The gender disparity in technology related fields is well known and well documented. Only 18% of computer science undergraduates and 26% of computer science professionals are women. Despite numerous interventions in the past decade, there is still not gender parity in the undergraduate pipeline. However, 43% of post-baccalaureate "coding bootcamp" participants were women in 2016, indicating that this population may have different characteristics, attitudes, and mindsets than younger women and girls. In this project, the authors have investigated these changes in gender role perceptions that create barriers for girls but are seemingly resolved for some adult women. We hypothesize that older women come to view their own abilities as well as the impact of failure differently than girls and younger women. By recruiting a subject pool of women who have entered the computer science profession through traditional baccalaureate as well as non-traditional bootcamp pathways and posing reflective as well as current questions in semi-structured interviews we assess the changes in attitudes regarding the subjects' self-efficacy and mindset with respect to technical work. From these findings, we hope to identify triggers and possible interventions.
