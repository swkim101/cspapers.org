Scheduling on related machines (Q||Cmax) is one of the most important problems in the field of Algorithmic Mechanism Design. Each machine is controlled by a selffish agent and her valuation can be expressed via a single parameter, her speed. Archer and Tardos [4] showed that, in contrast to other similar problems, a (non-polynomial) allocation that minimizes the makespan can be truthfully implemented. On the other hand, if we leave out the game-theoretic issues, the complexity of the problem has been completely settled --- the problem is strongly NP-hard, while there exists a PTAS [9, 8].
 This problem is the most well-studied in single-parameter Algorithmic Mechanism Design. It gives an excellent ground to explore the boundary between truthfulness and efficient computation. Since the work of Archer and Tardos, quite a lot of deterministic and randomized mechanisms have been suggested. Recently, a breakthrough result [7] showed that a randomized, truthful-in-expectation PTAS exists. On the other hand, for the deterministic case, the best known approximation factor is 2.8 [10, 11].
 It has been a major open question whether there exists a deterministic truthful PTAS, or whether truthfulness has an essential, negative impact on the computational complexity of the problem. In this paper we give a deffinitive answer to this important question by providing a truthful deterministic PTAS.
