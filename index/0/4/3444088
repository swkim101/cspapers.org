A "plan diagram" is a pictorial enumeration of the execution plan choices of a database query optimizer over the relational selectivity space. In this paper, we present and analyze representative plan diagrams on a suite of popular commercial query optimizers for queries based on the TPC-H benchmark. These diagrams, which often appear similar to cubist paintings, provide a variety of interesting insights, including that current optimizers make extremely fine-grained plan choices, which may often be supplanted by less efficient options without substantively affecting the quality; that the plan optimality regions may have highly intricate patterns and irregular boundaries, indicating strongly non-linear cost models; that non-monotonic cost behavior exists where increasing result cardinalities decrease the estimated cost; and, that the basic assumptions underlying the research literature on parametric query optimization often do not hold in practice.
