Online social streams such as Twitter timelines, forum discussions and email threads have emerged as important channels for information propagation. Mining transient stories and their correlations implicit in social streams is a challenging task, since these streams are noisy and surge quickly. In this paper, we propose CAST, which is a context-aware story-teller that discovers new stories from social streams and tracks their structural context on the fly to build a vein of stories. More precisely, we model the social stream as a capillary network, and define stories by a new cohesive subgraph type called (k,d)-Core in the capillary network. We propose deterministic and randomized context search to support the iceberg query, which builds the story vein as social streams flow. We perform detailed experimental study on real Twitter streams and the results demonstrate the creativity and value of our approach.
