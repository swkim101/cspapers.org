"STiNG" is a Cache Coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access (CC-NUMA) Multiprocessor designed and built by Sequent Computer Systems, Inc. It combines four processor Symmetric Multi-processor (SMP) nodes (called Quads), using a Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) based coherent interconnect. The Quads are based on the Intel P6 processor and the external bus it defines. In addition to 4 P6 processors, each Quad may contain up to 4 GBytes of system memory, 2 Peripheral Component Interface (PCI) busses for I/O, and a Lynx board. The Lynx board provides the datapath to the SCI-based interconnect and ensures system-wide cache coherency. STiNG is one of the first commercial CC-NUMA systems to be built. This paper describes the motivation for building STiNG as well as its architecture and implementation. In addition, performance analysis is provided for On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Decision Support System (DSS) workloads. Finally, the status of the current implementation is reviewed.
