The 3sum problem represents a class of problems conjectured to require (n 2) time to solve, where n is the size of the input. Given two polygons P and Q in the plane, we show that some variants of the decision problem, whether there exists a transformation of P that makes it contained in Q, are 3sum-hard. In the rst variant P and Q are any simple polygons and the allowed transformations are translations only; in the second and third variants both polygons are convex and we allow either rotations only or any rigid motion. We also show that nding the translation in the plane that minimizes the Hausdorr distance between two segment sets is 3sum-hard.
