Linear chains and trees are basic building blocks in many applications of graphical models, and they admit simple exact maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference algorithms based on message passing. However, in many cases this computation is prohibitively expensive, due to quadratic dependence on variables' domain sizes. The standard algorithms are inefficient because they compute scores for hypotheses for which there is strong negative local evidence. For this reason there has been significant previous interest in beam search and its variants; however, these methods provide only approximate results. This paper presents new exact inference algorithms based on the combination of column generation and pre-computed bounds on terms of the model's scoring function. While we do not improve worst-case performance, our method substantially speeds real-world, typical-case inference in chains and trees. Experiments show our method to be twice as fast as exact Viterbi for Wall Street Journal part-of-speech tagging and over thirteen times faster for a joint part-of-speed and named-entity-recognition task. Our algorithm is also extendable to new techniques for approximate inference, to faster 0/1 loss oracles, and new opportunities for connections between inference and learning. We encourage further exploration of high-level reasoning about the optimization problem implicit in dynamic programs.
