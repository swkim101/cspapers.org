The primary goal of the Cognitive Walkthrough (CW) is to make a formal user interface evaluation method accessible to individuals who are directly involved in the design process of a new system, but do not necessarily have expertise in UI issues. As such the CW needs to be easy to understand and apply. It was originally developed to evaluate the usability of 'walk-up-and-use' interfaces, such as ATM's (Lewis, Polson, Wharton, and Rieman, 1990, and Polson, Lewis, Rieman, and Wharton, in press). The CW was used to evaluate the user interface of an existing support system for sales representatives (REPS), which is a fairly complex system that provides access to various databases and a limited editing capability. Its interface consists of a multitude of different screens, each only used for a few basic functions. Therefore this evaluation of REPS with the help of the Cognitive Walkthrough was seen as a reasonable test of the breadth of the Cognitive Walkthrough's applicability. The poster describes the effectiveness of the method and the effort needed to use it.
