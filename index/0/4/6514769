In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of implicit information flow (IIF) on the Android bytecode is presented to identify all potential IIF forms, determine their exploitability, and mitigate the potential threat. By applying control-transfer-oriented semantic analysis of the bytecode language, we identify five IIF forms, some of which are not studied by existing IIF literature. We develop proof-of-concepts (PoCs) for each IIF form to demonstrate their exploitability. The experimental results show that all these PoCs can effectively and efficiently transmit sensitive data, as well as successfully evade the detection of a state-of-the-art privacy monitor TaintDroid. To mitigate the threat of IIF, we propose a solution to defending against IIF leveraging a special control dependence tracking technique and implement a prototype system. The evaluation shows that the prototype can effectively detect information leak by all the identified IIF forms and also real-world malware with an acceptable overhead. In summary, our study gives in-depth insight into Android IIF from both offensive and defensive perspectives, and provides a foundation for further research on Android IIF.
