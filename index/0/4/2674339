This paper describes the development of the support torque reduction mechanism for a biped locomotor with leg mechanisms using Stewart platforms, designed for heavy payload and low power consumption during walking. The basic design of this mechanism was decided through preliminary experiments. Each leg of the robot is equipped with this mechanism consisting of 2 gas springs with different reaction forces, which are switched according to the swing/support phase. The experiment measuring motor current during walking with payload and the walking experiment with maximum payload confirmed the effectiveness of this mechanism.
