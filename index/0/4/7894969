We see teaching cybersecurity through hands-on, interactive exercises as a way to engage students. Some of the exercises that we have seen require significant preparation on the part of the instructor. Having a community makes it easier to share exercises, knowing what works and what problems students and instructors have encountered. The purpose of this BOF is to bring together instructors who have used hands-on exercises and those who would like to. We recognize that few CS programs can afford new required courses, so we would be discussing ways to integrate security-related exercises into existing ones. This could include networking, OS, computer architecture, programming languages, software engineering and algorithms.
 Recent hiring forecasts indicate that there is a tremendous need for skilled information security experts. This was evident at the last National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) conference at NIST, and from sponsors of the Collegiate Cybersecurity CCDC. Security will be one of the core areas in the ACM/IEEE COMPUTER SCIENCE 2013 Curricula.
 We think that it is particularly important to share stories from the classroom (what worked and what didn't), discuss ethical hacking, and discuss how to teach analytical skills. We also plan to discuss our own experiences, practices and ongoing efforts (e.g., our teaching experiences, the SISMAT program, Security Injections, EDURange and the dissemination of infosec interactive exercises). SISMAT includes a two-week summer intensive program based on the "Hacker Curriculum" and a combination of research and internship in cyberbersecurity for undergraduates.
