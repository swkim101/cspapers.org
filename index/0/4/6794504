My paper presents a new method of design of a System On Programmable Chip (SOPC), testing its performances, makes accessible the implementation of an image processing program coded with OpenCV library on the Altera Cyclone III platform. The main idea consists on making a hardware implementation of the designed SOPC on the NEEK platform. We make also the implementation of a uClinux Operating System on the Nios II processor based SOPC to facilitate the implementation of our proposed image processing chain on an Altera reconfigurable platform.
