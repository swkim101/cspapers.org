Bipedal walking with humanoid robots requires efficient real-time control. Nowadays, most bipedal robots require to ensure local stability at every instant in time, preventing them from achieving the impressive human walking skills. At the same time, bio-inspired walking controllers are emerging, though they are still mostly explored in simulation studies. However, porting these controllers to real hardware is needed to validate their use on real robots, as well as adapting them to face the world non-idealities. Here, we implemented one of them on a real humanoid robot, namely the COMAN, by conducting dynamic walking experiments. More precisely, we used a muscle-reflex model producing efficient and humanlike gaits. Starting from an off-line optimization performed in simulation, we present the controller implementation, focussing on the additional steps required to port it to real hardware. In our experimental results, we highlight some discrepancies between simulation and reality, together with possible controller extensions to fix them. Despite these differences, the real robot still managed to perform dynamic walking. On top of that, its gait exhibited stretched legs and foot roll at some points of the gait, two human walking features hard to achieve with most robot gaits. We present this on a 50 steps walk where the robot was free to move in the sagittal plane while lateral balance was provided by a human operator.
