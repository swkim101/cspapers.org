I examine how discourse anaphoric uses of the definite pronoun it contrast with similar uses of the demonstrative pronoun that. Their distinct contexts of use are characterized in terms of two contextual features---persistence of grammatical subject and persistence of grammatical form---which together demonstrate very clearly the interrelation among lexical choice, grammatical choices and the dimension of time in signalling the dynamic attentional state of a discourse.
