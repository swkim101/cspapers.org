In this paper, we provide a simple recursive programming language with a semantics and a formal proof system, along the lines of [5], [17] and [23]. We show that the semantics used is the “best” possible if one admits the validity of Algol's copy rule, and that the proof system is complete with respect to the semantics. The definitions and methods used are meant to provide a basis for a broader theory of program schemas, which models parallel as well as sequential programs.
