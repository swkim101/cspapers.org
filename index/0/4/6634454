The REpresentational State Transfer (REST) architectural style describes the design principles that made the World Wide Web scalable and the same principles can be applied in enterprise context to do loosely coupled and scalable application integration. In recent years, RESTful services are gaining traction in the industry and are commonly used as a simpler alternative to SOAP Web Services. However, one of the main drawbacks of RESTful services is the lack of standard mechanisms to support advanced quality-of-service requirements that are common to enterprises. Transaction processing is one of the essential features of enterprise information systems and several transaction models have been proposed in the past years to fulfill the gap of transaction processing in RESTful services. The goal of this paper is to analyze the state-of-the-art RESTful transaction models and identify the current challenges.
