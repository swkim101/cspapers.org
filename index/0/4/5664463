This paper proposes a new way to achieve robotic tasks by visual servoing. Instead of using geometric features (points, straight lines, pose, homography, etc.) as it is usually done, we use directly the luminance of all pixels in the image. Since most of the classical control laws fail in this case, we turn the visual servoing problem into an optimization problem leading to a new control law. Experimental results validate the proposed approach and show its robustness regarding to approximated depths, non Lambertian objects and partial occlusions.
