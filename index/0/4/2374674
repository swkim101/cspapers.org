In this paper the authors propose geometric techniques to deal with the problem of grasping of the objects relaying on their mathematical models. For that we use the geometric algebra framework to formulate the kinematics of a three linger robotic hand. Our main objective is by formulating a kinematic control law to close the loop between perception and actions. This allows us to perform a smooth visually guided object grasping.
