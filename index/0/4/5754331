Most previous Web-page summarization methods treat a Web page as plain text. However, such methods fail to uncover the full knowledge associated with a Web page needed in building a high-quality summary, because many of these methods do not consider the hidden relationships in the Web. Uncovering the hidden knowledge is important in building good Web-page summarizers. In this paper, we extract the extra knowledge from the clickthrough data of a Web search engine to improve Web-page summarization. Wefirst analyze the feasibility in utilizing the clickthrough data to enhance Web-page summarization and then propose two adapted summarization methods that take advantage of the relationships discovered from the clickthrough data. For those pages that are not covered by the clickthrough data, we design a thematic lexicon approach to generate implicit knowledge for them. Our methods are evaluated on a dataset consisting of manually annotated pages as well as a large dataset that is crawled from the Open Directory Project website. The experimental results indicate that significant improvements can be achieved through our proposed summarizer as compared to the summarizers that do not use the clickthrough data.
