Two critical factors affecting the utility of a VLSI processor array are 1) the versatility of the array, and 2) the size problem due to I/O constraints. In this paper we present a feedback systolic array system for matrix computations which, in addition to being able to produce high throughput, has improved utility. The array system can solve many matrix problems containing arbitrarily large matrices. It can also process sparse matrices efficiently by skipping blocks of zeros.
