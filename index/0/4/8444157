We consider the following scheduling problem. We are given a set of jobs Ji, Jz, . . . , J,, where each job Ji has a processing time pi and a weight wi. Jobs have precedence constraints between them that are specified in the form of a directed acyclic graph. If i 4 j, Ji has to scheduled before Jj. The objective is to find a nonpreemptive schedule of the jobs on a single machine (or equivalently an ordering), to minimize Cj WjCj, where Cj is the completion time of Jj in the schedule. The problem is NP-hard if we permit arbitrary precedence constraints on the jobs. It is in polynomial time for some special cases such as trees and series parallel graphs. Scheduling problems with the objective of minimizing Cj WjCj have been studied extensively in operations research. Computer science applications include profile driven instruction scheduling in VLIW and super-scalar compilers [2]. Constant factor algorithms for several basic variants were obtained recently [7], including a 2 approximation for the problem we consider. Most of these algorithms use linear programming relaxations. In this paper, we give an efiicient combinatorial 2 approximation algorithm for the single machine problem which matches the best ratio achieved in [fl. The advantage of our algorithm is twofold. First, the algorithms in [7] are based on solving linear programming relaxations while ours is based on solving minimum cuts, and hence is more efficient. Second, combining our algorithm with the conversion algorithm in [3], we get eflicient combinatorial algorithms for several single and parallel machine variants in a unified way. Margot, Queyranne, and Wang [8] have independently obtained the same algorithm that we present in this paper. A full version [l] of our paper has been submitted for publication. In a recent paper, Chudak and Hochbaum [4] show a half integral linear programming relaxation for the
