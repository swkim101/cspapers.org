In this paper, we developed a novel dynamic mobile platform capable of transforming between four wheel rapid driving mode with ZMP stabilization and two wheel balancing mode. Usually, the four wheel mobile platforms have low acceleration due to the high center of mass. Using the feed-forward ZMP stabilization method, we achieved high acceleration performance with maintaining stable ZMP. We use a LQR controller for two wheel balancing mode. In the two wheel balancing mode, there are two different driving modes, self-balancing mode, human-riding mode. The transformation between four wheel and two wheel mode is made possible by swing up and swing down control method. We prove the dynamic performance of mobile platform by experimental results.
