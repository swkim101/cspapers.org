Software localization is an important process for international acceptance of software products. However, software development and localization does not always come together without friction. In our empirical software engineering research, we examine the interplay of software development and software localization by gathering and analyzing qualitative and quantitative data from professionals in relevant roles. Our aim is to co-validate issues and inform practice about the development of international software.
