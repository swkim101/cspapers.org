This article will describe the SIGCSE 2001 Maze Demo program that may be used as a CS2 laboratory exercise on traversal algorithms. The article will also describe the object-oriented design of the program and the Java Power Tools that were used to enable rapid development of its graphical user interface. Finally, the quality of the program and the speed of its development shows that it is now practical to teach freshmen using full graphical user interfaces rather than interfaces that use the console or a small restricted set of interface widgets.
