The Earth Observing One spacecraft has been under the control of AI software for several years - experimentally since 2003 and since November 2004 as the primary operations system. This software includes: model-based planning and scheduling, procedural execution, and event detection software learned by support vector machine (SVM) techniques. This software has enabled a 100x increase in the mission science return per data downlinked and a >$1M/year reduction in operations costs. In this paper we discuss the AI software used, the impact of the software, and lessons learned with implications for future AI research.
