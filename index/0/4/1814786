We present an algorithm for extracting a disjunctive decomposition from the BDD representation of F. The output of the algorithm is a multiple-level netlist exposing the hierarchical decomposition structure of the function. The algorithm has theoretical quadratic complexity in the size of the input BDD. Experimentally, we were able to decompose most synthesis benchmarks in less than one second of CPU time, and to report on the decomposability of several complex ISCAS combinational benchmarks. We found the final netlist to be often close to the output of more complex dedicated optimization tools.
