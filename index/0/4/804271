We present our ongoing work on data quality problems in sensor networks. Specifically, we deal with the problems of outliers, missing information, and noise. We propose an approach for modeling and online learning of spatio-temporal correlations in sensor net-works. We utilize the learned correlations to discover outliers and recover missing information. We also propose a Bayesian approach for reducing the effect of noise on sensor data online.
