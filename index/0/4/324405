Humans are often able to communicate effectively to solve a joint task, even when they do not speak much of a common language, for instance, when buying a train ticket in a foreign country. Although the conversation might not be fully fluent and error-free, the communication does not break down; instead, through clarifications, confirmations and inferences, the dialog can proceed towards solving the common task. Key to this is the ability to note an error (or miscommunication), assess it, and address it. We believe that these principles of human dialog repair can be used to enhance the conversational abilities of task oriented interactive systems, allowing them to interact more smoothly with human users (Perlis, Purang, & Andersen 1998). To this end, we are developing an agent that can act as an interface between the user and a task-oriented system, providing a bed for dialog correction and repair. Our agent, ALFRED (Active Logic for Reason Enhanced Dialog) is built on a time-tracking, logical framework called active logic (Elgot-Drapkin et al 1993; Elgot-Drapkin & Perlis 1990). Active logic works by combining inference rules with a constantly evolving measure of time (a "Now") that can itself be referenced in those rules. As an example, from Now(t)-the time is now "t"-one infers Now(t+l). Special rules governing the persistence of formulas in the database, including rules for disinheriting direct contradictions, along with a quotation mechanism which allows formulas to refer to one another, give active logic the expressive and inferential power to monitor its own reasoning, allowing it to watch for errors (such as mismatches between conveyed and intended meanings), note temporal conversational cues such as pauses that may signal a turn change, and to exert reasoned control over its past and upcoming inferential processes, including reexamination and alteration of beliefs and inferences.
