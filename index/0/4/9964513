A humanoid robot "H6" is developed as a platform for the research on perception-action coupling in intelligent behaviour of humanoid type robots. The H6 has the features as follows: 1) a body which has enough DOFs and each joint has enough torque for full body motion, 2) a PC/AT compatible on-board computer which is controlled by RT-linux so that low-level to high-level control is achieved simultaneously, 3) is self-contained and connected to a network via radio ethernet, 4) a 3D vision function can be applied. The H6 is expected to be a common test-bed for experiment and discussion for various aspects of intelligent humanoid robotics.
