We present a novel method for approximate inference in Bayesian models and regularized risk functionals. It is based on the propagation of mean and variance derived from the Laplace approximation of conditional probabilities in factorizing distributions, much akin to Minka's Expectation Propagation. In the jointly normal case, it coincides with the latter and belief propagation, whereas in the general case, it provides an optimization strategy containing Support Vector chunking, the Bayes Committee Machine, and Gaussian Process chunking as special cases.
