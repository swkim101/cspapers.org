We introduce the concept of randomized sparsification of a weighted, undirected graph. Randomized sparsification yields a sparse unweighted graph which closely approximates the minimum cut structure of the original graph. As a consequence, we show that a cut of weight within a (1 + 6) multiplicative factor of the minimum cut in a graph can be found in O(m + n(log3 n)/e*) time; thus any constant factor approximation can be achieved in d(m) time. Similarly, we show that a cut within a multiplicative factor of (Y of the minimum can be found in RNC using m + n21a processors. We also investigate a parametric version of our randomized sparsification approach. Using it, we show that for a graph undergoing a series of edge insertions and deletions, an O(dm)-approximation to the minimum cut value can be maintained at a cost of o(n6+1/2) time per insertion or deletion. If only insertions are allowed, the approximation can be maintained at a cost of O(ne) time per insertion.
