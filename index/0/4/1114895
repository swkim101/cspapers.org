This research project investigates the vulnerabilities of civilian Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) systems and how they can be exploited by law enforcement should a UAV be utilized in a terrorist attack against the United States. Research into the vulnerabilities of civilian UAVs focused primarily on how such systems could be compromised and taken over by a third party, and for law enforcement to exploit as a potential countermeasure. In particular, the focus of the research was on using Internet Protocol (IP) Address and Media Access Control Address spoofing to spoof the UAV controller. Multiple techniques of spoofing attacks were conducted to compromise the UAV systems and allow for precision control from a third party computer. Additional research was conducted into intercepting an autonomous UAV via spoofing. This paper identifies the threats that UAVs pose to the United States, while providing a reliable and safe way to counter certain hostile UAV threat scenarios.
