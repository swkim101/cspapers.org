Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) presents special challenges in terms of how image data is indexed, accessed, and how end systems are evaluated. This paper discusses the design of a CBIR system that uses global colour as the primary indexing key, and a user centered evaluation of the systems visual search tools. The results indicate that users are able to make use of a range of visual search tools, and that different tools are used at different points in the search process. The results also show that the provision of a structured navigation and browsing tool can support image retrieval, particularly in situations in which the user does not have a target image in mind. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the design of visual search tools, and their implications for the use of user-centered evaluation for CBIR systems.
