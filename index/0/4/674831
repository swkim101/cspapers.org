Re-finding what we have accessed before is a common behavior in real life. Psychological studies show that context under which information was accessed can serve as a powerful cue for information recall. "Finding the sweet recipe that I read at the hotel on the trip to Africa last year" is a context-based re-finding request example. Inspired by users' recall characteristics and human memory, we present a context memory model, where each context unit links to the data created/accessed before. Context units are organized in a clustering and associative manner, and evolve dynamically in life cycles. Based on the context memory, we build a recall-by-context query model. Two methods are devised to evaluate context-based recall queries. Our experiments with synthetic and real data show that evaluation exploring the use of context associations can get the best response time.
