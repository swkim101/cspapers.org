We present a novel approach to estimate the dimension m of an unknown manifold M ⊂ Rd with positive reach from a set of point samples P ⊂ M. It works by analyzing the shape of simplices formed by point samples. Suppose that P is drawn from M according to a Poisson process with an unknown parameter λ. Let k be some fixed positive integer. When λ is large enough, we prove that the dimension can be correctly output in O(kd|P|1+1/k) time with probability greater than 1-2-k. We experimented with a practical variant and showed that its performance is competitive with several previous methods.
