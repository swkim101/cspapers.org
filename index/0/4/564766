A pattern is supposed to capture best practice in some domain. Pedagogical patterns try to capture expert knowledge of the practice of teaching. This paper contains a number of patterns that have been used and refined over many years of teaching by the author and others. The intent is to capture the essence of the practice in a compact form that can be easily communicated to those who need the knowledge. Presenting this information in a coherent and accessible form can mean the difference between every new instructor needing to relearn what is known by senior faculty and easy transference of knowledge of teaching within the community. Many of the ideas here are very common knowledge to skilled instructors, but are captured here because they lead to pattern languages.
