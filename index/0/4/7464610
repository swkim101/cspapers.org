This paper investigates the design and implementation of a finger-like robotic structure capable of reproducing human hand gestural movements performed by a multi-fingered, hand-like structure. In this work, we present a pneumatic circuit and a closed-loop controller for a finger-like soft pneumatic actuator. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the pneumatic and control systems of the soft pneumatic actuator, and its ability to track human movement trajectories with affective content.
