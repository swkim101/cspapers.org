We introduce a new framework for designing fixed-parameter algorithms with subexponential running time---2<sup><i>O</i>(√<i>k</i>)</sup><i>n</i><sup><i>O</i>(1)</sup>. Our results apply to a broad family of graph problems, called <i>bidimensional problems</i>, which includes many domination and covering problems such as vertex cover, feedback vertex set, minimum maximal matching, dominating set, edge dominating set, clique-transversal set, and many others restricted to bounded-genus graphs. Furthermore, it is fairly straightforward to prove that a problem is bidimensional. In particular, our framework includes as special cases all previously known problems to have such subexponential algorithms. Previously, these algorithms applied to planar graphs, single-crossing-minor-free graphs, and map graphs; we extend these results to apply to bounded-genus graphs as well. In a parallel development of combinatorial results, we establish an upper bound on the treewidth (or branchwidth) of a bounded-genus graph that excludes some planar graph <i>H</i> as a minor. This bound depends linearly on the size |<i>V</i> (<i>H</i>)| of the excluded graph <i>H</i> and the genus <i>g</i>(<i>G</i>) of the graph <i>G</i>, and applies and extends the graphminors work of Robertson & Seymour.Building on these results, we develop subexponential fixedparameter algorithms for dominating set, vertex cover, and set cover in any class of graphs excluding a fixed graph <i>H</i> as a minor. In particular, this general category of graphs includes planar graphs, bounded-genus graphs, single-crossing-minor-free graphs, and any class of graphs that is closed under taking minors. Specifically, the running time is 2<sup><i>O</i>(√<i>k</i>)</sup><i>n</i><sup><i>h</i></sup>, where <i>h</i> is a constant depending only on <i>H</i>, which is polynomial for <i>k</i> = <i>O</i>(log<sup>2</sup><i>n</i>). We introduce a general approach for developing algorithms on <i>H</i>-minor-free graphs, based on structural results about <i>H</i>-minor-free graphs at the heart of Robertson & Seymour's graph-minors work. We believe this approach opens the way to further development for problems on <i>H</i>-minor-free graphs.
