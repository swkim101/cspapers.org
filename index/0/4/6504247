Horn clauses provide a useful framework for writing executable structural representations for digital circuits. This paper discusses how these representations can be used to diagnose faulty circuits using algorithmic program debugging techniques developed by Shapiro. The sound theoretical basis of these techniques is one of the major advantages of this approach. This framework also provides a new perspective on some of the hardware diagnosis techniques suggested in the literature.
