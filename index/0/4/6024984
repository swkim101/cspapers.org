The structural properties of optic flow fields are used to develop constraints on the motion of image features over time. For several restricted cases of motion, these constraints greatly simplify the determination of inter-frame motion and the inference of environmental information. These structural properties are briefly reviewed. Procedures are presented for computing, and making environmental inferences from, optic flow produced when camera motion is known, translational, or restricted to a plane. Some applications are discussed.
