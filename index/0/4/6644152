We designed an algorithm to build a speed-call list adaptively based on mobile phone call logs. Call logs provide the time-dependent calling patterns of mobile phone users, and therefore a speed-call list based on them will be more successful in recommending a desired number than a speed-call list based on recent calls only. This paper presents the design process of our algorithm for an adaptive speed-call list, its verification result with recorded call logs, and in-situ evaluation results of the algorithm using an Experience Sampling Method (ESM) system.
