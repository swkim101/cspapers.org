This paper describes the holistic phase model of the `4 Robotic Revolutions' - disruptive waves of evolution in robotics and automation - and their impact on society, economy and other areas of human life over the next 50 years. Furthermore, an explanation is provided, why a new Generation `R' of Robotic Natives will grow up in daily contact with automation technology perceiving technology as valuable enrichments for their lives. The paper closes with an outlook into reasons why humankind has to ignite a holistic discourse about the responsible application of these disruptive technologies in order to shape a sustainable future enhanced (and not threatened) by robotics and automation. In consequence, the need for self-regulation in the sense of Technology and Robotic Governance will arise.
