Questions which involve 'all', 'every', 'some', or the indefinite article, pose some p e c u l i a r problems when p r e s e n t e d to a c o m p u t e r i z e d q u e s t i o n-a n s w e r i n g system where ambiguities cannot be tolerated. These problems vary from the nature of the correct answer in special cases to the very a d m i s s i b i l i t y of the question itself. To deal with these problems it is convenient to divide questions into two c l a s s e s-e x t e n s i o n a l questions whose answers are to name things or truth values, i n t e n s i o n a l questions whose answers are to give meanings. This paper examines e x t e n s i o n a l questions. For these, the i n t e r p r e t a t i v e problems arising with 'all' and 'every' can be solved by i n t r o d u c i n g a new kind of quantifi-cation, e x t e n s i o n a l universal quantifica-tion, that has the meaning of 'all F' together with a secondary meaning that the class F is not empty. Formal rules for this q u a n t i f i c a t i o n are given, and it is shown that the s o-c a l l e d definite formulas (which explicate permissible queries) are closed under the new operator. Our purpose in this paper is to examine the role of q u a n t i f i c a t i o n in computerized question a n s w e r i n g systems. For illustrative purposes, let us consider our system to have a data base consisting of b i b l i o g r a p h i c and related information on p u b l i c a t i o n s and their authors.+ This has the advantage of p r o v i d i n g concrete examples for the t h e o â€¦
