This paper presents PhotoSlap, an intelligent system for semantic annotation of photos. The system contains a semi-automatic face detector, a bulk annotation tool, and a multi-player online game, PhotoSlap. By exploring the design principles of gameplay and applying game theoretic analysis, PhotoSlap is designed as a fun and productive game, which adapts itself to different players to produce the desired output. Experiments involving four focus groups showed the game to be fun and effective in annotating people metadata for personal photo collections.
