Like many other application areas, task-based domains that employ digital imagery are faced with the problem of information overload. Modeling the relationship between images and the tasks being performed is an important step in addressing this problem. We have developed an interactive approach for the capture and reuse of image context information that leverages a measure of a user's intentions with regard to tasks that they address. We analyze aspects of human-computer interaction information that enables us to infer why image contents are important in a particular context and how specific images have been used to address particular domain goals.
