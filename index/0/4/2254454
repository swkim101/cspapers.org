Interactive spoken dialog provides many new challenges for spoken language systems. One of the most critical is the prevalence of speech repairs. This paper presents an algorithm that detects and corrects speech repairs based on finding the repair pattern. The repair pattern is built by finding word matches and word replacements, and identifying fragments and editing terms. Rather than using a set of prebuilt templates, we build the pattern on the fly. In a the fair test, our method, when combined with a statistical model to filter possible repairs, was successful at detecting and correcting 80% of the repairs, without using prosodic information or a parser.
