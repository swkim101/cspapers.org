Growing competition has made today's banks understand the value of knowing their customers better. In this paper, we describe a tool, LIPTUS, that associates the customer interactions (emails and transcribed phone calls) with customer and account profiles stored in an existing data warehouse. The associations discovered by LIPTUS enable analytics spanning the customer and account profiles on one hand and the meta-data associated or derived from the interaction (using text mining techniques) on the other. We illustrate the value derived from this consolidated analysis through specific customer intelligence applications. LIPTUS is today being extensively used in a large bank in India. A highlight of this paper is a discussion of the technical challenges encountered while building LIPTUS and deploying it on real-life customer data.
