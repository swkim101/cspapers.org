This work addresses conceptual modeling and automatic code generation for Rich Internet Applications, a variant of Web-based systems bridging the gap between desktop and Web interfaces. The approach we propose is a first step towards a full integration of RIA paradigms into the Web development process, enabling the specification of complex Web solutions mixing HTTP+HTML and Rich Internet Applications, using a single modeling language and tool.
