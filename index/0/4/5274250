Introduction: We describe here an approach to integrating multilevel security with object-oriented database management systems (DBMSs) based on the SODA (Secure Object-oriented DAtabase) security model [4]. We concern ourselves here with multilevel security (MLS) policy which is characterized by a partially ordered set (SC, 2). where SC is a set of classifications with partial ordering, 5. For 11 and 12 in SC, if 11 < 12, we say I2 dominates 11. The active subjects in the system are assigned elements of SC indicating their perceived trustworthiness. We refer to this as the classification level of the subject. Information can flow from a subject with classification level 11 to a subject with classification level 12 if 11 I 12.
