In this paper we discuss the structured multimedia documents that will be, or already are, to some degree the communication backbone of the so-called superhighways. It will be shown that storage and retrieval of such documents will best be handled by an integration of database and information retrieval technologies. We assume documents to be structured with the help of standards like SGML/HyTime and represented by the multitude of formats currently used for multimedia data.
Starting with an approach based on object-oriented database technology we extend both their functionality on the cost models for query evaluation on one side with multimedia features and on the other with logic-based models of information retrieval to truly combine structure and content information about the documents in question.
