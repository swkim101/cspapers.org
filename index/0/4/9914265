This paper deals with the way temporal connectives affect Temporal Structure as well as Discourse Structure in Narratives. It presents a contrastive study of French connectives puis (then, afterwards) and un peu plus tard (a bit later) within the framework of Segmented Discourse Representation Theory. It shows that puis is a marker of the Narration discourse relation, whereas un peu plus tard blocks Narration and licenses only a weaker discourse relation, that can be considered as a "weak Narration" involving only temporal succession. In addition, puis blocks Result, while un peu plus tard does not.
