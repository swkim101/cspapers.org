This poster presents latency and reliability characterization of wireless sensor network as applied to an advanced building control system for demand response energy pricing. A test network provided the infrastructure to extract round trip time and packet failure data. Latency was below the predicted 75 milliseconds per hop. Packet failure rates increased with network depth and in some locations exceeded 75 percent failure rates. Both latency and packet failure rates exhibited non-linear changes within the network. Lastly, the impacts of latency and reliability characteristics to control-specific parameters are presented.
