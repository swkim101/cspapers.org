Microscale robots offer an unprecedented opportunity to perform tasks at resolutions approaching 1 Î¼m, but the great majority of research to this point focuses on actuation and control. Potential applications for microrobots can be considerably expanded by integrating sensing, signal processing and feedback into the system. In this work, we demonstrate that technologies from the field of synthetic biology may be directly integrated into microrobotic systems to create cell-based programmable mobile sensors, with signal processors and memory units. Specifically, we integrate genetically engineered, ultraviolet light-sensing bacteria with magnetic microrobots, creating the first controllable biological microrobot that is capable of exploring, recording and reporting on the state of the microscale environment. We demonstrate two proof-of-concept prototypes: (a) an integrated microrobot platform that is able to sense biochemical signals, and (b) a microrobot platform that is able to deploy biosensor payloads to monitor biochemical signals, both in a biological environment. These results have important implications for integrated micro-bio-robotic systems for applications in biological engineering and research.
