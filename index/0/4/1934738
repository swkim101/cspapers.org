Let 立 be a disk of radius <i>R</i> in the plane. A set <i>F</i> of closed unit disks contained in 立 forms a maximal packing if the unit disks are pairwise disjoint and the set is maximal: i.e., it is not possible to add another disk to <i>F</i> while maintaining the packing property. A point <i>p</i> is hidden within the "forest" defined by <i>F</i> if any ray with apex <i>p</i> intersects some disk of <i>F:</i> that is, a person standing at <i>p</i> can hide without being seen from outside the forest. We show that if the radius <i>R</i> of 立 is large enough, one can find a hidden point for any maximal packing of unit disks in 立. This proves a conjecture of Joseph Mitchell. We also present an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>5/2</sup> log <i>n</i>)-time algorithm that, given a forest with <i>n</i> (not necessarily congruent) disks, computes the boundary illumination map of all disks in the forest.
