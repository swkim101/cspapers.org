Traditionally user interfaces to databases have either assumed complete knowledge of the conceptual schema of the database or they have relied on the utilization of predefined views to restrict the universe of discourse for end users or application programmers. This paper introduces an interface mechanism to dynamically derive personalized views and consequently a dynamic learning facility for the utilization of a database. The principles are based on ideas developed for the dynamic creation of universal views in multi-database environments.
