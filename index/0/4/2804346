In this paper, we present work-in-progress of a recently started research effort that aims at understanding the hidden temporal dynamics in online food communities. In this context, we have mined and analyzed temporal patterns in terms of recipe production and consumption in a large German community platform. As our preliminary results reveal, there are indeed a range of hidden temporal patterns in terms of food preferences and in particular in consumption and production. We believe that this kind of research can be important for future work in personalized Web-based information access and in particular recommender systems.
