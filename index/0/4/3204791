This paper describes a design methodology for an object oriented database, based on a semantic network. This approach is based on the assumption that Yemantic data models are more powerful and more easy to use than current proposed object oriented data models. They are especially more poweful in representing integrity constraints and various relationships, Object oriented data models are generally based only on class hierarchies and inheritance, plus their ability to represent the behavior of objects, But this latter capability is generally provided through an algorithmic language which cannot be considered as a conceptual language. This paper describes a design procedure which generates an object oriented database schema (both the structural aspect and the dynamic aspect) from an abstract specification giveri in a high level language. This specification language is built upon a semantic network and allows to define integrity constraints and behavior rules. This approach is presented through a CASE tool environment.
