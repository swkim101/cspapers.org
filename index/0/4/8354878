This paper discusses the effectiveness of several dependence tests in Perfect Benchmarks. The tests analyzed include the generalized greatest common divisor test, Banerjee's test and the Omega test. Two methods are applied. One uses only compile-time information for the analysis. The other uses information gathered during program execution. It is shown that, for the codes considered, the Omega test improved the accuracy of the analysis by only 1% when codes are analyzed statically. Furthermore, the dynamic analysis shows that the Omega test does not improve the detected inherent parallelism.
