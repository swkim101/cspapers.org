The main problems of existing methods are: (1) The degree of re-sampling, a key factor greatly affecting performance, needs to be pre-fixed, which is difficult to make the optimal choice; (2) Many useful negative samples are discarded in under-sampling; (3) The effectiveness of algorithm-level methods are limited because they just use the original training data for single classifier. To address the above issues, a novel approach of adaptive sampling with optimal cost is proposed for class-imbalance learning in this paper. The novelty of the proposed approach mainly lies in: adaptively over-sampling the minority positive examples and under-sampling the majority negative examples, forming different sub-classifiers by different subsets of training data with the best cost ratio adaptively chosen, and combining these sub-classifiers according to their accuracy to create a strong classifier. It aims to make full use of the whole training data and improve the performance of class-imbalance learning classifier. The solid experiments are conducted to compare the performance between the proposed approach and 12 state-of-the-art methods on challenging 16 UCI data sets on 3 evaluation metrics, and the results show the proposed approach can achieve superior performance in class-imbalance learning.
