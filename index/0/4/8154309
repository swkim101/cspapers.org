We report the development of an artificial haircell (AHC) fabricated using two methods: (1) silicon bulk micromachining and (2) polymer surface micromachining. Both methods leverage efficient three dimensional assembly of microstructures. The AHC is modeled after biological hair cells, a common and versatile mechanoreceptor in biology. The design, fabrication process, along with testing results are discussed in the paper.
