Fast Fourier Transform in the West(FFTW) is one of the most successful adaptive Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT) libraries. The high-performance of FFTW mostly derives from its empirical search engine that includes all major DFT algorithms. We propose an adaptive model-driven FT performance prediction technique to replace the empirical search engine in FFTW. Our model achieves over 94% of the DFT performance and uses less than 5% of the search time compared with FFTW Exhaustive search on four test platforms.
