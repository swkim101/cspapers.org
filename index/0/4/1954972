In this paper we propose an approximated structured prediction framework for large scale graphical models and derive message-passing algorithms for learning their parameters efficiently. We first relate CRFs and structured SVMs and show that in CRFs a variant of the log-partition function, known as the soft-max, smoothly approximates the hinge loss function of structured SVMs. We then propose an intuitive approximation for the structured prediction problem, using duality, based on a local entropy approximation and derive an efficient message-passing algorithm that is guaranteed to converge. Unlike existing approaches, this allows us to learn efficiently graphical models with cycles and very large number of parameters.
