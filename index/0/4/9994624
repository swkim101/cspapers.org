understanding of the nature of interactions Melissa Lee Price Staffordshire University PO Box 660 College Road Stoke on Trent ST4 2XN UK +44 1782 295 727 mlprice@attglobal.net Andy Lapham London College of Music and Media Thames Valley University London W5 5DX UK +44 20 8231 2262 andy.lapham@tvu.ac.uk ABSTRACT This study examines student interactions on an asynchronous classroom bulletin board. The quantity of student postings was a part of the individual studentâ€™s assessment process with no assessment as to the quality of the post. The interactions were viewed as either on task or off task with further descriptions as to the nature of the discussion. Results show that students were on task 83.72% of the time. There is further evidence that students contribute to the discussion by posting URLs for illustrative purposes. These postings were examined and found in 62% of the time not to spawn further discussion.
