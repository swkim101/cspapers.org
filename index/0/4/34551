A system of parallel processes is said to be <underline>synchronous</underline> if all processes run using the same clock, and it is <underline>asynchronous</underline> if each process has its own independent clock. For any s, n, a particular distributed problem is defined involving system behavior at n “ports”. This problem can be solved in time s by a synchronous system but requires time at least (s-1) log n on any asynchronous system.
