In the data stream environment, the patterns generated by the mining techniques are usually distinct at different time because of the evolution of data. In order to deal with various types of multiple data streams and to support flexible mining requirements, we devise in this paper a clustering on demand framework, abbreviated as COD framework, to dynamically cluster multiple data streams. While providing a general framework of clustering on multiple data streams, the COD framework has two major features, namely one data scan for online statistics collection and compact multiresolution approximations, which are designed to address, respectively, the time and the space constraints in a data stream environment. Furthermore, with the multiresolution approximations of data streams, flexible clustering demands can be supported.
