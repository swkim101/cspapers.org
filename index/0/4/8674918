In a modern conference room, various of video and audio devices are provided to ensure efficient communications. This is commonly referred to as a conferencing system. Compared to wired conferencing systems, wireless systems require less deployment effort, but may become unreliable when the selected radio spectrum is highly occupied. This demo focuses on improving the quality of service of a commercial wireless conferencing system using dynamic channel selection based on real-time spectrum sensing. The proposed solution is verified in a large-scale wireless testbed, and the result shows that the link of the conferencing system is indeed more robust against interference when cognitive solution is applied.
