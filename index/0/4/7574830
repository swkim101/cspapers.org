We establish hardness versus randomness trade-offs for a broad class of randomized procedures. In particular, we create efficient nondeterministic simulations of bounded round Arthur-Merlin games using a language in exponential time that cannot be decided by polynomial size oracle circuits with access to satisfiability. We show that every language with a bounded round Arthur-Merlin game has subexponential size membership proofs for infinitely many input lengths unless the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses. This provides the first strong evidence that graph nonisomorphism has subexponential size proofs. We set up a general framework for derandomization which encompasses more than the traditional model of randomized computation. For a randomized procedure to fit within this framework, we only require that for any fixed input the complexity of checking whether the procedure succeeds on a given random bit sequence is not too high. We then apply our derandomization technique to four fundamental complexity theoretic constructions: The Valiant-Vazirani random hashing technique which prunes the number of satisfying assignments of a Boolean formula to one, and related procedures like computing satisfying assignments to Boolean formulas non-adaptively given access to an oracle for satisfiability. The algorithm of Bshouty et al. for learning Boolean circuits. Constructing matrices with high rigidity. Constructing polynomial-size universal traversal sequences. We also show that if linear space requires exponential size circuits, then space bounded randomized computations can be simulated deterministically with only a constant factor overhead in space.
