The experimental translational hovering control of a Tri-TiltRotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle is the subject of this paper. This novel UAV is developed to possess the capability to perform autonomous conversion between the Vertical Take-Off and Landing, and the Fixed-Wing flight modes. Via this design's implemented features however, the capability for additional control authority on the UAV's longitudinal translational motion arises: The rotor-tilting servos are utilized in performing thrust vectoring of the main rotors, thus exploiting their fast response characteristics in directly providing translation-controlling forces. The system's hovering translation is handled by a Model Predictive Control scheme, following the aforementioned actuation principles. While performing experimental studies of the overall controlled system's efficiency, the advantageous effects of this novel control authority are clearly noted. Additionally, in this article the considerations and requirements for operational autonomy-related on-board-only state estimation are addressed.
