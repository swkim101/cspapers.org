This special session will report on the work of the ACM K-12 Computer Science Curriculum Committee, which recently completed the design of a K-12 model curriculum [1]. This session is a follow-up to our special session at SIGCSE 2003, which presented the first draft of that curriculum design. This session differs from that one by emphasizing the next steps that must be taken to implement the recommendations in the model.
