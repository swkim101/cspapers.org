Conventional natural language interfaces suffer from several ease-of-use problems. They require a user to type and to formulate questions in a way that the system can understand. They have high failure rates which often frustrate users, and users often do not use features of the systems because they are unaware of them or don't trust them. In addition, conventional natural language systems are expensive to build and require large amounts of storage to use. This paper describes a new approach to natural language interfaces called menu-based natural language understanding. This new approach solves the problems listed above. The paper compares the menu-based natural language approach to conventional natural language interfaces and to other forms of interface and discusses the advantages and limitations of this new approach.
