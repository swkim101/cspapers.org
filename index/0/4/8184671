We axiomatize a notion of “classic structure” on a regular category, isolating the essential properties of the category of classes together with its full subcategory of sets. Like the axioms for a topos, our axiomatization is very simple, but has powerful consequences. In particular, we show that our axiomatized categories provide a sound and complete class of models for Intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set
