This study presents an analysis of science application workloads for the Jaguar Cray XT5 system during its tenure as a 2.3 petaflop supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Jaguar was the first petascale system to be deployed for open science and has been one of the world's top three supercomputers for six releases of the TOP500 list. Its workload is investigated here as a representative of the growing worldwide install base of petascale systems and also as a foreshadowing of science workloads to be expected for future systems. The study considers characteristics of the Jaguar workload such as resource utilization, typical job characteristics, most heavily used applications, application scaling and application usage patterns. Implications of these findings are considered for current petascale workflows and for exascale systems to be deployed later this decade.
