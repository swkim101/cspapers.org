UI on the Fly is a system that dynamically presents coordinated multimodal content through natural language and a small-screen graphical user interface. It adapts to the user's preferences and situation. Multimodal Functional Unification Grammar (MUG) is a unification-based formalism that uses rules to generate content that is coordinated across several communication modes. Faithful variants are scored with a heuristic function.
