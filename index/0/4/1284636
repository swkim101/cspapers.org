This paper addresses the problem of controlling mobile sensing systems to improve the accuracy and efficiency of gathering information autonomously. It applies to scenarios such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue, surveillance and reconnaissance, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A multi-sensor active information acquisition problem, capturing the common characteristics of these scenarios, is formulated. The goal is to design sensor control policies which minimize the entropy of the estimation task, conditioned on the future measurements. First, we provide a non-greedy centralized solution, which is computationally fast, since it exploits linearized sensing models, and memory efficient, since it exploits sparsity in the environment model. Next, we decentralize the control task to obtain linear complexity in the number of sensors and provide suboptimality guarantees. Finally, our algorithms are applied to the multi-robot active SLAM problem to enable a decentralized nonmyopic solution that exploits sparsity in the planning process.
