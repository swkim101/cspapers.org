Managers of large software projects with system test groups face a problem that they may not be aware of. Vague notions among project members about the role of system testing tend to cloud the relationship between developers and testers with misunderstanding and disappointment. The main source of the problem is unrealistic expectations about what can be accomplished during the system test phase of the project. This has the effect of de-emphasizing the developers' responsibility for software quality and imposing a definition of success on system testers that is not possible to achieve.
This paper describes a series of role awareness seminars at which a discussion technique was used to clarify expectations between developers and testers. Transcending the discussion of roles was a fundamental message: the quality of software is determined during the development phase and cannot be radically improved during the system test phase.
