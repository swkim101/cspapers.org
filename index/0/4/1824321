Vast volumes of online information related to news stories, blogs and online social media have an observable effect on investor's opinions towards financial markets. But do these particular information reflect or impact people's decision-making in investment? This paper investigates whether data generated from Internet usage can be used to predict the movements in the financial market. We provide evidence that data on how often a company's Wikipedia page is being viewed is linked to its subsequent performance in the stock market. We then develop a portfolio in line with the Wikipedia usages and demonstrate that our investment strategy based on Wikipedia views is profitable both financially and statistically. Our finding implies that online web data such as Wikipedia presents an alternative insights on collecting and quantifying investor's sentiments towards financial markets, which can be further employed as a timely approximation of investor's behaviours in decision-making.
