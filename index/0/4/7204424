Most proposals for quantum neural networks have skipped over the problem of how to train the networks. The mechanics of quantum computing are different enough from classical computing that the issue of training should be treated in detail. We propose a simple quantum neural network and a training method for it. It can be shown that this algorithm works in quantum systems. Results on several real-world data sets show that this algorithm can train the proposed quantum neural networks, and that it has some advantages over classical learning algorithms.
