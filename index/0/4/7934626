Lecturers, presenters and meeting participants often say what they publicly handwrite. In this paper, we report on three empirical explorations of such multimodal redundancy -- during whiteboard presentations, during a spontaneous brainstorming meeting, and during the informal annotation and discussion of photographs. We show that redundantly presented words, compared to other words used during a presentation or meeting, tend to be topic specific and thus are likely to be out-of-vocabulary. We also show that they have significantly higher tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) weights than other words, which we argue supports the hypothesis that they are dialogue-critical words. We frame the import of these empirical findings by describing SHACER, our recently introduced Speech and HAndwriting reCognizER, which can combine information from instances of redundant handwriting and speech to dynamically learn new vocabulary.
