The hierarchical nature of existing Web directories, ontologies, and folksonomies, are known to provide meaningful information that guide users and applications. We hypothesize that such hierarchical structures provide richer information if they are further enriched by incorporating additional links besides parents, and siblings, namely, between non-sibling nodes. We call such structure a networked hierarchy. Our empirical results indicate that such a networked hierarchy introduces interesting links between nodes (non-sibling) that otherwise in a hierarchical structure are not evident.
