YouTube uploaders are the central agents in the YouTube phenomenon. We conduct extensive measurement and analysis of YouTube uploaders. We estimate YouTube scale and examine the uploading behavior of YouTube users. We demonstrate the positive reinforcement between on-line social behavior and uploading behavior. Furthermore, we examine whether YouTube users are truly broadcasting themselves, via characterizing and classifying videos as either user generated or user copied.
