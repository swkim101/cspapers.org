Robotic Sensor Networks (RSNs) find increasing use in environmental monitoring as RSNs can collect data from obscure, hard-to-reach places over long periods of time. This work reports progress in building a network of small, light-weight robotic rafts which will be used to monitor common carp tagged with radio transmitters across Minnesota lakes. We describe the design and architecture of the robotic raft, and demonstrate the robustness of our waypoint navigation algorithm through field tests conducted in various lakes. We also present results from experiments aimed towards localizing tagged fish.
