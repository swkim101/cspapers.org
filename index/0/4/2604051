We present an algorithm for collision-free navigation of multiple flying robots in three-dimensional workspace. Our approach extends the model of a simple car to a simple-airplane, which has constraints on speed and steering angle and includes a configuration variable for the altitude. We use a locally optimal reciprocal collision avoidance scheme that computes the trajectory without any collisions or oscillations for each airplane independently. In addition, our algorithm explicitly considers the kinematic and dynamic constraints of a simple-airplane and uses the notion of variable reciprocity when choosing velocities to ensure that simple-airplanes that are less constrained take more responsibility for avoiding collisions. We test our approach in two simulations and compute collision-free and oscillation-free trajectories that satisfy the kinematic and dynamic constraints of each simple-airplane.
