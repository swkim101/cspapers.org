Submitty is an open source programming assignment submission system from the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software (RCOS) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) accessed via an online interface. Submitty allows students to submit their code through file upload or version control, such as an internal Git/SVN server or Github, where it is then tested with a highly configurable and customizable automated grader. For each assignment, instructors can specify whether or not students can work in teams. For team assignments, the instructor can either assign teammates or allow the students to choose. In addition to the auto-grading for submissions, Submitty supports human grading. The human graded rubric is developed by the graders as they work, allowing reuse of common feedback messages and partial credit points. The rubric can be searched and modified during and after grading is complete for consistency. By default, grading is handled by instructors and TAs who are assigned to sections of students, which can be rotated through the semester. However, an instructor can choose to incorporate peer grading, which will allow students to anonymously view and submit grades for each other, receiving multiple peer grades per assignment. Submitty has been used at RPI for several years for a variety of courses, serving over 1500 students and 50 instructors and TAs each semester, and has recently been used by several other universities. We will present "case studies" of assignment configurations for autograding and manual grading and demonstrate the grading interface in support of team submissions and peer grading.
