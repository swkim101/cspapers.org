We developed methods and implemented a system prototype to help people find specific signboards in areas with densely located signboards. In addition, we examined whether the proposed methods would reduce the search time of a specific signboard. The result showed that the proposed method was superior in cases where there were multiple signboards to be searched and background saturation was low.
