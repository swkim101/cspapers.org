Software reuse is a simple idea: reduce the cost of software development by developing less new software. In practice, however, achieving software reuse on a large scale has been frustratingly difficult. Nevertheless, as the complexity and cost of software systems continues to rise, there has been growing interest in really trying to make large-scale reuse a reality. Interest in reuse has been particularly. strong in both the Ada and objectoriented programming communities. This panel brings together key experts from these communities to discuss the issues, problems and potentials of reuse. This discussion is continued from the first meeting of this panel at the Tenth Washington Ada Symposium last June.
