In work on globally-scheduled real-time multiprocessor systems, analysis is lacking for supporting real-time applications developed using general processing graph models. In this paper, it is shown that bounded deadline tardiness can be ensured for such applications on a multiprocessor with no utilization loss. This result is general: it is applicable to periodic, sporadic, and rate-based directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) models and allows sophisticated notions of precedence to be supported (particularly, notions allowed by the processing graph method). This paper is the first to show that bounded tardiness can be ensured for globally-scheduled DAG-based applications without utilization loss.
