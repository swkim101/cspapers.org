Recently, many NLP tasks have benefited from distributed word representation. However, it remains unknown whether embedding models are really immune to the typological diversity of languages, despite the language-independent architecture. Here we investigate three representative models on a large set of language samples by mapping dense embedding to sparse linguistic property space. Experiment results reveal the language universal and specific properties encoded in various word representation. Additionally, strong evidence supports the utility of word form, especially for inflectional languages.
