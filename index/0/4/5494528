Entropy-based approaches for anomaly detection are appealing since they provide more fine-grained insights than traditional traffic volume analysis. While previous work has demonstrated the benefits of entropy-based anomaly detection, there has been little effort to comprehensively understand the detection power of using entropy-based analysis of multiple traffic distributions in conjunction with each other. We consider two classes of distributions: flow-header features (IP addresses, ports, and flow-sizes), and behavioral features (degree distributions measuring the number of distinct destination/source IPs that each host communicates with). We observe that the timeseries of entropy values of the address and port distributions are strongly correlated with each other and provide very similar anomaly detection capabilities. The behavioral and flow size distributions are less correlated and detect incidents that do not show up as anomalies in the port and address distributions. Further analysis using synthetically generated anomalies also suggests that the port and address distributions have limited utility in detecting scan and bandwidth flood anomalies. Based on our analysis, we discuss important implications for entropy-based anomaly detection.
