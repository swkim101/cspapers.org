In this paper we show, how semantic nets when interpreted as so-called conceptual schemata can be successfully made to serve as common denominator to two as yet disparate areas of artificial Intelligence and real-life data management: Knowledge Representation and Data Base design. 
 
First, we describe the requirements to Semantic Nets in the context of production data bases. Next we describe the automated mapping between the Semantic Net and (possibly several) DBMSs. 
 
Further we show how this formal and machine accessible mapping allows to execute formally structured English Queries, and formulate expert rules in a data base context. Implementation status and research directions for these ideas are given resp. suggested.
