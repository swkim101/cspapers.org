Driven by increasing cost of energy and by the inclusion of re-newable but time variant sources of energy on the production side, and by new requirements from electromobility, building and home automation on the consumption side, the energy grid has moved in the focus of research, industry and infrastructure development. One of the key challenges is the interaction of the numerous em-bedded systems controlling energy producing and consuming devices using an "internet of energy".
 This session will provide different views on this development towards a smart energy grid. The first talk given by a leading pro-vider of energy grid equipment will give an overview on the new developments and challenges in modeling and simulating local grid behavior. The second talk discusses building energy management at the interface between home automation and the smart grid, both from the application and the embedded platform perspective. The third talk addresses home automation which serves many objectives, besides being a terminal network of the smart grind. Last not least, the fourth talk presents new development in wireless sensor devices as an important component of future home and energy networks.
