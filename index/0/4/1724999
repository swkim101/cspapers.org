This paper presents an approach for enhancing analog circuit sizing using Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). The circuit sizing problem is encoded using nonlinear constraints. An SMT-based algorithm exhaustively explores the design space, where the biasing-level design variables are conservatively tracked using a collection of hyperrectangles. The device dimensions are then determined by accurately relating biasing to geometry-level design parameters. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methodology on a two-stage amplifier and a folded cascode amplifier. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve higher quality in analog synthesis and unrivaled coverage of the design space.
