Transaction log analysis represents a powerful methodology which allows examination of both user commands and system responses when conducting an online information search. Machine-readable transaction log tapes from online catalogs are obtained and subsequently analyzed using stochastic pattern developments within parsed user sessions, mathematical models utilizing Markov chain analysis and the development of state transition probability matrices, which illustrate the probability of proceeding from one user or system state to another state. The objective of monitoring information systems and using transaction log analysis is to discover the extent to which systems are used and to determine the actual user patterns when conducting an information search. This in turn can aid in the evaluation of such systems and assist in the improvement of existing and future systems. Such analysis can assist in system design, while the predictive power of the methodology may allow real-time aids to be developed.As examples of the use of the methodology, patron use and system response patterns from several online public catalogs have been obtained by transaction log tapes. This paper presents an overview of the methodology, results obtained, and efforts that are being conducted within OCLC's Office of Research.
