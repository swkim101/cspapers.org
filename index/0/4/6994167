With the reduced noise margin brought by relentless technology scaling, power integrity assurance has become more challenging than ever. On the other hand, traditional design methodologies typically focus on a single design layer without much cross-layer interaction, potentially introducing unnecessary guard-band and wasting significant design resources. Both issues imperatively call for a cross-layer framework for the co-exploration of power delivery (PD) and system architecture, especially at early design stage with larger design freedom. Unfortunately, such a framework does not exist yet in the literature. As a step forward, this paper provides a run-time simulation framework of both PD and architecture and captures their interactions. Enabled by the proposed recursive run-time PD model, it handles an entire PD system on-the-fly simulation with <;1% deviation from SPICE. Moreover, with a seamless interaction among architecture, power and PD simulators, it has the capability to simulate benchmarks with millions of cycles within reasonable time. A support vector regression (SVR) model is employed to further speed up power estimation of functional units to millions cycle/second with good accuracy. The experimental results of running PARSEC suite have illustrated the framework's capability to explore hardware configurations to discover the co-effect of PD and architecture for early stage optimization. Moreover, it also illustrates multiple over-pessimisms in traditional methodologies.
