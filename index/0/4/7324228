We consider the approximability of maximization and minimization variants of the Morse matching problem, posed as open problems by Joswig and Pfetsch. We establish hardness results for Max-Morse matching and Min-Morse matching. In particular, we show that, for a simplicial complex with n simplices and dimension $d \leq 3$, it is NP-hard to approximate Min-Morse matching within a factor of $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$, for any $\epsilon > 0$. Moreover, using an L-reduction from Degree 3 Max-Acyclic Subgraph to Max-Morse matching, we show that it is both NP-hard and UGC-hard to approximate Max-Morse matching for simplicial complexes of dimension $d \leq 2$ within certain explicit constant factors.
