The integrated management of multimedia information, that is of complex information consisting of conventional data, text, graphics, images and voice, is of great interest not only in fields like information Retrieval, Office Automation, Computer Aided Instruction, Computer Aided Design, but also in other emerging fields such as Tourist Applications, Computer generated films, Newspapers and magazines production, and so on. In this paper the definition of multimedia object, partially derived from the ECMA standard “Office Document Architecture”, is given and an approach to multimedia information management is proposed. A multilevel environment, where multimedia information can be handled, stored and retrieved and the inner level of which consists of a general purpose Multimedia Data Base Management System (MDBMS), is described. They are outlined the main functionalities that languages which describe and manipulate multimedia objects should provide.
