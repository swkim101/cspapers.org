WordFreak is a natural language annotation tool that has been designed to be easy to extend to new domains and tasks. Specifically, a plug-in architecture has been developed which allows components to be added to WordFreak for customized visualization, annotation specification, and automatic annotation, without re-compilation. The APIs for these plug-ins provide mechanisms to allow automatic annotators or taggers to guide future annotation to supports active learning. At present WordFreak can be used to annotate a number of different types of annotation in English, Chinese, and Arabic including: constituent parse structure and dependent annotations, and ACE named-entity and coreference annotation. The Java source code for WordFreak is distributed under the Mozilla Public License 1.1 via SourceForge at: http://wordfreak.sourceforge.net. This site also provides screenshots, and a web deployable version of WordFreak.
