We present two tools to support the teaching of data structures and algorithms: Visualizers, which provide interactive visualizations of user-written data structures, and Testers, which check the functionality of user-written data structures. We outline a prototype implementation of visualizers and testers for data structures written in Java, and report on classroom use of testers and visualizers in an introductory Data Structures and Algorithms (CS2) course.
