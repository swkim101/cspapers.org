Fairness algorithms and access methods enable non-zero channel access for wireless communication systems operating in a random access channel environment. Fair access to a random access channel for each station in a wireless network is assured by each station calculating a priority or probability for accessing the channel based on logical connections among certain stations, based on other stations perception of the channel and based on each calculating station's own perception of the channel properties.
