Let S be a set of n pair-wise disjoint segments in W3, and let B be a ball of radius 1. The free configuration space 3 of B amid S is the set of all placements of B at which (the interior of) B does not intersect any segment of S. We show that the combinatorial complexity of 3 is O(n5/2+e), for any E > 0, with the constant of proportionality depending on E. This is the first subcubic bound on the complexity of the free configuration space even when S is a set of lines in R3. We also present a randomized algorithm that can compute the boundary of the free configuration space in O(n5/2+c) expected time.
