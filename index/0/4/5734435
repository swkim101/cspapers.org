In this paper, we will investigate a cross-linguistic phenomenon referred to as complex prepositions (CPs), which is a frequent type of multiword expressions (MWEs) in many languages. Based on empirical data, we will point out the problems of the traditional treatment of CPs as complex lexical categories, and, thus, propose an analysis using the formal paradigm of the HPSG in the tradition of (Pollard and Sag, 1994). Our objective is to provide an approach to CPs which (1) convincingly explains empirical data, (2) is consistent with the underlying formal framework and does not require any extensions or modifications of the existing description apparatus, (3) is computationally tractable.
