We prove that the computational complexity of the problem of deciding if an equation in a free group has a solution is PSPACE. The problem was proved decidable in 1982 by Makanin, w h o s e algorithm was proved later to be non primitive recursive: this was the best upper bound known for this problem. Our proof consists in reducing equations in free groups to equations in free semigroups with antiinvolution, and presenting an algorithm for deciding equations in free semigroups with antiinvolution.
