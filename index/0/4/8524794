LOGIC PROGRAMMING INTO A DATA BASE COURSE: RULES IN DEDUCTIVE RELATIONAL DATA BASES Dr. Yuksel UCKAN Department of Systems Analysis Miami University Oxford, This paper describes an approach adopted in introducing logic-based data base management and deductive data base systems into an undergraduate data base course, The fundamental concepts and terminology for deductive data base systems are briefly discussed. A conventional relational data base manage ment system (DBMS) has some intrinsic deductive capabilities. These capabilities can be exploited effectively by defining and implementing deductive axioms as views, A variety of deductive axioms including those with negated formulas and those corresponding to integrity constraints are implemented as SQL views. This approach provides students with an instructional tool based, on a conventional DBMS, and enables them to appreciate various as pects of deductive data base systems, as well as pros and cons of using a conventional DBMS as a deductive DBMS.
