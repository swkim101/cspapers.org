Heading information becomes widely used in ubiquitous computing applications for mobile devices. Digital magnetometers, also known as geomagnetic field sensors, provide absolute device headings relative to the earth's magnetic north. However, magnetometer readings are prone to significant errors in indoor environments due to the existence of magnetic interferences, such as from printers, walls, or metallic shelves. These errors adversely affect the performance and quality of user experience of the applications requiring device headings. In this paper, we propose Headio, a novel approach to provide reliable device headings in indoor environments. Headio achieves this by aggregating ceiling images of an indoor environment, and by using computer vision-based pattern detection techniques to provide directional references. To achieve zero-configured and energy-efficient heading sensing, Headio also utilizes multimodal sensing techniques to dynamically schedule sensing tasks. To fully evaluate the system, we implemented Headio on both Android and iOS mobile platforms, and performed comprehensive experiments in both small-scale controlled and large-scale public indoor environments. Evaluation results show that Headio constantly provides accurate heading detection performance in diverse situations, achieving better than 1 degree average heading accuracy, up to 33X improvement over existing techniques.
