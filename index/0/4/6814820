Wueless ATM aims at -tending ATM services to the wire 1= environment. In contrast to wirehne ATM, which is primarily based on refiable fiber optic, wirel= ATM will have to cope with an unreliable radio channel. ThB POS= a host of technical chdlengw related to the prov~loning of qurdity of service (QoS). Key imttw include incorporating the characteristics of the wirelm channel in the protiloning of cell-level QoS, and improving the perceived qurdity by using error control mechanisms. k this study, we propose a model for anrdyzing the cell IOS statistim due to btier overflow in a wireless ATM environment. This model incorporate the service disruption caused by the unreliable radio channel as well as the impact of error control schema, e.g., automatic repeat requwt (ARQ) and forward error correction (FEC) mechanisms. The main theme of this study is to invatigate the cdl loss behavior of a wireless ATM fink as a finction of the assigned bandwidth and error control schemw. Using fluid analysis, we pr=ent an approximate ar-ion for the cell loss rate (CLR). This ~r-ion is used to derive a closed-form ~ression for the wireless tiective bandwidth. It is *O used to investigate the optirnd FEC code rate that gttarante= a given CLR wtie m_lng the unitization of the wireless bandwidth. The Mldity of our andyticd re sttlts are tested by contrasting them to simulation r=ttlts. Our observations indicate that the proposed qrassion of CLR is quite accurate over a range of moderate bit error rat=.
