College Board is thrilled to announce the launch of a pilot program, Advanced PlacementÂ® (AP) with We.org Service, in a partnership with international charity and educational partner, Free the Children. AP Computer Science is among six AP courses that will participate in this pilot program. The College Board and Free The Children share a passion for enriching students' learning experiences and developing well-rounded citizens. The program combines the academic challenge and rigor of AP Computer Science with Free The Children's WE.org education and citizenship model. AP Computer Science with WE.org Service creates an opportunity for students to consider their classroom work and how it applies to the real world, while working closely with peers to address social issues.
