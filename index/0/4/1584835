WeMet (Window Environment Meeting Enhancement Tool), is a prototype pen-based meeting support tool which allows meeting participants in the same or different room to share a work-space for sketching and writing or for the presentation of images. In addition to facilitating real-time communication among participants. WeMet enables the review and selective retrieval of meeting information, during or after the meeting. This presentation describes the rationale for key functionality and interface decisions in the design of WeMet, and reports on the experiences of users with the prototype to date.
