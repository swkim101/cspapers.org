The large number of degrees of freedom in legged robots give rise to complicated dynamics equations. Analyzing these equations or using them for control can therefore be a difficult and non-intuitive task. A simplification of the complex multi-body dynamics can be achieved by instantaneously reducing it to an equivalent single inertial entity called the locked inertia or the composite rigid body inertia.
