Logicians frequently use axiom schemata to encode (potentially infinite) sets of sentences with particular syntactic form. In this paper we examine a first-order language in which it is possible to write expressions that both describe sentences and assert the truth of the sentences so described. The effect of adding such expressions to a knowledge base is the same as directly including the set of described sentences.
