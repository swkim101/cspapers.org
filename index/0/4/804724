We consider the problem of optimizing convex and concave functions with access to an erroneous zeroth-order oracle. In particular, for a given function x → f (x) we consider optimization when one is given access to absolute error oracles that return values in [f (x) - ∊, f (x) + ∊] or relative error oracles that return value in [(1 - ∊)f (x), (1 + ∊)f (x)], for some ∊ > 0. We show stark information theoretic impossibility results for minimizing convex functions and maximizing concave functions over polytopes in this model.
