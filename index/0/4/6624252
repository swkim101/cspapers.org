We introduce a new updatable representation of binary trees. The structure requires the information theoretic minimum 2<i>n</i> + <i>&Ogr;</i>(<i>n</i>) bits and supports basic navigational operations in constant time and subtree size in <i>&Ogr;</i>(lg <i>n</i>). In contrast to the linear update costs of previously proposed succinct representations, our representation supports updates in <i>&Ogr;</i>(lg<sup>2</sup> <i>n</i>) amortized time.
