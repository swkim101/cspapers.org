HSDMS (Highly Secure Data Management System) is a secure, on-line and multi-user experimental database management system developed on the Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP-10 computer system. It is a vehicle for testing new facilities and applications of data management and access control. Furthermore the development of HSDMS itself has been aimed at the outset as an exercise in software engineering management and control.
 In the first part of the paper, the software engineering techniques that were used in the management and control of the programming team and efforts are discussed. The discussion centers on the application of some of the known concepts such as the chief programmer team, structured programming and composite design to programming of the database management system.
 In the second part of the paper, system goals and capabilities are presented. The goals for HSDMS were to achieve data independence, efficient storage and access, effective user interface, and secure access control. The ability of HSDMS to meet the goals result from the utilization and integration of a number of design concepts and implementation approaches. For each system goal the concepts and approaches that have provided HSDMS with the capabilities to achieve the goal are shown.
 In the final part of the paper, we attempt to relate this single experience with HSDMS to its possible impact on software engineering of database management systems in general and to data secure systems in particular.
