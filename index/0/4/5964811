Application paradigms will increasingly exceed a mobile device's physical boundaries. This paper presents a system solution for a mobile device to mount remote sensors on other devices. Our design is generic to mobile senor stacks, thus supporting unmodified apps and commodity sensors. Furthermore, it uses an asynchronous access model to facilitate semantics passing and data reporting in between. Such semantic information allows the development of an energy-efficient reporting policy for remote sensing applications. The results of experiments conducted on commercial Android smartphones with popular apps demonstrate that our design is very efficient in terms of energy consumption and completion time.
