In this paper, we consider the problem of tracking a reference trajectory for a simplified car model based on unicycle kinematics, whose position only is measured, and where the control input and the measurements are corrupted by independent Gaussian noises. To tackle this problem we devise a novel observer-controller: the invariant Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller (ILQG). It is based on the Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller, but the equations are slightly modified to account for, and to exploit, the symmetries of the problem. The gain tuning exhibits a reduced dependency on the estimated trajectory, and is thus less sensitive to misestimates. Beyond the fact the invariant approach is sensible (there is no reason why the controller performance should depend on whether the reference trajectory is heading west or south), we show through simulations that the ILQG outperforms the conventional LQG controller in case of large noises or large initial uncertainties.
