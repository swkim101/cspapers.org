Thus the long-standing issue of how the semantic content of language should be represented is reentering the communal discussion. This paper provides a brief "opinionated survey" of broad-coverage semantic representation (SR). It suggests multiple desiderata for such representations, and then outlines more than a dozen approaches to SR â€” some long-standing, and some more recent, providing quick characterizations, pros, cons, and some comments on implementations.
