Repackaged Android applications (app clones) have been found in many third-party markets, which not only compromise the copyright of original authors, but also pose threats to security and privacy of mobile users. Both fine-grained and coarse-grained approaches have been proposed to detect app clones. However, fine-grained techniques employing complicated clone detection algorithms are difficult to scale to hundreds of thousands of apps, while coarse-grained techniques based on simple features are scalable but less accurate. This paper proposes WuKong, a two-phase detection approach that includes a coarse-grained detection phase to identify suspicious apps by comparing light-weight static semantic features, and a fine-grained phase to compare more detailed features for only those apps found in the first phase. To further improve the detection speed and accuracy, we also introduce an automated clustering-based preprocessing step to filter third-party libraries before conducting app clone detection. Experiments on more than 100,000 Android apps collected from five Android markets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.
