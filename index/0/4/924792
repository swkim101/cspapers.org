Integrated development environments (IDEs) are complex applications that integrate multiple tools for creating and manipulating software project artifacts. To improve users' knowledge and the effectiveness of usage of the available functionality, the inclusion of recommender systems into IDEs has been proposed. We present a novel IDE command recommendation algorithm that, by taking into account the contexts in which a developer works and in which different commands are usually executed, is able to provide relevant recommendations. We performed an empirical comparison of the proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art IDE command recommenders on a real-world data set. The algorithms were evaluated in terms of precision, recall, F1, k-tail, and with a new evaluation metric that is specifically measuring the usefulness of contextual recommendations. The experiments revealed that in terms of the contextual relevance and usefulness of recommendations the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms.
