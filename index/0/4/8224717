Location models built on social media have been shown to be an important step toward understanding places in queries. Current search technology focuses on predicting broad regions such as cities. Hyperlocal scenarios are important because of the increasing prevalence of smartphones and mobile search and recommendation. Users expect the system to recognize their location and provide information about their immediate surroundings. In this work we propose an algorithm for constructing hyperlocal models of places that are as small as half a city block. We show that Dynamic Location Models (DLMs) are computationally efficient, and provide better estimates of the language models of hyperlocal places than the standard method of segmenting the globe into approximately equal grid squares. We evaluate the models using a repository of 25 million geotagged public images from Flickr. We show that the indexes produced by DLMs have a larger vocabulary, and smaller average document length than their fixed grid counterparts, for indexes with an equivalent number of locations. This produces location models that are more robust to retrieval parameters, and more accurate in predicting locations in text.
