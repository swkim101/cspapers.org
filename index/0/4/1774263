We propose MobileQueue, a mobile queue-card management system that offers more freedom to customers by enabling image-based queue-card retrieving and service-information querying actions using mobile phones. MobileQueue interacts with cloud services allowing customers to query summary description and availability (e.g., available seats) of services provided by stores. MobileQueue also offers suggestions to waiting customers such as potentially interesting substitute activities and stores.
