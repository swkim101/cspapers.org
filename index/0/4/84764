Both phrases and Boolean queries have a long history in information retrieval, particularly in commercial systems. In previous work, Boolean queries have been used as a source of phrases for a statistical retrieval model, This work, like the majority of research on phrases, resulted in little improvement in retrieval effectiveness, In this paper, we describe an approach where phrases identified in natural language queries are used to build structured queries for a probabilistic retrieval model. Our results show that using phrases in this way can improve performance, and that phrases that are automatically extracted from a natural language query perform nearly as well as manually selected phrases.
