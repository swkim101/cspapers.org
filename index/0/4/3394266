Making sense of research literature is a complicated process that involves various information seeking and compre-hension tasks. The lack of support for sensemaking in existing systems presents important design challenges and opportunities. This research proposes the design of an integral environment to support literature search, selection, organization and comprehension. Our system prototype, CiteSense, offers lightweight interaction tools and a smooth transition among various information activities. This research deepens our understanding of the design of systems that support the sensemaking of research literature.
