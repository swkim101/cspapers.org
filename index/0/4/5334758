Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a new type of recommendation task that comes along with the prevalence of location-based social networks in recent years. Compared with traditional tasks, it focuses more on personalized, context-aware recommendation results to provide better user experience. To address this new challenge, we propose a Collaborative Filtering method based on Non-negative Tensor Factorization, a generalization of the Matrix Factorization approach that exploits a high-order tensor instead of traditional User-Location matrix to model multi-dimensional contextual information. The factorization of this tensor leads to a compact model of the data which is specially suitable for context-aware POI recommendations. In addition, we fuse users' social relations as regularization terms of the factorization to improve the recommendation accuracy. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
