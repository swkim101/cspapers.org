In this work, we address the problem of robust data association for feature cloud matching. For matching two feature clouds observed at two different poses, we discover that the covariance matrix of the measurement prediction error can be written as the sum of a low rank matrix and a block diagonal matrix, if we assume that the features are observed independently at each pose. This special structure of the covariance matrix allows us to compute its inverse analytically and efficiently. Together with a good bookkeeping strategy, the complexity of the Joint Compatibility (JC) test is reduced to O(1). Contrary to the approximated JC test, ours is both exact and fast. Based on the efficient JC test algorithm and a branch and bound search procedure, we devise an algorithm, called Fast Joint Compatibility Branch and Bound (FastJCBB), to quickly obtain robust data association. The FastJCBB algorithm is essentially modified from the conventional Joint Compatibility Branch and Bound (JCBB) algorithm and both of these algorithms are able to produce exactly the same data association results. However, with the substantial improvement in the efficiency of JC tests, our FastJCBB algorithm is much faster than the conventional JCBB, especially when matching two large feature clouds. It is reported that our FastJCBB algorithm is more than 740 times faster than the conventional JCBB in carrying out one million JC tests when matching two clouds with about 100 features each. Since both FastJCBB and JCBB share the same branch and bound procedure in exploring the interpretation tree, the search complexity remains exponential. Our main contribution is the significant improvement in the efficiency of exploring each node of the interpretation tree.
