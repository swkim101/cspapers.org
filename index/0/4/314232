In this paper, the design, modeling and experimental verification of a large workspace, parallel aerial manipulator is presented. The proposed manipulator has 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) and enables physical interaction on the sides, as well as below the aerial robot. The design parameters of the manipulator are chosen such that it achieves large and singularity-free workspace in combination with high dexterity. A Global Conditioning Index (GCI) is defined and used as a performance index for the manipulator over its complete workspace. Given the manipulator design parameters, a holistic model of the redundant aerial manipulation system is derived capturing the coupled dynamics of the aerial vehicle and the manipulator. Free flight experimental studies are utilized to validate the system, demonstrate its redundant DoFs, and evaluate its performance.
