Cinema viewed from a location other than a Canonical Viewing Point (CVP) presents distortions to the viewer in both its static and dynamic aspects. Past works have investigated mainly the static aspect of this problem and attempted to explain why viewers still seem to perceive the scene very well. The dynamic aspect of depth perception, which is known as structure from motion, and its possible distortion, have not been well investigated. In this paper, we derive the dynamic depth cues perceived by the viewer and use the so-called isodistortion framework to understand its distortion. The result is that viewers seated at a reasonably central position experience a shift in the intrinsic parameters of their visual systems. Despite this shift, the key properties of the perceived depths remain largely the same, being determined in the main by the accuracy to which extrinsic motion parameters can be recovered. For a viewer seated at a non-central position and watching the movie screen with a slant angle, the view is related to the view at the CVP by a homography, resulting in various aberrations such as non-central projection.
