This paper proposes an interactive logic synthesis system which supports translation from behavioral to gate level. A design's specification described in the register transfer language DDL is translated into abstract objects. They are converted to macros representing logical structure and serving as technology independent goals which guide designers in synthesis phases. The system has knowledge about the technology adopted and can accommodate various know-how and design constraints to support the designer's tasks of PCB partition and logic synthesis. As a result, it greatly relieves designers from tedious tasks and makes it possible to explore alternative designs.
