Current web search engines are retrospective in that they limit users to searches against already existing pages. Prospective search engines, on the other hand, allow users to upload queries that will be applied to newly discovered pages in the future. We study and compare algorithms for efficiently matching large numbers of simple keyword queries against a stream of newly discovered pages.
