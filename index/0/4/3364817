In this paper, we present the first automated system-level analysis of multicore CPUs based on ARMv8 64-bit architecture (8-core, 28nm X-Gene 2 micro-server by AppliedMicro) when pushed to operate in scaled voltage conditions. We report detailed system-level effects including SDCs, corrected/uncorrected errors and application/system crashes. Our study reveals large voltage margins (that can be harnessed for energy savings) and also large $V_{min}$ variation among the 8 cores of the CPU chip, among 3 different chips (a nominal rated and two sigma chips), and among different benchmarks.Apart from the $V_{min}$ analysis we propose a new composite metric (severity) that aggregates the behavior of cores when undervolted and can support system operation and design protection decisions. Our undervolting characterization findings are the first reported analysis for an enterprise class 64-bit ARMv8 platform and we highlight key differences with previous studies on x86 platforms. We utilize the results of the system characterization along with performance counters information to measure the accuracy of prediction models for the behavior of benchmarks running in particular cores. Finally, we discuss how the detailed characterization and the prediction results can be effectively used to support design and system software decisions to harness voltage margins for energy efficiency while preserving operation correctness. Our findings show that, on average, 19.4% energy saving can be achieved without compromising the performance, while with 25% performance reduction, the energy saving raises to 38.8%.CCS CONCEPTS• Hardware → Power and energy → Power estimation and optimization; • Hardware → Robustness → Hardware reliability → Process, voltage and temperature variations
