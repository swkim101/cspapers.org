Offline ephemeral social networks (OffESNs) are the networks created ad-hoc at a specific location for a specific purpose and lasting for short period of time, relying on mobile social media such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Bluetooth devices. The primary purpose of people in the OffESNs is to acquire and share information via attending prescheduled events. Event Recommendation over this kind of networks can facilitate attendees on selecting the prescheduled events and organizers on making resource planning. However, because of lack of users' preference and rating information, as well as explicit social relations, the existing recommendation methods can no longer work well to recommend the events in the OffESNs. To address the challenges such as how to derive latent preferences and social relations and how to fuse the latent information in a unified model, we first construct two heterogeneous interaction social networks, an event participation network and a physical proximity network. Then, we use them to derive users' latent preferences and latent networks on social relations, including like-minded peers, co-attendees and friends. Finally, we propose an LNF (Latent Networks Fusion) model under a pairwise factor graph to infer event attendance probabilities for recommendation. Experiments on an RFID-based real conference dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with typical solutions.
