For applications with consecutive incoming training examples, on-line learning has the potential to achieve a likelihood as high as off-line learning without scanning all available training examples and usually has a much smaller memory footprint. To train CRFson-line, this paper presents the Periodic Step size Adaptation (PSA) method to dynamically adjust the learning rates in stochastic gradient descent. We applied our method to three large scale text mining tasks. Experimental results show that PSA outperforms the best off-line algorithm, L-BFGS, by many hundred times, and outperforms the best on-line algorithm, SMD, by an order of magnitude in terms of the number of passes required to scan the training data set.
