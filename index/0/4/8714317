Classical control approaches to robot force control have been extensively addressed by research in the last decades and are now considered a paradigm when dealing with force control for industrial robots. With this respect, the present paper exploits the capability of state-of-the-art Quadratic Programming (QP) solvers to specify a simple and intuitive constraint-based optimization strategy aiming at improving closed-loop performance of a classical force controller, such as the implicit force control with pure integral action for a position-controlled manipulator in contact with a compliant environment. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is experimentally validated on an industrial robot equipped with a force sensor.
