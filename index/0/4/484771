The recently introduced Extended Architecture (XA) of large IBM computer systems includes, in the disk I/O area, the ability for an access to be resumed and completed on a path different from the one on which it has been initiated. The expected disk performance improvement due to this feature - known as Dynamic Path Reconnection - is investigated in this note.
 Two popular double pathing connection schemes are considered: switched substrings (as in IBM 3380 Dynamic Path Selection) and dual ported devices (as in Amdahl 6280 Dynamic Performance Pathing). A simple classical queueing system is used to model missed revolutions when transfer paths are found busy. The numerical results obtained indicate that, depending on load, a substantial reduction in the average I/O time can be expected with the Dynamic Path Reconnection feature. This reduction can top 30% under moderately heavy loads. The accuracy of the analytical model for missed reconnections has been checked using discrete-event simulation.
