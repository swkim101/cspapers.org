We introduce the concept of rule schema in this paper in order to support constraints in the active object-oriented paradigm. The rule schema provides the meta-knowledge associated with constraints analogous to the way a database schema provides metadata about the database objects. It is used to compile the constraints into clauses which are then \attached" to appropriate object attributes. The compiled constraints incorporate the semantics associated with inheritance over generalization hierarchies and references to simple objects which are constituents of complex objects. These clauses are evaluated and enforced whenever an attribute value is retrieved or updated. The update semantics for update propagation of object instances is embedded in the compiled constraints; constraints therefore play a role similar to methods in the model, but are speci ed explicitly rather than procedurally. They can therefore be managed by the active object-oriented database.
