The apparent motion reveals what in an image that human vision detects first. Chen's assumption that early stage vision can percept global topology is proved incorrect in theory and experiments. Based upon psychological studies on human vision, a new theory, the blurred matching, was introduced into visual computation which well fits the results of all experiments about apparent motion, Chen's included. An algorithm was constructed accordingly which predicts apparent motion by comparison of distances.
