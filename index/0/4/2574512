Execution of MPI applications on clusters and Grid deployments suffering from node and network failures motivates the use of fault tolerant MPI implementations. We present MPICH-V2 (the second protocol of MPICH-V project), an automatic fault tolerant MPI implementation using an innovative protocol that removes the most limiting factor of the pessimistic message logging approach: reliable logging of in transit messages. MPICH-V2 relies on uncoordinated checkpointing, sender based message logging and remote reliable logging of message logical clocks. This paper presents the architecture of MPICH-V2, its theoretical foundation and the performance of the implementation. We compare MPICH-V2 to MPICH-V1 and MPICH-P4 evaluating a) its point-to-point performance, b) the performance for the NAS benchmarks, c) the application performance when many faults occur during the execution. Experimental results demonstrate that MPICH-V2 provides performance close to MPICH-P4 for applications using large messages while reducing dramatically the number of reliable nodes compared to MPICH-V1.
