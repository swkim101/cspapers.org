Software to translate English text into American Sign Language (ASL) animation can improve information accessibility for the majority of deaf adults with limited English literacy. ASL natural language generation (NLG) is a special form of multimodal NLG that uses multiple linguistic output channels. ASL NLG technology has applications for the generation of gesture animation and other communication signals that are not easily encoded as text strings.
