When Part-of-Speech annotated data is scarce, e.g. for under-resourced languages, one can turn to cross-lingual transfer and crawled dictionaries to collect partially supervised data. We cast this problem in the framework of ambiguous learning and show how to learn an accurate history-based model. Experiments on ten languages show significant improvements over prior state of the art performance.
