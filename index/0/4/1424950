The ability to take information, entertainment and e-commerce on the go has great promise. However, the existing Web infrastructure and content were designed for desktop computers and are not well-suited for other types of accesses, e.g., devices that have less processing power and memory, small screens, and limited input facilities, or through wireless data networks with low bandwidth and high latency. Thus, there is a growing need for techniques that provide alternative means to access Web content and services, be it the ability to browse the Web through a wireless PDA or smart phone, or hands-free access through voice interfaces. In this paper, we discuss issues involved in making existing Web content and services available for diverse environments, and describe WebViews, a system that allows casual Web users to easily create customized views of Web sites that are well-suited for di erent types of terminals. In particular, we describe our approach to provide voice access to these Web views and experiences in building the system.
