We describe our efforts to create infrastructure to enable web interfaces for robotics. Such interfaces will enable researchers and users to remotely access robots through the internet as well as expand the types of robotic applications available to users with web-enabled devices. This paper centers on rosjs, a lightweight Javascript binding for ROS, Willow Garage's robot middleware framework. rosjs exposes many of the capabilities of ROS, allowing application developers to write controllers that are executed through a web browser. We discuss how rosjs extends ROS and briefly overview some of the features it provides. rosjs has been instrumental in the creation of remote laboratories featuring the iRobot Create and the PR2. These facilities will be available to the community as experimental resources. We describe the overall goals of this project as well as provide a brief description of how rosjs was used to help create web interfaces for these facilities.
