In this paper we propose the language of 'state specifications' to uniformly specify effect of actions, executability condition of actions, and dynamic and static constraints. This language allow? us to be able to express effects of action and constraints with same first order representation but different intuitive behavior to be specified differently. We then discuss how we can use state specifications to extend the action description languages A and Lo.
