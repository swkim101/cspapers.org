Partitioning by clustering of very large databases is a necessity to reduce the space/time complexity of retrieval operations. However, the contemporary and modern retrieval environments demand dynamic maintenance of clusters. A new cluster maintenance strategy is proposed and its similarity/stability characteristics, cost analysis, and retrieval behavior in comparison with unclustered and completely reclustered database environments have been examined by means of a series of experiments.
