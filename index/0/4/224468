The design of increasingly complex VLSI circuits and multilayer printed circuit boards have increased the demands on computer aided design methods including interactive graphics systems. Earlier minicomputer based systems with direct view storage tube displays lack the processing power and display characteristics that allow high degrees of interactivity and visual discrimination required for high productivity in complex design situations. Declining semiconductor RAM costs and increasing capabilities of microprocessors have allowed raster display technology to keep pace with the demands of current interactive graphics systems.
 The recently introduced Lexidata Graphics System 8000 combines state of the art color and black and white raster display technology with the latest microprocessor technology to provide a powerful element for the design of interactive graphics systems to meet today's greater needs. The GS8000 includes a very fast Schottky display processor to convert vectors to raster and fill areas and a 16 bit microprocessor to service interactive devices and process a world coordinate data base for editing and display. The system hardware off loads a significant processing and memory burden from the host computer allowing the use of a less powerful host or more users on a single host. An extensive software library resident in the Graphics System 8000 reduces the software development required of the user allowing him to concentrate on the applications software necessary for the creation, maintenance and non-graphic processing of his design data base on his host computer.
