We examine the problem of retrieving the top-<i>m</i> ranked items from a large collection, randomly distributed across an <i>n</i>-node system. In order to retrieve the top <i>m</i> overall, we must retrieve the top <i>m</i> from the subcollection stored on each node and merge the results. However, if we are willing to accept a small probability that one or more of the top-<i>m</i> items may be missed, it is possible to reduce computation time by retrieving only the top <i>k < m</i> from each node. In this paper, we demonstrate that this simple observation can be exploited in a realistic application to produce a substantial efficiency improvement without compromising the quality of the retrieved results. To support our claim, we present a statistical model that predicts the impact of the optimization. The paper is structured around a specific application~---~passage retrieval for question answering~---~but the primary results are more broadly applicable.
