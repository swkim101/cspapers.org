In this paper, a current control scheme for the brushless DC (BLDC) motor is proposed. In order to estimate the phase current, it employs the adaptive extended Kalman filter (EKF) and measurement of a single DC link current. When estimating the motor phase current, measurement of a single DC link current is scaled by PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) duty. If the PWM duty is very small, the sensitivity of the measurement noise is dramatically increased. In order to solve this problem adaptive EKF is applied. Therefore, estimated phase current using adaptive EKF prevents the possible occurrence of an unstable situation due to the sensitivity. The accuracy of the proposed current control scheme was confirmed by comparing the estimated current by adaptive EKF and the measured actual phase current. In additions, the effectiveness was verified through the current-control time response of the when the PWM duty for the control was close to zero. By using the proposed current control scheme, robust current control of the BLDC motor was possible with a single DC link current.
