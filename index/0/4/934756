Limiting consideration to algorithms satisfying various numerical stability requirements may change lower bounds for computational complexity and/or make lower bounds easier to prove. We will show that, under a sufficiently strong restriction upon numerical stability, any algorithm for multiplying two n×n matrices using only +, − and × requires at least n3 multiplications. We conclude with a survey of results concerning the numerical stability of several algorithms which have been considered by complexity theorists.
