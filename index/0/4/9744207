Our computer graphics (CG) programming class uses games development as a means to help students understand CG concepts. Many students mistakenly thought this CG class was a games programming class. We present a simple frame-work for discussing games programming classes. Based on the framework, the paper describes our efforts in integrating competencies associated with games programming into our CG programming class. Our results show that the resulting class maintains the integrity of the original CG class while allowing students to develop projects with more interesting games features.
