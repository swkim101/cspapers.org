In the paper, we present an approach to mining a directed social network from a message board on the Internet where vertices denote individuals and directed links denote the flow of influence. The influence is measured based on propagating terms among individuals via messages. The distance with respect to contextual similarity between individuals is acquired since the influence indicates the degree of their shared interest represented as terms.
