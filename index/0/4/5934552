The current debate regarding the data structure necessary to represent discourse structure, specifically whether tree-structure is sufficient to represent discourse structure or not, is mainly focused on written text. This paper reviews some of the major claims about the structure in discourse and proposes an investigation of discourse structure for simultaneous spoken Turkish by focusing on tree-violations and exploring ways to explain them away by non-structural means.
