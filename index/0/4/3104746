Abstract : Despite of the fact that large line segment datasets are becoming more and more popular, most of the analysis for estimating the selectivity of window queries posed on spatial data - the most important parameter for query optimization - has focused on point or region data only. In this paper we move one significant step forward in line segment datasets theoretical analysis. We discovered that real lines closely follow a distribution law, that we named the SLED law (Segment LEngth Distribution). The SLED law can be used for an accurate estimation of the selectivity of window queries. Experiments on a variety of real line segment datasets (hydrographic systems, road maps, railroads, utilities networks) show that our law holds and that our formula is extremely accurate, enjoying a maximum relative error of 4% in estimating the selectivity.
