Network coding (NC) is a recent new technique which promises to revolutionize the way data packets are transmitted over communication networks. Originally proposed for wired networks, it has been recently adapted to wireless networks to improve the throughput of broadcast and multicast traffic. In this paper, an NC-based scheme that can efficiently disseminate multimedia data over MANET is proposed. We have also developed a simulation framework for NC extensive simulations using the network simulator package NS-3. This simulation framework has been applied to analyzing the performance of the proposed scheme with two scalable multimedia source coding paradigms, layered coding (LC) and multi-description coding (MDC). Simulation results show improved performance of the proposed scheme over the original scheme, and suggest the combination of NC and MDC as a viable solution for better multimedia broadcast and multicast services in MANET.
