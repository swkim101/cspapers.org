User assistance is incorporated into some of today's interactive computing systems. The assistance is rarely consistent in its accuracy, availability, accessibility or style. In this paper we discuss general requirements for assistance systems and a characterization of different types of assistance which may be provided users. A technique for integrating the design of an assistance system with the design of an interactive computing system is described. The technique satisfies the expressed requirements and greatly facilitates the development of assistance systems. Finally, a brief discussion of techniques for evaluating the quality and effectiveness of an interactive assistance system is presented.
