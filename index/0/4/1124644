When the training instances of the target class are heavily outnumbered by non-target training instances, SVMs can be ineffective in determining the class boundary. To remedy this problem, we propose an adaptive conformal transformation (ACT) algorithm. ACT considers feature-space distance and the class-imbalance ratio when it performs conformal transformation on a kernel function. Experimental results on UCI and real-world datasets show ACT to be effective in improving class prediction accuracy
