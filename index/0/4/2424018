The comprehension of dialogue is an important concern for those interested in natural language processing for several reasons: dialogue gives particularly good access to human communication phenomena, it is less contrived than authored text, and human dialogue provides useful analogies for improving man-machine communication. In naturally occurring dialogues, the goals of the participants play a key role in structuring their language interactions. People know how dialogue is used to achieve goals, and they use this knowledge to comprehend what they hear.
