Platt's resource-allocation network (RAN) (Platt, 1991a, 1991b) is modified for a reinforcement-learning paradigm and to "restart" existing hidden units rather than adding new units. After restarting, units continue to learn via back-propagation. The resulting restart algorithm is tested in a Q-learning network that learns to solve an inverted pendulum problem. Solutions are found faster on average with the restart algorithm than without it.
