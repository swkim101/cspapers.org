This paper proposes an analytical inductance extraction model for characterizing min/max values of typical on-chip global intercon-nect structures, and a corresponding delay metric that can be used to provide RLC delay prediction from physical geometries. The model extraction and analysis is efficient enough to be used within optimization and physical design exploration loops. The analytical min/max inductance approximations also provide insight into the effects caused by inductances.
