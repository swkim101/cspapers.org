Users frequently formulate complex data analysis queries in order to identify interesting trends, make unusual patterns stand out, or verify hypotheses. They also issue complex data manipulation queries in order to generate tables to be used by data mining tools. Being able to express these queries succinctly and concisely is of major importance not only from the user’s, but also from the system’s point of view. Extended Multi-Feature query language (EMF SQL), an extension to SQL, has proven useful in the expression of these queries. The succinct representation of complex data manipulation queries leads to a simple and generic evaluation algorithm that is easy to analyze, optimize, scale and parallelize. The PanQuery tool (PanQ) is a product that utilizes EMF SQL to combine and aggregate information from several data sources. It implements efficient evaluation and optimization techniques developed specifically for EMF SQL, offering at least one to two orders of magnitude performance improvement in most cases compared to traditional commercial database systems.
