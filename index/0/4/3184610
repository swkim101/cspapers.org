Adaptive Resource-Centric Computing (ARCC) enables a simultaneous mix of high-throughput parallel, real-time, and interactive applications through automatic discovery of the correct mix of resource assignments necessary to achieve application requirements. This approach, embodied in the Tessellation manycore operating system, distributes resources to QoS domains called cells. Tessellation separates global decisions about the allocation of resources to cells from application-specific scheduling of resources within cells. We examine the implementation of ARCC in the Tessellation OS, highlight Tessellation's ability to provide predictable performance, and investigate the performance of Tessellation services within cells.
