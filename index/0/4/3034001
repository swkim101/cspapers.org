This paper explores the use of set expansion (SE) to improve question answering (QA) when the expected answer is a list of entities belonging to a certain class. Given a small set of seeds, SE algorithms mine textual resources to produce an extended list including additional members of the class represented by the seeds. We explore the hypothesis that a noise-resistant SE algorithm can be used to extend candidate answers produced by a QA system and generate a new list of answers that is better than the original list produced by the QA system. We further introduce a hybrid approach which combines the original answers from the QA system with the output from the SE algorithm. Experimental results for several state-of-the-art QA systems show that the hybrid system performs better than the QA systems alone when tested on list question data from past TREC evaluations.
