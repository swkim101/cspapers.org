We present the WebdamLog system for managing distributed data on the Web in a peer-to-peer manner. We demonstrate the main features of the system through an application called Wepic for sharing pictures between attendees of the sigmod conference. Using Wepic, the attendees will be able to share, download, rate and annotate pictures in a highly decentralized manner. We show how WebdamLog handles heterogeneity of the devices and services used to share data in such a Web setting. We exhibit the simple rules that define the Wepic application and show how to easily modify the Wepic application.
