In this paper, a novel force/torque sensor is presented. The sensor is based on optoelectronic components and therefore its design is relatively simple and reliable. The sensor design make it suitable for the integration in different robotic systems, such as e.g. the fingers of robotic hands. The basic principle and the design of the sensor are described in this paper, along with a specific prototype implemented for underwater applications. Experimental data are presented and discussed to illustrate the main features of the proposed sensor, and its use as an intrinsic tactile sensor is evaluated.
