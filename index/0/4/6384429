Previous information extraction (IE) systems are typically organized as a pipeline architecture of separated stages which make independent local decisions. When the data grows beyond some certain size, the extracted facts become inter-dependent and thus we can take advantage of information redundancy to conduct reasoning across documents and improve the performance of IE. We describe a joint inference approach based on information network structure to conduct cross-fact reasoning with an integer linear programming framework. Without using any additional labeled data this new method obtained 13.7%-24.4% user browsing cost reduction over a state-of-the-art IE system which extracts various types of facts independently.
