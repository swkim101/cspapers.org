Microcomputer Systems I, CSE 416, was adopted as a required senior course by our program faculty in 1985 to provide students with a better understanding of the computer hardware field before they complete selection of their technical elective courses. We had discovered over time that students generally feel that they have a clear understanding of “the software field” but that they were not at all sure what “hardware” was all about. If one examines the typical jobs which our students take upon graduation this material would also enhance their “day one” ability with many potential employers.
