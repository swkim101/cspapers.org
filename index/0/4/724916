Students get more out of an interactive lecture than a passive lecture because they are given time to think. This time allows them to determine if they understand a concept, and if not to ask questions. This understanding is crucial when concepts build on one another. We describe our positive experiences in teaching sophomore-level computer science courses in an interactive lecture format with a computer in the classroom.
