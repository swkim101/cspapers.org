A database design method, based on the concept of moduLe, is first described. The method incorporates both a strategy for enforcing integrity constraints and a tactic for organizing large sets of database structures, integrity constraints and operations. A software toot that helps the development and maintenance of database schemas designed according to the method is then specified. Finally, a prototype expert system offering a partial implementation of the tool is described.
