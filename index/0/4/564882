Semiconducting nanowires (NWs) have the potential to function as highly sensitive and selective sensors for label-free detection of minute concentrations of target molecules. We discuss here an approach to NW sensors using CMOS (complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor) - FET (field effect transistor) compatible technology, which enables detection of biomolecules to clinically relevant concentrations, as well as real-time monitoring of response. This approach eliminates the need for hybrid methods and enables system-scale integration of these sensors with signal processing and information systems. The ability to monitor antibody binding and sense real-time live cellular immune response with readily available technology will facilitate widespread diagnostic applications.
