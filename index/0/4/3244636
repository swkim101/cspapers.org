This work investigates design choices in modeling a discourse scheme for improving opinion polarity classification. For this, two diverse global inference paradigms are used: a supervised collective classification framework and an unsupervised optimization framework. Both approaches perform substantially better than baseline approaches, establishing the efficacy of the methods and the underlying discourse scheme. We also present quantitative and qualitative analyses showing how the improvements are achieved.
