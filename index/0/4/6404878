A custom FPGA-based, 1U CubeSat form-factor reconfigurable computing development platform has been designed and built for the purpose of implementing and testing multicore and multiprocessor systems. The platform was designed to leverage the active partial reconfiguration and configuration readback capabilities of the Xilinx Virtex-6 device. This enables myriad research opportunities in parallel processing, high-performance reconfigurable computing, and multicore/multiprocessor system design. An example application features a nine-processor radiation tolerant computer system which motivates further research into network-on-chip solutions for reducing multicore system routing complexity.
