We consider the sparse Fourier transform problem: given a complex vector x of length n, and a parameter k, estimate the k largest (in magnitude) coefficients of the Fourier transform of x. The problem is of key interest in several areas, including signal processing, audio/image/video compression, and learning theory. 
 
We propose a new algorithm for this problem. The algorithm leverages techniques from digital signal processing, notably Gaussian and Dolph-Chebyshev filters. Unlike the typical approach to this problem, our algorithm is not iterative. That is, instead of estimating "large" coefficients, subtracting them and recursing on the reminder, it identifies and estimates the k largest coefficients in "one shot", in a manner akin to sketching/streaming algorithms. The resulting algorithm is structurally simpler than its predecessors. As a consequence, we are able to extend considerably the range of sparsity, k, for which the algorithm is faster than FFT, both in theory and practice.
