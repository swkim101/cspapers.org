Given a video sequence, obtaining accurate layer segmentation and alpha matting is very important for various applications. However, when a non-textured or smooth area is present in the scene, the segmentation based on only single motion cue usually cannot provide satisfactory results. Conversely, the most matting approaches require a smooth assumption on foreground and background to obtain a good result. In this paper, we combine the merits of motion segmentation and alpha matting technique together to simultaneously achieve high-quality layer segmentation and alpha mattes. First, we explore a general occlusion constraint and design a novel graph cuts framework to solve the layer-based motion segmentation problem for the textured regions using multiple frames. Then, an alpha matting technique is further used to refine the segmentation and resolve the non-textured ambiguities by determining proper alpha values for the foreground and background respectively.
