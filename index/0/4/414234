An anthropomorphic hand arm system using variable stiffness actuation has been developed at DLR. It is aimed to reach its human archetype regarding size, weight and performance. The main focus of our development is put on robustness, dynamic performance and dexterity. Therefore, a paradigm change from impedance controlled, but mechanically stiff joints to robots using intrinsic variable compliance joints is carried out.
