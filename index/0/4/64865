We examine clarification dialogue, a mechanism for refining user questions with follow-up questions, in the context of open domain Question Answering systems. We develop an algorithm for clarification dialogue recognition through the analysis of collected data on clarification dialogues and examine the importance of clarification dialogue recognition for question answering. The algorithm is evaluated and shown to successfully recognize the occurrence of clarification dialogue in the majority of cases and to simplify the task of answer retrieval.
