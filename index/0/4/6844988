In this paper we propose a new method for evaluating systems that extract temporal information from text. It uses temporal closure to reward relations that are equivalent but distinct. Our metric measures the overall performance of systems with a single score, making comparison between different systems straightforward. Our approach is easy to implement, intuitive, accurate, scalable and computationally inexpensive.
