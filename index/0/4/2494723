New interaction experiences are fundamentally changing the way we interact with the web. Emerging touch-based devices and a variety of web-connected appliances represents challenges that prevents the seamless reach of web resources originally tailored for the standard browser experience. This paper explores how web pages can be re-purposed and become interactive presentations that effectively supports communication in scenarios such as digital signage and other presentation use cases. We will cover the TagVisor project which is a JavaScript run-time that uses modern animation effects and provides an HTML5 extension approach to support the authoring of visual narratives using plain web pages.
