XML documents may contain a large diversity of characters. The Character Repertoire Validation for XML (CRVX) language is a simple schema language for specifying character repertoire constraints. These constraints can be specific for syntaxand/or context-based parts of an XML document. The constraints are based on the character classes introduced by XML Schemaâ€™s regular expressions.
