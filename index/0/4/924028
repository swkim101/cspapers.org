We propose improvements to current trace-driven cache simulation methods to make them faster and more economical. We attack the large time and space demands of cache simulation in two ways. First, we reduce the program traces to the extent that exact performance can still be obtained from the reduced traces. Second, we devise an algorithm that can produce performance results for a variety of metrics (hit ratio, write-back counts, bus traffic) for a large number of set-associative write-back caches in just a single simulation run. The trace reduction and the efficient simulation techniques are extended to parallel multiprocessor cache simulations. Our simulation results show that our approach substantially reduces the disk space needed to store the program traces and can dramatically speedup cache simulations and still produce the exact results.
