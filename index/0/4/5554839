We propose a language-model-based approach for addressing the performance robustness problem -- with respect to free-parameters' values -- of pseudo-feedback-based query-expansion methods. Given a query, we create a set of language models representing different forms of its expansion by varying the parameters' values of some expansion method; then, we select a single model using criteria originally proposed for evaluating the performance of using the original query, or for deciding whether to employ expansion at all. Experimental results show that these criteria are highly effective in selecting relevance language models that are not only significantly more effective than poor performing ones, but that also yield performance that is almost indistinguishable from that of manually optimized relevance models.
