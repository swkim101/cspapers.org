A new statistical formula for identifying 2-character words in Chinese text, called the contextual information formula, was developed empirically by performing stepwise logistic regression using a sample of sentences that had been manually segmented. Contextual information in the form of the frequency of characters that are adjacent to the bigram being processed as well as the weighted document frequency of the overlapping bigrams were found to be significant factors for predicting the probablity that the bigram constitutes a word. Local information (the number of times the bigram occurs in the document being segmented) and the position of the bigram in the sentence were not found to be useful in determining words. The contextual information formula was found to be significantly and substantially better than the mutual information formula in identifying 2-character words. The method can also be used for identifying multi-word terms in English text.
