Information Retrieval (IR) systems exploit user feedback by generating an optimal query with respecttoa particularinformationneed. Sinceobtaininganoptimalqueryisanexpensiveprocess, the need for mechanisms to save and reuse past optimal queries for future queries is obvious. In this article, we propose the use of a query base, a set of persistent past optimal queries, and investigatesimilaritymeasuresbetweenqueries. The querybase can be used eitherto answer user queriesor to formulateoptimalqueries. We justifythe formercase analyticallyand thelattercase by experiment.
