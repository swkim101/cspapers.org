This paper proposes the live demonstration of a prototype of MINERVA, a novel P2P Web search engine. The search engine is layered on top of a DHT-based overlay network that connects an a-priori unlimited number of peers, each of which maintains a personal local database and a local search facility. Each peer posts a small amount of metadata to a physically distributed directory that is used to efficiently select promising peers from across the peer population that can best locally execute a query. The proposed demonstration serves as a proof of concept for P2P Web search by deploying the project on standard notebook PCs and also invites everybody to join the network by instantly installing a small piece of software from a USB memory stick.
