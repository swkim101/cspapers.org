We present two new quantum algorithms that either find a triangle (a copy of <i>K</i><inf>3</inf>) in an undirected graph <i>G</i> on <i>n</i> nodes, or reject if <i>G</i> is triangle free. The first algorithm uses combinatorial ideas with Grover Search and makes <i>Õ</i>(<i>n</i><sup>10/7</sup>) queries. The second algorithm uses <i>Õ</i>(<i>n</i><sup>13/10</sup>) queries, and it is based on a new design concept of Ambainis [6] that incorporates the benefits of quantum walks into Grover search [18]. The first algorithm uses only <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) qubits in its quantum subroutines, whereas the second one uses <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) qubits. The Triangle Problem was first treated in [12], where an algorithm with <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> + √n|<i>E</i>|) query complexity was presented (here |<i>E</i>| is the number of edges of <i>G</i>).
