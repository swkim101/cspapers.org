We describe an efficient validity checker for the quantifier-free logic of equality with uninterpreted functions. This logic is well suited for verifying microprocessor control circuitry since it allows the abstraction of datapath values and operations. Our validity checker uses special data structures to speed up case splitting, and powerful heuristics to reduce the number of case splits needed. In addition, we present experimental results and show that this implementation has enabled the automatic verification of an actual high-level microprocessor description.
