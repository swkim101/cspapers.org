In this demonstration, we will present a semantic environment called the K-Box. The K-Box supports the lightweight integration of knowledge tools, with a focus on semantic tools, but with the flexibility to integrate natural language and conventional tools. We discuss the implementation of the framework, and two existing applications, including details of a new application for developers of semantic workflows. The demonstration will be of interest to developers and researchers of ontology-based knowledge management systems, and semantic desktops, and to analysts working with cross-media information.
