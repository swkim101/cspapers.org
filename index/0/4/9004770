We created a proximity measure, called Proximity Within Paragraph (PWP), which is based on the concept of value assignment to queried words, grouped by associated ideas within paragraphs. Based on the WT10G dataset, a test system comprising three test sets and fifty queries were constructed to evaluate the effectiveness of PWP by comparing it with the existing method: Minimum Distance Between Queried Pairs. A further experiment combines the scores obtained from both methods and the results suggest that the combination can significantly improve the effectiveness.
