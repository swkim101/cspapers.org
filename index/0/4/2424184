In this paper we describe the design of fault tolerance capabilities for general-purpose offload semantics, based on the OmpSs programming model. Using ParaStation MPI, a production MPI-3.1 implementation, we explore the features that, being standard compliant, an MPI stack must support to provide the necessary fault tolerance guarantees, based on MPI's dynamic process management. Our results, including synthetic benchmarks and applications, reveal low runtime overhead and efficient recovery, demonstrating that the existing MPI standard provided us with sufficient mechanisms to implement an effective and efficient fault-tolerant solution.
