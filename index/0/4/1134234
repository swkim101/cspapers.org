High throughput performance for bulk data transfers is important for a growing number of communication applications that demand not only the transfer of a large volume of data, but also that this transfer be complewd within certain time constraints. While local area networks today can provide raw transmission bandwidth of multi-megabytes per second and will provide bandwidth in the range of gigabits per second in the not too distant future, user level data transfer rates on existing LANâ€™s have remained much lower. Performance degradation occurs because of the characteristics of the network interface device, the connection between the interface device and the host computer, the host operating system, and the communication protocol software.
