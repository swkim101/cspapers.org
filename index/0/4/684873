Camera networks are being used in more applications as different types of sensor networks are used to instrument large spaces. Here we show a method for localizing the cameras in a camera network to recover the orientation and position up to scale of each camera, even when cameras are wide-baseline or have different photometric properties. Using moving objects in the scene, we use an intra-camera step and an inter-camera step in order to localize. The intra-camera step compares frames from a single camera to build the tracks of the objects in the image plane of the camera. The inter-camera step uses these object image tracks from each camera as features for correspondence between cameras. We demonstrate this idea on both simulated and real data.
