An XML range query may impose predicates on the numerical or textual contents of the elements and/or their respective path structures. In order to handle content and structure range queries efficiently, an XML query processing engine needs to incorporate effective indexing and summarization techniques to efficiently partition the XML document and locate the results. In this paper, we propose a dynamic summarization and indexing method, FLUX, based on Bloom filters and B+-trees to tackle these problems. The results of our extensive experimental evaluations indicated the efficiency of the proposed system.
