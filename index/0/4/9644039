A talking microcomputer recently developed at Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne enables blind and visually impaired students to complete the 2- or 4-year degree program in computer technology without need for sighted readers. The talking microcomputer, and the talking typewriter which was developed as a prelude to it, are discussed not only in the educational context, but also in terms of present and future working environments. Coupling unmodified, commercially available hardware with customized software, the talking microcomputer should be well within the reach of individuals and employers. Future plans include interfacing it with a mainframe, and thus expanding language capabilities.
