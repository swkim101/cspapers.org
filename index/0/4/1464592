Current approaches to compiling aspect-oriented programs are inefficient. This inefficiency has negative effects on the productivity of the development process and is especially prohibitive for dynamic aspect deployment. In this work, we present how well-known virtual machine techniques can be used with only slight modifications to support fast aspect deployment while retaining runtime performance. Our implementation accelerates dynamic aspect deployment by several orders of magnitude relative to mainstream aspect-oriented environments. We also provide a detailed comparison of alternative implementations of execution environments with support for dynamic aspect deployment.
