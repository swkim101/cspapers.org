The use of Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning model (POGIL) in introductory computer science courses has shown to be very useful in active learning delivery of fundamentals of computer science. Moreover, the aspect of organized teamwork in POGIL helps students develop professional skills to be ready to participate in team-based upper division CS courses such as software engineering or capstone courses. POGIL introduces a structured, yet flexible model for group activities. It also resolves the issue of member participations in activities since everyone needs to take a role and switch them in different activities. Time-management is also enhanced with POGIL. Though POGIL is a promising pedagogy, it also presents some unique challenge such as how to adopt the current activities to specific model of the classrooms. The implementation of courses can follow various approaches depending on factors like: class size, institutional culture, background of the students, the nature of facilities, and instructor preferences. In particular, faculty might need to invest significant amount of time to develop and/or work on modifying existing materials for specific courses. Therefore, instructors who choose to be POGIL facilitators has various decision choices. Detailed discussion about all these challenges, choices, options, and approaches are provided which can benefit faculty who are using and/or interested in adopting POGIL in CS courses. The discussions could be helpful to those who are only interested in group-based active learning teaching of CS courses.
