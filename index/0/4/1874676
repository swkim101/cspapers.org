In this paper, we proposed a novel strategy for pick and place operation in a micro range, by using a squeeze effect. In a micro range, the attracting forces such as the van der Waals, capillary, and electrostatic forces are dominate due to the scaling effect. The attracting forces make a release of an object difficult. In this paper, by vibrating the finger, we generate the gas film (the squeeze effect) between the object and the finger and relax the attracting forces. Some experimental results are shown to verify our approach.
