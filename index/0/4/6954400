This paper proposes a dynamic model of DNA microarray hybridization properties in moving fluid. Prior experimental studies indicate hybridization efficiency is closely related to fluid dynamics, temperature, DNA probe density and microarray surface properties. Simulation results using the model proposed here agree well with practical observations. The model may be used to improve and manipulate performance of DNA microarray hybridization, and implement as a control model for hybridization automation to improve reliability and robustness of microarray hybridization process.
