Our students are the social media generation, touting Facebook, Google+, and even Twitter accounts as a matter of course. Providing rich, highly integrated environments, social media systems are a template for community and connection. In contrast, CS education is via singular modalities: lectures, textbooks, labs, discussions, et cetera, that share no active or social connection (you cannot +1 a lecture, for example, share a passage of a text with a classmate, or pull up a view that truly integrates a course and its community). But now we have the technology to create learning environments that share the same rich, multimedia experience as the popular social media sites. What should this look like? How do we start? What have you tried? We'll open with a brief overview of the leading social media tools for those unfamiliar, then proceed straight to an open discussion.
