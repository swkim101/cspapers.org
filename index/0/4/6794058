Abstract : It has been extensively argued that the art and science of programming should strive to become more like mathematics. In this paper we argue that this point of view is correct, but that the reasons usually given for it are wrong. We present our view that mathematics is, rather than a formal process, an ongoing social process and that the formalistic view of mathematics is misleading and destructive for proving software.
