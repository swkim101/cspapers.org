Fine-grained sense distinctions are one of the major obstacles to successful Word Sense Disambiguation. In this paper, we present a method for reducing the granularity of the WordNet sense inventory based on the mapping to a manually crafted dictionary encoding sense hierarchies, namely the Oxford Dictionary of English. We assess the quality of the mapping and the induced clustering, and evaluate the performance of coarse WSD systems in the Senseval-3 English all-words task.
