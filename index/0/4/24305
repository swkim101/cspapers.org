Tapping-based selection methods for handheld devices may need to be supplemented with other approaches as increasingly complex tasks are carried out using those devices. Circling selection methods (such as the Lasso) allow users to select objects on a touch screen by circling with a pen. An experimental comparison of the selection time and accuracy between a circling method and a traditional tapping style of selection was carried out. The experiment used a two dimensional grid (varying in terms of the sizes and the distances of the targets). Analysis of variance showed that tapping selection time differed significantly depending on the size and spacing of the targets. In contrast, circling selection times differed significantly for different levels of target cohesiveness and shape complexity. The results are discussed in terms of implications for design of new pen-based selection methods for handheld devices, and also in terms of evaluation methodology for input selection methods.
