Given a set of entities, the all-pairs similarity search aims at identifying all pairs of entities that have similarity greater than (or distance smaller than) some user-defined threshold. In this article, we propose a parallel framework for solving this problem in metric spaces. Novel elements of our solution include: i) flexible support for multiple metrics of interest; ii) an autonomic approach to partition the input dataset with minimal redundancy to achieve good load-balance in the presence of limited computing resources; iii) an on-the- fly lossless compression strategy to reduce both the running time and the final output size. We validate the utility, scalability and the effectiveness of the approach on hundreds of machines using real and synthetic datasets.
