The approximate degree of a Boolean function f: {-1, 1}^n &#x21a6; {-1, 1} is the least degree of a real polynomial that approximates f pointwise to error at most 1/3. We introduce a generic method for increasing the approximate degree of a given function, while preserving its computability by constant-depth circuits.Specifically, we show how to transform any Boolean function f with approximate degree d into a function F on O(n polylog(n)) variables with approximate degree at least D = &#x3a9;(n^{1/3} d^{2/3}). In particular, if d = n^{1-&#x3a9;(1), then D is polynomially larger than d. Moreover, if f is computed by a constant-depth polynomial-size Boolean circuit, then so is F.By recursively applying our transformation, for any constant &#x3b4; 0 we exhibit an AC&#xb0; function of approximate degree &#x3a9;(n^{1-&#x3b4;}). This improves over the best previous lower bound of &#x3a9;(n^{2/3}) due to Aaronson and Shi (J. ACM 2004), and nearly matches the trivial upper bound of n that holds for any function. Our lower bounds also apply to (quasipolynomial-size) DNFs of polylogarithmic width.We describe several applications of these results. We give:&#x2022; For any constant &#x3b4; 0, an &#x3a9;(n^{1-&#x3b4;}) lower bound on the quantum communication complexity of a function in AC&#xb0;.&#x2022; A Boolean function f with approximate degree at least C(f)^{2-o(1), where C(f) is the certificate complexity of f. This separation is optimal up to the o(1) term in the exponent.&#x2022; Improved secret sharing schemes with reconstruction procedures in AC&#xb0;.
