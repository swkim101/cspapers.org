An approach is described in which students learn object-oriented design by using as many of the characteristics of real program development (starting with incomplete specifications, etc.) as possible in a one-month project. Two-person teams are used, both for the benefit of team experience and to divide the effort between an algorithm portion and a GUI portion. Examples of student work are given, together with suggestions for other projects. Ideas for running a project are given in a week-by-week listing. The paper ends with suggestions for grading.
