For many learning tasks where data is collected over an extended period of time, its underlying distribution is likely to change. A typical example is information (cid:12)ltering, i.e. the adaptive classi(cid:12)cation of documents with respect to a particular user interest. Both the interest of the user and the document content change over time. A (cid:12)ltering sys-tem should be able to adapt to such concept changes. This paper proposes a new method to recognize and handle concept changes with support vector machines. The method maintains a window on the training data. The key idea is to automatically adjust the window size so that the estimated generalization error is minimized. The new approach is both theoretically well-founded as well as e(cid:11)ective and e(cid:14)cient in practice. Since it does not require complicated parameterization, it is simpler to use and more robust than comparable heuristics. Experiments with simulated concept drift scenarios based on real-world text data compare the new method with other window management approaches. We show that it can e(cid:11)ectively select an appropriate window size in a robust way.
