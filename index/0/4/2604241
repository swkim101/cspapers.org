The model used by the CCG parser of Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002b) would fail to capture the correct bilexical dependencies in a language with freer word order, such as Dutch. This paper argues that probabilistic parsers should therefore model the dependencies in the predicate-argument structure, as in the model of Clark et al. (2002), and defines a generative model for CCG derivations that captures these dependencies, including bounded and unbounded long-range dependencies.
