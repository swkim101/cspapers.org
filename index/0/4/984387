Information retrieval using meta data can be traced back to the early age of IR where documents are represented by the controlled vocabulary. In this paper, we explore the usage of meta-data information under the framework of language model. We present a new language model that is able to take advantage of the category information for documents to improve the retrieval accuracy. We compare the new language model with the traditional language model over the TREC4 dataset where the collection information for documents is obtained using the k-means clustering method. The new language model outperforms the traditional language model, which verifies our statement.
