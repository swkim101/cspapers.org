This paper presents a distributed knowledge representation and data fusion system designed for highly integrated Ambient Intelligence applications. The architecture, based on the idea of an ecosystem of interacting artificial entities, is a framework for collaborating agents to perform an intelligent multi-sensor data fusion. In particular, we focus on the cognitive layers leading the overall data acquisition process. The approach has been thoroughly tested in simulation, and part of it has been already exploited in successful applications.
