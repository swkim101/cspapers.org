The method introduced in this paper aims at helping computer vision practitioners faced with an overfit problem. The idea is to replace, in a 3-branch ResNet, the standard summation of residual branches by a stochastic affine combination. The largest tested model improves on the best single shot published result on CIFAR10 by reaching 2.86% test error. Code is available at https://github.com/ xgastaldi/shake-shake
