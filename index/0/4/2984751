At present, the relationship between fault coverage of LSI circuit tests and the tested product quality is not satisfactorily understood. Reported work on integrated circuits predicts, for an acceptable field reject rate, a fault coverage that is too high (99 percent or higher). This fault coverage is difficult to achieve for LSI circuits. This paper proposes a model of fault distribution for a chip. The number of faults on a defective chip is assumed to have a Poisson density for which the average value is determined through experiment on actual chips. The procedure, which relates the model to the chip being studied, is simple; one or more fabricated chip lots must be tested by a few preliminary test patterns. Once the model is characterized, the required value of fault coverage can be easily determined for any given field reject rate. The main advantage of such a model is that it adapts itself to the various characteristics of the chip (technology, feature size, manufacturing environment, etc.) and the fault model (e.g., stuck-type faults). As an example, the technique was applied to an LSI circuit; realistic results were obtained.
