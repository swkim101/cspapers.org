We introduce NaviRadar: an interaction technique for mobile phones that uses a radar metaphor in order to communicate the user's correct direction for crossings along a desired route. A radar sweep rotates clockwise and tactile feedback is provided where each sweep distinctly conveys the user's current direction and the direction in which the user must travel. In a first study, we evaluated the overall concept and tested five different tactile patterns to communicate the two different directions via a single tactor. The results show that people are able to easily understand the NaviRadar concept and can identify the correct direction with a mean deviation of 37° out of the full 360° provided. A second study shows that NaviRadar achieves similar results in terms of perceived usability and navigation performance when compared with spoken instructions. By using only tactile feedback, NaviRadar provides distinct advantages over current systems. In particular, no visual attention is required to navigate; thus, it can be spent on providing greater awareness of one's surroundings. Moreover, the lack of audio attention enables it to be used in noisy environments or this attention can be better spent on talking with others during navigation.
