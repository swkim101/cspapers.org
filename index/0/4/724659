Research work done on a particular aspect of robot deployment in a surveillance task is described. The goal is the optimization of remote control and supervision of semi-automatic vehicles from a single control station for various missions. The technical parameters and control station procedures that would reduce the bandwidth necessary for transmitting still videos while retaining sufficient quality to permit operators to detect and classify objects of interest were investigated. Three technically feasible steps are discussed.
