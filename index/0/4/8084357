This project develops tools to manage personal memories that include a multimedia retrieval system and user interfaces for different devices. This paper and demonstration presents the mobile interface which allows browsing, retrieving, and taking pictures that are automatically annotated with GPS data and audio information. The multimedia retrieval system uses multimodal information: visual content, GPS metadata and audio information. The interface was evaluated in a cultural heritage site.
