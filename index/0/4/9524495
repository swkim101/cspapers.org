Relation classification is a crucial ingredient 
in numerous information extraction systems 
seeking to mine structured facts from 
text. We propose a novel convolutional 
neural network architecture for this task, 
relying on two levels of attention in order 
to better discern patterns in heterogeneous 
contexts. This architecture enables endto-end 
learning from task-specific labeled 
data, forgoing the need for external knowledge 
such as explicit dependency structures. 
Experiments show that our model outperforms 
previous state-of-the-art methods, including 
those relying on much richer forms 
of prior knowledge.
