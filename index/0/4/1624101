We present a scheduling algorithm for controllers which reduces cycle time in datapath-controller systems. The algorithm chooses a schedule to reduce the primary output's dependence on late-arriving inputs - a minimum-dependence structure leads to a shorter system cycle time. Our algorithm accurately predicts from a behavioral description FSM properties which are correlated with fast logic. Experimental results show that the algorithm improves delay in critical outputs and control step-cycle time product.
