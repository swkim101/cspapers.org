This paper presents Yagada, an algorithm to search labelled graphs for anomalies using both structural data and numeric attributes. Yagada is explained using several security-related examples and validated with experiments on a physical Access Control database. Quantitative analysis shows that in the upper range of anomaly thresholds, Yagada detects twice as many anomalies as the best-performing numeric discretization algorithm. Qualitative evaluation shows that the detected anomalies are meaningful, representing a combination of structural irregularities and numerical outliers.
