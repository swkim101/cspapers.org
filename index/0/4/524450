Recently a few systems for automatically solving math word problems have reported promising results. However, the datasets used for evaluation have limitations in both scale and diversity. In this paper, we build a large-scale dataset which is more than 9 times the size of previous ones, and contains many more problem types. Problems in the dataset are semi-automatically obtained from community question-answering (CQA) web pages. A ranking SVM model is trained to automatically extract problem answers from the answer text provided by CQA users, which signiÔ¨Åcantly reduces human annotation cost. Experiments conducted on the new dataset lead to interesting and surprising results.
