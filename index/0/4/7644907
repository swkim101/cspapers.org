In this paper we present the design and implementation of Rapyuta1, the RoboEarth Cloud Engine. Rapyuta is an open source Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) framework designed specifically for robotics applications. Rapyuta helps robots to offload heavy computation by providing secured customizable computing environments in the cloud. The computing environments also allow robots to easily access the RoboEarth knowledge repository. Furthermore, these computing environments are tightly interconnected, paving the way for deployment of robotic teams. We also describe specific use case configurations and present some performance results.
