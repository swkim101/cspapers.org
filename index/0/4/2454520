The discrete-time <italic>D</italic><supscrpt>[<italic>A</italic>]</supscrpt><italic>/D/c/B</italic> queueing system is studied. We consider both a bulk arrival process with constant bulk inter-arrival time (<italic>D</italic>) and general bulk-size distribution (<italic>A</italic>) and a periodic arrival process (<italic>D</italic><subscrpt>1</subscrpt> + ··· + <italic>D<subscrpt>N</subscrpt></italic>). The service/transmission times are deterministic (<italic>D</italic>) and the system provides for a maximum of <italic>c</italic> servers with a buffer size <italic>B</italic>. The motivation for studying this queueing system is its application in performance modeling and analysis of an <italic>asynchronous transfer mode</italic> (ATM) switch with multichannel transmission groups.
