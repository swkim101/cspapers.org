Logic replication, the duplication of logic in order to limit communication between partitions, is an effective part of a complete partitioning solution. In this paper we seek a better understanding of the important issues in logic replication. By developing new optimizations to existing algorithms we are able to significantly improve the quality of these techniques, achieving up to 12.5% better results than the best existing replication techniques. When integrated into our already state-of-the-art partitioner we improve overall cutsizes by 37.8%, while requiring the duplication of at most 7% of the logic.
