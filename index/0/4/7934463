The project library presented in this article insures the harmonious development of the documentation for a software system in tandem with the development of the system itself. It offers the programmer a well-defined framework for his work, and gives management an articulate means for planning and control. The structure of the project library is defined by three dimensions: (1) systems structure (modularization), (2) standard organization and (3) development status. The project library has been realized as a system of files on the Programm-Entwicklungs-Terminalsystem PET/X1150 (known in the USA as MAESTRO) and supported by an appropriate variety of PET-procedures. Our experience with the project library, specifically in the START project, has been very positive and instructive.
