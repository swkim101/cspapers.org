This paper presents an overview of the results from “An Insider's Survey on Software Development”. The purpose of the survey was: to provide a vehicle for the communication of information on the usefulness and effectiveness of methodologies, tools, control mechanisms, metrics, and data collection used by Bell Telephone Laboratories software developers; to evaluate the severity of certain obstacles to project development; and to ascertain feelings on the value of specific software quality issues.
 The results of the survey emphasize the need for work in the requirements area; the lack of attention given to the importance of maintenance within the software life cycle; and the need for more tools and methodologies, automated data collection, and effective software metrics.
