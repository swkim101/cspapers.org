A computer program has been designed and implemented to allow a researcher to analyze the oscillatory behavior of simulated neural networks with cyclic connectivity. The computer program, implemented on the Texas Instruments Explorer /Odyssey system, and the results of numerous experiments are discussed. 
 
The program, CYCLES, allows a user to construct, operate, and inspect neural networks containing cyclic connection paths with the aid of a powerful graphics-based interface. Numerous cycles have been studied, including cycles with one or more activation points, non-interruptible cycles, cycles with variable path lengths, and interacting cycles. The final class, interacting cycles, is important due to its ability to implement time-dependent goal processing in neural networks.
