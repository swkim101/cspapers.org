This paper presents an unsupervised random walk approach to alleviate data sparsity for selectional preferences. Based on the measure of preferences between predicates and arguments, the model aggregates all the transitions from a given predicate to its nearby predicates, and propagates their argument preferences as the given predicateâ€™s smoothed preferences. Experimental results show that this approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on the pseudo-disambiguation task, and it better correlates with human plausibility judgements.
