This paper aims to leverage magnetic information from a Magneto-Inertial Measurement Unit — an IMU sensor augmented with an array of magnetometers, called MIMU hereafter — in a vision/inertial navigation system (VINS). This ego-motion estimation problem is formulated as an optimization over a sliding window fusing data from the MIMU with features tracked in a monocular camera image stream. The novelty of our approach lies in the formulation of preintegrated magnetic measurements that are computed from successive measurements of the local variations of the magnetic field, in the line of the preintegration of IMU data introduced in [1]. The resulting magnetic error terms participate to the minimized cost function along with the classical reprojection and IMU error terms. Our experiments show the benefits of this fusion. On the one hand, the added magnetic information from the MIMU allows to complement the VINS in cases where vision does not provide useful information during an extended period of time; on the other hand, vision does extend the operational domain of the navigation system compared to a pure MIMU solution, in particular for the outdoor portions of the trajectory.
