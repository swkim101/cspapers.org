This paper reports, to our knowledge, the first spherical induction motor (SIM) operating with closed loop control. The motor can produce up to 4 Nm of torque along arbitrary axes with continuous speeds up to 300 rpm. The motor's rotor is a two-layer copper-over-iron spherical shell. The stator has four independent inductors that generate thrust forces on the rotor surface. The motor is also equipped with four optical mouse sensors that measure surface velocity to estimate the rotor's angular velocity, which is used for vector control of the inductors and control of angular velocity and orientation. Design considerations including torque distribution for the inductors, angular velocity sensing, angular velocity control, and orientation control are presented. Experimental results show accurate tracking of velocity and orientation commands.
