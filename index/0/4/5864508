The major purpose of this paper is to combine results of current robot force control research with scientific approaches in compliant motion, which are based on Mason's task frame formalism. The embedding of adaptive implicit hybrid force/pose control in a robot control architecture for compliant motion control is described. By the usage of adaptive force control, the practicability of compliant motion applications is improved. The applied control concept is constituted in a theoretical as well as in a practical manner. To highlight the meaning for practical implementations, experimental results with industrial manipulators under adaptive force control in three degrees of freedom are finally shown.
