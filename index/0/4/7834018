Dimensionality reduction is a commonly used step in many algorithms for visualization, classification, clustering and modeling. Most dimensionality reduction algorithms find a low dimensional embedding that preserves the structure of high-dimensional data points. This paper proposes Local Minima Embedding (LME), a technique to find a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the local minima structure of a given objective function. LME provides an embedding that is useful for visualizing and understanding the relation between the original variables that create local minima. Additionally, the embedding can potentially be used to sample the original function to discover new local minima. The function in the embedded space takes an analytic form and hence the gradients can be computed analytically. We illustrate the benefits of LME in both synthetic data and real problems in the context of image alignment. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper that addresses the problem of finding an embedding that preserves local minima properties of an objective function.
