A model-based computer vision system has been developed which can determine the position and orientation of several parts in the same scene. The parts can be of the same type or of different types. Furthermore, the system can work with visually noisy scenes and some occlusion. Abstract two-dimensional models are formed by having the system view the parts under favorable conditions. Parts are found by matching the abstract models to the scene data, after it has been highly organized.
