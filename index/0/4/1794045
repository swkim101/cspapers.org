In this paper a novel decoupling method using eigenmode derived from S-parameter is proposed. Eigen beam forming toward a degenerated eigenmode of a mutual coupling channel allows one antenna group to be isolated from the other spatially, which results in decoupling over a wide range of frequencies. Moreover, due to symmetric antenna arrangement, the proposed method can isolate one antenna group from many more antennas.
