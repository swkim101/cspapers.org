This paper presents a new approach to solving the orthogonal packing problem (OPP). The OPP is shown to be related to one class of resource allocation problems, namely the land allocation problem. The proposed method differs from traditional methods in that component dimensions are not prescribed, allowing designers greater flexibility and giving them the ability to choose from a number of different solutions. We will show that in removing constraints from dimensions, we allow for the possibility for finding better solutions and this is verified in the case study.
