The paper investigates the problem of providing a formal device for the dependency approach to syntax, and to link it with a parsing model. After reviewing the basic tenets of the paradigm and the few existing mathematical results, we describe a dependency formalism which is able to deal with long-distance dependencies. Finally, we present an Earley-style parser for the formalism and discuss the (polynomial) complexity results.
