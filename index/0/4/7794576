This paper provides a systematic comparison of various characteristics of computationally-intensive workloads. Our analysis focuses on standard HPC benchmarks and representative applications. For the selected workloads we provide a wide range of characterizations based on instruction tracing and hardware counter measurements.
 Each workload is analyzed at the instruction level by comparing the dynamic distribution of executed instructions. We also analyze memory access patterns including various aspects of cache utilization and locality properties of address distributions. Since prefetching plays an important role in the performance of computational workloads, we explore the prefetching potential and for parallel workloads we study the sharing properties of memory accesses. For the purpose of completeness, HPC workloads are compared to two commonly used commercial computing benchmarks.
 The results of this work show that the HPC application space is surprisingly diverse, with some codes showing similar data sharing and locality properties with commercial applications. The wide range of studies presented in this paper are instrumental in uncovering the diversity of this application space.
