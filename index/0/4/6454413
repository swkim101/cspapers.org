We developed a Japanese morphological analyzer that uses the co-occurrence of words to select the correct sequence of words in an unsegmented Japanese sentence. The co-occurrence information can be obtained from cases where the system incorrectly analyzes sentences. As the amount of information increases, the accuracy of the system increases with a small risk of degradation. Experimental results show that the proposed system assigns the correct phonological representations to unsegmented Japanese sentences more precisely than do other popular systems.
