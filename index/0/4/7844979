An EMG controlled intelligent orthosis was developed to support the rollover movement of cancer bone metastasis patients. In this paper, the validation of the developed signal processing algorithm to recognize the rollover was focused. Firstly, the ElectroMechanicalDelay of the internal oblique muscle was measured as the about 65 (msec). Secondly, it was confirmed that the rollover movement was recognized about 65 (msec) before the movement started. Therefore, the developed Micro Macro Neural Network (MMNN) recognized the rollover movement using the EMG signal as quick as possible. Finally, the robustness of the developed MMNN was discussed by conducting the experiment to discriminate between the rollover and turning out. We proposed and developed the original algorithm in which the logical XOR operation was added to the MMNN, because the MMNN which learned the characteristics of the only rollover recognized the turning out movement as the rollover movement perfectly. When the proposed algorithm that combined the MMNN and XOR operator was used, the rollover and turning out movements were discriminated 83%.
