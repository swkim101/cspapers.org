This paper describes the effort undertaken at the University of Iowa to institute a software engineering curriculum at the graduate level. We describe our experiences over 2 years in developing a pilot 2-semester course in object-oriented software engineering. This pilot course had the goals of introducing practical and realistic object-oriented software engineering to students, and developed several innovative techniques to achieve this goal on a very limited budget.
