A new structure of second order digital phase locked loop (DPLL) called modified second order DPLL (MSO-DPLL) has been proposed. Ranges of initial conditions leading to the phase locking condition of both conventional and modified second order DPLL have been determined from computer simulation. The phase error dynamics of both the loops have also been studied using digital computers. These observations establish the larger frequency acquisition range (FAR) of the MSO-DPLL compared to the conventional loop.
