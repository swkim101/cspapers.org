The paper explores the meaning of smart grid, concluding that the term is closely linked with enhanced sensing, actuation and control of power systems. It is suggested that such cyber-physical systems would be more meaningfully described as responsive grids. The paper provides a brief historical perspective of the decision-making that underlies existing, seemingly inflexible, grid structures. It emphasizes the future needs for responsive grids, as a consequence of inevitable growth in renewable generation and newer types of loads such as plug-in electric vehicles. The paper considers the cyber-infrastructure requirements for supporting controllability of highly distributed generation and load resources.
