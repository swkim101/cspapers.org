The Three-Dimensional Normal Distributions Transform (3D-NDT) is a spatial modeling technique with applications in point set registration, scan similarity comparison, change detection and path planning. This work concentrates on evaluating three common variations of the 3D-NDT in terms of accuracy of representing sampled semi-structured environments. In a novel approach to spatial representation quality measurement, the 3D geometrical modeling task is formulated as a classification problem and its accuracy is evaluated with standard machine learning performance metrics. In this manner the accuracy of the 3D-NDT variations is shown to be comparable to, and in some cases to outperform that of the standard occupancy grid mapping model.
