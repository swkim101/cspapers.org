Change computation is an essential component in several capabilities of a deductive database, such as integrity constraints checking, materialized view maintenance and condition monitoring. In this paper, we present a general method for change computation, which is based on the use of transition and internal events rules. These rules explicitly define the insertions, deletions and modifications induced by a database update. Standard SLDNF resolution can be used to compute the induced changes, but other procedures could be used as well. Our method generalizes and extends previous work on change computation methods, and in some cases computes changes in a more efficient way.
