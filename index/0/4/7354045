For more than a decade the relational database model has been a dominant factor in database research and development. Now, with over 30 DBMSes claiming to support relational concepts, it is safe to say that the relational approach is coming into widespread use. This paper reports on an investigation into the justifiability of a relational standard. The motivations and scope for the investigation are given together with an outline of the approach being taken, the current status of the work, and some of the issues. The paper concludes by raising the question of the role of a relational standard in a family of DBMS standards.
