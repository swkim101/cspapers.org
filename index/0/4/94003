This paper describes Pyro, a robotics programming environment designed to allow inexperienced undergraduates to explore topics in advanced robotics. Pyro, which stands for Python Robotics, runs on a number of advanced robotics platforms. In addition, programs in Pyro can abstract away low-level details such that individual programs can work unchanged across very different robotics hardware. Results of using Pyro in an undergraduate course are discussed.
