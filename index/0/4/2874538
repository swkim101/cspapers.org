Word usage is domain dependent. A common word in one domain can be quite infrequent in another. In this study we exploit th~ property of word usage to improve document routing. We show that routing queries (profiles) learned only from the documents in a query domain are better than the routing profiles learned when query domains are not used. We approximate a query domain by a guerg zone. Experiments show that routing profiles learned from a query zone are 8â€“12~0 more effective than the profiles generated when no query zoning is used.
