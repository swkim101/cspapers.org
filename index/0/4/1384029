We analyze circuits for kernels from popular quantum computing applications, characterizing the hardware resources necessary to take ancilla preparation off the critical path. The result is a chip entirely dominated by ancilla generation circuits. To address this issue, we introduce optimized ancilla factories and analyze theirstructure and physical layout for ion trap technology. We introduce a new quantum computing architecture with highly concentrated data-only regions surrounded by shared ancilla factories. The results are a reduced dependence on costly teleportation, more efficient distribution of generated ancillae and more than five times speedup over previous proposals.
