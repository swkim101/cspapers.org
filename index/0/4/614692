A data collection system has been proposed to collect small data effectively such that the total traffic is decreased by sharing the packet header. The system functions were designed to make the system work effectively for the case to collect student IDs in universities to check if students enter the classroom on time. The designed functions were implemented, and the performance was examined in an experimental network. The system could collect the small data gotten by the RFID readers, and it was found that the total traffic by the proposed scheme was decreased down to 50% of the values by conventional system. The results clarified that the proposed system worked effectively to collect small data by circulating packets.
