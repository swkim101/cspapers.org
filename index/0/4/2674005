Metric learning has proved very successful. However, human annotations are necessary. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method, dubbed Metric Imitation (MI), where metrics over cheap features (target features, TFs) are learned by imitating the standard metrics over more sophisticated, off-the-shelf features (source features, SFs) by transferring view-independent property manifold structures. In particular, MI consists of: 1) quantifying the properties of source metrics as manifold geometry, 2) transferring the manifold from source domain to target domain, and 3) learning a mapping of TFs so that the manifold is approximated as well as possible in the mapped feature domain. MI is useful in at least two scenarios where: 1) TFs are more efficient computationally and in terms of memory than SFs; and 2) SFs contain privileged information, but are not available during testing. For the former, MI is evaluated on image clustering, category-based image retrieval, and instance-based object retrieval, with three SFs and three TFs. For the latter, MI is tested on the task of example-based image super-resolution, where high-resolution patches are taken as SFs and low-resolution patches as TFs. Experiments show that MI is able to provide good metrics while avoiding expensive data labeling efforts and that it achieves state-of-the-art performance for image super-resolution. In addition, manifold transfer is an interesting direction of transfer learning.
