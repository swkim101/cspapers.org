In the past, various studies have been proposed to acquire the capacity to perceive and comprehend language in articles or human communications. Recently, researchers focus on higher semantic levels to what human would need to understand the contents of articles. While human can smoothly interpret documents when they have knowledge of the context of documents, they have difficulty with those as their context is lost or changes. In this PhD proposal, we address three novel research questions: detecting uninterpretable pieces in documents, retrieving contextual information and constructing compact context for the documents, then propose approaches to these tasks, and discuss related issues.
