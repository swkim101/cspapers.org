In wireless networks, mobile hosts must update the network with their current location in order to get packets delivered. Paging facilitates efficient power management at the mobile host by allowing the host to update the network less frequently at the cost of providing the network with only approximate location information. The network determines the exact location of a mobile host through paging before delivering packets destined to the mobile host. In this paper, we propose the concept of paging as an IP service. IP paging enables a common infrastructure and protocol to support the different wireless interfaces such as CDMA, GPRS, wireless LAN, avoiding the duplication of several application layer paging implementations and the inter-operability issues that exist today. We present the design, implementation, and detailed qualitative and quantitative evaluation, using measurements and simulation, of three IP-based paging protocols for mobile hosts.
