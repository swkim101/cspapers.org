We present a complete framework to design and deploy adaptive low power wireless networks. The framework consists of Fennec Fox, a four-layer network protocol stack, and Swift Fox, a high-level programming language. At run-time, Fennec Fox dynamically reconfigures services running on the network protocol stack layers using a library of modules optimizing a layer's performance with respect to some metric (delay, power consumption, etc.). While network reconfiguration is triggered by sensing or timer events, policies specifying how a network should be reconfigured when given events occur are programmed in Swift Fox at design time. We discuss a network that reconfigures its communication services to support 3 scenarios and that was tested on mica2, intelMote2, and telosB architectures, the last one requiring 21KB of ROM and 2KB of RAM.
