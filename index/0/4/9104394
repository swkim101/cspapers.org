For the purposes of this paper an Interactive Graphical System is defined as a computer driven input/output video device, capable of displaying lines as well as text, and incorporating interactive devices such as function buttons, and/or light pen, etc.. Basically there are two approaches to generating pictures for such interactive graphical systems. One approach, called the display file approach, is to maintain all graphical data in a single display file which is used to drive a display. The second approach, called the separate data structure-display file approach, is to maintain the data in a list type data structure from which a display file is generated. The interaction speed of a graphical system based upon the separate data structure-display file approach is dictated primarily by the program that traverses the list type data structure to produce a display file for the display device. This program, called the Picture Compiler (PC), is the single most critical program in the success of the separate data structure-display file approach, and is the topic of this paper. The described techniques are applicable independent of the type of data structure, display hardware, and computer hardware, utilized in the graphical system.
