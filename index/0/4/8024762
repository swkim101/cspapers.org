In this talk, I will focus on the applications and the latest development of deep learning technologies at Alibaba. More specifically, I will discuss (a) how to handle high dimensional data in deep learning and its application to recommender system, (b) the development of deep learning models for transfer learning and its application to image classification, (c) the development of combinatorial optimization techniques for DNN model compression and its application to large-scale image classification and object detection, and (d) the exploration of deep learning technique for combinatorial optimization and its application to the packing problem in shipping industry. I will conclude my talk with a discussion of new directions for deep learning that are under development at Alibaba.
