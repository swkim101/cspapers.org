Between 1993-1999, the foundations of the retrieval platform HySpirit (HYpermedia System with Probabilistic Inference for the Retrieval of InformaTion) were developed at the University of Dortmund. Since 1999, HySpirit has been used as a research tool and as a commercial product in selected applications. The main purposes of the HySpirit technology are: • Provide flexible abstraction layers (relational, logical and object-oriented) for modelling hypermedia and knowledge retrieval. • Exploit the logical structure of documents for retrieving best entry points into documents. • Support knowledge-oriented retrieval in semi-structured and heterogeneous data sources. • Integrate fact-oriented and content-oriented searching and browsing. • Support retrieval strategies exploiting relationships (spatial, temporal, semantic etc.). • Consider intrinsic features of knowledge such as uncertainty, incompleteness and inconsistency. • Allow for easy parameter setting to reflect user preferences (profiles) and support retrieval experiments and evaluation. • Extend database models with probability theory in order to create a retrieval platform possessing the advantages and expressiveness of database models, and the aggregation of uncertain evidence as defined by probability theory. Currently, the platform is applied in research projects on structured document retrieval (XML) and interactive TV (MPEG-7). Also, the system is installed in a commercial environment, where various information needs occur in a highly heterogeneous and complex information environment. The HySpirit system consists of a number of modules including the core retrieval engine, knowledge modelling languages, indexers, analysers, statistical tools and data management connectors. This modular structure supports distributed development and a " plug-in " architecture.
