Acquiring models of the environment belongs to the fundamental tasks of mobile robots. In the last few years several researchers have focused on the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Classic SLAM approaches are passive in the sense that they only process the perceived sensor data and do not influence the motion of the mobile robot. In this paper we present a novel and integrated approach that combines autonomous exploration with simultaneous localization and mapping. Our method uses a grid-based version of the FastSLAM algorithm and at each point in time considers actions to actively close loops during exploration. By re-entering already visited areas the robot reduces its localization error and this way learns more accurate maps. Experimental results presented in this paper illustrate the advantage of our method over pervious approaches lacking the ability to actively close loops.
