The performance of a ROS application is a function of the individual performance of its constituent nodes. Since ROS nodes are typically configurable (parameterised), the specific parameter values adopted will determine the level of performance generated. In addition, ROS applications may be distributed across multiple computation devices, thus providing different options for node allocation. We address two configuration problems that the typical ROS user is confronted with: i) Determining parameter values and node allocations for maximising performance; ii) Determining node allocations for minimising hardware resources that can guarantee the desired performance. We formalise these problems with a mathematical model, a constrained form of a multiple-choice multiple knapsack problem. We propose a greedy algorithm for optimising each problem, using linear regression for predicting the performance of an individual ROS node over a continuum set of parameter combinations. We evaluate the algorithms through simulation and we validate them in a real ROS scenario, showing that the expected performance levels only deviate from the real measurements by an average of 2.5%.
