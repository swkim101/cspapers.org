Mutation analysis is a powerful technique for assessing and improving the quality of test data used to unit test software. Unfortunately, current automated mutation analysis systems suffer from severe performance problems. This paper presents a new method for performing mutation analysis that uses program schemata to encode all mutants for a program into one metaprogram, which is subsequently compiled and run at speeds substantially higher than achieved by previous interpretive systems. Preliminary performance improvements of over 300% are reported. This method has the additional advantages of being easier to implement than interpretive systems, being simpler to port across a wide range of hardware and software platforms, and using the same compiler and run-time support system that is used during development and/or deployment.
