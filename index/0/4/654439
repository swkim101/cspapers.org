This paper addresses the question whether metaphors can be represented in WordNets. For this purpose, domain-centered data is collected from the Hamburg Metaphor Database, an online source created for the study of possible metaphor representations in WordNets. Based on the results of the analyses of French and German corpus data and EuroWordNet, the implementation problem is discussed. It can be shown that a much more complete representation of synsets and relations between synsets in the source domain as well as a clearer indication of the level of figurativity for individual synsets are needed before global conceptual metaphors can be dealt with in WordNets.
