We describe efficient deterministic techniques for breaking symmetry in parallel. The techniques work well on rooted trees and graphs of constant degree or genus. Our primary technique allows us to 3-color a rooted tree in &Ogr;(lg*n) time on an EREW PRAM using a linear number of processors. We apply these techniques to construct fast linear processor algorithms for several problems, including (&Dgr; + 1)-coloring constant-degree graphs, 5-coloring planar graphs, and finding depth-first-search trees in planar graphs. We also prove lower bounds for 2-coloring directed lists and for finding maximal independent sets in arbitrary graphs.
