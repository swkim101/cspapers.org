Collaborative learning can be beneficial for students, but its success is highly dependent on the characteristics of the students grouped together. Structuring group interactions enhances the effectiveness of collaborative learning [1] and therefore the structuring must be done appropriately. Creating successful groups is challenging for instructors, who generally do not have the ability to hand-select groups. We have created a system to dynamically recommend student groups for short-term collaboration. Instructors can request group suggestions based on various criteria related to students' performance on assessment materials. This system creates groups based on different pedagogical theories we find to be salient to group learning.
