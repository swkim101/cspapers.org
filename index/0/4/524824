We describe a data structure that supports access, rank and select queries, as well as symbol insertions and deletions, on a string S[1, n] over alphabet [1..σ] in time O(lg n/lg lg n), which is optimal. The time is worst-case for the queries and amortized for the updates. This complexity is better than the best previous ones by a Θ(1 + lg σ/lg lg n) factor. Our structure uses nH0(S) + O(n + σ(lg σ + lg1+en)) bits, where H0(S) is the zero-order entropy of S and 0
