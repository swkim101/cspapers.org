The ever increasing popularity of social networks and the ever easier photo taking and sharing experience have led to unprecedented concerns on privacy infringement. Inspired by the fact that the Robot Exclusion Protocol, which regulates web crawlers' behavior according a per-site deployed robots.txt, and cooperative practices of major search service providers, have contributed to a healthy web search industry, in this paper, we propose Privacy Expressing and Respecting Protocol (PERP) that consists of a Privacy.tag -- a physical tag that enables a user to explicitly and flexibly express their privacy deal, and Privacy Respecting Sharing Protocol (PRSP) -- a protocol that empowers the photo service provider to exert privacy protection following users' policy expressions, to mitigate the public's privacy concern, and ultimately create a healthy photo-sharing ecosystem in the long run. We further design an exemplar Privacy.Tag using customized yet compatible QR-code, and implement the Protocol and study the technical feasibility of our proposal. Our evaluation results confirm that PERP and PRSP are indeed feasible and incur negligible computation overhead.
