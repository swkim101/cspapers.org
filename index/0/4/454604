This paper studies the problem of identifying erroneous/correct sentences. The problem has important applications, e.g., providing feedback for writers of English as a Second Language, controlling the quality of parallel bilingual sentences mined from the Web, and evaluating machine translation results. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detecting erroneous sentences by integrating pattern discovery with supervised learning models. Experimental results show that our techniques are promising.
