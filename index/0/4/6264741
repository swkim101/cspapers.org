We study the query answering using views (QAV) problem for tree pattern queries. Given a query and a view, the QAV problem is traditionally formulated in two ways: (i) find an equivalent rewriting of the query using only the view, or (ii) find a maximal contained rewriting using only the view. The former is appropriate for classical query optimization and was recently studied by Xu and Ozsoyoglu for tree pattern queries (TP). However, for information integration, we cannot rely on equivalent rewriting and must instead use maximal contained rewriting as shown by Halevy. Motivated by this, we study maximal contained rewriting for TP, a core subset of XPath, both in the absence and presence of a schema. In the absence of a schema, we show there are queries whose maximal contained rewriting (MCR) can only be expressed as the union of exponentially many TPs. We characterize the existence of a maximal contained rewriting and give a polynomial time algorithm for testing the existence of an MCR. We also give an algorithm for generating the MCR when one exists. We then consider QAV in the presence of a schema. We characterize the existence of a maximal contained rewriting when the schema contains no recursion or union types, and show that it consists of at most one TP. We give an efficient polynomial time algorithm for generating the maximal contained rewriting whenever it exists. Finally, we discuss QAV in the presence of recursive schemas.
