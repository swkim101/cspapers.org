We consider the problem of minimizing tree pattern queries (TPQ) that arise in XML and in LDAP-style network directories. In [Minimization of Tree Pattern Queries, <i>Proc. ACM SIGMOD Intl. Conf. Management of Data,</i> 2001, pp. 497-508], Amer-Yahia, Cho, Lakshmanan and Srivastava presented an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>4</sup>) algorithm for minimizing TPQs in the absence of integrity constraints (Case 1); <i>n</i> is the number of nodes in the query. Then they considered the problem of minimizing TPQs in the presence of three kinds of integrity constraints: required-child, required-descendant and subtype (Case 2). They presented an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>6</sup>) algorithm for minimizing TPQs in the presence of only required-child and required-descendant constraints (i.e., no subtypes allowed; Case 3). We present <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>), <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>4</sup>) and <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) algorithms for minimizing TPQs in these three cases, respectively, based on the concept of graph simulation. We believe that our <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) algorithms for Cases 1 and 3 are runtime optimal.
