Gaussian mixtures (or so-called radial basis function networks) for density estimation provide a natural counterpart to sigmoidal neural networks for function fitting and approximation. In both cases, it is possible to give simple expressions for the iterative improvement of performance as components of the network are introduced one at a time. In particular, for mixture density estimation we show that a k-component mixture estimated by maximum likelihood (or by an iterative likelihood improvement that we introduce) achieves log-likelihood within order 1/k of the log-likelihood achievable by any convex combination. Consequences for approximation and estimation using Kullback-Leibler risk are also given. A Minimum Description Length principle selects the optimal number of components k that minimizes the risk bound.
