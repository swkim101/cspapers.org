A primary challenge in the field of reconfigurable robotics is scaling down the size of individual robotic modules. We present a novel set of permanent magnet modules that are under 1 mm in all dimensions, called Mag-ÂµMods, for use in a reconfigurable micro-system. The modules are actuated by oscillating external magnetic fields of several mT in strength, and are capable of locomoting on a 2-D surface. Multiple modules are controlled by using an electrostatic anchoring surface, which can selectively prevent specific modules from being driven by the external field while allowing others to move freely. We address the challenges of both assembling and disassembling two modules. Assembly is performed by bringing two modules sufficiently close that their magnetic attraction causes them to combine. Disassembly is performed by electrostatically anchoring one module to the surface, and applying magnetic torques from external sources to separate the unanchored module.
