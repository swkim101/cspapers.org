We describe our experience in teaching an integrated module in networks, mathematics, and cryptography, suitable for high school students. The objective is to design a lesson with minimal prerequisite background and a varying degree of programming experience, with an aim towards exciting students early on about computing. Students create and implement a chat program protocol and a minimal RSA algorithm implementation, and implement a brute force algorithm to recover each other's private key. Depending on student experience, scaffolding can be provided to assist with the programming, and advanced topics are possible as extensions to this lesson. We hope that this lesson can be taught as an interdisciplinary unit in math and computer science classes.
