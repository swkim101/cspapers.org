In this paper we summarize recent developments in compact dynamical modeling for both linear and nonlinear systems arising in analog applications. These techniques include methods based on the projection framework, rational fitting of frequency response samples, and nonlinear system identification from time domain data. By combining traditional projection and fitting methods with recently developed convex optimization techniques, it is possible to obtain guaranteed stable and passive parameterized models that are usable in time domain simulators and may serve as a valuable tool for analog designers in both top-down and bottom-up design flows.
