Online communication media such as email, instant messaging, bulletin boards, voice-over-IP, and social networking sites allow any sender to reach potentially millions of users at near zero marginal cost. This property enables information to be exchanged freely: anyone with Internet access can publish content. Unfortunately, the same property opens the door to unwanted communication, marketing, and propaganda. Examples include email spam, Web search engine spam, inappropriately labeled content on YouTube, and unwanted contact invitations in Skype. Unwanted communication wastes one of the most valuable resources in the information age: human attention. 
 
In this paper, we explore the use of trust relationships, such as social links, to thwart unwanted communication. Such relationships already exist in many application settings today. Our system, Ostra, bounds the total amount of unwanted communication a user can produce based on the number of trust relationships the user has, and relies on the fact that it is difficult for a user to create arbitrarily many trust relationships. 
 
Ostra is applicable to both messaging systems such as email and content-sharing systems such as YouTube. It does not rely on automatic classification of content, does not require global user authentication, respects each recipient's idea of unwanted communication, and permits legitimate communication among parties who have not had prior contact. An evaluation based on data gathered from an online social networking site shows that Ostra effectively thwarts unwanted communication while not impeding legitimate communication.
