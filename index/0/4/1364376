Making accurate recommendations for users has become an important function of e-commerce system with the rapid growth of WWW. Conventional recommendation systems usually recommend similar objects, which are of the same type with the query object without exploring the semantics of different similarity measures. In this paper, we organize objects in the recommendation system as a heterogeneous network. Through employing a path-based relevance measure to evaluate the relatedness between any-typed objects and capture the subtle semantic containing in each path, we implement a prototype system (called HeteRecom) for semantic based recommendation. HeteRecom has the following unique properties: (1) It provides the semantic-based recommendation function according to the path specified by users. (2) It recommends the similar objects of the same type as well as related objects of different types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with a real-world movie data set.
