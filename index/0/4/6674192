Two key problems in the design of systems and network management applications are: how to efficiently manage large quantities of related data, and how to allow the application user to view this data at a user-defined level of detail. This paper describes an architecture for network management facilities that may help solve these problems. It also describes CNMgraf (Communications Network Management Graphics Facility), which was developed to test the presentation service model defined by this architecture.
