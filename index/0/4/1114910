Many AI applications are based on some underlying logic that tolerates inconsistent information in a non-trivial way. However, it is not always clear what should be the exact nature of such a logic, and how to choose one for a specific application. In this paper, we formulate a list of desirable properties of "ideal" logics for reasoning with inconsistency, identify a variety of logics that have these properties, and provide a systematic way of constructing, for every n > 2, a family of such n-valued logics.
