We investigate the number of plane geometric, i.e., straight-line, graphs, a set <i>S</i> of <i>n</i> points in the plane admits. We show that the number of plane graphs and connected plane graphs as well as the number of cycle-free plane graphs is minimized when <i>S</i> is in convex position. Moreover, these results hold for all these graphs with an arbitrary but fixed number of edges. Consequently, we provide simple proofs that the number of spanning trees, cycle-free graphs (forests), perfect matchings, and spanning paths is also minimized for point sets in convex position.In addition we construct a new extremal configuration, the so-called double zig-zag chain. Most noteworthy this example bears Θ*(√72<sup><i>n</i></sup>) = Θ*(8.4853<sup><i>n</i></sup>) triangulations and Θ*(41.1889<sup><i>n</i></sup>) plane graphs (omitting polynomial factors in both cases), improving the previously known best maximizing examples.
