Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a popular face recognition technique. However, an inherent problem with this technique stems from the parametric nature of the scatter matrix, in which the sample distribution in each class is assumed to be normal distribution. So it tends to suffer in the case of non-normal distribution. In this paper a nonparametric scatter matrix is defined to replace the traditional parametric scatter matrix in order to overcome this problem. Two kinds of nonparametric subspace analysis (NSA): PNSA and NNSA are proposed for face recognition. The former is based on the principal space of intra-personal scatter matrix, while the latter is based on the null space. In addition, based on the complementary nature of PNSA and NNSA, we further develop a dual NSA-based classifier framework using Gabor images to further improve the recognition performance. Experiments achieve near perfect recognition accuracy (99.7%) on the XM2VTS database.
