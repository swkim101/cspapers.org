Data defined by interpolation is frequently found in new applications 
 involving geographical concepts, moving objects, and 
 spatio-temporal data. This data leads to potentially infinite collections of 
 items, (e.g. the elevation of any point in a map), whose definition is based 
 on the association of a collection of samples with an interpolation 
 function. We first argue that the manipulation of the data through direct 
 access to the samples and interpolation functions easily leads 
 to cumbersome or inaccurate queries. We therefore suggest hiding the 
 samples and the interpolation function away from the logical level, and 
 letting the system manipulate them at the physical level. 
 We propose to model such data conceptually using infinite relations (e.g. 
 the map with elevation yields an infinite ternary relation) which can be 
 manipulated through standard relational query languages (e.g. SQL), with no 
 mention of the interpolated definition. This approach is simple and 
 establishes a clear separation between logical and physical levels.
