Robots and automation systems have become a 
valuable partner in several facets of human life: from learning 
and teaching, to daily working, including health monitoring 
and assistance. So far, these appealing robot-based applications 
are restricted to conduct repetitive, yet useful, tasks due to the 
reduced individual robotsâ€™ capabilities in terms of processing 
and computation. This concern prevents current robots from 
facing more complex applications related to understanding hu- 
man beings and perceiving their subtle feelings. Such hardware 
limitations have been already found in the computer science 
field. In this domain, they are currently being addressed using 
a new resource exploitation model coined as cloud computing, 
which is targeted at enabling massive storage and computation 
using smartly connected and inexpensive commodity hardware. 
The purpose of this paper is to propose a cloud-based robotics 
architecture to effectively develop complex tasks related to 
hospitalized children assistance. More specifically, this paper 
presents a multi-agent learning system that combines machine 
learning and cloud computing using low-cost robots to (1) 
collect and perceive children status, (2) build a human-readable 
set of rules related to the child-robot relationship, and (3) 
improve the children experience during their stay in the hos- 
pital. Conducted preliminary experiments proof the feasibility 
of this proposal and encourage practitioners to work towards 
this direction.
