Applying error recovery monotonously can either compromise the real-time constraint, or worsen the power/energy envelope. Neither of these violations can be realistically accepted in embedded system design, which expects ultra efficient realization of a given application. In this paper, we propose a HW/SW methodology that exploits both application specific characteristics and Spatial/Temporal redundancy. Our methodology combines design-time and runtime optimizations, to enable the resultant embedded processor to perform runtime adaptive error recovery operations, precisely targeting the reliability-wise critical instruction executions. The proposed error recovery functionality can dynamically 1) evaluate the reliability cost economy (in terms of execution-time and dynamic power), 2) determine the most profitable scheme, and 3) adapt to the corresponding error recovery scheme, which is composed of spatial and temporal redundancy based error recovery operations. The experimental results have shown that our methodology at best can achieve fifty times greater reliability while maintaining the execution time and power deadlines, when compared to the state of the art.
