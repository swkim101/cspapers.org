Gaze is recognized as one of the most important cues for the analysis of the cognitive behaviors of a person such as the attention displayed towards objects or people, their in- teractions, functionality and causality patterns. In this short paper, we present our investigations towards the develop- ment of 3D gaze sensing solutions from consumer RGB-D sensors, including their use for the inference of visual at- tention in natural dyadic interactions and the resources we have made or will make available to the community.
