The Intelligent Database Interface (IDI) is a cache-based interface that is designed to provide Artificial Intelligence systems with efficient access to one or more databases on one or more remote database management systems (DBMSs). It can be used to interface with a wide variety of different DBMSs with little or no modification since SQL is used to communicate with remote DBMSs and the implementation of the IDI provides a high degree of portability. The query language of the IDI is a restricted subset of function-free Horn clauses which is translated into SQL. Results from the IDI are returned one tuple at a time and the IDI manages a cache of result relations to improve efficiency. The IDI is one of the key components of the Intelligent System Server (ISS) knowledge representation and reasoning system and is also being used to provide database services for the Unisys spoken language systems program.
