Students in middle level courses in data structures and programming languages often do not have a full appreciation of recursion. The study of the simulation of recursion can be an excellent tool in improving this situation. It is shown how to construct a nonrecursive routine to solve a problem whose solution is naturally recursive. This nonrecursive routine is then used as a foundation from which one can construct a simpler and better structured program than the original version. The advantages of this activity are also discussed.
