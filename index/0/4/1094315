Neuromorphic computing is recently gaining significant attention as a promising candidate to conquer the well-known von Neumann bottleneck. In this work, we propose RENO - a efficient reconfigurable neuromorphic computing accelerator. RENO leverages the extremely efficient mixed-signal computation capability of memristor-based crossbar (MBC) arrays to speedup the executions of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The hierarchically arranged MBC arrays can be configured to a variety of ANN topologies through a mixed-signal interconnection network (M-Net). Simulation results on seven ANN applications show that compared to the baseline general-purpose processor, RENO can achieve on average 178.4× (27.06×) performance speedup and 184.2× (25.23×) energy savings in high-efficient multilayer perception (high-accurate auto-associative memory) implementation. Moreover, in the comparison to a pure digital neural processing unit (D-NPU) and a design with MBC arrays co-operating through a digital interconnection network, RENO still achieves the fastest execution time and the lowest energy consumption with similar computation accuracy.
