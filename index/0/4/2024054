Methods developed for the qualitative simulation of dynamical systems have turned out to be powerful tools for studying genetic regulatory networks. A bottleneck in the application of these methods is the analysis of the simulation results. In this paper, we propose a combination of qualitative simulation and model-checking techniques to perform this task systematically and efficiently. We apply our approach to the analysis of the complex network controlling the nutritional stress response in the bacterium Escherichia coli.
