Data centers and HPC clusters often incorporate specialized networking fabrics to satisfy system requirements. However, Ethernet's low cost and high performance are causing a shift from specialized fabrics toward standard Ethernet. Although Ethernet's low-level performance approaches that of specialized fabrics, the features that these fabrics provide such as reliable in-order delivery and flow control are implemented, in the case of Ethernet, by endpoint hardware and software. Unfortunately, current Ethernet endpoints are either slow (commodity NICs with generic TCP/IP stacks) or costly (offload engines). To address these issues, the JNIC project developed a novel Ethernet endpoint. JNIC's hardware and software were specifically designed for the requirements of high-performance communications within future data-centers and compute clusters. The architecture combines capabilities already seen in advanced network architectures with new innovations to create a comprehensive solution for scalable and high-performance Ethernet. We envision a JNIC architecture that is suitable for most in-data-center communication needs.
