This paper presents COBRA - a visible light communication (VLC) system for off-the-shelf smartphones. COBRA encodes information into specially designed 2D color barcodes and streams them between screen and camera of smartphones. Due to the directionality and short range of visible light, COBRA can preserve user privacy and security in many near field communication scenarios such as opportunistic data exchange between smartphones. We develop a new 2D color barcode for COBRA that is optimized for streaming between small-size screen and low-speed camera of smartphones. COBRA adapts the size and layout of code blocks in streamed barcodes to deal with the significant image blur in mobile environments, and adopts new image processing techniques to achieve real-time barcode stream decoding. Our approach is evaluated through extensive experiments on Android smartphones.
