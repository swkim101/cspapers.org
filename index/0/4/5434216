lIntroduction This paper provides an overview of the Andrew Message System, which is in operation within the Andrew project at Carnegie Mellon University. The Andrew environment currently consists of 300 highfunction workstations (typified by the IBM RT-PC) each running Berkeley Unix and attached to a large campus-wide network. A central file system provides transparently the appearance of a large, monolithic Unix file system. In addition, there are approximately 600 IBM PCâ€™s and 300 (University-owned) Apple Macintoshes that may also participate in the network.
