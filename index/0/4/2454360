Blogs have been expanded at an incredible speed in recent years. Plentiful personal information makes blogs a popular way mining user profiles. In this paper, we propose a novel bloggers' interests modeling approach based on forgetting mechanism. A new forgetting function is introduced to track interest drift. Based on that, the Short Term Interest Models (STIM) and Long Term Interest Models (LTIM) are constructed to describe bloggers' short-term and long-term interests. The experiments show that both models can identify bloggers' preferences well respectively.
