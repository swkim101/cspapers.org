Selecting a Pseudo-Hamiltonian cycle in any irregular network and applying a restricted packet injection mechanism to avoid the exhaustion of the storage resources, a new fully adaptive routing algorithm has been developed and tested. Our new routing mechanism outperforms the most relevant routing proposals for networks with irregular topology. In all the tested cases a significant improvement has been obtained. The most spectacular gains were obtained for big networks. For a 512-node network, uniform traffic, and virtual cut-through flow control, our mechanism can outperform, in some cases, the classic up*/down* algorithm by almost a factor of 2.
