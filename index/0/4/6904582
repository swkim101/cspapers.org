One of the main roadblocks to Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) based nanomanipulation is lack of real time visual feedback. Although the model based visual feedback can partly solve this problem, its unguaranteed reliability due to the inaccurate models in nano-environment still limits the efficiency of AFM based nanomanipulation. This paper introduce a Realtime Fault Detection and Correction (RFDC) method to improve the reliability of the visual feedback. By utilizing Kalman filter and local scan technologies, the RFDC method not only can realtime detect the fault display caused by the modeling error, but also can on-line correct it without interrupting manipulation. In this way, the visual feedback keeps consistent with the true environment changes during manipulation, which makes several operations being finished without a image scanning in between. The theoretical study and the implementation of the RFDC method are elaborated in this paper. Experiments of manipulating nano-particles have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
