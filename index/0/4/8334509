In order to meet the demand of a research platform for intelligent robotics, a humanoid robot named Saika-3 has been developed. It is a self-sustaining biped robot with dual arms and a robotic head. It is equipped with a PC (IBM PC/AT clone), batteries, a wireless ethernet modem, a gyroscope and motor drivers inside its body. Saika-3 can be teleoperated via wireless' ethernet communication. A graphic dynamic simulator is also developed to study control strategy. The paper presents an outline of the hardware of Saika-3 and a simulation result.
