The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new wire routing method for two layer printed circuit boards. This technique has been developed at the University of Illinois Center for Advanced Computation and has been programmed in ALGOL for a B5500 computer. The routing method is based on the newly developed channel assignment algorithm and requires many via holes. The primary goals of the method are short execution time and high wireability. Actual design specifications for ILLIAC IV Control Unit boards have been used to test the feasibility of the routing technique. Tests have shown that this algorithm is very fast and can handle large boards.
