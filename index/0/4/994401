In this paper, we present a real time robust human detection and tracking system for video surveillance which can be used in varying environments. This system consists of human detection, human tracking and false object detection. The human detection utilizes the background subtraction to segment the blob and use codebook to classify human being from other objects. The optimal design algorithm of the codebook is proposed. The tracking is performed at two levels: human classification and individual tracking .The color histogram of human body is used as the appearance model to track individuals. In order to reduce the false alarm, the algorithms of the false object detection are also provided.
