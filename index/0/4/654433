In this paper we initially present an in-depth analysis of the semi-singularity in terms of its definition, properties and its relationship to the self-motion topology structure in the presence of kinematic constraints. Next, the topology structure is explored as a basis for the design of an algorithm structure suitable to address redundancy resolution and path planning for redundant manipulators in the global sense. The proposed top-down algorithm structure provides a global view of the search space with the help of a connectivity graph in the top layer where path options are obtained for further exploration in the lower layers under a parallelizable framework. A 3-DOF planar manipulator is used to illustrate the methodology and a case study is based on the AAI Arm. The methodology is also appropriate for the implementation of the telemonitoring concept for the kinematic control of redundant manipulators.<<ETX>>
