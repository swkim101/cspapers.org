Given a statistical database containing a set of summary tables, this paper examines the complexity of retrieving data from the database in order to satisfy a query. In particular, we consider the case when the query cannot be directly satisfied via a single summary table and requires two or more summary tables. We show that a system of linear equations can be constructed from a set of summary tables whose solution(s) satisfy a query in oarying degrees. We derive a formula for determining the degree of acceptabdity of the solution as a function of the characteristics of the summary tables which derive the algebraic system. We also show that selecting the optimal set of summary tables from the database that yields the best solution to the query is NP-complete. These findings offer important insights into the retrievabfit y of information from a statistical database when designing a statistical query processor.
