Smart cities have attracted the international scientific and business attention and a niche market is being evolved, which engages almost all the business sectors. In their attempt to empower and promote urban competitive advantages, local governments have approached the smart city context and they target habitants, visitors and investments. However, engaging the smart city context is not free-of-charge and corresponding investments are extensive and of high risk without the appropriate management. Moreover, investing in the smart city domain does not secure corresponding mission success and both governments and vendors require more effective instruments. This paper performs an investigation on the smart city business models and is a work in progress. Modeling can illustrate where corresponding profit comes from and how it flows, while a significant business model portfolio is eligible for smart city stakeholders.
