The ability to argue to support a conclusion or to encourage some course of action is fundamental to communication. Guided by examination of naturally occurring arguments, this paper classifies the communicative structure and function of several different kinds of arguments and indicates how these can be formalized as plan-based models of communication. The paper describes the use of these communication plans in the context of a prototype which cooperatively interacts with a user to allocate scarce resources. This plan-based approach to argument helps improve the cohesion and coherence of the resulting communication.
