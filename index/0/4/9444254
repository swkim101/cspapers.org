Increasing interest is being shown in the use of Java for large scale or Grande applications. This new use of Java places speci.c demands on the Java execution environments that can be tested using the Java Grande benchmark suite [5], [6], [7]. The large processing requirements of Grande applications makes parallelisation of interest. A suite of parallel benchmarks has been developed from the serial Java Grande benchmark suite, using three parallel programming models: Java native threads, MPJ (a message passing interface) and JOMP (a set of OpenMP-like directives). The contents of the suite are described, and results presented for a number of platforms.
