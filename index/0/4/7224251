This paper develops mathematical foundations and architectural components for providing privacy guarantees on stream data in grassroots participatory sensing applications, where groups of participants use privately-owned sensors to collectively measure aggregate phenomena of mutual interest. Grassroots applications refer to those initiated by members of the community themselves as opposed to by some governing or official entities. The potential lack of a hierarchical trust structure in such applications makes it harder to enforce privacy. To address this problem, we develop a privacy-preserving architecture, called PoolView, that relies on data perturbation on the client-side to ensure individuals' privacy and uses community-wide reconstruction techniques to compute the aggregate information of interest. PoolView allows arbitrary parties to start new services, called pools, to compute new types of aggregate information for their clients. Both the client-side and server-side components of PoolView are implemented and available for download, including the data perturbation and reconstruction components. Two simple sensing services are developed for illustration; one computes traffic statistics from subscriber GPS data and the other computes weight statistics for a particular diet. Evaluation, using actual data traces collected by the authors, demonstrates the privacy-preserving aggregation functionality in PoolView.
