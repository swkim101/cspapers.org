This paper gives the first optimal bounds for coalesced hashing schemes in the case of limited randomness, and thereby establishes the analytic performance of these schemes in a model that supports formal randomized computation. As a byproduct of this work, we attain a much simpler analysis of coalesced hashing schemes, which provides more information about the statistics of the underlying processes. We present the generating functions that govern the chain distribution and probe performance for coalesced hashing schemes, including asymptotic formulations when cellars are used.
