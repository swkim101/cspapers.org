A majority of the state-of-the-art local search solvers perform random and/or Novelty-based walks to overcome search stagnation. Although such strategies are effective in diversifying a search from its current local minimum, they do not actively prevent the search from visiting previously encountered local minima. In this paper, we propose a new preventative strategy to effectively minimise search stagnation using pseudo-conflict learning. We define a pseudo-conflict as a derived path from the search trajectory that leads to a local minimum. We then introduce a new variable selection scheme that penalises variables causing those pseudo-conflicts. Our experimental results show that the new preventative approach significantly improves the performance of local search solvers on a wide range of structured and random benchmarks.
