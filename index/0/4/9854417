This paper presents a framework for planning the motion of an n-fingered robot hand to create an inertial load on a grasped object to achieve a desired in-grasp sliding motion. The model of the sliding dynamics is based on a soft-finger limit surface contact model at each fingertip. The framework is applied to the problem of regrasping a block held in a pinch grasp. The approach is applied to two examples in simulation, one of which is tested experimentally.
