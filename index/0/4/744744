In this paper we present generic distributed algorithms for assembling and repairing shapes using modular self-reconfiguring robots. The algorithms work in the sliding cube model. Each module independently evaluates a set of local rules using different evaluation models. Two methods are used to determine the correctness of the algorithms - a graph analysis technique which can prove the rule set is correct for specific instances of the algorithm, and a statistical technique which can produce arbitrary bounds on the likelihood that the rule set functions correctly. An extension of the assembly algorithm can be used to produce arbitrary non-cantilevered convex shapes without holes. The algorithms have been implemented and evaluated in simulation.
