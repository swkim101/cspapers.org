The papers presented in this volume were presented at the 15th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, held January 11-13, 2004 in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Symposium was jointly sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory and the SIAM Activity Group on Discrete Mathematics.In response to the call for papers a total of 454 papers were submitted: 360 long form abstracts and 94 in short form, of which 117 long form abstracts and 18 short form submissions were accepted by the program committee. The decisions were based on originality, technical contribution and relevance. The submissions were not formally refereed, although every attempt was made to verify the main claims. In addition to the program committee members, many additional reviewers contributed to this effort. It is expected that most of the accepted papers will appear in more complete form in scientific journals.
