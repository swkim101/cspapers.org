Urbanization grows steadily, i.e. more humans live at one place and rural areas are more unpopular. Urbanization faces challenges for city planning and development. Cities have to deal with large crowds, high energy consumption, large quantities of garbage etc. Thus, smart cities have to meet many requirements of different areas. Hence, realizing smart cities can be supported by linking different smart areas, such as smart girds and smart homes, to one large area. The linking is done by information and communication technologies, which are supported through a clear definition of functionalities and interfaces. Smart cities and further smart areas are under development, so, it is difficult to depict an overview on their functionalities, yet. Therefore, the two approaches, use case methodology and integration profiles, are introduced in this work, which are also realized by a web-based application.
