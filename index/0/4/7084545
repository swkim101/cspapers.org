Path planning in dynamic environments with moving obstacles is computationally complex since it requires modeling time as an additional dimension. While in other domains there are state dominance relationships that can significantly reduce the complexity of the search, in dynamic environments such relationships do not exist. This paper presents a novel state dominance relationship tailored specifically for dynamic environments, and presents a planner that uses that property to plan paths over ten times faster than without using state dominance.
