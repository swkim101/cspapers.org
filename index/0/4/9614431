We address the text content mining problem through a concept based framework by constructing a conceptual knowledge base and discovering knowledge therefrom. Defining a novel representation called the Concept Frame Graph (CFG), we propose a learning algorithm for constructing a CFG knowledge base from text documents. An interactive concept map visualization technique is presented for user-guided knowledge discovery from the knowledge base. Through experimental studies on real life documents, we observe that the proposed approach is promising for mining deeper knowledge.
