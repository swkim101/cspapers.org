This paper presents a distributed formation control method for a group of robots. The global objective of achieving a desired formation is obtained by dividing it into a set of local objectives which are achieved in a distributed manner. A basic repetitive pattern in the desired formation is identified and a corresponding unique differentiable task function is defined based on the position coordinates of the robots forming the pattern. Neighbor selection rules are designed for the robots in such a way that each robot is part of one or more such patterns. A singularity-robust task-priority inverse kinematics method is used to design velocity controllers to achieve these patterns. Since a robot can receive multiple control actions being part of multiple task functions or patterns, a distributed null space behavioral (NSB) approach is designed to combine such multiple control actions in a prioritized way. A comprehensive stability analysis of the proposed approach based on Lyapunov methods is presented. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
