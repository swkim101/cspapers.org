The amount of available data grows every day. The data can help to make better decisions. However, with growing volume and variety it becomes increasingly more difficult to find the necessary data. Traditional search engines such as ElasticSearch or Apache Solr are primarily designed to search for text documents. Whereas a search for data has its own specifics: there is less text and more structure. Knoema's search engine is designed specifically to search for data by leveraging data's structure in order to get better results compared to document-oriented search engines.
