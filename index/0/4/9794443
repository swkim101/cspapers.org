Automatic extraction of collocations from large corpora has been the focus of many research efforts. Most approaches concentrate on improving and combining known lexical association measures. In this paper, we describe a genetic programming approach for evolving new association measures, which is not limited to any specific language, corpus, or type of collocation. Our preliminary experimental results show that the evolved measures outperform three known association measures.
