We present several approximation algorithms for the problem of embedding metric spaces into a line, and into the two-dimensional plane. Among other results, we give an O(√n)-approximation algorithm for the problem of finding a line embedding of a metric induced by a given unweighted graph, that minimizes the (standard) multiplicative distortion. We give an improved Õ(n1/3) approximation for the case of metrics generated by unweighted trees. This is the first result of this type.
