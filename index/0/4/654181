This paper proposed a phase-closed-loop nanomachining control method to realize the directly control of machining depth based on ultrasonic vibration-assisted AFM. By using applied force to control the machining depth, conventional AFM machining approaches unable to machining a nanostructure with specified machined depth. With the proposed method, the vibration phase of micro-cantilever has a specific relationship with machining depth. Therefore, the nano-grooves with desired depth can be machined by using phase value as feedback of PID control. In this paper, the theoretical analysis and simulation are carried out, and the experiments of phase-closed-loop control method are conducted. The experimental results verify the primary feasibility of the proposed method. The present method also demonstrates the potential on the fabrication of three-dimension nanostructures and nanoelectronic device.
