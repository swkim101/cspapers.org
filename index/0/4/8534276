This paper describes ultra-low-power chip design using nano-scale electro-mechanical switches (NEMS) with graphene. This chip is attachable and detachable onto the top of other chips due to remarkable stickiness of carbon-nanotube interconnects. New 3D-IC can be thus constructed for reconfigurable system-on-chips. Furthermore, due to a floating gate built in NEMS, their logic performance is much superior to that of NEMS-based logic in previous works, and even better than that of conventional CMOS.
