The growing influence of modern electronic computing in many fields of knowledge has contributed to a dramatic increase and diversification in the application of mathematics to other disciplines. No longer are the uses of mathematics confined exclusively to the physical sciences and engineering; they are found with increasing frequency in the social, behavioral, and life sciences as well. At the same time the use of the computer has led to different requirements for the solution process in mathematics itself. Theory construction and model building have assumed a different dimension; in addition to knowing existence theorems, the user of mathematics must know constructive methods for solving problems, and he must have the means to ascertain the efficiency as well as the correctness of these methods.
