A number of retrieval models incorporating term dependencies have recently been introduced. Most of these modify existing "bag-of-words" retrieval models by including features based on the proximity of pairs of terms (or bi-terms). Although these term dependency models have been shown to be significantly more effective than the bag-of-words models, there have been no previous systematic comparisons between the different approaches that have been proposed. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of recent bi-term dependency models over a range of TREC collections, for both short (title) and long (description) queries. To ensure the reproducibility of our study, all experiments are performed on widely available TREC collections, and all tuned retrieval model parameters are made public. These comparisons show that the weighted sequential dependence model is at least as effective as, and often significantly better than, any other model across this range of collections and queries. We observe that dependency features are much more valuable in improving the performance of longer queries than for shorter queries. We then examine the effectiveness of dependence models that incorporate proximity features involving more than two terms. The results show that these features can improve effectiveness, but not consistently, over the available data sets.
