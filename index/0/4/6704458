We address the challenge of building secure embedded web interfaces by proposing WebDroid: the first framework specifically dedicated to this purpose. Our design extends the Android Framework, and enables developers to create easily secure web interfaces for their applications. To motivate our work, we perform an in-depth study of the security of web interfaces embedded in consumer electronics devices, uncover significant vulnerabilities in all the devices examined, and categorize the vulnerabilities. We demonstrate how our framework's security mechanisms prevent embedded applications from suffering the vulnerabilities exposed by our audit. Finally we evaluate the efficiency of our framework in terms of performance and security.
