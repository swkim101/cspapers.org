Let <i>k</i> be a fixed integer. We consider the problem ofpartitioning an input set of points endowed with a distancefunction into <i>k</i> clusters. We give polynomial timeapproximation schemes for the following three clustering problems:Metric <i>k</i>-Clustering, l <sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub><i>k</i>-Clustering, and l<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> <i>k</i>-Median.In the <i>k</i>-Clustering problem, the objective is to minimizethe sum of all intra-cluster distances. In the <i>k</i>-Medianproblem, the goal is to minimize the sum of distances from pointsin a cluster to the (best choice of) cluster center. In metricinstances, the input distance function is a metric. In l<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> instances, the points are in R<sup><i>d</i></sup> and the distance between two points <i>x,y</i>is measured by <i>x−y</i> <sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> (noticethat (R <sup><i>d</i></sup>, ṡ <sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> is nota metric space). For the first two problems, our results are thefirst polynomial time approximation schemes. For the third problem,the running time of our algorithms is a vast improvement overprevious work.
