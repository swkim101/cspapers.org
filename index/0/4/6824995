We experiment with adding semantic role information to a string-to-tree machine translation system based on the rule extraction procedure of Galley et al. (2004). We compare methods based on augmenting the set of nonterminals by adding semantic role labels, and altering the rule extraction process to produce a separate set of rules for each predicate that encompass its entire predicate-argument structure. Our results demonstrate that the second approach is effective in increasing the quality of translations.
