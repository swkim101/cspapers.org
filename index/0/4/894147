The Live Nugget Extractor system provides users with a method of efficiently and accurately collecting relevant information for any web query rather than providing a simple ranked lists of documents. The system utilizes an online learning procedure to infer relevance of unjudged documents while extracting and ranking information from judged documents. This creates a set of judged and inferred relevance scores for both documents and text fragments, which can be used for test collections, summarization, and other tasks where high accuracy and large collections with minimal human effort are needed.
