A hierarchical structuring method for functional software systems is described. This method is greatly influenced by the authors experiences in developing the experimental HIerarchical Software Processor (HISP) during the last four years. In this paper, however, the method is described in a general setting. This method appears to be applicable to a broad class of functional software systems.
 We first describe the words “functional” and “hierarchical”. Then the hierarchical structuring method is presented. Some applications of this method are also discussed. In particular, an example of transformational programming based on this structuring method is presented. The truncated syntax diagrams of the HISP language are also given as an appendix.
