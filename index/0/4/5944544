We present a method for Noun Phrase chunking in Hebrew. We show that the traditional definition of base-NPs as non-recursive noun phrases does not apply in Hebrew, and propose an alternative definition of Simple NPs. We review syntactic properties of Hebrew related to noun phrases, which indicate that the task of Hebrew SimpleNP chunking is harder than base-NP chunking in English. As a confirmation, we apply methods known to work well for English to Hebrew data. These methods give low results (F from 76 to 86) in Hebrew. We then discuss our method, which applies SVM induction over lexical and morphological features. Morphological features improve the average precision by ~0.5%, recall by ~1%, and F-measure by ~0.75, resulting in a system with average performance of 93% precision, 93.4% recall and 93.2 F-measure.
