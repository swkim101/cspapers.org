REPGRID-NET: A NEIWORKING SUPPORT SYSTEM RepGrid-Net is a computer-based message system that integrates conventional electronic mail and bulletin board facilities with repertory grid elicitation and analysis facilities to provide both unstructured and structured communications supporting the formation and operation of special interest networks. Users see a mail system in which special-interest networks are specifically supported. The coordinators of such a network provide a basic focus for it through statements of inten~ topics and issues which are handled on a bulletin board basis. They also provide one or more kernel grids listing specific topics and the concepts which they apply to them. These kernel grids can be developed by others interested in the groups, using the stated topics and concepts, and adding to them. General similarities between grids are analyzed to provide a socionet of people with common viewpoints, and this may be used to access the mail system to communicate with them. Detailed comparisons of similarities and differences between viewpoints may be made, and individual concept structures can be analyzed. —— Is!!!! I1%%%’”1
