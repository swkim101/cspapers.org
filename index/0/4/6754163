An algorithm for generating the possible quantifier scopings for a sentence, in order of preference, is outlined. The scoping assigned to a quantifier is determined by its interactions with other quantifiers, modals, negation, and certain syntactic-constituent boundaries. When a potential scoping is logically equivalent to another, the less preferred one is discarded.The relative scoping preferences of the individual quantifiers are not embedded in the algorithm, but are specified by a set of rules. Many of the rules presented here have appeared in the linguistics literature and have been used in various natural language processing systems. However, the co-ordination of these rules and the resulting coverage represents a significant contribution. Because experimental data on human quantifier-scoping preferences are still fragmentary, we chose to design a system in which the set of preference rules could be easily modified and expanded.The algorithm described has been implemented in Prolog as part of a larger natural language processing system. Extensions of this algorithm are in progress.
