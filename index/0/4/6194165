This paper presents a novel approach to camera calibration that improves final accuracy with respect to standard methods using precision planar targets, even if now inaccurate, unmeasured, roughly planar targets can be used. The work builds on a recent trend in camera calibration, namely concurrent optimization of scene structure together with the intrinsic camera parameters [4, 8, 1]. A novel formulation is presented that allows maximum likelihood estimation in the case of inaccurate targets, as it extends the camera extrinsic parameters into a tight parametrization of the whole scene structure. It furthermore observes the special characteristics of multi-view perspective projection of planar targets. Its natural extensions to stereo camera calibration and hand-eye calibration are also presented. Experiments demonstrate improvements in the parametrization of the camera model as well as in eventual stereo reconstruction.
