Protection of data against unauthorized access (read or write operations) as currently practised in data base systems is too crude a measure to be effective in an environment with a large diversity of progmms for evaluating the data base. Too restrictive a protection prohibits the application of all but the simplest programs, while too broad an authorization allows wide latitude in programs but may open up too many data to individual inspection. The most obvious way to solve this dilemma is for the protection to take the program within which the data is used into consideration. It is shown that a number of measures must accompany this solution in order to be effective: a method base, the control of sets of data, and a hierarchical system structure. Some fundamental problems are outlined and some technical solutions are proposed. In particular, the type of facilities provided by the data base system has an influence on the efficiency of the protection mechanism.
