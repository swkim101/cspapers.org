Probabilistic expert systems based on Bayesian networks (BNs) require initial specification of both a qualitative graphical structure and quantitative assessment of conditional probability tables. This paper considers statistical batch learning of the probability tables on the basis of incomplete data and expert knowledge. The EM algorithm with a generalized conjugate gradient acceleration method has been dedicated to quantification of BNs by maximum posterior likelihood estimation for a super-class of the recursive graphical models. This new class of models allows a great variety of local functional restrictions to be imposed on the statistical model, which hereby extents the control and applicability of the constructed method for quantifying BNs.
