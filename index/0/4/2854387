Pneumatic actuators have inherent compliance and hence they are very interesting for applications involving interaction with environment or human. But controlling such kind of actuators is not trivial. The paper presents an implementation of iterative Linear Quadratic regulator (iLQR) based optimal control framework to control an anthropomorphic arm with each joint actuated by an agonist-antagonistic pair of Mckibben artificial muscles. The method is applied to positioning tasks and generation of explosive movements by maximizing the link speed. It is then compared to traditional control strategies to justify that optimal control is effective in controlling the position in highly non-linear pneumatic systems. Also the importance of varying compliance is highlighted by repeating the tasks at different compliance level. The algorithm validation is reported here by several simulations and hardware experiments in which the shoulder and elbow flexion are controlled simultaneously.
