Standard ML is a state of the art functional programming language, with features that make it excellent for teaching recursion and problem solving at the introductory level. Among the many pedagogically interesting characteristics of ML are its simple and uniform syntax, its type polymorphism and type inferencing system, and datatype declaration facilities. With little formal ML instruction, after several weeks first year students were able to use recursively defined data structures and to define fairly powerful recursive functions in ML. Standard ML is highly recommended as a tool for teaching recursive problem solving in the context of a course on the foundations of computer science.
