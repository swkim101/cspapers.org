A UAV navigation system relying on GPS is vulnerable to signal failure, making a drift free backup system necessary. We introduce a vision based geo-referencing system that uses pre-existing maps to reduce the long term drift. The system classifies an image according to its environmental content and thereafter matches it to an environmentally classified map over the operational area. This map matching provides a measurement of the absolute location of the UAV, that can easily be incorporated into a sensor fusion framework. Experiments show that the geo-referencing system reduces the long term drift in UAV navigation, enhancing the ability of the UAV to navigate accurately over large areas without the use of GPS.
