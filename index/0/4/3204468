The location-based social networks (LBSN) facilitate users to check-in their current location and share it with other users. The accumulated check-in data can be employed for the benefit of users by providing personalized recommendations. In this paper, we propose a random walk based context-aware friend recommendation algorithm (RWCFR). RWCFR considers the current context (i.e. current social relations, personal preferences and current location) of the user to provide personalized recommendations. Our LBSN model is an undirected unweighted graph model that represents users, locations, and their relationships. We build a graph according to the current context of the user depending on this LBSN model. In order to rank the recommendation scores of the users for friend recommendation, a random walk with restart approach is employed. We compare RWCFR with popularity-based, friend-based and expert-based baseline approaches. According to the results, our friend recommendation algorithm outperforms these approaches in all the tests.
