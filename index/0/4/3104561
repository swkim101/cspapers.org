Model merging is an important activity in software development. We often need to integrate a set of models coming from different sources so as to create a unified model encompassing all the given models. Inconsistencies between models can make model merging significantly more complex. To deal with inconsistencies efficiently, a systematic negotiation process is needed. This paper outlines a formal approach to merging and negotiation over behavioural models and presents the results achieved so far.
