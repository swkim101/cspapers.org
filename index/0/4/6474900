A typical instrument for different tasks in minimally invasive surgery is a flexible endoscope. To overcome the problem of restricted motion of today's systems, a hyper-redundant active shaft concept is developed. It features good resistance with respect to manipulation forces through its unique binary, electromagnetic actuation concept. With an active control of each element of the hyper-redundant endoscope shaft and in combination with automated feed motion, it is controlled in a “follow-the-leader” fashion. In general, this approach is characterized by very good path following capabilities. However, due to its binary actuation concept, joint angles cannot be interpolated continuously. Therefore, an adaption to binary actuation with optimized switching sequences to achieve an appropriate path following performance despite of the restricted motion is proposed.
