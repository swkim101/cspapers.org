ClassQue is a classroom response system that goes beyond clickers to allow a wide selection of classroom interactions: teacher to individual student, teacher to all students, student to teacher and student to student. Questions are not restricted to multiple choice, and multiple questions can be pending at one time. One student can anonymously comment on another student's answer. After the class, students and teachers can receive reports of the classroom interactions. The current version of ClassQue is available for use in an environment in which each student is seated at a computer.
