We address here a sensor-based navigation system to safely drive vehicles in realistic scenarios. The system is composed of three modules with the following functionalities: model builder, planning and reactive motion. These modules are integrated within a planner-reactor architecture that supervises and coordinates them in order to carry out the motion task. The advantage of our system is to achieve a robust and trustworthy navigation in difficult scenarios, which remain troublesome for many of the existing systems. In order to validate the system, we present experiments with a wheelchair vehicle transporting a human among locations in an office type scenario.
