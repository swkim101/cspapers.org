Adaptive-granularity memory architectures have been considered mainly because of main memory bottleneck and power efficiency. Meanwhile, highly reliable protection schemes are getting popular especially in large computing systems. Unfortunately, conventional ECC mechanisms including Chipkill require a large number of symbols to guarantee strong protection with acceptable overhead. We propose a novel memory protection scheme called CLEAN (Chipkill-LEvel reliable and Access granularity Negotiable), which enables us to balance the contradicting demands of fine-grained (FG) access and strong & efficient ECC. To close a potentially significant detection coverage gap due to CLEAN's detection mechanism coupled with permanent faults, we design a simple mechanism access granularity enforcement. By enforcing coarse-grained (CG) access, we can get only the advantage of higher protection comparable to Chipkill instead of achieving the adaptive access granularity together. CLEAN showed Chipkill level reliability as well as improvement in performance, system and memory power efficiency by up to 11.8%, 10.8% and 64.9% with mixes of SPEC2006 benchmarks.
