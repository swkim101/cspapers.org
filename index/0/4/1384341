Digital technologies are increasingly an ubiquitous part of everyday communication. These technologies offer contact with friends and family that is both persistent and pervasive. Social ties that at one time would have gone dormant, or vanished entirely, are now made persistent through social media. As we transition through different jobs, neighborhoods, schools, and communities our social ties remain. Contact is no longer reliant on the occasional phone call and holiday card, but has a persistent presence on our screens and through our mobile devices. What are the benefits and the consequences of being connected? Are our relationships more committed? What impact will these emerging developments in computing have for society? It has been said that these technologies offer new opportunities for democratic participation, that they support collective action, and give marginalized individuals a voice. Social capital, once lost through the dormancy of ties, hidden as a result of infrequent contact, can be made visible through the persistent and pervasive nature of these new media. Yet, the practice of social media may not live up to its hype; they may contribute to social isolation, stress, and disengagement. Based on a series of large-scale studies of where people connect, who they connect with, and what they discuss, this presentation explores contradictory evidence of how digital technologies are related to social capital, democratic engagement, and the fear and joy that we may all be missing out.
