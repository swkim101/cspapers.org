Algorithms under this setting sometimes have many advantages over those under the setting where data is partitioned on samples, especially when the number of features is huge. Therefore, it is important to understand the inherent limitations of these optimization problems. In this paper, with certain restrictions on the communication allowed in the procedures, we develop tight lower bounds on communication rounds for a broad class of non-incremental algorithms under this setting. We also provide a lower bound on communication rounds for a class of (randomized) incremental algorithms.
