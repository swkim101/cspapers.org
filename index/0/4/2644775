This paper proposes an automatic method of detecting grammar elements that decrease readability in a Japanese sentence. The method consists of two components: (1) the check list of the grammar elements that should be detected; and (2) the detector, which is a search program of the grammar elements from a sentence. By defining a readability level for every grammar element, we can find which part of the sentence is difficult to read.
