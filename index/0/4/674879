In this paper, we describe an integrated strategy for planning, perception, state-estimation and action in complex mobile manipulation domains. The strategy is based on planning in the belief space of probability distribution over states. Our planning approach is based on hierarchical symbolic regression (pre-image back-chaining). We develop a vocabulary of fluents that describe sets of belief states, which are goals and subgoals in the planning process. We show that a relatively small set of symbolic operators lead to task-oriented perception in support of the manipulation goals.
