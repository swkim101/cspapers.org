We present new algorithms, based on random sampling, that find maximum flows in undirected uncapacitated graphs. Our algorithms dominate augmenting paths over all parameter values (number of vertices and edges and flow value). They also dominate blocking flows over a large range of parameter values. Furthermore, they achieve time bounds on graphs with parallel (equivalently, capacitated) edges that previously could only be achieved on graphs without them. The key contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that such an improvement is possible. This shows that augmenting paths and blocking flows are non-optimal, and reopens the question of how fast we can find a maximum flow. We improve known time bounds by only a small (but polynomial) factor, and the complicated nature of our algorithms suggests they will not be practical. A new idea of our algorithm is to find flow by diminishing cuts instead of augmenting paths. Rather than finding a way to push flow from the source to the sink, we identify and delete edges that are not needed in a maximum flow. When no more edges can be deleted, we know that every remaining edge must be saturated to give a maximum flow.
