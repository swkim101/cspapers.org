Reading has been studied for decades, yet no theories exist which completely explain it. In particular, a type of knowledge intensive reading, creative reading, has been practically ignored. Creative reading is the reading of texts which contain novel concepts. Nearly all reading will be creative to some degree; thus, any theory which overlooks this will be incomplete. By combining results from psychology, artificial intelligence, and education, we have produced a functional theory of the complete reading process, aimed at explaining creative reading.
