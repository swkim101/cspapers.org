An appealing strategy for supporting <i>specialization</i> of an <i>object-oriented framework</i> is to adopt a <i>domain-specific modeling</i> approach, where a domain metamodel and a code generator are <i>manually</i> developed to support <i>model-driven</i> framework specialization. Our research advocates that this support can be <i>automated</i> by having an additional specialization layer in the framework.
