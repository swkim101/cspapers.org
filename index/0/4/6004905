In this paper we present a novel filtering system, based on a new model which reshapes the aims of content-based filtering. The filtering system has been developed within the EC project PENG, aimed at providing news professionals, such as journalists, with a system supporting both filtering and retrieval capabilities. In particular, we suggest that in tackling the problem of information overload, it is necessary for filtering systems to take into account multiple aspects of incoming documents in order to estimate their relevance to a user's profile, and in order to help users better understand documents, as distinct from solely attempting to either select relevant material from a stream, or block inappropriate material. Aiming to so this, a filtering model based on multiple criteria has been defined, based on the ideas gleamed in the project requirements stage. The filtering model is briefly described in this paper.
