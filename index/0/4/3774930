In this paper, we present the design and implementation of our expertise oriented search system, EOS http://www.arnetminer.net. EOS is a researcher social network system. It has gathered information about a half-million computer science researchers from the Web and constructed a social network among the researchers through their co-authorship. In particular, the relationship in the social network information is used in both ranking experts for a given topic and searching for associations between researchers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods for expert finding and association search in a social network are both more effective and efficient than the baseline methods.
