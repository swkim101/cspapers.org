Many curricular guidelines, such as the Recommended Curriculum for Computer Science at Liberal Arts Colleges [4], suggest that students be exposed to many different programming paradigms (e.g., imperative, functional, object-oriented, declarative) in the undergraduate curriculum. Some institutions believe that students should have early exposure to many paradigms, often as early as the first two courses.Many institutions emphasize object-oriented programming early in the curriculum. Some also include functional programming. Imperative topics are often covered in courses that emphasize object-oriented or functional issues. Where does declarative programming fit? Sometimes not until an upper-level language paradigms course or artificial intelligence course. Sometimes it never fits, at least not explicitly.
