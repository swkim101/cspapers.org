This work presents a software architecture that is especially useful for managing the evolution of web applications. Web-based systems are a range of applications for which there are no technological standards and new concepts and tools are currently under evolution. Examples of this lack of standards include the transition from CGI scripts to Java Servlets and to Java Server Pages (JSP). Therefore, the maintenance and evolution of web applications is an important topic for software developers and the software research community. The proposed architecture combines the n-tier, broker, and blackboard architectural patterns.
