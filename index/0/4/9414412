One challenging problem for biomedical text retrieval is to find accurate synonyms or name variants for biomedical entities. In this paper, we propose a new concept-based approach to tackle this problem. In this approach, a set of concepts instead of keywords will be extracted from a query first. Then these concepts will be used for retrieval purpose. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can boost the retrieval performance and it generates very good results on 2005 TREC Genomics data sets.
