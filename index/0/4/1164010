Force-based reasoning, for identifying a cluster of parts that can be decomposed naturally by the applied force, plays an important role in selecting feasible subassemblies and analyzing subassembly stability in assembly planning. This is because force-based reasoning provides a new set of constraints which are distinctive from those from geometric reasoning. Such constraints not only enhance the planning efficiency but also allows stability analysis in terms of subassembly deformation due to the mating forces. Specifically, force-based reasoning can be applied during subassembly identification to eliminate unstable subassemblies that are deformable during the mating operation.
