In this paper, we propose a three-phase method to address the problem of identifying review spammer groups and individual spammers, who get paid for posting fake comments. We evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the approach on a real-life online shopping review dataset from amazon.com. The experimental result shows that our model achieved comparable or better performance than previous work on spammer detection.
