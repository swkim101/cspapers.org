Relevance feedback is an appreciated process to produce increasingly better retrieval. Usually, positive feedback plays a fundamental role in the feedback process whereas the role of negative feedback is limited. We think that negative feedback is a promising precision oriented mechanism and we propose a logical framework in which positive and negative feedback are homogeneously modeled. Evaluation results against small test collections are provided.
