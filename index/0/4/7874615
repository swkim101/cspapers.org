This paper proposes a generic framework for monitoring continuous spatial queries over moving objects. The framework distinguishes itself from existing work by being the first to address the location update issue and to provide a common interface for monitoring mixed types of queries. Based on the notion of safe region, the client location update strategy is developed based on the queries being monitored. Thus, it significantly reduces the wireless communication and query reevaluation costs required to maintain the up-to-date query results. We propose algorithms for query evaluation/reevaluation and for safe region computation in this framework. Enhancements are also proposed to take advantage of two practical mobility assumptions: maximum speed and steady movement. The experimental results show that our framework substantially outperforms the traditional periodic monitoring scheme in terms of monitoring accuracy and CPU time while achieving a close-to-optimal wireless communication cost. The framework also can scale up to a large monitoring system and is robust under various object mobility patterns.
