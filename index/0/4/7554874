Reorganization of classes for object-oriented programming and object-oriented databa.se design ha,s recently received considerable a.ttention in the literature. In this paper a small set of primitive transformations is presented which forms a.n orthogonal ba,sis for object-preserving class reorganizations. This set is proven to be correct, complet,e, and minimal. The primitive transforma.tions help form a theoretical basis for cla.ss orgxlization and are a powerful tool for reasoning about particular organizations.
