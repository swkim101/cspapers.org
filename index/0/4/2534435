This paper presents an efficient DNN design with stochastic computing. Observing that directly adopting stochastic computing to DNN has some challenges including random error fluctuation, range limitation, and overhead in accumulation, we address these problems by removing near-zero weights, applying weight-scaling, and integrating the activation function with the accumulator. The approach allows an easy implementation of early decision termination with a fixed hardware design by exploiting the progressive precision characteristics of stochastic computing, which was not easy with existing approaches. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the conventional binary logic in terms of gate area, latency, and power consumption.
