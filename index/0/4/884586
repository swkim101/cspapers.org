Autonomous, vision-based quadrotor flight is widely regarded as a challenging perception and control problem since the accuracy of a flight maneuver is strongly influenced by the quality of the on-board state estimate. In addition, any vision-based state estimator can fail due to the lack of visual information in the scene or due to the loss of feature tracking after an aggressive maneuver. When this happens, the robot should automatically re-initialize the state estimate to maintain its autonomy and, thus, guarantee the safety for itself and the environment. In this paper, we present a system that enables a monocular-vision-based quadrotor to automatically recover from any unknown, initial attitude with significant velocity, such as after loss of visual tracking due to an aggressive maneuver. The recovery procedure consists of multiple stages, in which the quadrotor, first, stabilizes its attitude and altitude, then, re-initializes its visual state-estimation pipeline before stabilizing fully autonomously. To experimentally demonstrate the performance of our system, we aggressively throw the quadrotor in the air by hand and have it recover and stabilize all by itself. We chose this example as it simulates conditions similar to failure recovery during aggressive flight. Our system was able to recover successfully in several hundred throws in both indoor and outdoor environments.
