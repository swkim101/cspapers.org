Climate change can directly impact agriculture. Failure in different aspects of agriculture due to climate change and other influencing factors, are extremely rampant in several agrarian economies, most of which go unnoticed. In this paper, we describe the design of a system that mines disparate information sources on the Web to automatically summarize important climatic and agricultural trends for any specific location and construct a location-specific climatic and agricultural information portal. We have evaluated the system across 605 different districts in India. The results revealed a pan-India scenario of different problem affected areas. The key findings from this work include, around 64.58% of the districts of India suffer from soil related issues and 76.02% have water related problems. We have also manually validated the authenticity of our information sources and validated our summarized results for specific locations with findings in reputed journals and authoritative sources.
