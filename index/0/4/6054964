The ultimate goal of computer design is to satisfy the end-user. In particular computing domains, such as interactive applications, there exists a variation in user expectations and user satisfaction relative to the performance of existing computer systems. In this work, we leverage this variation to develop more efficient architectures that are customized to end-users. We first investigate the relationship between microarchitectural parameters and user satisfaction. Specifically, we analyze the relationship between hardware performance counter (HPC) readings and individual satisfaction levels reported by users for representative applications. Our results show that the satisfaction of the user is strongly correlated to the performance of the underlying hardware. More importantly, the results show that user satisfaction is highly user-dependent. To take advantage of these observations, we develop a framework called Individualized Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (iDVFS). We study a group of users to characterize the relationship between the HPCs and individual user satisfaction levels. Based on this analysis, we use artificial neural networks to model the function from HPCs to user satisfaction for individual users. This model is then used online to predict user satisfaction and set the frequency level accordingly. A second set of user studies demonstrates that iDVFS reduces the CPU power consumption by over 25% in representative applications as compared to the Windows XP DVFS algorithm.
