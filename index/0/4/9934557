In this methodology paper we define a metric we call impact ratio. We use this ratio to measure the effectiveness of inspections and other evaluative techniques in getting usability improvements into products. We inspected ten commercial software products and achieved an average impact ratio of 78%. We discuss factors affecting this ratio and its value in helping us to appraise usability engineering's impact on products.
