As a large-scale space structure, the authors propose a space multibody structure that consists of many relatively small bodies mutually connected by passive joints. They assume that one of the bodies is equipped with an orientation-control device, such as control momentum wheels. Being free from elasticity-induced vibration is an advantage of the structure. The authors analyze the dynamics of nonholonomic behavior of the structure and propose a control scheme to stabilize its shape.
