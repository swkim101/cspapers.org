The human arterial tree consists of a complex network of branching blood vessels leading from the heart to arterioles, capillaries, and venules - comprising the microcirculation. The numerical simulation of the blood flow in a single part of the human arterial tree requires hundreds of CPUs; a full human arterial tree will require thousands of CPUs. Nowadays, we can use geographically distributed supercomputers connected by a fast network to perform large-scale simulations.Nektar-G2 is the grid-enabled version of Nektar, software developed at Brown University, that allows to solve problems on geographically distributed supercomputers. The topology-aware feature of MPICH-G2 is utilized to enforce an efficient data distribution strategy. Multi-level message passing algorithms minimizes the inter-site communication. Our ultimate goal is to model blood flow interaction of different regions of the cardiovascular system and to establish a biomechanics gateway on the TeraGrid.During poster presentation we will present results of ongoing project.
