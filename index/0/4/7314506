Recently there have been many collections of relational data in diverse areas such as the internet, social networks, customer shopping records, bioinformatics, etc. The main goal of the relational data analysis is to discover latent structure from the data. The conventional data mining algorithms based on exhaustive enumeration have an inherent limitation for this purpose because of the combinatorial nature of the methods. In contrast, in machine learning a lot of statistical models have been proposed for the relational data analysis. In this talk, first I will review the statistical approach, especially Bayesian approach, for the relational data analysis with recent advancements in machine learning literature. Then, as a future research I will also talk about a statistical approach for combining multiple relational data.
