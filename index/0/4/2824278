State-of-the-art bootstrapping systems rely on expert-crafted semantic constraints such as negative categories to reduce semantic drift. Unfortunately, their use introduces a substantial amount of supervised knowledge. We present the Relation Guided Bootstrapping (RGB) algorithm, which simultaneously extracts lexicons and open relationships to guide lexicon growth and reduce semantic drift. This removes the necessity for manually crafting category and relationship constraints, and manually generating negative categories.
