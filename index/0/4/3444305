The cloud database services are attractive for managing outsourced databases. However, the data security and privacy is a big concern hampering the acceptance of cloud database services. A straightforward way to address this concern is to encrypt the database, but an encrypted database cannot be easily queried. In this demo paper, we demonstrate that aggregate SQL queries with range conditions can be performed efficiently over encrypted databases, without decrypting the databases first, by using our new homomorphic encryption scheme. The techniques in this paper can be applied to existing Database Management Systems (DBMSs). Moreover, the techniques do not need to predetermine the maximum sum and number of data in one database table column. These features make our technologies suitable to manage long-standing and large encrypted databases.
