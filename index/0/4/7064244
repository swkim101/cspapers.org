The goal of this set of this demonstration presentation is to describe a set of visualizations that underline the importance of appropriate data visualizations in particular contexts. The goal is to showcase different types of visualizations, and illustrate how emerging media technology can be utilized for this purpose. First, we showcase "The UX-Machine", which is a tool for visualizing bio-feedback data; second, we illustrate a visualization of a cultural photographic collection; third, we present Cognitive Big Data as emerging new technology in the domain of Big Data, and fourth present visualization as a matter of communication and culture. The goal of this paper is to introduce and describe the key aspects of visualization on some concrete examples. The demonstrators should also illustrate the use of emerging media technology as part of advanced concepts for data visualization.
