The University of Minnesota's Scout robot is a small cylindrical robot capable of rolling and jumping. In this paper, models describing the robot's motion under its mode of actuation are developed. These models can be employed for Scout motion prediction and simulation. The models suggest that the determining factor of the Scout's behavior is the length of the winch cable. The validity of the models is verified with empirical data.
