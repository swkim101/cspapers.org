This paper presents an outline of a theory of agency that seeks to integrate ongoing understanding, planning and activity into a single model of representation and processing. Our model of agency rises out of three basic pieces of work: Schank's structural model of memory organization (Schank, 1982), Hammond's work in case-based planning and dependency directed repair (Hammond, 1989d), and Martin's work in Direct Memory Access Parsing (Martin 1990). We see this paper as a first step in the production of a memory-based theory of agency: the active pursuit of goals in the face of a changing environment, that can exist within the computational constraints of a computer model.
