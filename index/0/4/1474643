The inference capabilities of humans suggest that they might be using algorithms with high degrees of parallelism. This paper develops a completely parallel connectionist inference mechanism. The mechanism handles obvious inferences, where each clause is only used once, but may be extendable to harder cases. The main contribution of this paper is to show formally that some inference can be reduced to an energy minimization problem in a way that is potentially useful.
