The paper gives an overview of the data base design process. It claims that a practically useful, well integrated theory of data base design is clearly within reach. The following problem areas are touched upon in the paper: the purpose and role of a data base, user participation, reality modeling, information needs and observation possibilities, data base modeling, design of file structures and access paths, data base integrity, concurrency problems, confidentiality, evaluation and maintenance, data base administration, meta-data bases, and strategies for "going data base" in an organization.
