As a dialog progresses the objects and actions that are most relevant to the conversation, and hence in the focus of attention of the dialog participants, change. This paper describes a representation of focus for language understanding systems, emphasizing its use in understanding task-oriented dialogs. The representation highlights that part of the knowledge base relevant at a given point in a dialog. A model of the task is used both to structure the focus representation and to provide an index into potentially relevant concepts in the knowledge base The use of the focus representation to make retrieval of items from the knowledge base more efficient is described.
