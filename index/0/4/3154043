A decentralized controller is presented that causes a network of robots to converge to a near optimal sensing configuration, while simultaneously learning the distribution of sensory information in the environment. A consensus (or flocking) term is introduced in the learning law to allow sharing of parameters among neighbors, greatly increasing learning convergence rates. Convergence and consensus is proven using a Lyapunov-type proof. The controller with parameter consensus is shown to perform better than the basic controller in numerical simulations.
