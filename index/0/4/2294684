A 550 MHz 64 b PowerPC processor was developed for fabrication in Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) technology from a processor previously designed and fabricated in bulk CMOS. Both the design and the associated CAD methodology (point tools, flow, and models) were modified to handle demands specific to SOI technology. The challenge was to improve the cycle time by adapting the circuit design, timing, and chip integration methodologies to accommodate effects unique to SOI.
