This paper describes the application of a sequential logic fault analyzer computer program to the problem of logic circuit module tests for the CONTROL DATAÂ® 7600 computer. A description of the sequential fault analyzer is provided first. Next, the software system built around this fault analyzer is outlined. The development of test sequences for 231 logic module types used in the 7600 computer is considered. Block diagrams of the test fixtures used at the manufacturing facility and to supplement field maintenance are provided and explained. Preliminary results of the application of fault analyzer developed tests are reported.
