Views are an important feature of database systems to provide abstraction and guarantee a certain level of security. The problem of updating a database through view updates is well-established and has been widely studied in the context of relational databases. This work tries to point out what complications arise when considering the view-update problem in an XML setting and what research questions come up. Since both views and updates on XML are not yet completely understood, we first give some hints at the implications of design choices made in the construction of languages for both defining views and updating XML.
