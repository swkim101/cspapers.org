The purpose of this paper is to define a method of adding extensibility to programming languages and to demonstrate the advantages of extensibility. The paper describes a method of adding ldquo;abstract data and operators‚Äù to a language. This aids in the design, debugging, monitoring, and optimization of the program. By allowing the programmer to use the data constructs which fit his problem, the design and coding of the algorithm are integrated. Effective monitoring of the code is accomplished by using the newly defined operator entry and exit points as probe points. After initial debugging, the program can be optimized without changing any code by improving the implementation of the data type representation and by implementing important operators in micro-code.
