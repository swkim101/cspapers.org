Since teleoperation systems are mostly executed in the extreme environment, there are constraints in designing the mechanism and choosing sensors. This paper presents a novel quantitative comparison method of teleoperators based on H/sub /spl infin// framework. The upper H/sub /spl infin// norm bound of the system including H/sub /spl infin// sub optimal controller is used as the performance index. As a case study, the method is applied to a real teleoperation system to study the effects of sensory configuration and back-drivability of the mechanism on the performance of the system in tasks, which involve different environment impedances. It can be important criteria to design a teleoperator from the control point of view.
