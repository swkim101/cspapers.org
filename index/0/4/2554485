An important factor in the development of such systems is reducing the time and cost overheads in manually creating content for these scenarios. To address this challenge, we present ScenarioGen, an automatic method for generating content about everyday activities through combining computer science techniques with the crowd. ScenarioGen uses the crowd in three different ways: to capture a database of scenarios of everyday activities, to generate a database of likely replacements for specific events within that scenario, and to evaluate the resulting scenarios. We evaluated ScenarioGen in 6 different content domains and found that it was consistently rated as coherent and consistent as the originally captured content. We also compared ScenarioGen's content to that created by traditional planning techniques. We found that both methods were equally effective in generating coherent and consistent scenarios, yet ScenarioGen's content was found to be more varied and easier to create.
