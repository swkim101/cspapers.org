In states, school districts, individual schools, and alone in classrooms, educators are providing access to computer science (CS) for more students than ever before. Many are learning as they go. Education leaders and teachers are finding effective tools for hurdles to expanding CS access through their own experiences, formal and informal networks, and partnerships with external organizations. However, much is known in the education policy community which can be applied to CS for All efforts. This poster presents the framework for a doctoral dissertation which examines the implementation of a CS for All policy using a policy implementation lens. The site of the study is a school district that was an early adopter of CS for All; Computational thinking activities were inserted into K-8 classrooms and all high schools introduced accessible and rigorous CS classes. The "story" of this district provides both models and cautions for those undertaking CS for All initiatives. Replicating implementation is unrealistic since educational environments are unique and complex. The questions inspiring this work are not about how to implement a CS for All policy, but rather about the conditions under which CS for All policy was implemented in this school district (Honig, 2006). The framework presented is developed from education implementation literature with consideration for the challenges unique to CS for All. Those working in CS education will identify how their experiences fit into the framework and can use it to move their own work ahead.
