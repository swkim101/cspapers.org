In this paper we propose an approach that enables mobile clients to determine the validity of previous queries based on their current locations. In order to make this possible, the server returns in addition to the query result, a validity region around the client's location within which the result remains the same. We focus on two of the most common spatial query types, namely nearest neighbor and window queries, define the validity region in each case and propose the corresponding query processing algorithms. In addition, we provide analytical models for estimating the expected size of the validity region. Our techniques can significantly reduce the number of queries issued to the server, while introducing minimal computational and network overhead compared to traditional spatial queries.
