Logic grid puzzle is a genre of logic puzzles in which we are given (in a natural language) a scenario, the object to be deduced and certain clues. The reader has to figure out the solution using the clues provided and some generic domain constraints. In this paper, we present a system, LOGICIA, that takes a logic grid puzzle and the set of elements in the puzzle and tries to solve it by translating it to the knowledge representation and reasoning language of Answer Set Programming (ASP) and then using an ASP solver. The translation to ASP involves extraction of entities and their relations from the clues. For that we use a novel learning based approach which uses varied supervision, including the entities present in a clue and the expected representation of a clue in ASP. Our system, LOGICIA, learns to automatically translate a clue with 81.11% accuracy and is able to solve 71% of the problems of a corpus. This is the first learning system that can solve logic grid puzzles described in natural language in a fully automated manner. The code and the data will be made publicly available at http://bioai.lab . asu.edu/logicgridpuzzles.
