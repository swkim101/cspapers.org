We propose a method for automatically labelling topics learned via LDA topic models. We generate our label candidate set from the top-ranking topic terms, titles of Wikipedia articles containing the top-ranking topic terms, and sub-phrases extracted from the Wikipedia article titles. We rank the label candidates using a combination of association measures and lexical features, optionally fed into a supervised ranking model. Our method is shown to perform strongly over four independent sets of topics, significantly better than a benchmark method.
