In this paper we address the problem of object retrieval based on scale-space interest points, namely top-points. The original retrieval algorithm can only cope with scale-Euclidean transformations. We extend the algorithm to the case of non-rigid transformations like affine and perspective transformations and investigate its robustness. The proposed algorithm is proven to be highly robust under various degrading factors, such as noise, occlusion, rendering artifacts, etc. and can deal with multiple occurrences of the object.
