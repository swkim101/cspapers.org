Quick motion and soft touch control are important for autonomous grasping. To perform a grasping action, a hand must adjust its fingertips to match the object shape. It is also necessary to reduce the fingertip velocity on contact with the object. We propose a method of fingertip velocity control for fast approach and slow contact using proximity sensors installed on fingertips. The proposed control reduces the fingertip velocity at contact, decreasing the change of impulse force and thus making it appropriate for grasping soft or fragile objects. The proposed control uses time-to-contact (TTC), which is converted from sensor output. It is known that many animals, including humans, use TTC for collision avoidance. TTC represents the remaining time until collision considering the rate change of a control variable. We carried out grasping tests on various common objects using TTC. Experimental results show that the proposed control realizes fingertip alignment perpendicular to unknown shapes and surface objects and lowers the velocity at contact.
