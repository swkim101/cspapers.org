Passive brain-computer interfaces, in which implicit input is derived from a user's changing brain activity without conscious effort from the user, may be one of the most promising applications of brain-computer interfaces because they can improve user performance without additional effort on the user's part. I seek to use physiological signals that correlate to particular brain states in order to adapt an interface while the user behaves normally. My research aims to develop strategies to adapt the interface to the user and the user's cognitive state using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive, lightweight brain-sensing technique. While passive brain-computer interfaces are currently being developed and researchers have shown their utility, there has been little effort to develop a framework or hierarchy for adaptation strategies.
