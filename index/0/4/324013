Current trends in database systems include the incorporation of parallel processing; objectrelational capabilities; support for data warehousing, data mining, and OLAP. The typical hardware systems on which such database systems are being implemented include SMP’s, MPP’s, clusters, 64bit processors, disk caches, and RAID and other high availability configurations. In addition, as database technology and products have matured, they have been employed in a wide range of traditional business applications including transaction processing, decision support, and OLAP, as well as newer, emerging applications which require, for example, handling of multimedia and spatial data; handling historical data and providing support for tertiary storage; and dealing with multiple, heterogeneous data sources.
