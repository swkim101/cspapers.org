The past few years have seen a proliferation in the number of Local Area Networks (LANs) installed worldwide. This development has resulted largely from advances in workstation technology and innovations in the design and performance of various communication protocols, which have become the building blocks of distributed computing environments. These advances have also affected the ways in which LANs have been used. Initial applications of LANs were remote terminal access and fiie transfer; then came diskless workstations and distributed processing. Today we have a new network-oriented, windowed user interface standard: the X Window System. As each of these networking environments was introduced, numerous researchers reviewed the performance implications of the environment on the network. The study presented in this paper investigates whether or not the Ethernet will be a performance bottleneck in the distributed DECwindows computing environment.
