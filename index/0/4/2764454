Despite the promising properties of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), its integration with Transport Layer Security (TLS), has not been explored yet. We then present a PUF based machine to machine (M2M) authentication extension for TLS. An Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol termed DHZKP based on PUF is designed. We develop this protocol as a TLS extension, and prove its security.
