Even with the adoption of the latest OLED technology, the display panel remains one of the most power-hungry components in smart-phones. Existing attempts for OLED power optimization have mainly focused on modifying the content that is shown on the display during the playback phase, requiring significant overhead in terms of image analysis and modification. While such methods are effective, they overlook opportunities present during the camera recording phase, where utilization of already determined camera parameters could reduce or eliminate the image processing overhead. Hence, we proposed MORPh, a cross-layer optimization system for OLED. We first analyze three fundamental parameters extracted from the smartphone camera and their impact on OLED power consumption and visual quality. We then define corresponding metrics to assess power optimization potentials, and propose a set of algorithms that optimize camera recording to be more OLED friendly. Finally, the proposed schemes are realized as part of a video recording and playback application on an existing Android smartphone. The experiments results indicate power saving of 7.3%~39.7%, and 20.3% on average while maintaining perceived visual quality.
