In this paper we discuss how the combination of modern technologies in “big data” storage and management, knowledge representation and processing, cloud-based computation, and web technology can help the robotics community to establish and strengthen an open research discipline. We describe how we made the demonstrator of a EU project review openly available to the research community. Specifically, we recorded episodic memories with rich semantic annotations during a pizza preparation experiment in autonomous robot manipulation. Afterwards, we released them as an open knowledge base using the cloud- and web-based robot knowledge service OPENEASE. We discuss several ways on how this open data can be used to validate our experimental reports and to tackle novel challenging research problems.
