Social media has great potential as a means to enable civil protection and law enforcement agencies to more effectively tackle disasters and emergencies. However, there is currently a lack of tools that enable civil protection agencies to easily make use of social media. The Emergency Analysis Identification and Management System (EAIMS) is a prototype service that provides real-time detection of emergency events, related information finding and credibility analysis tools for use over social media during emergencies. This system exploits machine learning over data gathered from past emergencies and disasters to build effective models for identifying new events as they occur, tracking developments within those events and analyzing those developments for the purposes of enhancing the decision making processes of emergency response agencies.
