This paper discusses recent developments in sensors for the Harvard RoboBee. The RoboBee is a sub-100 mg flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicle that is able to lift its own weight under external power, but, like flying insects, is unstable in flight without active feedback. We discuss design and characterization of two low-latency insect-inspired sensors for flight control: an antenna to sense airspeed and light-sensing ocelli to estimate attitude angle relative to a luminous sky. We demonstrate accurate wind velocity estimation in a wind tunnel despite the effect of nearby flapping wings.We also demonstrate pitch angle control using the ocelli on a wire-mounted RoboBee that is free to rotate about its pitch axis. These flight-weight sensors are essential first steps toward autonomous upright stability and controlled forward motions.
