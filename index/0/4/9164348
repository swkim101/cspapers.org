Variational execution offers an avenue of efficiently analyzing configurable systems, but data structures like lists require special consideration. We implement automatic substitution of a more efficient list representation in a variational execution framework and evaluate its performance in micro-benchmarks. The results suggest that the substitution may offer substantial performance improvements to programs involving highly variational lists.
