The design and implementation of the data base structures of the Electro-Optical and Data Systems Group's (EDSG) Computer-Aided Design (CAD) system at Hughes Aircraft is introduced and discussed. The design is flexible, yet robust enough to support multiple CAD technologies and to afford easy integration of new capabilities. The current system structure and future plans are presented and discussed.
