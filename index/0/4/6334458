The rapid and perpetual growth of knowledge on the Web has given rise to many grand challenges (such as scalability, inconsistency, uncertainty, distribution and dynamics) for traditional knowledge processing methods and systems. Knowledge representation, retrieval and reasoning methods need to evolve and adapt to the Web to face these challenges and make this vast, heterogenous knowledge useful and accessible. In this light, the International Workshop on Web-scale Knowledge Representation, Retrieval, and Reasoning (Web-KR) is initiated. This workshop serves as the third one in this workshop series. This summary discusses the scope of Web-KR and introduces the advances in this field through the accepted papers in the Web-KR 2012 workshop, co-located with CIKM 2012.
