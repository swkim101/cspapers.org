Human stereo vision processes the two different images seen by the two eyes to generate depth sensation. While current stereoscopic display technologies look at how to faithfully simulate the stereo viewing experience, we took a look out of this scope, to explore how we may present binocular image pairs that differ in other ways to create novel visual experience. This paper presents several interesting techniques we explored, and discusses their potential applications according to an informal user study.
