Web applications are popular among developers because of the ease of development and deployment through the ubiquitous web browsing platform. However, differences in a web application's execution across different web browsers manifest as Cross-browser Inconsistencies (XBIs), which are a serious concern for web developers. Testing for XBIs manually is a laborious and error-prone process. In this demo we present X-PERT, which is a tool to identify XBIs in web applications automatically, without requiring any effort from the developer. X-PERT implements a comprehensive technique to identify XBIs and has been found to be effective in detecting real-world XBIs in our empirical evaluation. The source code of X-PERT and XBI reports from our evaluation are available at http://gatech.github.io/xpert.
