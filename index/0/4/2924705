Many widely deployed phishing defense schemes, such as SiteKey, use client-side secrets to help users confirm that they are visiting the correct website before entering their passwords. Unfortunately, studies have demonstrated that up to 92% of users can be convinced to ignore missing client-side secrets and enter their passwords into phishing pages. However, since client-side secrets have already achieved industry acceptance, they are an attractive building block for creating better phishing defenses. We present PhorceField, a phishing resistant password ceremony that combines client-side secrets and graphical passwords in a novel way that provides phishing resistance that neither achieves on its own. PhorceField enables users to login easily, but forces phishers to present victims with a fundamentally unfamiliar and onerous user interface. Victims that try to use the phisher's interface to enter their password find the task so difficult that they give up without revealing their password. We have evaluated PhorceField's phishing resistance in a user study in which 21 participants used PhorceField for a week and were then subjected to a simulated phishing attack. On average, participants were only able to reveal 20% of the entropy in their password, and none of them revealed their entire password. This is a substantial improvement over previous research that demonstrated that 92% of users would reveal their entire password to a phisher, even if important security indicators were missing[27].
 PhorceField is easy to deploy in sites that already use client-side secrets for phishing defense -- it requires no client-side software and can be implemented entirely in javascript. Banks and other high value websites could therefore deploy it as a drop-in replacement for existing defenses, or deploy it on an "opt-in" basis, as Google has done with its phone-based "2-step verification" system.
