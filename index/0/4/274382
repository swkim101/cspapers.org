Residual coding is an effective way to enhance the coding performance in video coding. This paper proposed a new inter-layer residual coding method based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) to obtain the sparse representation vectors as the transform coefficients. To achieve this purpose, a content adaptive dictionary is constructed in I frame based on the analysis of the coding unit complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 2.3% bitrate saving on average when compared to the HM-16.12.
