This paper demonstrates the need and impact of subcategorization information for SMT. We combine (i) features on sourceside syntactic subcategorization and (ii) an external knowledge base with quantitative, dependency-based information about target-side subcategorization frames. A manual evaluation of an English-toGerman translation task shows that the subcategorization information has a positive impact on translation quality through better prediction of case.
