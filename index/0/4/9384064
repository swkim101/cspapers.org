Spatial trajectory analysis is crucial to uncovering insights into the motives and nature of human behavior. In this work, we study the problem of discovering motifs in trajectories based on symbolically transformed representations and context free grammars. We propose a fast and robust grammar induction algorithm called mSEQUITUR to infer a grammar rule set from a trajectory for motif generation. Second, we designed the Symbolic Trajectory Analysis and VIsualization System (STAVIS), the first of its kind trajectory analytical system that applies grammar inference to derive trajectory signatures and enable mining tasks on the signatures. Third, an empirical evaluation is performed to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of mSEQUITUR for generating trajectory signatures and discovering motifs.
