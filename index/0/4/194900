Caprera is an open framework for designing client/server applications that operate over a wide-area network. The activity model of Caprera used to extend transaction processing and transaction-oriented application in an open environment including mobile and remote clients connected by wireless, phone lines, or Internet is described here. Since Caprera enables off-line users on mobile platforms to interact with corporate transaction processing systems, Tactica Corporation markets its product as a programmable server software for off-line transaction processing (OFTP). This paper describes the design rationale and the product architecture of Caprera.
