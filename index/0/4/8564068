We are interested in quantitatively modeling the interactions between humans in conversational settings. While a variety of models are potentially appropriate, such as the coupled HMM, all require a very large number of parameters to describe the interactions between chains. We propose as an alternative the generative model developed in [1], the Influence Model, which parametrizes the hidden state transition probabilities by taking a convex combination of the pairwise transitions with constant “influence” parameters. We develop a learning algorithm for this model and show its abilities to model chain dependencies in comparison to other standard models using synthetic data. We also show early results of applying this model to human interaction data. 1 Int r o duct io n There is a long history of work in the social sciences aimed at understanding the interactions between individuals and influencing their behavior. In the psychology community, there are many instances of work studying these effects. For instance, Wells and Petty [2] show how a speaker's confidence could be significantly influenced by repeated head nodding from the audience. Studies of this kind give us interesting insights into the workings of human dynamics. In many cases, the * The first three authors contributed equally to this paper and are listed alphabetically.
