The Bayesian paradigm provides a natural and effective means of exploiting prior knowledge concerning the time-frequency structure of sound signals such as speech and musicâ€”something which has often been overlooked in traditional audio signal processing approaches. Here, after constructing a Bayesian model and prior distributions capable of taking into account the time-frequency characteristics of typical audio waveforms, we apply Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in order to sample from the resultant posterior distribution of interest. We present speech enhancement results which compare favourably in objective terms with standard time-varying filtering techniques (and in several cases yield superior performance, both objectively and subjectively); moreover, in contrast to such methods, our results are obtained without an assumption of prior knowledge of the noise power.
