A back-gauging system for a shear machine that derives support from the side housings of the machine and is designed with a rotatable movement gauge stop and slideable control guides to enable the gauge stop to be moved above the work plane for shearing work pieces longer than the maximum gauge range, to eliminate excessive force being transmitted to the gauge drive when gauging or shearing and to eliminate wedging of sheared pieces between the knives and the back-gauge stop.
