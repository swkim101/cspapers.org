I N T R O D U C T I O N In this paper, I present work in progress on an extension of Combinatory Categorial Grammars, CCGs, (Steedman 1985) to handle languages with freer word order than English, specifically Turkish. The approach I develop takes advantage of CCGs' ability to combine the syntactic as well as the semantic representations of adjacent elements in a sentence in an incremental manner. The linguistic claim behind my approach is that free word order in Turkish is a direct result of its grammar and lexical categories; this approach is not compatible with a linguistic theory involving movement operations and traces.
