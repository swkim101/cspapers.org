The information used for the extraction of terms can be considered as rather 'internal', i.e. coming from the candidate string itself. This paper presents the incorporation of 'external' information derived from the context of the candidate string. It is embedded to the C-value approach for automatic term recognition (ATR), in the form of weights constructed from statistical characteristics of the context words of the candidate string.
