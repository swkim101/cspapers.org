In the past, some researches suggested that engineers can use combined software reliability growth models (SRGMs) to obtain more accurate reliability prediction during testing. In this paper, three weighted combinational models, namely, equal, linear, and nonlinear weight, are proposed for reliability estimation of web-based software. We further investigate the estimation accuracy of using genetic algorithm to determine the weight assignment for the proposed models. Preliminary result shows that the linearly and nonlinearly weighted combinational models have better prediction capability than single SRGM and equally weighted combinational model for web-based software.
