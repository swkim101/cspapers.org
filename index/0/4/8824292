A simple model of coupled dynamics of fast neurons and slow interactions, modelling self-organization in recurrent neural networks, leads naturally to an effective statistical mechanics characterized by a partition function which is an average over a replicated system. This is reminiscent of the replica trick used to study spin-glasses, but with the difference that the number of replicas has a physical meaning as the ratio of two temperatures and can be varied throughout the whole range of real values. The model has interesting phase consequences as a function of varying this ratio and external stimuli, and can be extended to a range of other models.
