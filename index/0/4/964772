This paper presents a mechanism for the robot moving inside of pipelines. The mechanism is composed of the 2-2D differential gear mechanism, the active adhesion mechanism, and the rescue mechanism. The 2-2D differential gear mechanism is designed to be driven with single actuator at any elbow type pipelines without any additional control efforts. The active adhesion mechanism is for providing sufficient adhesion forces of the robot on climbing over the pipelines against the gravity. In addition the rescue mechanism is designed for retrieving the robot safely in emergency situation. In this paper, three proposed mechanisms are explained in details and their effectiveness is experimentally demonstrated.
