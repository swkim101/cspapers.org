Faceted search is becoming a popular method to allow users to interactively search and navigate complex information spaces. A faceted search system presents users with key-value metadata that is used for query refinement. While popular in e-commerce and digital libraries, not much research has been conducted on which metadata to present to a user in order to improve the search experience. Nor are there repeatable benchmarks for evaluating a faceted search engine. This paper proposes the use of collaborative filtering and personalization to customize the search interface to each user's behavior. This paper also proposes a utility based framework to evaluate the faceted interface. In order to demonstrate these ideas and better understand personalized faceted search, several faceted search algorithms are proposed and evaluated using the novel evaluation methodology.
