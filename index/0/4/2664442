On the verge of realizing truly ubiquitous access to high quality data (e.g., media, financial, etc.), an efficient burst admission control algorithm is crucial in third generation (3G) wireless communication systems based on wideband CDMA standards. In this paper, we propose and analyze the performance of a novel burst admission technique, called the multiple- burst admission-spatial dimension algorithm (MBA-SD) to judiciously allocate the precious channels in wideband CDMA systems to burst requests. The major contributions of the present paper are the novel formulation of the problem as an integer programming problem and the derivation of an optimal algorithm for scheduling the burst requests. Both the forward link and the reverse link burst requests are considered and the system is simulated by dynamic simulations which takes into account of the user mobility, power control, and soft hand-off. We found that significant performance improvement, in terms of data user capacity coverage, and admission and outage probabilities, could be achieved by our scheme compared to the existing burst assignment algorithms.
