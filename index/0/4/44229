We develop a framework for forgetting concepts and roles (aka uniform interpolation) in terminologies in the lightweight description logic ∆êL extended with role inclusions and domain and range restrictions. Three different notions of forgetting, preserving, respectively, concept inclusions, concept instances, and answers to conjunctive queries, with corresponding languages for uniform interpolants are investigated. Experiments based on SNOMED CT (Systematised Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) and NCI (National Cancer Institute Ontology) demonstrate that forgetting is often feasible in practice for large-scale terminologies.
