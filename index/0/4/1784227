We have developed a novel, publicly available annotation tool for the semantic encoding of texts, especially those in the narrative domain. Users can create formal propositions to represent spans of text, as well as temporal relations and other aspects of narrative. A built-in natural-language generation component regenerates text from the formal structures, which eases the annotation process. We have run collection experiments with the tool and shown that non-experts can easily create semantic encodings of short fables. We present this tool as a stand-alone, reusable resource for research in semantics in which formal encoding of text, especially in a narrative form, is required.
