The increasing availability of 3D input and output devices demands a better understanding and comparison of their quality.This report describes an empirical experiment for comparing 3D display modes: traditional perspective viewing, anaglyph stereo and shutter glass stereo. We followed two hypotheses 1. shutter glass stereo viewing allows a faster and more accurate recognition than the anaglyph and the perspective viewing, and 2. subjects experienced with particular 3D representationsare faster and more accuratethan subjectswith-outexperience.The experiment is based on a true research sce-narioin organicchemistry.Organicmolecules were used as 3D objects.Mean responseerror and mean responsetime were calculated for a seriesof six tasks and 81 subjects.
