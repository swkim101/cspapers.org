Effective exploitation of computational grids can only be achieved when applications are fully integrated with the grid middleware and the underlying computational resources. Fundamental to this exploitation is information. Information about the structure and behaviour of the application, the capability of the computational and networking resources, and the availability and access to these resources by an individual, a group or an organisation.This paper describes an integrated grid environment that is open, extensible and platform independent. We match a high-level application specification, defined as a network of components, to an optimal combination of the currently available component implementations within our grid environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture through high-level specification and solution of a set of linear equations by automatic and optimal resource and implementation selection.
