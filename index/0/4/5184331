The purpose of this research is to investigate the extent to which knowledge can replace and support search in selecting a chess move and to delineate the issues involved. This has been carried out by constructing a program, PARADISE Pattern recognised Applied to Directing Search), which finds the best move in tactically sharp middle game positions. It encodes a large body of knowledge in the form of production rules. The program uses the knowledge base to discover plans during static analysis and to guide a small (tens of nodes) tree search. PARADISE does not place a depth limit on the search (or any other artificial effort limit), and has found combinations as deep as 19 ply. This paper describes plans how they are produced, and how they are used to guide the search. A complete description of PARADISE appears in [12]
