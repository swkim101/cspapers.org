This paper presents an unsupervised learning scheme for categorizing 3D objects from their 2D projected images. The scheme exploits an auto-associative network's ability to encode each view of a single object into a representation that indicates its view direction. We propose two models that employ different classification mechanisms; the first model selects an auto-associative network whose recovered view best matches the input view, and the second model is based on a modular architecture whose additional network classifies the views by splitting the input space nonlinearly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed classification models through simulations using 3D wire-frame objects.
