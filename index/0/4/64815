Flight control system development typically involves phases that are often chronological, yet are extensively interrelated and interconnected, where design, validation and verification (DV&V) play a central role. This paper proposes an integrated (DV&V) process aiming at reducing development cycles. A two-way integration approach suggests improvement than the traditional one-way integration approach, in integrating multiparadigm models, heterogeneous simulations, and in including mutual design and validation interactions. The necessity of such an integrated approach is illustrated by a flight control example
