Transaction scheduling is necessary to downgrade concurrency control insensitivity to both data and resource contention. W bile resource contention can be relieved by employing adclitioual MIPS processing power and memory space, data contention remains inevitable especially in high-speed on-line transaction processing systems, or in databases with hot-spots. We define two main objectives for transaction scheduling. The first is to maximize the effective level of concurrency, which excludes concurrency contributeci by unsuccessful transactions. The aim here is to increase throughput or transactions per second (TPS). The second objective is the timely detection and handling of highly contentious data items as well as highly contending transactions. To achieve this objective we use adaptable back-off strategies to restart and delay contending transactions. The same strategies are used to distance concurrent accesses to hot spots. In this paper we present an adaptable transaction scheduling technique that is applicable to high contention environments, and that can be used in conjunction with any lock-based concurrency control algorithm. We show how we attempt to achieve optiruum performance over a wide range of conflict levels, where depending on various criteria, transactions are scheduled for execution, delayed, or backed-off. We describe a simulation-based performance study of transaction scheduling and its impact on various concurrency control algorithms.
