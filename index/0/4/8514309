This paper reports on an experimental course taught by the author at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The motivation for the unusual structure of the course was to bolster student morale weakened by inadequate background. Students, whose performance in a course had been only average, were given academic credit for tutoring students in a trailing lectureless section. Student response was overwhelmingly favorable and academic results appear to be at least as good as under more traditional course structures.
