We propose an augmented reality system on off-the-shelves smartphones which allows random physical object tagging. At later times, such tags could be retrieved from different locations and orientations. Our approach does not require any additional infrastructure support, localization scheme, specialized camera, or modification to smartphone's operating system. Designed and developed for current generation smartphones, our application shows promising initial results with retrieval accuracy of 82% in indoor environment without noticeable impact on the user experience. If made commercially available, such system could be used in city tourism, infrastructure maintenance, and enabling new kind of social interactions.
