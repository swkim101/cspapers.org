Summary form only given. We propose an efficient method for estimating the motion of a multi-camera rig from a minimal set of feature correspondences. Existing methods for solving the multi-camera relative pose problem require extra correspondences, are slow to compute, and/or produce a multitude of solutions. Our solution uses a first-order approximation to relative pose in order to simplify the problem and produce an accurate estimate quickly. The solver is applicable to sequential multi-camera motion estimation and is fast enough for real-time implementation in a random sampling framework. Our experiments show that our approach is both stable and efficient on challenging test sequences.
