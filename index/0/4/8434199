Collective classification in relational data has become an important and active research topic in the last decade. It exploits the dependencies of instances in a network to improve predictions. Related applications include hyperlinked document classification, social network analysis and collaboration network analysis. Most of the traditional collective classification models mainly study the scenario that there exists a large amount of labeled examples (labeled nodes). However, in many real-world applications, labeled data are extremely difficult to obtain. For example, in network intrusion detection, there may be only a limited number of identified intrusions whereas there are a huge set of unlabeled nodes. In this situation, most of the data have no connection to labeled nodes; hence, no supervision knowledge can be obtained from the local connections. In this paper, we propose to explore various latent linkages among the nodes and judiciously integrate the linkages to generate a latent graph. This is achieved by finding a graph that maximizes the linkages among the training data with the same label, and maximizes the separation among the data with different labels. The objective is further cast into an optimization problem and is solved with quadratic programming. Finally, we apply label propagation on the latent graph to make prediction. Experiments show that the proposed model LNP (Latent Network Propagation) can improve the learning accuracy significantly. For instance, when there are only 10% of labeled examples, the accuracies of all the comparison models are less than 63%, while that of the proposed model is 74%.
