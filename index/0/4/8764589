When I saw the title of this panel discussion, “Is There a Best Programming Language for Design Automation?”, I thought that this would be the shortest remark I ever had to make - one word, AED, and then I got to thinking about it and noticed that wasn't really keeping to the subject of the panel, so I had to double the length of the paper and say, “Yes, AED.” I really don't feel terribly controversial yet this afternoon, so I would like to be very brief and merely try to put a slight twist, or maybe an elaboration on the title of the panel, because I think it is ambiguous as it's stated and we should spend some time trying to remove this ambiguity.
