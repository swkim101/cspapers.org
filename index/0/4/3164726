The physical-layer models commonly used in current networking research only minimally address the interaction of directional antennas and radio propagation. This paper compares the models found in popular simulation tools with measurements taken across a variety of links in multiple environments. We find that the effects of antenna direction are significantly different from the models used by the common wireless network simulators. We propose a parametric model which better captures the effects of different propagation environments on directional antenna systems. We believe that adopting this model will allow more realistic simulation of protocols relying on directional antennas, supporting better design and more valid assessment of those protocols.
