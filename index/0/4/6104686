We describe our experiences in applying learning-to-rank techniques to improving the quality of search results of an online hotel reservation system. The search result quality factors we use are average booking position and distribution of margin in top-ranked results. (We expect that total revenue will increase with these factors.) Our application of the SVMRank technique improves booking position by up to 25% and margin distribution by up to 14%.
