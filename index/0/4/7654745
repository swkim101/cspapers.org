Visible light indoor localization offers promising accuracy and reliability due to dense light deployment and multipath-free propagation. However, current visible light localization schemes rely on either energy-hungry cameras or assumptions about channel responses of light sources, which limits their application. They also require LED lights with specialized circuitry, which increases cost and hinders large scale deployment. We present LiTell2, a scheme that extracts unique features from incumbent fluorescent or LED lights, and uses a simple photodiode sensor to extract AoA information for localization. LiTell2's sensor achieves AoA measurements by leveraging the diversity of photodiodes' angular responses. By comparing signal from photodiodes of different angular response, LiTell2 can derive AoA of each light source, thus achieving high precision localization with unmodified light fixtures and extremely low fingerprinting cost. Our experiments show that LiTell2 provides accurate AoA sensing and enables energy efficient yet robust localization.
