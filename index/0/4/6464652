Caching is a key component of information-centric networking, but most of the work in the area focuses on simple en-route caching with limited cooperation between the caches. In this paper we model cache cooperation under a game theoretical framework and show how cache cooperation policy can allow the system to converge to a Pareto optimal configuration. Our work shows how cooperation impacts network caching performance and how it takes advantage of the structural properties of the underlying network.
