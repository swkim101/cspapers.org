In this paper, a novel object class detection method based on 3D object modeling is presented. Instead of using a complicated mechanism for relating multiple 2D training views, the proposed method establishes spatial connections between these views by mapping them directly to the surface of 3D model. The 3D shape of an object is reconstructed by using a homographic framework from a set of model views around the object and is represented by a volume consisting of binary slices. Features are computed in each 2D model view and mapped to the 3D shape model using the same homographic framework. To generalize the model for object class detection, features from supplemental views are also considered. A codebook is constructed from all of these features and then a 3D feature model is built. Given a 2D test image, correspondences between the 3D feature model and the testing view are identified by matching the detected features. Based on the 3D locations of the corresponding features, several hypotheses of viewing planes can be made. The one with the highest confidence is then used to detect the object using feature location matching. Performance of the proposed method has been evaluated by using the PASCAL VOC challenge dataset and promising results are demonstrated.
