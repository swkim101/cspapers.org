Several papers have recently dealt with techniques for proving area-time lower bounds for VLSI computation by “crossing sequence” methods. A number of natural questions are raised by these definitions. 1.Is the fooling set approach the most powerful way to get information-transfer-based lower bounds? We shall show it is not, and offer a candidate for the title “most powerful.” Of course, without a precise definition of “information transfer argument,” there could be other contenders. 2.Are the notions of the three papers cited equivalent? We shall exhibit certain inequivalences among the three notions, although open questions remain. However, we can resolve an open question of Papadimitriou and Sipser [PS] concerning the relationship between nondeterministic and deterministic communication complexity.
