We demonstrate significant improvement on the MCTest question answering task (Richardson et al., 2013) by augmenting baseline features with features based on syntax, frame semantics, coreference, and word embeddings, and combining them in a max-margin learning framework. We achieve the best results we are aware of on this dataset, outperforming concurrentlypublished results. These results demonstrate a significant performance gradient for the use of linguistic structure in machine comprehension.
