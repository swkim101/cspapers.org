A feed-holding member entices fish into a fish-trapping device which has an "exit only" closure for an outlet opening thereof. A "live net" is connected to that fish-trapping device adjacent that outlet opening, and, when the fish have satisfied their appetites, they will attempt to escape from the fish-trapping device. In doing so, the fish will open the "exit only" closure and pass through the outlet opening into the "live net"-which will hold the fish until they can be removed from that "live net".
