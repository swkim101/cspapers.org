Graph-theoretical tools, algorithm animation, and other related visual-aids have proven very useful in computerscience pedagogy. In this paper the use of the graphical aspects of Petri net theory as a tool to introduce operating system concepts is given. It is shown how a minimal amount of Petri net theory cara be applied to problems often discussed in an operating systems course. Examples of models for the concept of deadlocks, for the deadlock detection algorithm, and the fork/â€™oin and parbegin/parend concurrency constructs are shown, In addition, discussion of how Petri net models are utilized to introduce Ada rendezvous solutions of classic problems, such as producer/consumer with a ring-buffer, is given.
