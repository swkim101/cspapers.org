We present a clustering algorithm for discovering rare yet significant recurring classes across a batch of samples in the presence of random effects. We model each sample data by an infinite mixture of Dirichlet-process Gaussian-mixture models (DPMs) with each DPM representing the noisy realization of its corresponding class distribution in a given sample. We introduce dependencies across multiple samples by placing a global Dirichlet process prior over individual DPMs. This hierarchical prior introduces a sharing mechanism across samples and allows for identifying local realizations of classes across samples. We use collapsed Gibbs sampler for inference to recover local DPMs and identify their class associations. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm, processing a flow cytometry data set containing two extremely rare cell populations, and report results that significantly outperform competing techniques. The source code of the proposed algorithm is available on the web via the link:http://cs.iupui.edu/~dundar/aspire.htm.
