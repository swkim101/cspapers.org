We define noun phrase translation as a subtask of machine translation. This enables us to build a dedicated noun phrase translation subsystem that improves over the currently best general statistical machine translation methods by incorporating special modeling and special features. We achieved 65.5% translation accuracy in a German-English translation task vs. 53.2% with IBM Model 4.
