We define the class of conjunctive queries in relational data bases, and the generalized join operator on relations. The generalized join plays an important part in answering conjunctive queries, and it can be implemented using matrix multiplication. It is shown that while answering conjunctive queries is NP complete (general queries are PSPACE complete), one can find an implementation that is within a constant of optimal. The main lemma used to show this is that each conjunctive query has a unique minimal equivalent query (much like minimal finite automata).
