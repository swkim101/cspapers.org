We propose a new technique for hardware synthesis from higher-order functional languages with imperative features based on Reynolds's Syntactic Control of Interference. The restriction on contraction in the type system is useful for managing the thorny issue of sharing of physical circuits. We use a semantic model inspired by game semantics and the geometry of interaction, and express it directly as a certain class of digital circuits that form a cartesian, monoidal-closed category. A soundness result is given, which is also a correctness result for the compilation technique.
