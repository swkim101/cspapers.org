This paper studies MIMO based rate adaptation (RA) in 802.11n wireless networks. Our case study shows that existing RA algorithms offer much lower throughput than even a fixed-rate scheme. The fundamental problem is that, all such algorithms are MIMO oblivious; they do not consider the characteristics of diversity-oriented, single-stream mode and the spatial multiplexing driven, double-stream mode. We propose MiRA, a novel MIMO RA scheme that zigzags between intra- and inter-mode rate options. Our experiments show that MiRA consistently outperforms three representative RA algorithms, SampleRate, RRAA and Atheros MIMO RA, in static, mobility and collision settings.
