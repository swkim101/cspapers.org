This paper gives an overview of a model for the reconstruction of task-oriented dialogues based on an interactive, multilevel parsing formalism. It is applied to route description dialogues. It will be shown, how the pragmatic aspects of such dialogues are taken into account on different levels of processing. The approach described is based on an extension of the concept of cascaded ATNs. Furthermore this approach uses knowledge sources (KSs) for every participant in the dialogue in which knowledge about the world and a partner model is build up during the analysis of a dialogue. These KSs are supplied to the parsing process, as well. In this paper special importance is laid on the description of the interaction and cooperation of the different processing components of this formalism.
