This paper approximates the 3D geometry of a scene by a small number of 3D planes. The method is especially suited to man-made scenes, and only requires two calibrated wide-baseline views as inputs. It relies on the computation of a dense but noisy 3D point cloud, as for example obtained by matching DAISY descriptors [35] between the views. It then segments one of the two reference images, and adopts a multi-model fitting process to assign a 3D plane to each region, when the region is not detected as occluded. A pool of 3D plane hypotheses is first derived from the 3D point cloud, to include planes that reasonably approximate the part of the 3D point cloud observed from each reference view between randomly selected triplets of 3D points. The hypothesis-to-region assignment problem is then formulated as an energy-minimization problem, which simultaneously optimizes an original data-fidelity term, the assignment smoothness over neighboring regions, and the number of assigned planar proxies. The synthesis of intermediate viewpoints demonstrates the effectiveness of our 3D reconstruction, and thereby the relevance of our proposed data fidelity-metric.
