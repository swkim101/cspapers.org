ProLiV - Animated Process-modeler of Complex (Computational) Linguistic Methods and Theories - is a fully modular, flexible, XML-based stand-alone Java application, used for computer-assisted learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Computational Linguistics (CL). Having a flexible and extendible architecture, the system presents the students, by means of text, of visual elements (such as pictures and animations) and of interactive parameter set-up, the following topics: Latent Semantics Analysis (LSA), (computational) lexicons, question modeling, Hidden-Markov-Models (HMM), and Topic-Focus. These topics are addressed to first-year students in computer science and/or linguistics.
