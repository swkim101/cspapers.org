This paper presents a novel and fast k-NN classifier that is based on a binary CMM (Correlation Matrix Memory) neural network. A robust encoding method is developed to meet CMM input requirements. A hardware implementation of the CMM is described, which gives over 200 times the speed of a current mid-range workstation, and is scaleable to very large problems. When tested on several benchmarks and compared with a simple k-NN method, the CMM classifier gave less than 1% lower accuracy and over 4 and 12 times speed-up in software and hardware respectively.
