This session will explore the reasons for the lack of impact in four important areas in which AI has been expected to significantly affect real world Software Engineering. The panelists, each representing one of these areas, will respond to the conjecture that these failures rest upon a common cause -- reliance on isolationist technology and approaches, rather than upon creating additive technology and approaches that can be integrated with other existing capabilities.
