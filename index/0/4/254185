When documents and queries are presented in different languages, the common approach is to translate the query into the document language. While there are a variety of query translation approaches, recent research suggests that combining multiple methods into a single ”structured query” is the most effective. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for producing a unique combination recipe for each query, as it has also been shown that the optimal combination weights differ substantially across queries and other task specifics. Our query-specific combination method generates statistically significant improvements over other combination strategies presented in the literature, such as uniform and task-specific weighting. An in-depth empirical analysis presents insights about the effect of data size, domain differences, labeling and tuning on the end performance of our approach.
