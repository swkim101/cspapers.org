We describe here our proposed method to investigate the sliding motion of a soft fingertip in the dexterous manipulation. This paper focuses on analyzing dynamic sliding motion of a 2-dimensional (2-D) soft fingertip on a plane. To investigate the deformation of the fingertip during this process, we consider the soft fingertip as if it was composed of a finite number of elastic cantilevers which are compressible and bendable. Simulation will be carried out firstly on this 2-D model of soft fingertip, focusing on the analysis of incident slip-page. After that, various experimental results will be shown to verify this model.
