In this paper, we investigate the footprints of third-party tracking on the mobile web. The survey of 100 popular mobile versions of web applications indicates that third-party tracking is also prevalent on mobile web. The results show that 62 sites are tracking users' activities on mobile web and Google Analytics is the most widespread tracker on mobile web. We believe that this study will help raise awareness about the tracking situation on the mobile web side.
