In this paper we introduce LuminAR: a prototype for a new portable and compact projector-camera system designed to use the traditional incandescent bulb interface as a power source, and a robotic desk lamp that carries it, enabling it with dynamic motion capabilities. We are exploring how the LuminAR system embodied in a familiar form factor of a classic Angle Poise lamp may evolve into a new class of robotic, digital information devices.
