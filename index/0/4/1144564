This paper presents preliminary results on the detection of cultural differences from people's experiences in various countries from two perspectives: tourists and locals. Our approach is to develop probabilistic models that would provide a good framework for such studies. Thus, we propose here a new model, ccLDA, which extends over the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and cross-collection mixture (ccMix) (Zhai et al., 2004) models on blogs and forums. We also provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the model on the cross-cultural data.
