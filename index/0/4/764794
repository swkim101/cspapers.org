The IPython Notebook is an interactive browser-based environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots, and rich media into a single document. Originally designed for use as an electronic lab notebook for computational science, it is increasingly being used in teaching as well, and a rich ecosystem of open source plugins and extensions for teaching is growing around it. The first half of this hands-on workshop will introduce the Notebook and present examples of lessons and instructional materials built around it. In the second half, attendees will explore future directions for the Notebook as a teaching platform.
