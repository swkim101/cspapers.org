Maintenance is a time consuming and expensive task for any golf course or driving range manager. For a golf course the primary tasks are grass mowing and maintenance (fertilizer and herbicide spreading), while for a driving range mowing, maintenance and ball collection are required. All these tasks require an operator to drive a vehicle along paths, which are generally predefined. This paper presents some preliminary in-field testing results for an automated tractor vehicle performing golf ball collection on an actual driving range, and mowing on difficult unstructured terrain.
