This paper describes a hierarchical design verification system, consisting of a logic verification subsystem, MIXS(1), a timing verification subsystem, NELTAS(2), and a hierarchical data base. MIXS is a mixed level simulator, which can handle both functional and chip or gate level models with a unified simulation mechanism based on "node" model concept. NELTAS analizes delay time by tracing logical paths and calculating their media delay time. Both subsystems have hierarchical processing capability.
