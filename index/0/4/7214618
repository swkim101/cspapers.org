Identifying which fingers are in contact with a multi-touch surface provides a very large input space that can be leveraged for command selection. However, the numerous possibilities enabled by such vast space come at the cost of discoverability. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a three-step interaction pattern inspired by hotkeys that also supports feed-forward. We illustrate this interaction with three applications allowing us to explore and adapt it in different contexts.
