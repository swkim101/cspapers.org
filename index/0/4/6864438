This paper presents a novel approach to robot audition by performing robotic tasks with auditory cues. Unlike many previous works, we propose a control scheme, that does not require any explicit sound source localization. This approach is capable of controlling all the three degrees of freedom in a plane from two microphones. Built upon the sensor-based control framework, this approach relies on implicit sound source direction obtained from the time difference of arrival (TDOA). We introduce an analytical modelling of auditory cues considering a robot equipped with a pair of microphones and multiple sound sources, from which a control scheme is designed. A stability analysis is provided as well. The results obtained in simulation show the feasibility and the suitability of this method even in reverberant area.
