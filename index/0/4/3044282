Applicative programming has long been advocated on theoretical grounds because the formal properties of such programs are simple and elegant. Recently, there has been a trend to use the applicative approach in software development tools [3] and programming languages [2,7]. Unfortunately, the requirement that operations be free of side-effects makes it difficult to achieve efficient implementations [7]. To date, there are only two published algorithms [5,8], which treat the applicative manipulation of queues and stacks.
