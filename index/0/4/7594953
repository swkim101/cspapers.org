Wireless multicarrier communication systems transmit data by spreading it over multiple subcarriers and are widely used today owing to their robustness to multipath fading, high spectrum efficiency, and ease of implementation. In this paper, we use real measurements to show there is significant frequency diversity in Wi-Fi channels, and propose a series of techniques to explicitly harness such frequency diversity. In particular, we leverage the Channel State Information (CSI), which captures the SNR on each subcarrier to (i) map symbols to subcarriers according to their importance, (ii) effectively recover partially corrupted FEC groups and facilitate FEC decoding, and (iii) develop MAC-layer FEC to offer different degrees of protection to the symbols according to their error rates at the PHY layer. We further develop a rate adaptation approach that works together with these optimization schemes. Our trace-driven simulation and testbed experiments based on USRP clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.
