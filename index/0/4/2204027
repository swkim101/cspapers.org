We give a construction of statistically-hiding commitment schemes (ones where the hiding propertyholds information theoretically), based on the minimal cryptographic assumption that one-way functions exist. Our construction employs two-phase commitment schemes, recently constructed by Nguyen, Ong and Vadhan (FOCS '06), and universal one-way hash functions introduced and constructedby Naor and Yung (STOC '89) and Rompel (STOC '90).
