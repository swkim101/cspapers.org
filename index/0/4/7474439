An e ective bu er management system is crucial for any database management system. While much work has been expended to provide extensible data t ypes, extensible query languages and even extensible optimizers, there is very limited research in providing extensibility at the bu er management level. Supporting extensibility at the bu er management level is equally, if not more, important as no single strategy can perform well in all applications e ciently. In this paper, we present a uniform framework for modeling bu er replacement policies. The framework allows the bu er manager to be easily extended to provide support for and ne-tuning of di erent replacement policies. Our work is novel in two aspects. First, the proposed framework uni es existing work in this area. Second, our work introduces a new level of extensibility. To our knowledge, none of the existing extensible DBMSs and storage managers provide extensibility at the bu er management level. We implemented an extensible bu er manager and experimented with di erent bu er replacement polices. The experimental study illustrates the ease of use and e ciency of the proposed framework.
