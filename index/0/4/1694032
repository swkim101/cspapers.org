I t has been known for a long t ime now tha t the problem of counting the number of perfect matchings in a planar graph is in NC. This result is based on the notion of a pfaffian orientation of a graph. (Recently, Galluccio and Loebl [7] gave a P-t ime algorithm for the case of graphs of small genus.) However, it is not known if the corresponding search problem, tha t of finding one perfect matching in a planar graph, is in NC. This situation is intriguing as it seems to contradict our intuit ion tha t search should be easier than counting. For the case of planar bipartite graphs, Miller and Naor [22] showed tha t a perfect matching can indeed be found using an NC algorithm. We present a very different NG-algorithm for this problem. Unlike the Miller-Naor algorithm, our approach directly uses the fact tha t counting is in NC, and it also generalizes to the problem of finding a perfect matching in a bipar t i te graph of small (O(log n)) genus. I t also rekindles the hope for an NC-algorithm to find a perfect matching in a non-bipart i te planar graph. Along the way, we modify the algorithm of Gallucio and Loebl [7] to show that counting the number of perfect matchings in graphs of small genus is in NC.
