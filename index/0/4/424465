We studied the performance of a next-generation mobile backhaul network that is based on a hybrid architecture employing NG-PON2 (TWDM-PON) and FSO technologies. We have developed a mathematical model of the downlink system. We then comprehensively analyzed the performance of TWDM-PON/FSO-hybrid backhaul downlink while considering the impacts of various physical layer impairments of both optical fiber and wireless links. The performance of TWDM-PON/FSO systems with different service reaches is also compared to that of corresponding NG-PON2s. The numerical results show that the TWDM-PON/FSO-combined system can take the advantages of both optical access networks and FSO technologies to create a promising flexible gigabit-bandwidth-capable solution for next generation mobile backhaul networks.
