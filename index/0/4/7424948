With an ever-increasing portion of the delay in highspeed CMOS chips attributable to the interconnect, interconnect-circuit design automation continues to grow in importance. By transforming the gate and multilayer wire sizing problem into a convex programming problem for the Elmore delay approximation, we demonstrate the efficacy of a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) solution method. For cases where accuracy greater than that provided by the Elmore delay approximation is required we apply SQP to the gate and wire sizing problem with more accurate delay models. Since efficient calculation of sensitivities is of paramount importance during SQP, we describe an approach for efficient computation of the accurate delay sensitivities.
