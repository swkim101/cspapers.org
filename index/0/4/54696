Touch-screen technique has gained the large popularity in human-screen interaction with modern smartphones. Due to the limited size of equipped screens, scrolling operations are indispensable in order to display the content of interest on screen. While power consumption caused by hardware and software installed within smartphones is well studied, the energy cost made by human-screen interaction such as scrolling remains unknown. In this paper, we analyze the impact of scrolling operations to the power consumption of smartphones, finding that the state-of-art strategy of smartphones in responding a scrolling operation is to always use the highest frame rate which arouses huge computation burden and can contribute nearly 50% to the total power consumption of smartphones. In recognizing this significance, we further propose a novel system, Energy-Efficient Engine(E3), which automatically tracks the scrolling speed and adaptively adjusts the frame rate according to individual user preference. The goal of E3 is to guarantee the user experience and minimize the energy consumption caused by scrolling at the same time. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the efficiency of E3 design. On average, E3 can save up to 58% of the energy consumed by CPU and 34% of the overall energy consumption.
