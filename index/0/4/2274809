Manipulation of models and mappings is a common task in the design and development of information systems. Research in Model Management aims at supporting these tasks by providing a set of operators to manipulate models and mappings. As a framework, GeRoMeSuite provides an environment to simplify the implementation of model management operators. GeRoMeSuite is based on the generic role based metamodel GeRoMe [10], which represents models from different modeling languages (such as XML Schema, OWL, SQL) in a generic way. Thereby, the management of models in a polymorphic fashion is enabled, i.e. the same operator implementations are used regardless of the original modeling language of the schemas. In addition to providing a framework for model management, GeRoMeSuite implements several fundamental operators such as Match, Merge, and Compose.
