Enterprise-class databases require database administrators who are responsible for performance tuning. With large-scale deployment of databases, minimizing database administration function becomes important. One important task of a database administrator is selecting indexes that are appropriate for the workload on the system. In data intensive applications such as decision support and data warehousing picking the right set of indexes becomes crucial for performance. Moreover, the indexes chosen should track changes in the workload. While automating the process of index selection can greatly reduce administration cost, enterprise databases are simply too complex for the administrator to hit the “accept” button on the recommendations of an index selection tool without doing a quantitative impact analysis of the recommendations.
