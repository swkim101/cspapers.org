Workflow techniques are currently seen as the key techniques to improve the effectiveness and productivity of business processes. Most workflow models take a static view toward workflow applications. The static view requires that all the components are known in advance and the structural information alone can uniquely determine an execution path. Some applications may not have either or both of these properties. In these applications, uncertainty exists. In this paper, we study the issues related to uncertainties. We characterize uncertainties into three categories, domain uncertainty, structural uncertainty and implementation uncertainty, and discuss the impact they have on workflow specification and implementation. We then propose approaches to coping with each of them.
