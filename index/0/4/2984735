Radialize represents a service for listening to music and radio programs through the web. The service allows the discovery of the content being played by radio stations on the web, either by managing explicit information made available by those stations or by means of our technology for automatic recognition of audio content in a stream. Radialize then offers a service in which the user can search, be recommended, and provide feedback on artists and songs being played in traditional radio stations, either explicitly or implicitly, in order to compose an individual profile. The recommender system utilizes every user interaction as a data source, as well as the similarity abstraction extracted out of the radios' musical programs, making use of the wisdom of crowds implicitly present in the radio programs.
