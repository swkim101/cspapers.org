The increasing popularity of cloud storage services has lead companies that handle critical data to think about using these services for their storage needs. Medical record databases, power system historical information and financial data are some examples of critical data that could be moved to the cloud. However, the reliability and security of data stored in the cloud still remain major concerns. In this paper we present DEPSKY, a system that improves the availability, integrity and confidentiality of information stored in the cloud through the encryption, encoding and replication of the data on diverse clouds that form a cloud-of-clouds. We deployed our system using four commercial clouds and used PlanetLab to run clients accessing the service from different countries. We observed that our protocols improved the perceived availability and, in most cases, the access latency when compared with cloud providers individually. Moreover, the monetary costs of using DEPSKY on this scenario is twice the cost of using a single cloud, which is optimal and seems to be a reasonable cost, given the benefits.
