We describe a program for assigning correct stress contours to nominals in English. It makes use of idiosyncratic knowledge about the stress behavior of various nominal types and general knowledge about English stress rules. We have also investigated the related issue of parsing complex nominals in English. The importance of this work and related research to the problem of text-to-speech is discussed.
