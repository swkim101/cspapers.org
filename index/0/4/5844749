Four statistical visual feature indexes are proposed: SLM (Shot Length Mean), the average length of each shot in a video; SLD (Shot Length Deviation), the standard deviation of shot lengths for a video; ONM (Object Number Mean), the average number of objects per frame of the video; and OND (Object Number Deviation), the standard deviation of the number of objects per frame across the video. Each of these indexes provides a unique perspective on video content. A novel video retrieval interface has been developed as a platform to examine our assumption that the new indexes facilitate some video retrieval tasks. Initial feedback is promising and formal experiments are planned.
