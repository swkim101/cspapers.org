Invariably, new technologies introduce new vulnerabilities which often enable new attacks by increasingly potent adversaries. Yet new systems are more adept at handling well-known attacks by old adversaries than anticipating new ones. Our adversary models seem to be perpetually out of date: often they do not capture adversary attacks and sometimes they address attacks rendered impractical by new technologies.In this talk, I provide a brief overview of adversary models beginning with those required by program and data sharing technologies ('60-'70s), continuing with those required by computer communication and networking technologies ('70s-'90s), and ending with those required by and sensor network technologies ('00s ->). I argue that sensor, ad-hoc, and mesh networks require new models, different from those in common use, namely those of the Dolev-Yao and Byzantine adversaries. I illustrate this with adversaries that attack perfectly sensible and otherwise correct protocols of sensor networks. These attacks cannot be countered with traditional security protocols using end-to-end design arguments and require emergent security properties as countermeasures.
