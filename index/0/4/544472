Urban transit systems play a significant role in preventing daily commutes from becoming more congested than they are now, e.g., transit systems reduced 865 million hours of travel delay and 450 million gallons of gas during U.S. commutes in 2013. However, the previous theory and practice on urban transit research have typically focused on individual transit modes in isolation, and thus there is a lack of research on how to integrate real-time data feeds about different transit modes (e.g., taxicab, bus and subway) and other urban infrastructures (e.g., cellular networks) to improve transit efficiency. To address this issue, we propose and implement a novel architecture for multi-mode transit services based on the urban infrastructures in a Chinese city Shenzhen. The key contributions of this poster are as follows.
