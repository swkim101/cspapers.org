Trust is an integral part of the Semantic Web architecture. While most prior work focuses on entity-centered issues such as authentication and reputation, it does not model the content, i.e. the nature and use of the information being exchanged. This paper discusses content trust as an aggregate of other trust measures that have been previously studied. The paper introduces several factors that users consider in deciding whether to trust the content provided by a Web resource. Many of these factors are hard to capture in practice, since they would require a large amount of user input. Our goal is to discern which of these factors could be captured in practice with minimal user interaction in order to maximize the system's trust estimates. The paper also describes a simulation environment that we have designed to study alternative models of content trust.
