We present VisMap, a Web-based software tool that supports student exploration of possible data visualizations during a typical process of data science practice. Specifically, we detail visualization approaches within three major kinds of data analysis (part-to-whole and rank, correlation, and geospatial) and discuss how VisMap allows students to visually explore visualization options that correspond to the kind of analysis. The discussion is rooted in our experiences developing an introductory undergraduate course in data science and in our classroom observations of the limitations of existing software tools. These limitations include inefficiency of visualization comparison, difficulty in manipulating data to achieve visualization goals, and current challenges novices face when using professional tools simultaneous with learning about visualization. We finally offer a variety of future paths to further evaluate and refine VisMap.
