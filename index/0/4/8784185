The RoboCup Rescue project aims to simulate large urban disasters and rescue agents' activities. The simulator must support both simulation of heterogeneous agents such as fire fighters, victims' behaviors and interface to disaster's environments in the real world. The RoboCup Rescue simulator is a comprehensive urban disaster simulator into which a new disasters simulator or rescue agents can be easily plugged. In the paper, the simulator's specification based on the Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake and the simulator's architecture are described.
