MySQL Cluster is a parallel main memory database. It is using the normal MySQL software with a new storage engine NDB Cluster. MySQL Cluster 5.1 has been adapted to also handle fields on disk. In this work a number of recovery principles of MySQL Cluster had to be adapted to handle very large data sizes. The article presents an efficient algorithm for synchronizing a starting node with very large data sets. It provides reasons for the unorthodox choice of a no-steal algorithm in the buffer manager. It also presents the algorithm to change the data.
