In this paper, we propose a method to generate high quality test waveform on chip to avoid the parasitic effects in an analog testability bus test environment. For the test response analysis, we derive an extraction methodology to remove the parasitic effects and obtain the intrinsic response of the CUT. The test results show that the algorithm is robust such that the intrinsic responses remain the same regardless of the small variation in the test waveforms. With the concept of intrinsic responses, we are able to use a single library for the testing and diagnosis of multiple instantiation of an analog module.
