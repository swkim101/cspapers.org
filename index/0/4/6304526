Begin-BIG is a way of introducing students to computing with a " big " application which the students first use and later modify. The application, which is big for the student, is actually a small version of a spreadsheet, database, equation solver, etc. One example discussed in this paper is SpreadPage, a spreadsheet of one page (26 columns and 50 rows) which involves big objects (rows and columns) and big actions (procedures acting on the rows and columns). This approach will also " End-Big " with students finally modifying or maintaining the application. In mid-semester the " Big " mind-set often helps the students appreciate many software engineering concepts.
