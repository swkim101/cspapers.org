This paper explores corpus-based bilingual retrieval where the translation corpora used vary by source and size. We find that the quality of translation alignments and the domain of the bitext are important. In some settings these factors are more critical than corpus size. We also show that judicious choice of tokenization can reduce the amount of bitext required to obtain good bilingual retrieval performance.
