This paper explores the parallel performance of structured overset CFD computations for multi-component bodies in which there is relative motion between component parts. The two processes that dominate the cost of such problems are the flow solution on each component and the intergrid connectivity solution. A two-part static-dynamic load balancing scheme is proposed in which the static part balances the load for the flow solution and the dynamic part re-balances, if necessary, the load for the connectivity solution. This scheme is coupled with existing parallel implementations of the OVERFLOW flow solver and DCF3D connectivity routine and used for unsteady calculations about aerodynamic bodies on the IBM SP2 and IBM SP multi-processors. This paper also describes the parallel implementation of a new solution-adaption scheme based on structured Cartesian overset grids.
