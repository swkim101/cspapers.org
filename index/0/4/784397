This paper presents and evaluates a scheme for reducing the average memory access time in a vector processing architecture. This scheme uses data skewing to distribute vectors among the modules of a parallel memory system in such a way that, for typical vector access patterns, the average number of memory conflicts is reduced. It also employs both address and data buffers in each module to smooth out the transient irregularities that occur in some vector access patterns.
Most previous data skewing techniques were developed to provide conflict-free access for a limited set of access strides. While the proposed scheme does not eliminate all conflicts, it improves the average performance over non-skewed parallel memories by significantly reducing the number of conflicts for a wide range of strides. Also, this effect is much less dependent on the number of memory modules than the skewing schemes used to obtain conflict-free access.
