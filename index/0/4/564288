This article outlines a quantitative method for segmenting texts into thematically coherent units. This method relies on a network of lexical collocations to compute the thematic coherence of the different parts of a text from the lexical cohesiveness of their words. We also present the results of an experiment about locating boundaries between a series of concatened texts.
