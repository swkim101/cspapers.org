Software product line development (SPLD) can reduce the overall software production costs, but imposes extra complexity on the development process. Dealing with the commonalities and variabilities of the product variants and with the flexible software archiecture makes product line development a real challenge. Developers can only be successful with adequate tool support for product line development, which is still not the ”state of the art”. The demonstration shows the integration of software product line modeling based on feature models into the popular integrated development environment Eclipse. We will demonstrate that a flexible product line architecture can be build by using the modeling capabilities provided by pure::variants, an eclipse plugin for software product line development. The plugin covers all steps of product line development from requirements and variability analysis to product generation. Extended feature models are used for modeling of problem domain. Family models are used to represent the variable architecture of product line solution domains independent of the programming or modeling languages used for product line implementation. Along some concrete examples from the domain of embedded software product lines we will make a round-trip through all steps of the development from domain analysis to product deployment and demonstrate how pure::variants facilitates the entire process. We will show how features are used to model problem domains, how product line architectures are connected with domain models and finally how to integrate concepts of model driven development into the process of product derivation.
