—This paper gives an overview of ROS, an open-source robot operating system. ROS is not an operating system in the traditional sense of process management and scheduling; rather, it provides a structured communications layer above the host operating systems of a heterogenous compute cluster. In this paper, we discuss how ROS relates to existing robot software frameworks, and brieﬂy overview some of the available application software which uses ROS.
