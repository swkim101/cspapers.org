One of the limitations of wildcard rules in Software Defined Networks, such as OpenFlow, is losing visibility. FleXam is a flexible sampling extension for OpenFlow that allows the controller to define which packets should be sampled, what parts of each packet should be selected, and where they should be sent. Here, we present an interactive demo showing how FleXam enables the controller to dynamically adjust sampling rates and change the sampling scheme to optimally keep up with a sampling budget in the context of a traffic statistics collection application.
