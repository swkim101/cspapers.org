Numerous methods have been proposed for person re-identification, most of which however neglect the matching efficiency. Recently, several hashing based approaches have been developed to make re-identification more scalable for large-scale gallery sets. Despite their efficiency, these works ignore cross-camera variations, which severely deteriorate the final matching accuracy. To address the above issues, we propose a novel hashing based method for fast person re-identification, namely Cross-camera Semantic Binary Transformation (CSBT). CSBT aims to transform original high-dimensional feature vectors into compact identity-preserving binary codes. To this end, CSBT first employs a subspace projection to mitigate cross-camera variations, by maximizing intra-person similarities and inter-person discrepancies. Subsequently, a binary coding scheme is proposed via seamlessly incorporating both the semantic pairwise relationships and local affinity information. Finally, a joint learning framework is proposed for simultaneous subspace projection learning and binary coding based on discrete alternating optimization. Experimental results on four benchmarks clearly demonstrate the superiority of CSBT over the state-of-the-art methods.
