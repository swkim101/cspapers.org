Mobile devices such as smartphones and Internet-capable tablets have achieved computing and networking capabilities comparable to traditional personal computers. Their successful consumerization has also become a source of pain for adopting users and organizations. The operating systems supporting these new devices have both advantages and disadvantages with respect to offered security. On one hand, they use application sandboxing to contain exploits and limit privileges given to malware. On the other hand, they collect and organize many forms of security- and privacy-sensitive information simply as a matter of operation, and make that information easily accessible to downloaded third-party applications. Recognizing smartphone security and privacy as the emerging area, this workshop intends to provide a venue for interested researchers and practitioners to get together and exchange ideas, thus to deepen our understanding to various security and privacy issues on smartphones, specifically the platforms such as iOS and Android. To this end, the workshop solicits both technical and position paper submissions with a variety of relevant topics and further strongly encourages novel paradigms and controversial ideas. With strong engagement from our community, the workshop emerges as a vibrant venue for creative debate and interaction in security- and privacy-sensitive areas of computing and communication broadly impacted by smartphones and mobile devices.
