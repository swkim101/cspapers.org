This paper describes FADS --- a Form Application Development System which is an interactive system for the development of form-based database applications. FADS reduces the amount of work required to implement a forms application by suppressing much of the detail which would be required by conventional tools (e.g., a screen definition system, a database system, and a programming language). FADS provides direct access to a relational database, a standard model of the user interface, built-in form constructs, and an integrated development and debugging environment. Using FADS, form applications can be developed quickly and the resulting systems are easy to modify.A prototype implementation of the FADS kernel has been completed.
