Services Computing is emerging as a new discipline. The acceptance of web services technology stems from the fact that services enable easy integration and interoperation of enterprise level distributed systems. However, currently software developers are forced to translate business level service requirements and encode them into programs using low level abstractions such as objects. We propose to introduce language constructs for Service Oriented Programming that would enable raising programming abstractions from objects to services.
