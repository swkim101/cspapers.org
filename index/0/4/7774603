The dynamics of shortest-path routing algorithms bss.ed on distance vectors and link states are investigated. Detailed quantitative comparisons of the distributed Belhnen-Ford algorithm used in several routing protocols in the paa~ an ideal link-state ttlgonthm similar to the one used in OSPF and in the 0S1 intradomain routing protocol, and a loop-free distance-vector algorithm, are made for the network topologies of the 1988 ARPANET, LOSNEâ€™ITOS, DOE-ESNET, and the NSFNET T1 Backbone. Comparisons include the response of the algorithms to link-cost changes and to link end node failures and recoveries. A variety of quantities, including the length of messages and the average nutnber of paths affected by routing lceps, are computed as a function of time after a link or node change. Probabilities of various conditions are also obtained as a function of time, including the existence of loops. As expected, the dwtributed Belhnen-Ford algorithm behaves poorly compared with the other two. However, deciding between a routing protocol based on a link-state algorithm and one based on a loop-free d~tance-vector algorithm depends on the particular network in which it will perform.
