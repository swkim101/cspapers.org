A polyether imide resin composition is proposed which has improved ductility and is less harmful to mating parts during sliding and thus can be used as the material for parts requiring rub resistance and abrasion resistance. It comprises 50-99.5 percent by weight of a polyether imide and 50-0.5 percent by weight of a vulcanizable organopolysiloxane elastomer.
