Designing projects for an upperdivision course in Operating Systems has presented special problems not found in most computer science courses. Because of the importance of writing low-level software that interacts directly with hardware, it is necessary to have a type of environment not found in typical college and university computer laboratories. In traditional time-sharing environments, the underlying operating system supports many different types of activity (other course projects, faculty research, administrative data processing) and therefore must be protected. Student projects that could "crash" the system cannot be permitted.
