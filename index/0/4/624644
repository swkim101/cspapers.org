Many embedded systems comprise several controllers sharing available resources. It is well known that such resource sharing leads to complex timing behavior that can jeopardize stability of control applications, if it is not properly taken into account in the design process, e.g., mapping and scheduling. As opposed to hard real-time systems where meeting the deadline is a critical requirement, control applications do not enforce hard deadlines. Therefore, the traditional real-time analysis approaches are not readily applicable to control applications. Rather, in the context of control applications, stability is often the main requirement to be guaranteed, and can be expressed as the amount of delay and jitter a control application can tolerate. The nominal delay and response-time jitter can be regarded as the two main factors which relate the real-time aspects of a system to control performance and stability. Therefore, it is important to analyze the impact of variations in scheduling parameters, i.e., period and priority, on the nominal delay and response-time jitter and, ultimately, on stability. Based on such an analysis, we address, in this paper, priority assignment and sensitivity analysis problems for control applications considering stability as the main requirement.
