A scheme for syntax-directed translation that mirrors compositional model-theoretic semantics is discussed. The scheme is the basis for an English translation system called PATR and was used to specify a semantically interesting fragment of English, including such constructs as tense, aspect, modals, and various lexically controlled verb complement structures. PATR was embedded in a question-answering system that replied appropriately to questions requiring the computation of logical entailments.
