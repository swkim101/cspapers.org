This paper reports on analyses, trial manufacture, and experiments in the process of developing a transfer supporting equipment, and result of practical evaluations carried out at rehabilitation centers. This report was supported by the Agency of Industrial Science & Technology under the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and NED0 (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization). The equipment will lift and move bedridden people, position them in electric wheelchairs, and move them in such areas as the bath and toilet. This project began in 1983 and we completed the second trial model and clinical evaluations carried out at rehabilitation centers in 1989.
