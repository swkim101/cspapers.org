This paper presents methods for navigating and localizing mobile robots in a known indoor environment. We introduce a restricted visibility concept called a scannable sector that can aid many existing navigation and localization algorithms. The scannable sectors are based on the physical characteristics of the environment and the limitations of the localization sensors used. We describe a complete navigation system that includes a scannable sector based localizer, sonar sensors, and a probabilistic roadmap path planner. Simulation and hardware results using a real robot with sonar sensors show the potential of our approach.
