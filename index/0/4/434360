Sampling as a fundamental operation for the auditing and statistical analysis of large databases is discussed. Methods of obtaining samples from the results of relational queries without first performing the query are presented. Specifically, simple random sampling from selections, projections, joins, unions, and intersections is examined. Also discussed are data structures and algorithms for sampling, and their performance. It is shown how samples of relational queries can often be computed for a small fraction of the effort of computing the entire relational query. (DWL)
