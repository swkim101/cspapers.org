Given a database, structure mining algorithms search for substructures that satisfy constraints such as minimum frequency, minimum confidence, minimum interest and maximum frequency. Examples of substructures include graphs, trees and paths. For these substructures many mining algorithms have been proposed. In order to make graph mining more efficient, we investigate the use of the "quickstart principle", which is based on the fact that these classes of structures are contained in each other, thus allowing for the development of structure mining algorithms that split the search into steps of increasing complexity. We introduce the GrAph/Sequence/Tree extractiON (Gaston) algorithm that implements this idea by searching first for frequent paths, then frequent free trees and finally cyclic graphs. We investigate two alternatives for computing the frequency of structures and present experimental results to relate these alternatives.
