The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC; bjc.edc.org) is curriculum and professional development program developed jointly by EDC and UC Berkeley and endorsed by the College Board for the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles (CSP) exam. The purpose of this course is to attract more students, and particularly girls and underrepresented minority students, to the breadth and depth of ideas in modern computer science. BJC is aimed at helping students develop computational habits of mind including abstraction, modularity, algorithms, and modeling. BJC uses Snap!, a visual programming language based on Scratch, to expose students to the beauty and joy of programming using a project-based learning approach (including games, art, mathematics, language, etc.) and addresses social issues of computing (e.g., privacy, copyright, artificial intelligence, networking, and cybersecurity). This poster will share curriculum examples, results of early research on teacher and student use in New York City schools, teacher and student experiences and feedback, implementation challenges and supports, and preliminary results and outcomes including engagement, attitudes, and achievement.
