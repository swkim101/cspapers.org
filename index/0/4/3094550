However, the psychological notion of intrinsic motivation has recently inspired inquiry into whether there exist alternate reward functions that enable an agent to learn a task more easily than the natural task-based reward function allows. This paper presents an efficient genetic programming algorithm to search for alternate reward functions that improve agent learning performance.
