We introduce a new benchmark "Humans Interacting with Common Objects" (HICO) for recognizing human-object interactions (HOI). We demonstrate the key features of HICO: a diverse set of interactions with common object categories, a list of well-defined, sense-based HOI categories, and an exhaustive labeling of co-occurring interactions with an object category in each image. We perform an in-depth analysis of representative current approaches and show that DNNs enjoy a significant edge. In addition, we show that semantic knowledge can significantly improve HOI recognition, especially for uncommon categories.
