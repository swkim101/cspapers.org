After giving a rich data basis of our impact tests with standardized crash-test dummies in Part I of this work we address in Part II various aspects related to these tests in a case based discussion. The presented facts, the knowledge gained from our previous work, and the data from Part I lead us to recommendations for standardized crash-testing procedures in robotics. The proposed impact procedures will help to compare blunt robot-human impacts on a common basis. We will discuss additional requirements which will enhance the completeness of testing procedures.
