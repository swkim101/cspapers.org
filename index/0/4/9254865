Customizable mobile services are usually expressed with complex services composed of different atomic services. Fine-grained atomic mobile services are not so convenient for end users to reuse. Considering that in identical or similar service domains, a great deal of the business logics and functions are reusable within the scope. So we present a template-based framework to allow reuse of services and to achieve rapid mobile application development. The reusable fine-grained service logics and functions are encapsulated into comparatively coarse-grained templates, from which the designers can create the personalized composite services and edit the templates efficiently.
