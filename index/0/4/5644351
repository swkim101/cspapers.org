We revisit the question of delegation vs. synchronized access to shared memory, and show through analysis and demonstration that delegation can be much faster than locking under a range of common circumstances. Starting from first principles, we propose fast, fly-weight delegation (ffwd). The highly optimized design of ffwd allows it to significantly outperform prior work on delegation, while retaining the scalability advantage. In experiments with 6 benchmark applications, and 6 shared data structures, running on four different multi-socket systems with up to 128 hardware threads, we compare ffwd to a selection of lock, combining, lock-free, software transactional memory and delegation designs. Overall, we find that ffwd often offers a simple and highly competitive alternative to existing work. By definition, the performance of a fully delegated data structure is limited by the single-thread throughput of said data structure. However, due to cache effects, many data structures offer their best performance when confined to a single thread. With an efficient delegation mechanism, we approach this single-threaded performance in a multi-threaded setting. In application-level benchmarks, we see improvements up to 100% over the next best solution tested (RCL), and multiple micro-benchmarks show improvements in the 5-10x range.
