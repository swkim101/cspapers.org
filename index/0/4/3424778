Predicting user responses, such as clicks and conversions, is of great importance and has found its usage inmany Web applications including recommender systems, websearch and online advertising. The data in those applicationsis mostly categorical and contains multiple fields, a typicalrepresentation is to transform it into a high-dimensional sparsebinary feature representation via one-hot encoding. Facing withthe extreme sparsity, traditional models may limit their capacityof mining shallow patterns from the data, i.e. low-order featurecombinations. Deep models like deep neural networks, on theother hand, cannot be directly applied for the high-dimensionalinput because of the huge feature space. In this paper, we proposea Product-based Neural Networks (PNN) with an embeddinglayer to learn a distributed representation of the categorical data, a product layer to capture interactive patterns between interfieldcategories, and further fully connected layers to explorehigh-order feature interactions. Our experimental results on twolarge-scale real-world ad click datasets demonstrate that PNNsconsistently outperform the state-of-the-art models on various metrics.
