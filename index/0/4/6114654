Botnets continue to pose a significant threat to network-based applications and communications over the Internet. A key mitigation strategy has been to take down command and control infrastructure of the botnets. The efficiency of those mitigation methods has not been extensively studied. In this paper we investigate several observable characteristics of botnet command and controls (C&C) and estimate the variability in the survival rate of these C&Cs and the factors that are related to such variability. Furthermore, we show that different type of mitigation efforts have different impact. Kaplan-Meier analysis is performed to evaluate C&C survival ratios in the particular case of the ZeuS botnet. Using a lasso penalized Cox regression model, we identify the factors that influence the lifetime of a C&C. Location, malware family type, registrar, hosting type and popularity are the fundamental factors that explain this variability. Our results show that location and type of hosting are the two factors that affect more significantly the C&C lifetime. Thus, ZeuS C&Cs in certain regions of Asia are prone to stay online longer that those located in Europe.
