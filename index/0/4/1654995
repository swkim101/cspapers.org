This paper presents tangible interaction techniques for fine-tuning one-to-one scale NURBS curves on a large display for automotive design. We developed a new graspable handle with a transparent groove that allows designers to manipulate virtual curves on a display screen directly. The use of the proposed handle leads naturally to a rich vocabulary of terms describing interaction techniques that reflect existing shape styling methods. A user test raised various issues related to the graspable user interface, two-handed input, and large-display interaction.
