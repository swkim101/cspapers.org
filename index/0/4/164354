We present a novel domain analysis methodology that enables network researchers to quickly select the most accurate modeling and analysis method or methods for a given wired or wireless network path and network characteristic of interest e.g., delay, loss, or error process). Our approach includes two classical models, and two data preconditioning models developed in the Tapas project.
