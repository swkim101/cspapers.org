We explore the sequential decision-making problem where the goal is to estimate a number of linear models uniformly well, given a shared budget of random contexts independently sampled from a known distribution. For each incoming context, the decision-maker selects one of the linear models and receives an observation that is corrupted by the unknown noise level of that model. We present Trace-UCB, an adaptive allocation algorithm that learns the models' noise levels while balancing contexts accordingly across them, and prove bounds for its simple regret in both expectation and high-probability. We extend the algorithm and its bounds to the high dimensional setting, where the number of linear models times the dimension of the contexts is more than the total budget of samples. Simulations with real data suggest that Trace-UCB is remarkably robust, outperforming a number of baselines even when its assumptions are violated.
