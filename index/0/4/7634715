We explore how well the intersection between our own everyday memories and those captured by our smartphones can be used for what we call autobiographical authentication-a challenge-response authentication system that queries users about day-to-day experiences. Through three studies-two on MTurk and one field study-we found that users are good, but make systematic errors at answering autobiographical questions. Using Bayesian modeling to account for these systematic response errors, we derived a formula for computing a confidence rating that the attempting authenticator is the user from a sequence of question-answer responses. We tested our formula against five simulated adversaries based on plausible real-life counterparts. Our simulations indicate that our model of autobiographical authentication generally performs well in assigning high confidence estimates to the user and low confidence estimates to impersonating adversaries.
