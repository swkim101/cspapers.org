Autonomous as well as teleoperated robots find wide applications in various environments. Their capability to accomplish complex and dynamic operations can be significantly improved by fusing human intelligence with autonomous algorithms. In this paper, we propose a haptic shared control algorithm to provide flexible human assistance for semi-autonomous mobile robots. Through the admittance and impedance models, the haptic shared controller smoothly puts together human operator inputs with robot autonomy. Further, the level of autonomy is fully determined by the operator with the grasp motion. A decomposed design has been taken for the autonomous controller of the mobile robot. The algorithm was implemented on the haptic interface omega.7 together with a QBot mobile robot, and its feasibility and efficacy have been validated by experiments.
