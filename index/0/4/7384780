The optimised distance-based access methods currently available for multidimensional indexing in multimedia databases are developed based on two major assumptions: a suitable distance function is known a priori and the dimensionality of the image features is low. Unfortunately, these assumptions do not make the problem substantially easier to solve. Motivated by these concerns, we proposed and developed the CMVF (Combining Multi-Visual Features) framework, a fast and robust hybrid method for nonlinear dimension reduction of composite image features for indexing in large image databases [1]. This method incorporates both PCA and non-linear neural network techniques to reduce the dimensions of feature vectors, so that an optimised access method can be applied. In this demonstration, we show that with the CMVF approach a small but well-discriminating feature vector can be obtained for effective indexing. It allows us to incorporate classification information based on human visual perception into the indexing. In addition, the effectiveness of indexing can be improved significantly by the integration of additional image features.
