This paper presents a multiple hypothesis approach to solve the simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) problem with a bearing-only sensor. The main contribution of the paper is to provide a remedy for the landmark initialisation problem that occurs due to the absence of range information, in a computationally efficient manner. Each landmark is initialised in the form of multiple hypotheses distributed along the direction of the bearing measurement. Using subsequent measurements, the validity of the hypotheses is evaluated based on the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). Consequently, the best approximation to the landmark location is maintained. This approach enables an extended Kalman filler (EKF) to be used for bearing-only SLAM providing a computational efficient solution. Simulation and experimental results, from using a camera as the bearing-only sensor mounted on a Pioneer robot are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.
