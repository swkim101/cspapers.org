Fitting sensors to humans and physical structures is becoming more and more common. These developments provide many opportunities for ubiquitous computing, as well as challenges for analyzing the resulting sensor data. From these challenges, an underappreciated problem arises: modeling multivariate time series with mixed sampling rates. Although mentioned in several application papers using sensor systems, this problem has been left almost unexplored, often hidden in a preprocessing step or solved manually as a one-pass procedure (feature extraction/construction). This leaves an opportunity to formalize and develop methods that address mixed sampling rates in an automatic fashion. We approach the problem of dealing with multiple sampling rates from an aggregation perspective. We propose Accordion, a new embedded method that constructs and selects aggregate features iteratively, in a memory-conscious fashion. Our algorithms work on both classification and regression problems. We describe three experiments on real-world time series datasets, with satisfying results.
