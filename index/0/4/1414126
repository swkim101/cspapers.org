Currently gene expression data are being produced at a phenomenal rate. The general objective is to try to gain a better understanding of the functions of cellular tissues. In particular, one specific goal is to relate gene expression to cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. However, a key obstacle is that the availability of analysis tools or lack thereof, impedes the use of the data, making it difficult for cancer researchers to perform analysis efficiently and effectively.
