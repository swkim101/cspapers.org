The ARPANET routing metric was revised in July 1987, resulting in substantial performance improvements, especially in terms of user delay and effective network capacity. These revisions only affect the individual link costs (or metrics) on which the PSN (packet switching node) bases its routing decisions. They do not affect the SPF (“shortest path first”) algorithm employed to compute routes (installed in May 1979). The previous link metric was packet delay averaged over a ten second interval, which performed effectively under light-to-moderate traffic conditions. However, in heavily loaded networks it led to routing instabilities and wasted link and processor bandwidth.
The revised metric constitutes a move away from the strict delay metric: it acts similar to a delay-based metric under lightly loads and to a capacity-based metric under heavy loads. It will not always result in shortest-delay paths. Since the delay metric produced shortest-delay paths only under conditions of light loading, the revised metric involves giving up the guarantee of shortest-delay paths under light traffic conditions for the sake of vastly improved performance under heavy traffic conditions.
