An attribute grammar is a non-procedural specification of a translation from one language to another. In this paper we consider restrictions on attribute grammars to make them <italic>invertible</italic>. Given an attribute grammar defining a translation T: L<subscrpt>1</subscrpt> → L<subscrpt>2</subscrpt> obeying these restrictions, we show how to automatically synthesize the attribute grammar T<supscrpt>-1</supscrpt>: L<subscrpt>2</subscrpt> → L<subscrpt>1</subscrpt> describing the inverse translation; i.e., T &ogr; T<supscrpt>-1</supscrpt> &ogr; T = T. This allows for the generation of <italic>bi-directional</italic> translators from a single description. We provide motivation and demonstrate the practical utility of these concepts by describing the inversion of an attribute grammar used as part of an interface for database users.
