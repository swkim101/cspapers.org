Online newspaper articles can accumulate comments at volumes that prevent close reading. Summarisation of the comments allows interaction at a higher level and can lead to an understanding of the over-all discussion. Comment summarisation requires topic clustering, comment ranking and extraction. Clustering must be robust as the subsequent extraction relies on a good set of clusters. Comment data, as with many social media datasets, contains very short documents and the number of words in the documents is a limiting factors on the performance of LDA clustering. We evaluate whether we can combine comments to form larger documents to improve the quality of clusters. We Ô¨Ånd that combining comments with comments that reply to them produce the highest quality clusters.
