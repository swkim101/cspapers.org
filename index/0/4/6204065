The efficient execution of integration processes between distributed, heterogeneous data sources and applications is a challenging research area of data management. These integration processes are an abstraction for workflow-based integration tasks, used in EAI servers and WfMS. The major problem are significant workload changes during runtime. The performance of integration processes strongly depends on those dynamic workload characteristics, and hence workload-based optimization is important. However, existing approaches of workflow optimization only address the rule-based optimization and disregard changing workload characteristics. To overcome the problem of inefficient process execution in the presence of workload shifts, here, we present an approach for the workload-based optimization of instance-based integration processes and show that significant execution time reductions are possible.
