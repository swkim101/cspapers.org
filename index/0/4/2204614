The study of search satisfaction is one of the prime concerns in search performance evaluation research. Most existing works on search satisfaction primarily rely on the hypothesis that all results on search engine result pages (SERPs) are homogeneous. However, a variety of heterogeneous vertical results such as videos, images and instant answers are aggregated into SERPs by search engines to improve the diversity and quality of search results. In this paper, we carry out a lab-based user study with specifically designed SERPs to determine how verticals with different qualities and presentation styles affect search satisfaction. Users' satisfaction feedback and external assessors' satisfaction annotations are both collected to make a comparison regarding the perception of search satisfaction. Mouse click-through / movement data and eye movement information are also collected such that we can investigate the influence of vertical results from the perspectives of both benefit and cost. Finally, a vertical-aware learning-based prediction method is proposed to predict search satisfaction on aggregated SERPs. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze the effect of verticals on search satisfaction. The results show that verticals with different qualities, presentation styles and positions have different effects on search satisfaction, among which Encyclopedia verticals, as well as Download verticals, will bring the largest improvement. Furthermore, our proposed vertical-aware prediction method outperforms state-of-the-art methods that are designed for search satisfaction prediction in homogeneous environment.
