Reorganization of a keyboard layout based on linguistic characteristics would be an efficient way to improve input text speed. However, a new character layout imposes a learning period that often discourages users. Bi [1] aimed at easing a new layout acceptance by sacrificing the long term performance. We propose a solution based on the multilayer interface concept to achieve the same goal without prejudicing the long term performance. By smoothing the learning period, these strategies reintroduce interest in alternative layouts.
