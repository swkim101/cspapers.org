This paper proposes an opportunistic, reliable and realistic QoS mechanism for bulk data transfers in grids, which maximizes acceptance rate and network resource utilization by using an event based priority queue. The metrics that have been studied in the evaluation of elastic scheduling heuristics are the acceptance percentage and the mean flow time of requests. Some of the existing heuristics for the scheduling of bandwidth requests do not include the communication and computation delays and communication overheads, which are involved in the reliable transfers of such reservations. We have compared our approach with only those existing heuristics which are reliable and include all overheads. We demonstrate the performance improvement by documenting results of simulations.
