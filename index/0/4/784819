We present a non-malleable commitment scheme that retains its security properties even when concurrently executed a polynomial number of times. That is, a man-in-the-middle adversary who is simultaneously participating in multiple concurrent commitment phases of our scheme, both as a sender and as a receiver cannot make the values he commits to depend on the values he receives commitments to. Our result is achieved without assuming an a-priori bound on the number of executions and without relying on any set-up assumptions. Our construction relies on the existence of standard collision resistant hash functions and only requires a constant number of communication rounds.
