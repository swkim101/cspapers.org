Secure computation, e.g. using Yao's garbled circuit protocol, allows two parties to compute arbitrary functions without disclosing their inputs. A profitable application of secure computation is business optimization. It is characterized by a monetary benefit for all participants and a high confidentiality of their respective input data. In most instances the consequences of input disclosure, e.g. loss of bargaining power, outweigh the benefits of collaboration. Therefore these optimizations are currently not performed in industrial practice.
 Our demo shows such an optimization as a secure computation. The joint economic lot size (JELS) is the optimal order quantity between a buyer and supplier. We implemented Yao's protocol in JavaScript, such that it can be executed using two web browsers. This has the additional benefit that the software can be offered as a service (SaaS) and can be easily integrated with other SaaS offerings, e.g. using mash-up technology.
