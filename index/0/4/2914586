The increasing number of XML repositories has provided the impetus to design and develop systems that can store and query XML data efficiently. Non-native XML method could not adequately be customized to support XML, native XML database will be more efficient. Most of existed XML database systems claimed that their systems are schemaindependent. But we argue that schema plays an important role in managing XML data. In this paper, we introduce OrientX, a schema-based native XML database system. Schema information is fully investigated to enhance the efficiency and reliability in every module, including the multigranularity native storage strategy, the cost-based XML optimizer, the schema-based path index , the XML update, and the XML security, etc.
