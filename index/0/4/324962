In High Energy Physics experiments one has to sort through a high flux of events, at a rate of tens of MHz, and select the few that are of interest. One of the key factors in making this decision is the location of the vertex where the interaction, that led to the event, took place. Here we present a novel solution to the problem of finding the location of the vertex, based on two feedforward neural networks with fixed architectures, whose parameters are chosen so as to obtain a high accuracy. The system is tested on simulated data sets, and is shown to perform better than conventional algorithms.
