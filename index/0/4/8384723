The Guides prototype demonstrates the use of narrative metaphor and anthropomorphic agents for browsing a multimedia database of early American history. The Guides are characters drawn from this period, and are explained through the use of video stories. In addition to delivering these stories, they make recommendations of database items to be browsed which are consistent with their interests. The System Guide, a contemporary figure, delivers both voice-over help information and browsing suggestions based on extrapolations of the user’s interests. Options are also available for directed search and construction of guides which represent the user’s own interests.
