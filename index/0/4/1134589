We study the question of basing symmetric key cryptography on weak secrets. In this setting, Alice and Bob share an n-bit secret W, which might not be uniformly random, but the adversary has at least k bits of uncertainty about it (formalized using conditional min-entropy). Since standard symmetric-key primitives require uniformly random secret keys, we would like to construct an authenticated key agreement protocol in which Alice and Bob use W to agree on a nearly uniform key R, by communicating over a public channel controlled by an active adversary Eve. We study this question in the information theoretic setting where the attacker is computationally unbounded. We show that single-round (i.e. one message) protocols do not work when k ≤ n/2, and require poor parameters even when n/2<k ln.
 On the other hand, for arbitrary values of k, we design a communication efficient two-round (challenge-response) protocol extracting nearly k random bits. This dramatically improves the previous construction of Renner and Wolf [32], which requires Θ(λ + log(n)) rounds where λ is the security parameter. Our solution takes a new approach by studying and constructing <i>"non-malleable" seeded randomness extractors</i> -- if an attacker sees a random seed X and comes up with an arbitrarily related seed X', then we bound the relationship between R= Ext(W;X) and R' = Ext(W;X').
 We also extend our two-round key agreement protocol to the "fuzzy" setting, where Alice and Bob share "close" (but not equal) secrets W<sub>A</sub> and W<sub>B</sub>, and to the Bounded Retrieval Model (BRM) where the size of the secret W is huge.
