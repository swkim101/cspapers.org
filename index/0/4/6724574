The impact of spot defects on the susceptibility for electrical failure of a net is analyzed. Based on this analysis, a general routing cost function is presented, in which the manufacturability of a net is taken into account in conjunction with the traditional routing objectives. The new cost function, relating the process spot defects to the routing procedure has been implemented. For the benchmark layouts obtained by both the original routing tool and the new routing module, the failure probabilities are analyzed. The results show that the failure probability of a layout is significantly decreased if the spot defect mechanism is taken into account in the routing procedure, while the area of the layout is kept constant.
