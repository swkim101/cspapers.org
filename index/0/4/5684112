The concept of Bond Graph (BG), introduced by Paynter and perfected by Karnopp and Rosenberg [1] contributed a unified method to describe dynamic models of multidisciplinary systems since they can be modelled using elements possessing the properties of generation (Se, Sf), storage (I, C), dissipation (R) and transformation of energy (TF, GY). These elements interrelate in a conservative energy field by means of bonds that indicate the energy transfer and bonds (0, 1), which symbolise the system's dynamic behaviour. The resulting structure offers a global view of the system and its physical structure. Moreover, after obtaining causality, this technique also offers the computational structure and reveals any possible mathematical problems in simulating it. The entire system remains open and accessible unlike the classical methods. 
 
Starting out from a study of the different simulation programs available, this paper presents a simulation program based on the BG technique, which represents a considerable advance towards improving current automatic modelling methods. As will be seen in the following pages, the technique contributes a causal assignation algorithm specifically designed to allow the modeller maximum freedom without their having to take any kind of decision that might affect the end calculation. It also automatically provides the optimised, reduced state equations required to symbolically analyse linear and non-linear systems. To do so, it solves the problems arising when simulating models with differential causality without any need to modify the graph charts and reduces the model to the set of differential equations required to perform the simulation, eliminating where possible the restriction equations, thereby reducing the computation time used in the simulation.
