Tightly coupled parallel applications are increasingly run in Grid environments. Unfortunately, on many Grid sites the ability of machines to create or accept network connections is severely limited by ?rewalls, network address translation (NAT)or non-routed networks. Multi homing further complicates connection setup and machine identi?cation. Although ad-hoc solutions exist for some of these problems, it is usually up to the application's user to discover the cause of the connectivity problems and ?nd a solution. In this paper we describe SmartSockets1 a communication library that lifts this burden by automatically discovering the connectivity problems and solving them with as little support from the user as possible.
