Several hardware patterns matching algorithms are presented in this paper. These algorithms work directly on data residing on secondary storage devices, like rotating disks. The first algorithm presented recognizes the existence of repeating subpatterns within a pattern by simple hardware. The second algorithm does this by preprocessing the pattern. The pattern matching operations are implemented by a sequence of cascaded one-character comparators, and special status bits for each character. The basic pattern matching circuit thus developed, is then used to implement a more general information retrieval system, providing both content and context search.
