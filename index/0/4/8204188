In this paper a modification of the time domain passivity controller is presented to improve its performance and transparency in case of multi degrees of freedom (dof) haptic interaction. In multi-dof application the concept needs to be extended by additional conditions to distribute the adaptive damping appropriately among the degrees of freedom. This can be solved by using the geometrical information coded in the output signals of the system. Experiments show the validity of this concept.
