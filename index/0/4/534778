Nowadays people are exposed to huge amounts of information that are generated continuously. However, current mobile applications, Web pages, and Location-Based Services (LBSs) are designed for specific scenarios and goals. In this demo we show the system SHERLOCK, which searches and shares up-to-date knowledge from nearby devices to relieve the user from knowing and managing such knowledge directly. Besides, the system guides the user in the process of selecting the service that best fits his/her needs in the given context.
