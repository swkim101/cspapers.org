In this paper we present a method of calibrating the omnidirectional sensor used in our laboratory and named SYCLOP ("Conic System for Localization and Perception"). In order to have better precision than that obtained in classical applications using this kind of sensor, we highlight the importance of calibration for the whole sensor. After this step we validate our model by a reconstruction of objects, and of an environment from two different methods, the first based on a commercial software 3DS Max/sup (R)/ and the second based on a simulator developed by us and taking parameters determined in the previous stage. The real and calculated pictures are compared, to estimate the error of reconstruction. The last part of this paper presents results obtained with the SYCLOP simulator and an experimental phase.
