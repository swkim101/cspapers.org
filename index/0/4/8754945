Motivated by the problem of centralized market clearing in a market with probabilistic supply and demand, we introduce the Stochastic Packing-Market Planning problem (SPMP), which is a stochastic generalization of the Maximum <i>k</i>-Set Packing problem. We provide an <i>O</i>(<i>k</i>) approximation algorithm for SPMP, as well as a <i>O</i>(<i>k</i>) approximation mechanism that is truthful in expectation. This matches up to constants the best approximation ratio known for Maximum <i>k</i>-Set Packing. Along the way, we develop techniques for obtaining sparse subhypergraphs of an input hypergraph that preserves <i>E</i><sub><i>p</i></sub>(â€¢) up to an O(<i>k</i>) factor, where <i>E</i><sub><i>p</i></sub>(<i>G</i>) measures the expected weight of a maximum weight set packing in a random subhypergraph of <i>G</i>. We also give a linear programming based approximation for <i>E</i><sub><i>p</i></sub>(<i>G</i>). These techniques may be of independent interest.
