We discuss semantic composition in Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) and Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics (RMRS). We demonstrate that a previously defined formal algebra applies to grammar engineering across a much greater range of frameworks than was originally envisaged. We show how this algebra can be adapted to composition in grammar frameworks where a lexicon is not assumed, and how this underlies a practical implementation of semantic construction for the RASP system.
