In order to provide quality care for aged and disabled people without causing physical and mental burden to patients and nurses, we have developed a prototype of a wearable typed robotic system, named HARO (Human-Assisting Robot), that is operated by a nurse to amplify his or her physical power. This paper proposes a design method of force control system with consideration of transition of interaction force to a patient during certain nursing motion.
