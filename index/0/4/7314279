We study independent component analysis with noisy observations. We present, for the first time in the literature, consistent, polynomial-time algorithms to recover non-Gaussian source signals and the mixing matrix with a reconstruction error that vanishes at a 1/âˆšT rate using T observations and scales only polynomially with the natural parameters of the problem. Our algorithms and analysis also extend to deterministic source signals whose empirical distributions are approximately independent.
