In this paper we investigate unsupervised name transliteration using comparable corpora, corpora where texts in the two languages deal in some of the same topics --- and therefore share references to named entities --- but are not translations of each other. We present two distinct methods for transliteration, one approach using an unsupervised phonetic transliteration method, and the other using the temporal distribution of candidate pairs. Each of these approaches works quite well, but by combining the approaches one can achieve even better results. We believe that the novelty of our approach lies in the phonetic-based scoring method, which is based on a combination of carefully crafted phonetic features, and empirical results from the pronunciation errors of second-language learners of English. Unlike previous approaches to transliteration, this method can in principle work with any pair of languages in the absence of a training dictionary, provided one has an estimate of the pronunciation of words in text.
