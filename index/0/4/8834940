Given a collection of document groups, a quick question is what are the differences in these groups. In this paper, we study a novel problem of summarizing the differences between document groups. A discriminative sentence selection method is proposed to extract the most discriminative sentences which represent the specific characteristics of each document group. Experiments on real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
