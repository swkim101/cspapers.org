In the concurrent object-oriented programming methodology, a system is described by concurrent objects which communicate with each others by various communication facilities, i.e., synchronous/asynchronous(future) message passing. Those facilities help up to implement application programs based on the client/server model. It is, however, difficult to describe application programs such that concurrent objects may simultaneously initiate communication with each other. Such objects are called autonomous objects. In this paper, we propose the notion of the visible and intensive sets, and a communication mechanism using those sets which enables us to handle communication among autonomous objects safely and easily.
