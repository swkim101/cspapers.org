The author proposed concepts of Operator Fuzzy Logic and-Resolution in 1984. He and his cooperaters have obtained some theoretical results. This paper introduces-paramodulation to handle a set of clauses with the predicate of equality, and thus the equality substitution can be used in fuzzy reasoning. Then the-paramodulation method is proved to be complete with lock-semantic method. Finally, Yang Fengjie and I have improved the paramodulation, and proved that the linear paramodulation is complete too.
