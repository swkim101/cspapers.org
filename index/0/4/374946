Recent studies provide evidence that Quality of Service (QoS) routing can provide increased network utilization compared to routing that is not sensitive to QoS requirements of traffic. However, there are still strong concerns about the increased cost of QoS routing, both in terms of more complex and frequent computations and increased routing protocol overhead. The main goals of this paper are to study these two cost components, and propose solutions that achieve good routing performance with reduced processing cost. First, we identify the parameters that determine the protocol traffic overhead, namely (a) policy for triggering updates, (b) sensitivity of this policy, and (c) clamp down timers that limit the rate of updates. Using simulation, we study the relative significance of these factors and investigate the relationship between routing performance and the amount of update traffic. In addition, we explore a range of design options to reduce the processing cost of QoS routing algorithms, and study their effect on routing performance. Based on the conclusions of these studies, we develop extensions to the basic QoS routing, that can achieve good routing performance with limited update generation rates. The paper also addresses the impact on the results of a number of secondary factors such as topology, high level admission control, and characteristics of network traffic.
