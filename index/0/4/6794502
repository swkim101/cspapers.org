In this paper, we propose a novel approach for scene modeling. The proposed method is able to automatically discover the intermediate semantic concepts. We utilize Maximization of Mutual Information (MMI) co-clustering approach to discover clusters of semantic concepts, which we call intermediate concepts. Each intermediate concept corresponds to a cluster of visterms in the bag of Vis- terms (BOV) paradigm for scene classification. MMI co- clustering results in fewer but meaningful clusters. Unlike k-means which is used to cluster image patches based on their appearances in BOV, MMI co-clustering can group the visterms which are highly correlated to some concept. Unlike probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA), which can be considered as one-sided soft clustering, MMI co- clustering simultaneously clusters visterms and images, so it is able to boost both clustering. In addition, the MMI co- clustering is an unsupervised method. We have extensively tested our proposed approach on two challenging datasets: the fifteen scene categories and the LSCOM dataset, and promising results are obtained.
