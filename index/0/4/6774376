Conventional password-based authentication has been widely used due to its simplicity, familiarity, and cost effectiveness. However, the conventional password-based authentication has a fundamental weak-point that cleartext passwords are kept on client-side devices and networks. In order to acquire a user's password securely, we suggest a novel method that splits the roles of user interface onto two devices. With our method, cleartext passwords are neither stored on any devices nor transmitted over communication channels. Finally, we implement a demo application and analyze our method in the aspects of usability, deployability, and security.
