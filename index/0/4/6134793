In the approximate Euclidean min-cost perfect matching problem, we are a given a set V of 2n points in the plane, and a real number E > 0, and we want to pair up the points (into n pairs) so that the sum of the distances between the paired points is within a multiplicative factor of (1 + E) of the optimal. We present a Monte-Carlo algorithm that returns, with probability at least l/2, a solution within (1 + E) of the optimal; the running time of our algorithm is O((n/s3) log6 n). In the bipartite version of this problem, we are given a set R of n red points, a set B of n blue points in the plane, and a real number E > 0. We want to match each red point with a blue point so that the sum of the distances between paired points is within (1 + E) times that of an optimal matching. We present au algorithm for this problem that runs in O((~/E)~/* log5 n) time.
