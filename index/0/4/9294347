This paper presents an approach to query construction to detect multilingual dictionaries for predetermined language combinations on the web, based on the identification of terms which are likely to occur in bilingual dictionaries but not in general web documents. We use eight target languages for our case study, and train our method on pre-identified multilingual dictionaries and theWikipedia dump for each of our languages.
