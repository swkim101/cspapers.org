The kinematic redundancy enables a robot to change its joint configuration without changing the pose of the end-effector or the object. In addition to the requirement of path tracking in Cartesian space, many tasks require a manipulator to achieve more than one performance criteria or take into account some manipulation constraints. In this paper, a fuzzy logic approach is proposed for the desired joint path generation for redundant manipulators with consideration of multiple criteria. Performance criteria are fuzzified and their relative importance measures are introduced. The desired joint path is determined based on the relative importance of various criteria and the satisfaction measures of each candidate joint angle to all criteria by a fuzzy logic multiple criteria decision making process. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed method can generate a path which can satisfy two performance criteria.<<ETX>>
