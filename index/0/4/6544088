This paper describes cost-based query transformation in Oracle relational database system, which is a novel phase in query optimization. It discusses a suite of heuristic- and cost-based transformations performed by Oracle. It presents the framework for cost-based query transformation, the need for such a framework, possible interactions among some of the transformation, and efficient algorithms for enumerating the search space of cost-based transformations. It describes a practical technique to combine cost-based transformations with a traditional physical optimizer. Some of the challenges of cost-based transformation are highlighted. Our experience shows that some transformations when performed in a cost-based manner lead to significant execution time improvements.
