Consider the following three-stage strategy for recognizing patterns in larger scenes: Mimic randomization deterministically. Sample several positions of the pattern.Search for sample. Find all occurrences of the sample in the scene. Verify. For each occurrence of the sample, verify occurrence of the full pattern.This strategy has led to the core of the new idea given in this paper. Consider the string matching problem. Given the pattern, a sample of its positions is carefully selected whose size is at most logarithmic (the deterministic sample). Then, the sample is searched for. For nonperiodic patterns, the sample has the following perhaps surprising property. It is possible to disqualify all occurrences of the sample positions but one, within each “neighborhood” of locations in the text, without any further comparisons of characters. This provides sparse verification.This approach enables the text analysis (stages “search for sample” and “verify”) to be performed in $O(\log ^ * n)$ time and optimal spe...
