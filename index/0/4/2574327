The paper describes TCPTE, a framework that supports the development of thin-client applications for mobile devices. By using this framework, Java AWT applications can be executed on a server and their graphical interfaces can be displayed on a remote client. TCPTE combines in a single framework the advantages of thin-client computing with the richness of client-server graphical interfaces and the simplicity of development that characterizes desktop applications.
