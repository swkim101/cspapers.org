In this paper we give a characterization of functions that are simple with respect to communication complexity. More precisely we prove that if the communicat ion complexity of a function remains below a constant c, then there is a commuta t ive semigroup of size at most exp(exp(exp(exp(exp(c))))) that represents the function in a natural way. As a consequence we deduce that unbounded fanin circuits with gates with bounded symmetr ic communicat ion complexity can be simulated by circuits with AND, OK and MODm gates for bounded m, with only a quadrat ic increase in size and a constant factor increase in depth. This shows the robustness of the class of the aforementioned circuits suggesting a possible new approach to lower bounds. *The research was done in tile Computer Science Department of The University of Chicago.

Player 1 receives the values of the variables in Y and Player 2 receives the values of the variables in Z. The communication complexity of f with respect to the partition (Y, Z) is the number of bits the parties have to exchange in the worst case when jointly trying to evaluate the value of f according to an optimal protocol.
