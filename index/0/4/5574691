Computer architectures may be characterized by their operational principle and their physical structure. The paper defines these two characteristics for the novel concept of data structure architectures (DSAs). The representation and processing of arbitrary data structures in such a DSA is demonstrated by examples. It is shown how the functional requirements of a DSA can be satisfied by the specific information structure and the physical structure of the STARLET architecture introduced in preceding publications.
