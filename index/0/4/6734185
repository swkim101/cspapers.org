This abstract suggests that some of the unusual findings in the primate learning literature may reflect evolved solutions to the problem of safe learning in intelligent agents. We also propose a research program for trying to model this learning, and incorporate it into agent architectures and development methodology. This extended abstract is actually a summary of a research proposal we have submitted for funding. If we donâ€™t actually wind up being funded to do this work, we will probably withdraw this paper from your symposium, unless you are very interested and we can find travel funding elsewhere!
