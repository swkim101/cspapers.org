This paper describes an approach to improve summaries for a collection of Twitter posts created using the Phrase Reinforcement (PR) Algorithm (Sharifi et al., 2010a). The PR algorithm often generates summaries with excess text and noisy speech. We parse these summaries using a dependency parser and use the dependencies to eliminate some of the excess text and build better-formed summaries. We compare the results to those obtained using the PR Algorithm.
