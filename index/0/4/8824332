This paper introduces UNU, an online platform that enables networked users to assemble in real-time swarms and tackle problems as an Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI). Modeled after biological swarms, UNU enables large groups of networked users to work together in real-time synchrony, forging a unified dynamic system that can quickly answer questions and make decisions. Early testing suggests that human swarming has significant potential for harnessing the Collective Intelligence (CI) of online groups, often exceeding the natural abilities of individual participants.
