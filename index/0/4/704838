Since 2000, Baidu has set its mission as providing the best way for people to find what they're looking for. Today, the company has become the world's largest Chinese search engine. Everyday, we process billions of search queries and serve hundreds of millions of internet users. The huge volume of online text and multimedia content, as well as user log data, provide us unprecedented opportunities and challenges for further accomplishing our mission. In addition, we have seen several megatrends, cloud computing is becoming a pervasive service infrastructure, mobile internet will surpass traditional internet in user time spend, and social platform has demonstrated its great power. In response to all these opportunities, challenges, and megatrends, we must think ahead on the major technology focuses that may help Baidu to serve our users better. In this talk, I would like to share with the audience the nine areas that are the most important and interesting in my mind. For each of the areas, I will describe the challenges and explain why it is important and interesting. I hope the research community can get excited, and help us provide better services for users.
