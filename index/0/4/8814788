However, for one of the most important natural voting systems, the Borda Count, only a few such complexity results are known. We reduce the number of missing cases by pinpointing the complexity of three control scenarios for Borda elections, including some that arguably are among the practically most relevant ones. We also study online candidate control, an interesting dynamical, partial-information model due to Hemaspaandra et al. (2012a), who mainly focused on general complexity bounds by constructing artificial voting systemsâ€”only recently they succeeded in classifying four problems of online candidate control for one natural voting system: sequential plurality (Hemaspaandra et al. 2016). We settle the complexity of another four natural cases: constructive and destructive online control by deleting and adding candidates in sequential Borda elections.
