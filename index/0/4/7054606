Temporal aliasing artifacts are common in both computer generated and natural motion sequences. One of the most striking manifestations of temporal aliasing is the apparent reversal of motion commonly referred to as the "wagon wheel effect." In this paper, we examine temporal aliasing from the standpoint of joint spatiotemporal/spatiotemporal-frequency representations. We show that apparent motion reversal can be explained using these representations, and demonstrate that a motion estimation algorithm based on such a representation (the 3-D Gabor transform) can accurately predict this illusion.
