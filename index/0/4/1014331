There is growing interest in computing courses for non-CS majors. We have recently built such a course that has met with positive response. We describe our design process, which includes involvement of stakeholders and identifying a context that facilitates learning. We present evaluation results on success rates (approximately 90% of the students earn an A, B, or C) and impact of the course on students over time (80% report that the class has influenced them more than a semester later).
