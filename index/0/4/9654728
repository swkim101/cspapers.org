This paper discusses the application of a procedural semantics framework to autonomous robots. We model insights from decades of research in cognitive linguistics and empirical research to develop a system capable of autonomously producing and interpreting German locative utterances. The system is tested in the real world using a population of robots that talk to each other via natural language.
