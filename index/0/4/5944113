In this paper we investigate plant photosynthesis and microbial fuel cells. We report the following: 1) we introduce and validate a novel multi-objective optimization algorithm, PMO2; 2) in photosynthesis we increase the yield of 135%, while in Geobacter sulfurreducens we determine the tradeoff for growth versus redox properties; 3) finally, we discuss Pareto-Front as an estimator of robust metabolic pathways.
