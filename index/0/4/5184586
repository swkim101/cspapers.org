In the past decades Monte Carlo methods proved to be of a great importance in both theory and applications. There are several main techniques for bounding the convergence of Markov chains used in the analysis of algorithms. While they are powerful in some examples, they are weak in others. Here we will show how the use of a largely forgotten strong stationary time technique due to Aldous and Diaconis (see [1]) can improve some old bounds and give new bounds in cases when other techniques fail. We will restrict ourselves to random walks (r.w.) on groups, which can defined as nearest neighbor random walks on Cayley graphs. Among others, we obtain bound O(n2.5) on a mixing time for a random walk on a group of upper triangular matrices. A bound O(n3.5 log log n) is given for a group of real orthogonal matrices generated by random rotations. While in the first case only a weaker O(n3 log n) bound was known (see [8]), no polynomial bound was known in the second case. We also show that at least theoretically one can always speed up the random walk on a group G by changing the probability of generators as well as by considering liftings to nonreversible Markov chains on G×G. The first approach improves mixing from a general bound O(|S|∆2 log |G|) to O(∆2 log |G|), while the second improves further to O(∆ log |G|) (∆ denotes the diameter). The first result solves an open problem of Aldous and Fill (see [2]), while the second can be generalized to all Markov chains by use of multicommodity flows (joint work with L. Lovasz).
