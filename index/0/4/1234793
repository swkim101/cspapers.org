Symmetric positive definite (spd) matrices pervade numerous scientific disciplines, including machine learning and optimization. We consider the key task of measuring distances between two spd matrices; a task that is often nontrivial whenever the distance function must respect the non-Euclidean geometry of spd matrices. Typical non-Euclidean distance measures such as the Riemannian metric δR(X, Y) = ||log(Y-1/2XY-1/2)||F, are computationally demanding and also complicated to use. To allay some of these difficulties, we introduce a new metric on spd matrices, which not only respects non-Euclidean geometry but also offers faster computation than δR while being less complicated to use. We support our claims theoretically by listing a set of theorems that relate our metric to δR(X, Y), and experimentally by studying the nonconvex problem of computing matrix geometric means based on squared distances.
