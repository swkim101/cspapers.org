We present results of machine learning experiments designed to identify user corrections of speech recognition errors in a corpus collected from a train information spoken dialogue system. We investigate the predictive power of features automatically computable from the prosody of the turn, the speech recognition process, experimental conditions, and the dialogue history. Our best performing features reduce classification error from baselines of 25.70-28.99% to 15.72%.
