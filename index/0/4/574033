A significant challenge in programming robots by demonstration is to accurately capture the user's intentions, so that sensor differences can be managed during playback. Sensor difference can be caused by: natural sensory data variations, minor variations in the task conditions, significant changes in the task scenario, or because the task requires a new set of actions to be executed. This paper presents a design for a programming by demonstration system that focuses on the important goal of capturing the intentions of the user during the demonstration. A gesture interface for a large touch screen is used during demonstration, to capture more clearly the user's intentions for robot movements, and also during a pre- playback session to capture the user's intentions regarding sensor data.
