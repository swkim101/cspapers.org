In this paper, we explore the use of sequences of small code writing questions ("concept questions") designed to incrementally evaluate single programming concepts. We report on a study of student performance on a CS1 final examination that included a traditional code-writing question and four intentionally corresponding concept questions. We find that the concept questions are significant predictors of performance on both the corresponding code-writing question and the final exam as a whole. We argue that concept questions provide more accurate formative feedback and simplify marking by reducing the number of variants that must be considered. An analysis of responses categorized by the students' previous programming experience suggests that inexperienced students have the most to gain from the use of concept questions.
