In this paper, we briefly describe the implementation of various Open Geospatial Consortium Web Service Interface Standards in Oracle Spatial 11g. We highlight how we utilize Oracle's implementation of OASIS Web Services Security (WSS) to provide a robust security framework for these OGC Web Services. We also discuss our future direction in supporting OGC Web Service Interface Standards.
