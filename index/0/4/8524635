This work was motivated by the study of a multitree approach to reliability in distributed networks and by the study of non-separating paths and cycles in highly connected graphs. We first give a result on "non-separating chains" in 4-connected graphs. This result is then used to obtain a "non-separating chain decomposition" of a 4-connected graph <i>G</i>, and an <i>O</i>(|<i>V</i>(<i>G</i>)|<sup>2</sup>|<i>E</i>(<i>G</i>)|) algorithm for constructing such a decomposition. As an application of this decomposition, we show how to produce four "independent spanning trees" in a 4-connected graph in <i>O</i>(|<i>V</i>(<i>G</i>)|<sup>3</sup>) time.
