However, due to unavoidable uncertainty over models, it is difficult to obtain an exact specification of an MDP. We are interested in solving MDPs, where transition and reward functions are not exactly specified. Existing research has primarily focussed on computing infinite horizon stationary policies when optimizing robustness, regret and percentile based objectives. We focus specifically on finite horizon problems with a special emphasis on objectives that are separable over individual instantiations of model uncertainty (i.e., objectives that can be expressed as a sum over instantiations of model uncertainty): (a) First, we identify two separable objectives for uncertain MDPs: Average Value Maximization (AVM) and Confidence Probability Maximisation (CPM). (b) Second, we provide optimization based solutions to compute policies for uncertain MDPs with such objectives. In particular, we exploit the separability of AVM and CPM objectives by employing Lagrangian dual decomposition(LDD). (c) Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the LDD approach on a benchmark problem from the literature.
