Solutions to resource allocation problems in distributed systems are examined with respect to the measures of response time, message complexity, and failure locality. Response time measures the time it takes for an algorithm to respond to the requests of a process, message complexity measures the number of messages sent and received by a process, and failure locality characterizes the size of the network that is affected by the failure of a single process. An algorithm that achieves a constant failure locality of four along with a quadratic response time and a quadratic message complexity is presented.
