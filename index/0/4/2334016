A polymer based vortex micropump fabricated by micro molding replication technique is described in this paper. The optically transparent and biocompatible material used to fabricate the micropump will enable the pump to be applied on many biomedical and chemical analyses applications. Fluid transmission of the vortex micropump is driven by the circumrotating motion of an impeller inside the micropump. The pump rate can reach 2.5 ml/min at a low operating voltage of 3 V with a power consumption of 345 m W from the experimental results. The fabrication process and performance characterization of this novel micropump is described in this paper.
