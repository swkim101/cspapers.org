We propose a general framework for multi-context reasoning which allows us to combine arbitrary monotonic and nonmonotonic logics. Nonmonotonic bridge rules are used to specify the information flow among contexts. We investigate several notions of equilibrium representing acceptable belief states for our multi-context systems. The approach generalizes the heterogeneous monotonic multi-context systems developed by F. Giunchiglia and colleagues as well as the homogeneous nonmonotonic multi-context systems of Brewka, Serafini and Roelofsen.
