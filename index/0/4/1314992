We propose a fast and scalable method for semi-supervised learning of sequence models, based on anchor words and moment matching. Our method can handle hidden Markov models with feature-based log-linear emissions. Unlike other semi-supervised methods, no decoding passes are necessary on the unlabeled data and no graph needs to be constructedâ€” only one pass is necessary to collect moment statistics. The model parameters are estimated by solving a small quadratic program for each feature. Experiments on part-of-speech (POS) tagging for Twitter and for a low-resource language (Malagasy) show that our method can learn from very few annotated sentences.
