In this paper we propose a method to automatically recover a class specific low dimensional spherical harmonic basis from a set of in-the-wild facial images. We combine existing techniques for uncalibrated photometric stereo and low rank matrix decompositions in order to robustly recover a combined model of shape and identity. We build this basis without aid from a 3D model and show how it can be combined with recent efficient sparse facial feature localisation techniques to recover dense 3D facial shape. Unlike previous works in the area, our method is very efficient and is an order of magnitude faster to train, taking only a few minutes to build a model with over 2000 images. Furthermore, it can be used for real-time recovery of facial shape.
