This paper describes an automatic PLA synthesis (APLAS) system which automatically generates a PLA for the control function of a design from a DDL-P description of a digital system. APLAS can also minimize and partition the PLA to meet the design constraints. This is a very convenient tool for designing finite state machines. The control circuit of any digital system for which a state diagram can be drawn can be designed easily using this system.
