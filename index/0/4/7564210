SUMMARY College computer science enrollments dropped drastically between 2000 and 2004 with record decreases of 60% nationwide. [5] Reasons given for the waning interest in computer science and IT related fields include media attention to offshore outsourcing and the dot com.bust, as well as incorrect perceptions about the field of computer science [8]. Although offshoring has increased during the last few years, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, more IT jobs are available now than during the dot.com boom. [1]. Furthermore, over half the jobs in a list of the top ten fastest-growing jobs over the next decade are computer science related. This panel describes four projects that aim to increase computer science enrollments by providing enhanced curricula to K-12 students. All projects are funded by the Department of Graduate Education - National Science Foundation GK-12 Teaching Fellowships awards. These Fellowships place graduate students majoring in STEM (science, technology, engineering, or mathematics) disciplines in K-12 classrooms. The Fellows work with teachers to bring their research into the classroom in an effort to motivate students to become the next generation of scientists.
