Dropped Pronouns (DP) in which pronouns 
are frequently dropped in the source language 
but should be retained in the target language 
are challenge in machine translation. In response to this problem, we propose a semisupervised approach to recall possibly missing 
pronouns in the translation. Firstly, we build 
training data for DP generation in which the 
DPs are automatically labelled according to 
the alignment information from a parallel corpus. Secondly, we build a deep learning-based 
DP generator for input sentences in decoding 
when no corresponding references exist. More 
specifically, the generation is two-phase: (1) 
DP position detection, which is modeled as a 
sequential labelling task with recurrent neural 
networks; and (2) DP prediction, which employs a multilayer perceptron with rich features. Finally, we integrate the above outputs 
into our translation system to recall missing 
pronouns by both extracting rules from the 
DP-labelled training data and translating the 
DP-generated input sentences. Experimental 
results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement of 1.58 BLEU points in 
translation performance with 66% F-score for 
DP generation accuracy.
