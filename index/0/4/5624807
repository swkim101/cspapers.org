The main aspect in multi-robot exploration is the efficient coordination of a group of robots. Inspired by previous results on the coverage problem, we propose a novel, frontier-based approach for multi-robot exploration. This approach merges the step of choosing appropriate target points with the step of planning a collision-free path. This is achieved by optimizing an objective function consisting of distance and orientation costs as well as an estimated information gain. The optimization yields motion control laws directly solving the exploration task. Using a Voronoi partition of the environment ensures, that each robot autonomously creates and optimizes the objective function to obtain a collision-free path in a distributed fashion. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
