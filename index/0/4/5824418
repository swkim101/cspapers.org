Lightweight protocols for remote service invocation via HTTP and XML, such as SOAP, are rapidly gaining acceptance among developers of Internet-based e-services, especially because of their rewall-traversal capabilities. However, no standard technique for access control security is currently de ned for either HTTP or SOAP itself. Concerns have been raised about the possibility that di erent SOAP applications will deal with embedded security in different ways, leading to application-dependent security holes. In this paper, we propose an approach that relies on the XML structure of SOAP requests to support ne-grained authorizations at the level of individual XML elements and attributes that compose a SOAP call. The result is a simple, yet powerful and general, technique to enforce access restrictions to SOAP invocations.
