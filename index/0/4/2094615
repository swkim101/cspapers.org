Incorporating multiple types of relational information from heterogeneous networks has been proved effective in data mining. Although Wikipedia is one of the most famous heterogeneous network, previous works of semantic analysis on Wikipedia are mostly limited on single type of relations. In this paper, we aim at incorporating multiple types of relations to measure the semantic relatedness between Wikipedia entities. We propose a framework of coordinate matrix factorization to construct lowdimensional continuous representation for entities, categories and words in the same semantic space. We formulate this task as the completion of a sparse entity-entity association matrix, in which each entry quantifies the strength of relatedness between corresponding entities. We evaluate our model on the task of judging pair-wise word similarity. Experiment result shows that our model outperforms both traditional entity relatedness algorithms and other representation learning models.
