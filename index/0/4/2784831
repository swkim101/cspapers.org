This paper suggests refinements for the Distributional Similarity Hypothesis. Our proposed hypotheses relate the distributional behavior of pairs of words to lexical entailment -- a tighter notion of semantic similarity that is required by many NLP applications. To automatically explore the validity of the defined hypotheses we developed an inclusion testing algorithm for characteristic features of two words, which incorporates corpus and web-based feature sampling to overcome data sparseness. The degree of hypotheses validity was then empirically tested and manually analyzed with respect to the word sense level. In addition, the above testing algorithm was exploited to improve lexical entailment acquisition.
