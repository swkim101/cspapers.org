Recognizing the expressive power of graph representation and the ability of certain graph grammars to generalize, we attempt to use graph grammar learning for concept formation. In this paper we describe our initial progress toward that goal, and focus on how certain graph grammars can be learned from examples. We also establish grounds for using graph grammars in machine learning tasks. Several examples are presented to highlight the validity of the approach.
