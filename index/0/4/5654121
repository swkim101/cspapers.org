Model transformation methods are vital in several applications such as OMG's Model-Driven Architecture and Visual Model Processors. This paper contributes a metamodel-based rewriting rule representation similar to the UML class diagram and the supporting algorithms to determine valid instances of the patterns. The proposed algorithms are illustrated by specific examples throughout the paper. The results turn out to be useful not only for UML class diagram-based rewriting rule formulation patterns, but it provides a method for checking valid instantiation of UML class diagrams in modeling environments.
