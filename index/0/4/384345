This paper describes a method for the identification of moving objects by a team of robots based on kinematic information. The objective is to be able to identify moving objects observed by different robots without using specific landmarks. Our method uses a Bayesian approach and is based on the matching of maps of dynamic objects built by the members of the team. These maps contain the relative position of moving objects and their velocity at a given time. Experimental results using data from a real environment carried out to validate the method are presented and discussed.
