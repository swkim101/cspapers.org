We present a simple and effective blind image deblurring method based on the dark channel prior. Our work is inspired by the interesting observation that the dark channel of blurred images is less sparse. While most image patches in the clean image contain some dark pixels, these pixels are not dark when averaged with neighboring highintensity pixels during the blur process. This change in the sparsity of the dark channel is an inherent property of the blur process, which we both prove mathematically and validate using training data. Therefore, enforcing the sparsity of the dark channel helps blind deblurring on various scenarios, including natural, face, text, and low-illumination images. However, sparsity of the dark channel introduces a non-convex non-linear optimization problem. We introduce a linear approximation of the min operator to compute the dark channel. Our look-up-table-based method converges fast in practice and can be directly extended to non-uniform deblurring. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on deblurring natural images and compares favorably methods that are well-engineered for specific scenarios.
