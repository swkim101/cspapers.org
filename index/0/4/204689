This paper describes a mechanism for nonmonotonic temporal reasoning involving counterfactuals and disjunctions. The mechanism supports a method for exploring alternatives well suited to automatic planning. The application of these techniques to robot problem solving is discussed with an emphasis on reasoning about exclusive choices and monitoring the continued warrant and effectiveness of prevention tasks.
