Because of its small set of data types, the rela-tional model is constrained to simply structured data management tasks. For more advanced applications like engineering databases in the CAD/CAN area even a powerful extension like the NF' model is insufficient , yet: Important concepts like order and duplicates are not supported appropriately, and the free usage of composite items is prohibited by inherent asymmetries. These drawbacks can be removed by a data model which suooorts atomic data, lists, multisets, and tUpleS in"an orthogonal fashion. The necessary operations can be provided in an SQL-like framework. Compared with existing approaches, the expressive power could considerably be increased; nevertheless, the proposed SQL dialect has not become more complicated for comparable tasks, but more consistent and easier to understand.
