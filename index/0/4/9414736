The Generative Model Transformer (GMT) project is an Open Source initiative to build a Model Driven Architecureâ„¢ tool that allows fully customisable Platform Independent Models, Platform Description Models, Texture Mappings, and Refinement Transformations. The project should result in (a) a tool that fulfils the MDA promise for faster/more accurate/better maintainable application development, (b) a tool for industrial use, and (c) MDA related research-which is encouraged and needed. A distinctive feature of GMT is the emphasis of model transformations as "first-class model citizens". The implementation of model transformations is envisaged to be in conformance with the future OMG modeling standard for Queries, Views, and Transformations (QVT).
