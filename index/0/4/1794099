This paper proposes a new path planning approach based on statistical information, like the occupancy probability of partly or completely dynamic obstacles and/or the statistical flow of dynamic obstacles. With this new approach it is possible to integrate the expected behavior of moving obstacles into the preplanning of paths without knowing the individual movement of these dynamic obstacles. As the preplanned paths coincide with the average movement pattern in the environment, the runtime planning is simplified. The authors propose an appropriate world model to represent the necessary statistical data, which can be obtained automatically. In addition, a path planning approach, suited for point-shaped and arbitrary-shaped vehicles, is sketched. These paths integrate geometrical detours to fit the planned movements into the statistical movement pattern of the dynamic obstacles.<<ETX>>
