The popularity of mobile devices and the opportunity to learn regardless of time and place make mobile learning an important method in lifelong learning. However, acceptance of mobile learning by learners is crucial to the success of mobile learning. The objective of this study is to investigate main determinants of mobile learning acceptance in higher education in China. Based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, this study proposed a hypothesized model of m-learning acceptance. Employing a stepwise multiple regression analysis, the model was assessed based on the data collected from 186 participants at Beijing Normal University using a survey questionnaire. Results indicate that achievement value, effort expectancy, social influence and performance expectancy have significant influence on the behavioral intention to use mobile learning. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
