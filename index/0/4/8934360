Capturing the evolution of logical objects and structures in a software project is crucial to the development of a high-quality software. This research demonstration presents an <i>object-oriented</i> approach to managing the evolution of system objects at the <i>logical</i> level. Keys to our approach are its <i>extensible, logical,</i> and <i>object-oriented system model</i> and <i>structure versioning framework</i> in which types of logical objects and structures in a software system are extended from a small set of the system model's basic entities, allowing them to be versioned in a <i>fine-grained</i> manner and <i>independent</i> of the physical file structure. Changes to all logical objects and structures are captured and related to each other in a tightly connected and cohesive manner via the <i>Molhado</i> product versioning software configuration management (SCM) infrastructure. We also demonstrate our object-oriented SCM approach by applying it in different development paradigms such as UML-based object-oriented software development, architecture-based software development, and Web application development.
