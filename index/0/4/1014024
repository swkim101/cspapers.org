The Government's traditional role in technology development has been implemented through each agency's acquisition or enhancement of that technology sufficient to enable its mission at a reasonable cost.
 There has been a new role suggested for the Government in technology development and that is to serve the national interest in areas not directly in any agency's charter (not defense, not space, etc.). This national interest pertains to the health of the electronics industry.
 This suggested new role, if justifiable, could be implemented by high level directives to fund technology development beyond the scopes of present agency charters. If not justifiable at that level, it could be accomplished in two other ways. The first would be to simply provide a marked increase in funding based on the traditional role in technology development. The second way would be for the Government to sponsor the means for more efficient Design Automation (DA) development.
