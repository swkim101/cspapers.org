We analyze the problem of linear bandits under heavy tailed noise. Most of the work on linear bandits has been based on the assumption of bounded or sub-Gaussian noise. This assumption however is often violated in common scenarios such as financial markets. We present two algorithms to tackle this problem: one based on dynamic truncation and one based on a median of means estimator. We show that, when the noise admits only a 1 + e moment, these algorithms are still able to achieve regret in O (T2+e/2(1+e)) and O (T1+2e/1+3e) respectively. In particular, they guarantee sublinear regret as long as the noise has finite variance. We also present empirical results showing that our algorithms achieve a better performance than the current state of the art for bounded noise when the Lâˆž bound on the noise is large yet the 1+e moment of the noise is small.
