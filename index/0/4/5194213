Weakly supervised object detection, is a challenging task, where the training procedure involves learning at the same time both, the model appearance and the object location in each image. The classical approach to solve this problem is to consider the location of the object of interest in each image as a latent variable and minimize the loss generated by such latent variable during learning. However, as learning appearance and localization are two interconnected tasks, the optimization is not convex and the procedure can easily get stuck in a poor local minimum, i.e. the algorithm “misses” the object in some images. In this paper, we help the optimization to get close to the global minimum by enforcing a “soft” similarity between each possible location in the image and a reduced set of “exemplars”, or clusters, learned with a convex formulation in the training images. The help is effective because it comes from a different and smooth source of information that is not directly connected with the main task. Results show that our method improves a strong baseline based on convolutional neural network features by more than 4 points without any additional features or extra computation at testing time but only adding a small increment of the training time due to the convex clustering.
