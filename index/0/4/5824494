A bucket algorithm is proposed for zero-skew routing with linear time complexity on the average. Our algorithm is much simpler and more efficient than the best known algorithm which uses Delaunay triangulations for segments on Manhattan distance. Experimental results show that the linearity of our algorithm is accomplished. Our algorithm generates a zero-skew routing for 3000-pin benchmark data within 5 seconds on a 90MIPS RISC workstation.
