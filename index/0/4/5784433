Elias Koutsoupias* We investigate the tradeoff between storage redundancy and access overhead for indexing random d-dimensional point sets. We show that with high probability a range-query workload of n random points has polylogarithrnic tradeoff, more precisely, there is a constant cg,d such that every indexing scheme with storage redundancy c&d logd-’ n has the worst possible access overhead (equal to the block size B). We also show that this result is almost tight and that the trade-off even exhibits a threshold behavior: on a random set of points, expected storage redundancy O(logd-’ n) achieves access overhead 2d 1.
