A variety of solutions have been proposed for ensuring data integrity in nonreal-time systems (i.e. batch or on-line systems). A brief review is made of some of the techniques employed in these solutions. It is indicated why the data integrity problem is different in a real-time system than in a nonreal-time system. Two models of interprocess communication are presented and it is demonstrated that the models are sufficient to preserve data integrity in a real-time system.
