Augmented reality (AR) applications greatly benefit from direction estimation. In current AR devices, direction estimation is enabled by power hungry technologies such as GPS, management of inertial data and video processing. We present a low-complexity eyewear prototype capable of obtaining directional information from a set of environmental radio sources by using a multi-antenna system patented by Wagoo LLC. Eyewear devices are the natural match for this technology under the assumption that user line of sight represents the main reference for user interaction and orientation. In the demonstration, the prototype detects when a user aims at objects or people that are associated to standard Bluetooth Low Energy emitters (beacons) with a current 30Â° sensitivity and 5% error rate.
