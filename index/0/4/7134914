This workshop is for anyone who teaches CS, and introduces process-oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL) in computer science. POGIL is based on learning science, and shares characteristics with other forms of active, discovery, and inquiry learning. In a POGIL classroom, teams of 3-5 learners work on instructor-facilitated activities. Through scripted inquiry and investigation, learners discover concepts and construct their own knowledge. Using assigned team roles and meta-cognition, learners develop process skills and individual responsibility. Studies show that POGIL can significantly improve student performance. POGIL has particular potential for CS education. Software development is largely a team-based problem-solving activity, and POGIL helps students to learn from each other and develop problem-solving abilities as well as important team process skills. POGIL has been developed and validated over the last 15 years in a range of STEM disciplines.
 The workshop consists primarily of hands-on team activities. Participants will work through CS activities and a set of meta-activities to explore POGIL practices and activity structures. Participants will also begin to draft parts of their own activities. More information and materials are available at http://cspogil.org and http://pogil.org, including sample activities for topics in a variety of CS courses. Laptops optional. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant DUE-1044679.
