This paper explores the potential for annotating and enriching data for low-density languages via the alignment and projection of syntactic structure from parsed data for resource-rich languages such as English. We seek to develop enriched resources for a large number of the worldâ€™s languages, most of which have no significant digital presence. We do this by tapping the body of Web-based linguistic data, most of which exists in small, analyzed chunks embedded in scholarly papers, journal articles, Web pages, and other online documents. By harvesting and enriching these data, we can provide the means for knowledge discovery across the resulting corpus that can lead to building computational resources such as grammars and transfer rules, which, in turn, can be used as bootstraps for building additional tools and resources for the languages represented. 1
