This paper reviews several problems that arise in the area of design automation. Most of these problems are shown to be NP-hard. Further, it is unlikely that any of these problems can be solved by fast approximation algorithms that guarantee solutions that are always within some fixed relative error of the optimal solution value. This points out the importance of heuristics and other tools to obtain algorithms that perform well on the problem instances of "interest".
