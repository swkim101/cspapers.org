CAD systems utilize a central design database (DDB) to achieve the integration of diverse design information into one model. A global DDB represents a serious bottleneck for the CAD system; it prevents the extensibility of the CAD system over time and forces all design tools to work on the same comprehensive data model. As a solution, we propose to utilize the object-oriented view mechanism, called MultiView, for declaratively specifying customized tool interfaces (design views) on the CAD database. A design view contains a subset of relevant information from the DDB organized in a fashion most suitable to the needs of a particular tool. MultiView automatically maintains the mapping between the global data model and local design views, thus freeing individual design tools from this burden. The resulting CAD environment assures the consistent integration of design data from different tools, while providing each tool with a customized view of the integrated data. This paper gives numerous examples that demonstrate MultiView and its advantages for tool integration in behavioral synthesis.
