A novel Implementation of the basic mechanisms of a semantic network is presented. This constitutes merging, in terms of the underlying language architecture, of a powerful problem-solving mechanism, production-rule systems, with a proven representation formalism. Details are presented on the most basic aspects of the network, namely on representing nodes and on mechanisms for their access. Commands for definition, modification, and search-based displays of network information are discussed. The relations of the network are divided into six groups: taxonomic, structural, functional, descriptive, means-ends, and spatial. The importance of uniformly representing methods and network, and the importance of distinguishing temporary from permanent states are discussed. There is sketched a production system position on a number of relevant issues for advanced capabilities. The domain of application is the symbolic description and manipulation of computer structures at the PMS (processor-memory-switch) level. The system will ultimately be used for computer-aided design activities.
