Software design is the hardest part of creating intelligent agents. Therefore agent architectures should be optimized as design tools. This paper presents an architectural synthesis between the three-layer architectures which dominate autonomous robotics and virtual reality, and a more agent-oriented approach to viewing behavior modules. We provide an approach, Behavior Oriented Design (BOD), for rapid, maintainable development. We demonstrate our approach by modeling primate learning.
