Multiple systems coupling incurs performance degradation due to inter-system (global) lock conlention and database buffer invalidation. At high transaction rates, the level of inter-syslem interference can have a severe hnpact on performance. In this paper, we propose a scheme for transaction routing lhat reduces inter-system interference while keeping load nearly balanced. The routing decision is based on affinity relations defined between transactions and databases. A methodology, employing an integer linear programming technique, is developed to classify incoming transactions into affinity groups based on their dotuba& call reference puffem. Based on traces from two of IBMâ€™s high volume single system customers, we find that. at high lransaction rates, the proposed aflinily based routing significantly reduces the lock contention probability and leads to a substantial reduction in transaction response time. Further, the reduction in inter-system data contenlion, produces a large hnpact on the performance of optimislic type concurrency control.
