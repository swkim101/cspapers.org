Data replication has recently become a topic of increased interest among customers. Several database vendors provide products that perform data replication, The capabilities of these products and the customer problems they solve vary widely. This talk starts by identifying some of the dimensions of the replication solution space including latency, concurrency, logical and physical units of replication, network link requirements, heterogeneity, replica topology, replica transparency, and data transformation requirements. Digital Equipment Corporation provides three products that allow customers to replicate data. The distributed, two-phase commit products allow customers to program and coordinate replicated updates. DECTM Reliable Transaction Router provides an OLTP environment with transactional data replication. Transactions succeed in the face of site and network failures. DECTM Data Distributor manages the automated distribution of data using scheduled or ad-hoc batch data transfers. Data replication can be used to distribute data to remote sites, combine data from multiple sites, and archive data. In the process of moving the data from one site to another, data transformations carI be applied. The balance of the talk describes the Data Distributor, explaining the replica topologies it supports, their application in solving customer problems, and the internal mechanisms used to support them.
