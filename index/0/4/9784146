Accurate and reliable localization is a base requirement for a mobile robot. Landmark localization is a very common technique to do this. The arrangement of landmarks is important for reliable and accurate estimation of localization data. In this paper the optimized arrangement of artificial landmarks is discussed and a solution for building an accurate and reliable localization system based on combining artificial and natural landmarks is presented. Landmark placement is done by definition and optimization of a confidence level describing the expected localization estimation error. Areas in the environment which are ill conditioned by natural landmarks are furnished with additional artificial landmarks. The proposed system has been tested in a simulation and with a mobile robot in a real office environment.
