Retiming has been proposed as an optimization step for sequential circuits represented at the net-list level. Retiming moves the latches across the logic gates and in doing so changes the number of latches and the longest path delay between the latches. In this paper we show by example that retiming a design may lead to differing simulation results when the retimed design replaces the original design. We also show, by example, that retiming may not preserve the testability of a sequential test sequence for a given stuck-at fault as measured by a simulator. We identify the cause of the problemas forward retiming moves across multiple-fanout points in the circuit. The primary contribution of this paper is to show that, while an accurate logic simulation may distinguish the retimed circuit fromthe original circuit, a conservative three-valued simulator cannot do so. Hence, retiming is a safe operation when used in a design methodology based on conservative three-valued simulation starting each latch with the unknown value.
