The Short Messaging Service (SMS), one of the most successful cellular services, generates millions of dollars in revenue for mobile operators. Estimates indicate that billions of text messages are traveling the airwaves daily. Nevertheless, text messaging is becoming a source of customer dissatisfaction due to the rapid surge of messaging abuse activities. Although spam is a well tackled problem in the email world, SMS spam experiences a yearly growth larger than 500%. In this paper we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first analysis of SMS spam traffic from a tier-1 cellular operator. Communication patterns of spammers are compared to those of legitimate cell-phone users and Machine to Machine (M2M) connected appliances. The results indicate that M2M systems exhibit communication profiles similar to spammers, which could mislead spam filters. Beyond the expected results, such as a large load of text messages sent out to a wide target list, other interesting findings are made. For example, the results indicate that the great majority of the spammers connect to the network with just a handful of different hardware models. We find the main geographical sources of messaging abuse in the US. We also find evidence of spammer mobility, voice and data traffic resembling the behavior of legitimate customers.
