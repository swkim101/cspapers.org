A motion planning method for humanoid robots to pass under obstacles is proposed. The proposed motion planner can calculate a goal configuration and connect it with an initial configuration in a collision-free dynamically stable motion. The method can generate not only a body motion but also the footstep sequence. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated by experiments with the humanoid robot HRP-2.
