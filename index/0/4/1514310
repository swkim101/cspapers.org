Association Rule Mining algorithms operate on a data matrix (e.g., customers (cid:2) products) to derive association rules [2, 23]. We propose a new paradigm, namely, Ratio Rules, which are quanti(cid:12)able in that we can measure the \goodness" of a set of discovered rules. We propose to use the \guessing error" as a measure of the \goodness", that is, the root-mean-square error of the reconstructed values of the cells of the given matrix, when we pretend that they are unknown. Another con-tribution is a novel method to guess miss-ing/hidden values from the Ratio Rules that our method derives. For example, if some-body bought $10 of milk and $3 of bread, our rules can \guess" the amount spent on, say, butter. Thus, we can perform a variety of important tasks such as forecasting, answering \what-if" scenarios, detecting outliers, and vi-sualizing the data. Moreover, we show how to compute Ratio Rules in a single pass over the dataset with small memory requirements (a few small matrices), in contrast to traditional association rule mining methods that require multiple passes and/or large memory.
