Although linking video to additional information sources seems to be a sensible approach to satisfy information needs of user, the perspective of users is not yet analyzed on a fundamental level in real-life scenarios. However, a better understanding of the motivation of users to follow links in video, which anchors users prefer to link from within a video, and what type of link targets users are typically interested in, is important to be able to model automatic linking of audiovisual content appropriately. In this paper we report on our methodology towards eliciting user requirements with respect to video linking in the course of a broader study on user requirements in searching and a series of benchmark evaluations on searching and linking.
