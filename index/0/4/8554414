Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have emerged as a suitable solution for real-time vehicle data collection in many ITS applications. We propose the use of magnetometers in conjunction with WSN for real-time vehicle data collection. Magnetometers when used as sensor nodes offer advantages over other vehicle sensing technologies that include cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency, resistance to changes in environmental conditions, ease of re-deployment and flexibility. In this paper we present our prototype of a wireless magnetic sensor, algorithms for vehicle detection, vehicle speed estimation and vehicle length estimation and quantify their performance. Results from field evaluations prove the feasibility of our proposed solution for accurate vehicle data collection.
