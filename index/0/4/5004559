This paper proposes a context directed pattern matching (CDPM) mechanism, which employs the context of the coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) as a guide to improve cache prefetching accuracy. CDPM generates a prefetch pattern for an initially executed context, and reuses the pattern to issue prefetch requests when the context is again executed on CGRA. To eliminate the outdated prefetch pattern, CDPM also evaluates the prefetching accuracy of the prefetch pattern at run-time. Experiments showed that CDPM averagely improved performance by 31.1% compared to tests without any prefetching and by 7.7% compared to state-of-the-art prefetching techniques.
