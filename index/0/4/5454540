We present a simple architecture for parsing transcribed speech in which an edited-word detector first removes such words from the sentence string, and then a standard statistical parser trained on transcribed speech parses the remaining words. The edit detector achieves a misclassification rate on edited words of 2.2%. (The NULL-model, which marks everything as not edited, has an error rate of 5.9%.) To evaluate our parsing results we introduce a new evaluation metric, the purpose of which is to make evaluation of a parse tree relatively indifferent to the exact tree position of EDITED nodes. By this metric the parser achieves 85.3% precision and 86.5% recall.
