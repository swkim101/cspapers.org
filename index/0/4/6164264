Personalized technologies aim to enhance user experience by taking into account users' interests, preferences, and other relevant information. Persuasive technologies aim to modify user attitudes, intentions, or behavior through computerhuman dialogue and social influence. While both personalized and persuasive technologies influence user interaction and behavior, we posit that this influence could be significantly increased if the two are combined to create personalized and persuasive systems. For example, the persuasive power of a one-size-fits-all persuasive intervention could be enhanced by considering the user being influenced and their susceptibility to the persuasion being offered. Likewise, personalized technologies could cash in on increased successes, in terms of user satisfaction, revenue, and user experience, if their services used persuasive techniques.
