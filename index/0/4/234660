The CAD Contest at ICCAD is a challenging, multi-month competition, focusing on advanced, real-world problems in the field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA). In its fifth year, the 2016 CAD Contest at ICCAD attracted 135 teams from 11 regions/countries. Three critical EDA problems, in the areas of design verification, logic synthesis, and design for manufacturing (DFM), were called for competition this year. We hope that the contest benchmark suites and evaluation infrastructure boost research in the related areas and help EDA community find novel and high-quality solutions to the problems.
