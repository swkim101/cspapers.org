This report describes an experimental disk block server implemented for the RSX-11M Operating System using DECnet. The block server allows user programs on one system to access files on a disk physically located on a different system. The actual interface is at the level of physical blocks and IO transfers. Results of basic performance measurements are given, and explained in terms of major components. Performance predictions are made for servers of this type supporting more complex workloads.
