ComeWithMe is an activity oriented carpooling service that enlarges the candidate destinations of a ride request by considering alternative places where the desired activity can be performed. It is based on the observation that individuals often move towards a place to perform an activity while the activity is often not strictly associated with a single place, as one may go for shopping or eating to many different locations. Activity-oriented carpooling hugely increases the number of rides matching a query, thus introducing requirements on system responsiveness and ranking effectiveness that are not common to traditional carpooling services. The demoed system implements the ComeWithMe service in almost its entirety, and includes the back-end and a user-friendly mobile application for smart-phones aimed at achieving users' acceptance and usability.
