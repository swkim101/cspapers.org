(MATH) A vector <b>A</b> of length <i>N</i> is defined implicitly, via a stream of updates of the form "add 5 to <b>A</b><sub>3</sub>." We give a <i>sketching</i> algorithm, that constructs a small <i>sketch</i> from the stream of updates, and a <i>reconstruction</i> algorithm, that produces a <i>B</i>-bucket piecewise-constant representation (histogram) <b>H</b> for <b>A</b> from the sketch, such that ||<b>A—H</b>||&xie;(1+ε)||<b>A—H</b><sub>opt</sub>||, where the error |||<b>A—H</b>|| is either $\ell_1$ (absolute) or $\ell_2$ (root-mean-square) error. The time to process a single update, time to reconstruct the histogram, and size of the sketch are each bounded by poly(<i>B</i>,log(<i>N</i>),log||<b>A</b>,1/ε. Our result is obtained in two steps. First we obtain what we call a <i>robust</i> histogram approximation for <b>A</b>, a histogram such that adding a small number of buckets does not help improve the representation quality significantly. From the robust histogram, we cull a histogram of desired accruacy and <i>B</i> buckets in the second step. This technique also provides similar results for Haar wavelet representations, under $\ell_2$ error. Our results have applications in summarizing data distributions fast and succinctly even in distributed settings.
