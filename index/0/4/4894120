In this paper, we characterize a state-of-the-art 3D floating gate NAND flash memory through comprehensive experiments on an FPGA platform. Then, we present distinct observations on performance and reliability, such as operation latencies and various error patterns. We believe that through our work, novel 3D NAND flash-oriented designs can be developed to achieve better performance and reliability.
