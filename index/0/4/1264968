Representing articulated objects as a graphical model has gained much popularity in recent years, often the root node of the graph describes the global position and orientation of the object. In this work a method is presented to robustly track 3D human pose by permitting greater uncertainty to be modeled over the root node than existing techniques allow. Significantly, this is achieved without increasing the uncertainty of remaining parts of the model. The benefit is that a greater volume of the posterior can be supported making the approach less vulnerable to tracking failure. Given a hypothesis of the root node state a novel method is presented to estimate the posterior over the remaining parts of the body conditioned on this value. All probability distributions are approximated using a single Gaussian allowing inference to be carried out in closed form. A set of deterministically selected sample points are used that allow the posterior to be updated for each part requiring just seven image likelihood evaluations making it extremely efficient. Multiple root node states are supported and propagated using standard sampling techniques. We believe this to be the first work devoted to efficient tracking of human pose whilst modeling large uncertainty in the root node and demonstrate the presented method to be more robust to tracking failures than existing approaches.
