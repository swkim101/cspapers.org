This paper presents the experiments of collecting the documents on the WWW using distributed WWW robots. We propose distributed WWW robots to collect the documents quickly. Our final goal is to collect all of the documents on the WWW in Japan within one day. Currently, eight distributed WWW Robots are running in Japan. The experimental results show that we are able to gain 5.8 to 9.7 times speedup when four distributed WWW robots are placed at different places in comparison with when only one WWW robot is used.
