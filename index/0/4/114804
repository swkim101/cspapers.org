Distinguishing speculative statements from factual ones is important for most biomedical text mining applications. We introduce an approach which is based on solving two sub-problems to identify speculative sentence fragments. The first sub-problem is identifying the speculation keywords in the sentences and the second one is resolving their linguistic scopes. We formulate the first sub-problem as a supervised classification task, where we classify the potential keywords as real speculation keywords or not by using a diverse set of linguistic features that represent the contexts of the keywords. After detecting the actual speculation keywords, we use the syntactic structures of the sentences to determine their scopes.
