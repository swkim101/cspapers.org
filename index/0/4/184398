Low-power embedded systems traditionally employ a "thin" OS because of resource constraints, hardware variety, and cost efficiency. This results in two problems - First, the embedded system programmers are limited to professionals with sufficient knowledge on hardware; Second, it is much slower for progress in programming languages and software engineering to find their ways to the systems with embedded microcontrollers, which is 98% of the microprocessors market. When low-power embedded processors are used in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the thin OS approach, if followed, leads to another serious problem - The OS services cannot meet applications' ever-growing requirements. If these three problems are not solved, the transformation of the prosperous research on WSNs into a technology and market success has to be slow.
