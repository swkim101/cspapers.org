This work deals with the kinematic and dynamic modeling of a 3-DOF, under-actuated, pendulum-like manipulator and its control system. The cable-based device is capable of completing point-to-point planar motions, driving the end-effector from a starting pose to a goal pose, by means of two actuators only. The device relies on parametric excitation to control the oscillations of the variable-length pendulum. Unlike a previous work [1], the dynamic model introduced here is consistent with the assumption of cable-based device. Several control strategies are compared through numerical simulations.
