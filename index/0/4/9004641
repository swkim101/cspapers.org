Maintaining optimal consistency in a distributed system requires that nodes be always-on to synchronize information. Unfortunately, mobile devices such as laptops do not have adequate battery capacity for constant processing and communication. Even by powering off unnecessary components, such as the screen and disk, current laptops only have a lifetime of a few hours. Although PDAs and sensors are similarly limited in lifetime, a PDA's power requirement is an order-of-magnitude smaller than a laptop's, and a sensor's is an order-of-magnitude smaller than a PDA's. By combining these diverse platforms into a single integrated laptop, we can reduce the power cost of always-on operation. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of Turducken, a Hierarchical Power Management architecture for mobile systems. We focus on a particular instantiation of HPM, which provides high levels of consistency in a laptop by integrating two additional low power processors. We demonstrate that a Turducken system can provide battery lifetimes of up to ten times that of a standard laptop for always-on operation and three times for a system that periodically sleeps.
