To produce multimedia encyclopedic content, we propose a method to search the Web for images associated with a specific word sense. We use text in an HTML file which links to an image as a pseudocaption for the image and perform text-based indexing and retrieval. We use term descriptions in a Web search site called "CYCLONE" as queries and correspond images and texts based on word senses.
