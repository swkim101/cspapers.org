This paper describes a possible use of Artificial Intelligence models and techniques in the design of a small Information Retrieval system. In particular, some knowledge representation models, such as semantic networks and frame-like structures, are viewed as interesting tools for the implementation of a thesaurus, and also for a description of the stored documents' contents. In addition, a parser based on the ATN (Augmented Transition Network) model which can analyze Italian sentences concerning a legal domain is described. We are including it in an user/system interface whose goal is to provide the user with the possibility of expressing search topics by using noun phrases or other linguistic expressions, rather than single words or Boolean combinations of them. Finally, some tasks requiring automated reasoning facilities are outlined. The Kernel of the system, i.e. the component which both performs traditional information retrieval and allows the insertion of new documents, is described in an appendix. It was first applied to a bibliographic database containing about a thousand references (with abstracts) of both papers and books concerned with Artificial Intelligence; now we are working on its application to a legal domain, with a database of laws, decrees and sentences concerning pollution and environmental protection.
