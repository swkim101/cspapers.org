We describe the tools and interfaces created by the AGEDIS project, a European Commission sponsored project for the creation of a methodology and tools for automated model driven test generation and execution for distributed systems. The project includes an integrated environment for modeling, test generation, test execution, and other test related activities. The tools support a model based testing methodology that features a large degree of automation and also includes a feedback loop integrating coverage and defect analysis tools with the test generator and execution framework. Prototypes of the tools have been tried in industrial settings providing important feedback for the creation of the next generation of tools in this area.
