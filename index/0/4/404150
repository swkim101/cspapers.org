In order to boost the translation quality of EBMT based on a small-sized bilingual corpus, we use an out-of-domain bilingual corpus and, in addition, the language model of an in-domain monolingual corpus. We conducted experiments with an EBMT system. The two evaluation measures of the BLEU score and the NIST score demonstrated the effect of using an out-of-domain bilingual corpus and the possibility of using the language model.
