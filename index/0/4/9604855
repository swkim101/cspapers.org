Extracting information from web pages is an important problem; it has several applications such as providing improved search results and construction of databases to serve user queries. In this paper we propose a novel structured prediction method to address two important aspects of the extraction problem: (1) labeled data is available only for a small number of sites and (2) a machine learned global model does not generalize adequately well across many websites. For this purpose, we propose a weight space based graph regularization method. This method has several advantages. First, it can use unlabeled data to address the limited labeled data problem and falls in the class of graph regularization based semi-supervised learning approaches. Second, to address the generalization inadequacy of a global model, this method builds a local model for each website. Viewing the problem of building a local model for each website as a task, we learn the models for a collection of sites jointly; thus our method can also be seen as a graph regularization based multi-task learning approach. Learning the models jointly with the proposed method is very useful in two ways: (1) learning a local model for a website can be effectively influenced by labeled and unlabeled data from other websites; and (2) even for a website with only unlabeled examples it is possible to learn a decent local model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on several real-life data; experimental results show that significant performance improvement can be obtained by combining semi-supervised and multi-task learning in a single framework.
