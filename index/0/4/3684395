Students in introductory computer science courses (CS 1) typically receive little formal instruction in proper programming style. They may gain limited understanding of proper style by reading code samples, observing an instructor write code with proper style, or by receiving feedback on homework submissions. In our research, we evaluate the effectiveness of an alternative pedagogical approach in which students are provided brief instruction on proper style and are then asked to critique examples of improper style. This research answers three questions: First, when a student knows style will be graded, is proper style utilized? Second, does the student's ability to use proper style correlate with academic performance? Third, do our exercises increase the student's ability to employ proper style? We investigated the first two of these questions using data from three CS 1 courses with distinct forms of style assessment: 1) no style grading and no feedback; 2) automated style grading with feedback; and 3) hand-graded style with feedback. We investigated the third research question, by augmenting the first two course forms with our pedagogical approach. In all courses, a CS 1 style guide was distributed at the beginning of the term and similar lecture examples were used. We found that grading of style is necessary to motivate students, and that our approach shows some promise in increasing ability to use proper style.
