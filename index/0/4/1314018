We present our experiences using the RoboCup soccerserver simulator and Biter, our own agent platform, for the teaching of a graduate multiagent systems' class. The RoboCup simulator and Biter are both described. We argue that the combination of RoboCup and Biter forms an effective platform for the teaching of multiagent systems and the distributed mindset. Results from two semesters using these tools are presented. These results confirm our claims. Finally, we characterize this work within the framework provided by the STEELMAN Draft of the Computing Curricula 2001 initiative.
