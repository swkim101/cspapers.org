According to the World Health Organization (WHO), outdoor air pollution led to an estimated 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012. To address this problem, it is necessary for both residents and city administrations to understand air quality in their immediate environment with fine-grained temporal-spatial resolution. Currently both fixed and mobile systems are used to attempt to sense the pollution field. However, they generally are expensive, cover small areas and thus result in lower accuracy. To address this problem, we present Gotcha II, our environmental sensing system that utilizes data from both official sites and mobile sensing devices deployed on vehicles to infer air pollution. We present our experiences and calibration methods to improve data accuracy through the deployment on 100 vehicles in the greater Shenzhen area.
