We present results from a qualitative study examining how Charismatic Pentecostals use Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This work contributes to the growing body of research that broadens Weiser's vision by exploring technology use in novel and unfamiliar contexts. Our findings reveal how "extreme" and non-rational beliefs frame users' ICT experiences. We argue that if ubicomp is to be global and ubiquitous, accounting for alternative value systems is necessary. We discuss the implications of our findings and present issues the ubicomp community should consider when imagining a future that includes users from parts of the global south.
