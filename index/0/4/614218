We propose a method for accurate 3D shape reconstruction using uncalibrated multiview photometric stereo. A coarse mesh reconstructed using multiview stereo is first parameterized using a planar mesh parameterization technique. Subsequently, multiview photometric stereo is performed in the 2D parameter domain of the mesh, where all geometric and photometric cues from multiple images can be treated uniformly. Unlike traditional methods, there is no need for merging view-dependent surface normal maps. Our key contribution is a new photometric stereo based mesh refinement technique that can efficiently reconstruct meshes with extremely fine geometric details by directly estimating a displacement texture map in the 2D parameter domain. We demonstrate that intricate surface geometry can be reconstructed using several challenging datasets containing surfaces with specular reflections, multiple albedos and complex topologies.
