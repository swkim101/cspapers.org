In this paper, we present a tool-chain for the REMES language, which can be used for the construction and analysis of embedded system behavioral models. The tool-chain consists of the following tools: (i) a REMES editor for modeling behaviors of embedded components, (ii) a REMES simulator to test timing and resource behavior prior to formal analysis, and (iii) an automated transformation from REMES to Priced Timed Automata, needed for formal analysis.
