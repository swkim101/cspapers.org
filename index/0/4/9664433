We offer a different perspective: we present the concept of "Art Games", a view that opens up many possibilities for AI research and applications. Conference participants will play Jikan to Kukan, an art game where the player dynamically creates the soundtrack with the AI system, while developing her experience in the unconscious world of a character.
