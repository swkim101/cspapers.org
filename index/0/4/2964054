Information technology has become "infrastructure technology," as most sectors of critical infrastructure rest on an IT backbone. Yet IT systems are not yet designed to be as safe, secure and reliable as physical infrastructure. Improving the security worthiness of commercial software requires a significant change in the development and product delivery process across the board. The security worthiness of all commercial software - from all vendors - demands that assurance became a critical focus for both providers and customers of IT. During Oracle's long history of building and delivering secure software, we continue to invest heavily in building security into each component of the product lifecycle. This is also an "organic" process which is regularly being enhanced to improve overall security practices. Our efforts have evolved from a formal development process to now additionally include secure coding standards, intensive developer training, innovative "bug finding" tools and working with leading vendors to "raise the bar" for all of industry as it pertains to security.
