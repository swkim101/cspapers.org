In the past, graphics processors were special-purpose hardwired application accelerators, suitable only for conventional graphics applications. Modern GPUs are fully programmable, massively parallel floating point processors. In this talk I will describe NVIDIA's scalable, highly parallel many-core GPU architecture and how CUDA software for GPU computing delivers high throughput for data-intensive processing. I will discuss how CUDA is reinvigorating research on data-parallel algorithms, reducing time to scientific discovery, and enabling a variety of compute-intensive industrial applications of GPUs beyond computer graphics.
