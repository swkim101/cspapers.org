The paper constructs the first polynomial universal traversing sequences for cycles, solving an open problem of S. Cook and R. Aleliunas, R. Karp, R. Lipton, L. Lovasz, C. Rackoff (1979) [2] in the case of 2-regular graphs. The existence of universal traversing sequences of size <italic>&Ogr;</italic>(<italic>d</italic><supscrpt>2</supscrpt><italic>n</italic><supscrpt>3</supscrpt><italic>logn</italic>) for <italic>n</italic>-vertex <italic>d</italic>-regular graphs was established in [2] by a probabilistic argument, which was inherently non-constructive. For the cycles, the non-constructive upper bound was improved to <italic>&Ogr;</italic> (<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>3</supscrpt>) by Janowsky (1983) [13] and Cobham (1986) [8]. Previously, the best explicit constructions for cycles were due to Bridgland (1986) and A. Bar-Noy, A. Borodin, M. Karchmer, N. Linial, and M. Werman (1986), and have size <italic>&Ogr;</italic>(<italic>n<supscrpt>log n</supscrpt></italic>).
Our universal traversing sequence has size <italic>&Ogr;</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>4.76</supscrpt>), and can be constructed in log-space.
