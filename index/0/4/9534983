The objective of this paper is to propose a robust one shot structured light pattern for real time 3D shape inspection system. To reduce the influence of inspected part reflectance property and ambient light, the pattern is constructed by using monochromatic light. The corner of the chessboard is utilized as the primitive of the pattern since it can provide highly accurate position. Additionally, the orientation of the corner is used to encode the primitive of the pattern. Compared with ordinary two dimensional patterns, the pattern is developed in one dimension, along the epipolar line so that the search of the corresponding pixels between the projector and the camera is speeded up. Last, experiments were conducted to evaluate the robustness and accuracy of the inspection system using the proposed pattern. The results demonstrate that the system has high accuracy performance.
