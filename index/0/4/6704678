This session is dedicated to Paul Caspi. It is made of five talks, each of them addressing one aspect of Paul Caspi's contributions to the development of safe embedded software and systems: synchronous languages and models, the implementation of synchronous languages, the relation between functional and synchronous languages, the relation between continuous and discrete models, and the definition of embedded software and systems master curricula. This session is only a selection of recent work; Paul Caspi also worked on dependability and fault-tolerance, code distribution, and formal verification with theorem provers.
