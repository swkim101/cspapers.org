Although a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides an appealing model for problems of planning under uncertainty, exact algorithms for POMDPs are intractable. This motivates work on approximation algorithms, and grid-based approximation is a widely-used approach. We describe a novel approach to grid-based approximation that uses a variable-resolution regular grid, and show that it outperforms previous grid-based approaches to approximation.
