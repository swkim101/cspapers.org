An important aspect of interactive systems is the provision of a recovery facility that allows the user to reverse the effects of his interactions with the system. Due to differences between object-oriented and non-objectoriented methodologies, user recovery approaches used for non-object-oriented software are not suitable for object-oriented software. This paper presents an eventobject user recovery model for the construction of recovery facilities in object-oriented user interfaces. Our approach divides traditional history/command lists into per-object lists which fit well with object-oriented structure. Unique features of this framework are the hierarchical structure of the local recovery objects that reflect the application structure, its simple semantics, and its ease of implementation, which greatly reduces the effort required by the interface builder to incorporate it into existing object-oriented user interface structures. We introduce this framework by describing the event-object model, defining the protocol used by the local facilities to perform user recovery, and presenting examples of how the framework is used.
