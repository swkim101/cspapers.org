An algorithm is proposed for 3D object representation using generic 3D features which are transformation and scale invariant. Descriptive 3D features and their relations are used to construct a graphical model for the object which is later trained and then used for detection purposes. Descriptive 3D features are the fundamental structures which are extracted from the surface of the 3D scanner output. This surface is described by mean and Gaussian curvature values at every data point at various scales and a scale-space search is performed in order to extract the fundamental structures and to estimate the location and the scale of each fundamental structure.
