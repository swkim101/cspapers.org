It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the workshop on Data-driven user behavioral modeling and mining from social media (DUBMOD), co-located with 23rd ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management -- CIKM'14. This workshop builds upon the success of our previously held workshops User modeling from social media (UMSOCIAL), in conjunction with ACM IUI 2012, Data-driven user behavioral modeling and mining from social media (DUBMMSM), in conjunction with ACM CIKM 2012 and Data-driven user behavioral modeling and mining from social media (DUBMOD), in conjunction with ACM CIKM 2013. The call for papers attracted 8 submissions. We accepted 7 papers. The papers represent various topics such as reaction time for user behavior model for social network, user profile for answer quality, predicting requests for Wikipedia articles, linking Pinterest pins to online webshops, scalable mining of social data, predicting online buying behavior, flickr group recommendation. We hope that workshop proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners from diverse areas, such as user modeling, social media analysis, natural language processing, data mining and machine learning.
