A camera apparatus having a image fluctuation suppressing function has a fixed body and a lens barrel. The lens barrel is supported rotatably in at least one of panning and tilting directions by a supporting frame. The lens barrel is rotated by a panning or tilting actuator for suppressing an image fluctuation due to a fluctuation of the fixed body. The apparatus has a lock mechanism for locking the lens barrel so as not to rotate. The apparatus preferably has a mechanism for compensating for a movement of center of gravity of the lens barrel due to focusing or zooming operation.
