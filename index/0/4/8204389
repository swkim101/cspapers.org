Generalized bilateral control in teleoperation enables scaling, indexing, impedance control, shared control and the ability to use a non-replica master slave system. In this paper, control laws for both master and slave are derived for a desired impedance of the teleoperator system. A teleoperator system with six-degree-of-freedom Kraft hand controller (master) and a seven-degree-of-freedom Robotics Research Cooperation manipulator (slave), is used as a test-bed for generalized bilateral control. Parameter selection guidelines for controller design are developed based on experimental studies of the teleoperator system. An assembly task is performed to test the effectiveness of the controller design.<<ETX>>
