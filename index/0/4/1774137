Though technology in speech recognition has progressed recently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is vulnerable to noise. Lip-information is thought to be useful for speech recognition in noisy situations, such as in a factory or in a car.
This paper describes speech recognition enhancement by lip-information. Two types of usage are dealt with. One is the detection of start and stop of speech from lip-information. This is the simplest usage of lip-information. The other is lip-pattern recognition, and it is used for speech recognition together with sound information. The algorithms for both usages are proposed, and the experimental system shows they work well. The algorithms proposed here are composed of simple image-processing. Future progress in image-processing will make it possible to realize them in real-time.
