In this demonstration, we show SEREBRO, a lightweight courseware developed for student team collaboration in a software engineering class. SEREBRO couples an idea forum with software project management tools to maintain cohesive interaction between team discussion and resulting work products, such as tasking, documentation, and version control. SEREBRO has been used consecutively for two years of software engineering classes. Student input and experiments on student use in these classes has directed SERBRO to its current functionality.
