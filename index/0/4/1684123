We addressed two issues concerning the practical aspects of optimally scheduling web advertising proposed by Langheinrich et al. [5], which scheduling maximizes the total number of click-throughs for all banner advertisements. One is the problem of multi-impressions in which two or more banner ads are impressed at the same time. The other is inventory management, which is important in order to prevent over-selling and maximize revenue. We propose efficient methods which deal with these two issues.
