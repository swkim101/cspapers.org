Abstmct Rednet provides portable computers with an incxpensivc wireless network connection. It is designed to support seamless end-to-end communication using the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). Rednet uses a Iowpower infrared transceiver operating at 2-5 Mbps over a distance of 4 meters. The link layer protocol supports link sharing and transport of ATM cells over the link. Ceiling mounted base stalions in each room act as gateways between the infrared link and rhe wired network. Rednet is designed to support user mobility, so that users can roam from room to room and access network services in a location independent manner. The paper describes our infrared physical layer and link layer protocols, presents an ovcrview of protocols for dynamic address assignment and conncction management, and summarizes the status of the work.
