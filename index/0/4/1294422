This paper demonstrates the implementation of TinyTune, a collaborative musical instrument using sensor motes. The system implementation is distributed across multiple nodes and supports the basic elements of a musical instrument, such as pitch and octave selection. The communication design for realizing a collaborative musical instrument and the available user configuration options are then presented. Other topics of discussion include: the underlying system architecture, covering the advantages of our design choices; and the extensibility of the concept, which discusses how the nodes are configured in multi-instrument environments.
