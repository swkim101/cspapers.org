GPGPUs are evolving from dedicated accelerators towards mainstream commodity computing resources. During the transition, the lack of system management of device memory space on GPGPUs has become a major hurdle. In existing GPGPU systems, device memory space is still managed explicitly by individual applications, which not only increases the burden of programmers but can also cause application crashes, hangs, or low performance.
 In this paper, we present the design and implementation of GDM, a fully functional GPGPU device memory manager to address the above problems and unleash the computing power of GPGPUs in general-purpose environments. To effectively coordinate the device memory usage of different applications, GDM takes control over device memory allocations and data transfers to and from device memory, leveraging a buffer allocated in each application's virtual memory. GDM utilizes the unique features of GPGPU systems and relies on several effective optimization techniques to guarantee the efficient usage of device memory space and to achieve high performance.
 We have evaluated GDM and compared it against state-of-the-art GPGPU system software on a range of workloads. The results show that GDM can prevent applications from crashes, including those induced by device memory leaks, and improve system performance by up to 43%.
