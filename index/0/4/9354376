This paper presents a scheme which takes as input a 3D point cloud and an associated color image and parses the scene into a collection of salient planar surfaces. The scheme makes use of a fast color segmentation scheme to divide the color image into coherent regions and the groupings suggested by this procedure are used to inform and accelerate a RANSAC based interpretation process. Results on real data sets are presented.
