1. SUMMARY How does a department evaluate the effectiveness of its major programs in computer science? In years past it might have been done rather informally by faculty members having a sense of what their students are learning and measuring that against curriculum guidelines developed by national organizations such as ACM and the IEEE Computer Society. Or, maybe faculty members might have made that judgment by the types of jobs their students were obtaining right after they graduate or the number of students who would go on to graduate school in computer science. Nowadays, however, because of both internal and external forces, computer science departments are introducing formal processes. These involve articulating objectives (or goals) and outcomes for their programs and using a variety of instruments to measure success in meeting those objectives and outcomes, all with the idea of using the results to improve the program.
