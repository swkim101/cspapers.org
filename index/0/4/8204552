Catadioptric imaging systems use curved mirrors to capture wide fields of view. However, due to the curvature of the mirror, these systems tend to have very limited depth of field (DOF), with the point spread function (PSF) varying dramatically over the field of view and as a function of scene depth. In recent years, focal sweep has been used extensively to extend the DOF of conventional imaging systems. It has been shown that focal sweep produces an integrated point spread function (IPSF) that is nearly space-invariant and depth-invariant, enabling the recovery of an extended depth of field (EDOF) image by deconvolving the captured focal sweep image with a single IPSF. In this paper, we use focal sweep to extend the DOF of a catadioptric imaging system. We show that while the IPSF is spatially varying when a curved mirror is used, it remains quasi depth-invariant over the wide field of view of the imaging system. We have developed a focal sweep system where mirrors of different shapes can be used to capture wide field of view EDOF images. In particular, we show experimental results using spherical and paraboloidal mirrors.
