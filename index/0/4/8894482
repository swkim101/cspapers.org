Functional reactive programming (FRP) is an elegant and successful approach to programming reactive systems declaratively. The high levels of abstraction and expressivity that make FRP attractive as a programming model do, however, often lead to programs whose resource usage is excessive and hard to predict. In this paper, we address the problem of space leaks in discrete-time functional reactive programs. We present a functional reactive programming language that statically bounds the size of the dataflow graph a reactive program creates, while still permitting use of higher-order functions and higher-type streams such as streams of streams. We achieve this with a novel linear type theory that both controls allocation and ensures that all recursive definitions are well-founded.
 We also give a denotational semantics for our language by combining recent work on metric spaces for the interpretation of higher-order causal functions with length-space models of space-bounded computation. The resulting category is doubly closed and hence forms a model of the logic of bunched implications.
