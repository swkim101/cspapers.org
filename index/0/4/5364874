This paper describes a reactive obstacle negotiating algorithm for articulated-tracked robots and demonstrates a working system by presenting the simulation, animation, and control methodologies for an articulated-tracked mobile robot with a manipulator and sensory modules. Developing the motion planning strategies for robots with articulated-tracked locomotin is much different from path planning techniques developed for wheeled robots traveling on a planar surface, as the problems are not limited to solving the obstacle avoidance only, but involve finding the obstacle negotiating strategy as well. The authors have been developing tracked mobile-manipulator systems for applications in hazardous environments. A simulation, animation, visualization and interactive control (SAVIC) environment has been developed for the design and operation of a integrated robotic manipulator system.
