This paper is based on a recent technique called perturbation analysis of discrete event systems. The aims of the paper are two-fold. The first, is to bring this technique, which is still relatively new, to the attention of a wider audience, since the method is particularly relevant to practical systems optimization. The second, is to develop two new methods, the phantom customer method and the marked customer method, as extensions of the perturbation analysis approach. These methods enable efficient and accurate optimization of closed queueing networks with blocking and general service-time distributions. Useful practical applications of these methods would be for optimization of performance of computer systems, communication networks, and automated manufacturing complexes. The accuracy of the methods is illustrated by several numerical examples.
