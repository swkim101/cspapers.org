Secure group communication is an increasingly popular research area having received much attention in recent years. The fundamental challenge revolves around secure and efcient group key management. While centralized methods are often appropriate for key distribution in large groups, many collaborative group settings require distributed key agreement techniques. This work investigates a novel approach to group key agreement by blending binary key trees with DiAEe-Hellman key exchange. The resultant protocol suite is very simple, secure and fault-tolerant. Moreover, its eAEciency surpasses that of prior art.
