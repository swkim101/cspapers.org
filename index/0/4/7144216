The Ada language has for long provided support for the development of reliable real-time systems, with a model of computation amenable for real-time analysis. To complement the already existent multiprocessor support in the language, an ongoing effort is underway to extend Ada with a fine-grained parallel programming model also suitable for real-time systems. This paper overviews the model which is being proposed, pointing out the main issues still open and road ahead.
