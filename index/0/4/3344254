Mobile phones are becoming de facto pervasive devices for people's daily use. This demonstration illustrates a new interaction, Tilt & Touch, to enable a smart phone to be a 3D controller. It exploits capacitive touchscreen and built-in MEMS motion sensors. When people want to navigate in a virtual reality environment on a large display, they can tilt the phone for viewpoint transforming, touch the phone screen for avatar moving, and pinch screen for viewing camera zooming. The virtual objects in the virtual reality environment can be rotated accordingly by tilting the phone.
