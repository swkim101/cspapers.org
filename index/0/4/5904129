We describe a variant of Edelsbrunner's WRAP algorithm for surface reconstruction, for which we can prove geometric and topological guarantees within the Îµ-sampling model. The WRAP algorithm is based on ideas from Morse theory applied to the flow map induced by certain distance function. The variant is made possible by a previous result on the "separation" of critical points for a related distance function that directly applies in this case. Though the variant is easily proposed, in order to prove the quality guarantees for the output, we need to closely investigate the geometric properties of the flow map.
