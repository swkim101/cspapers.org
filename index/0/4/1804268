Given a stereo pair it is possible to recover a depth map and use that depth to render a synthetically defocused image. Though stereo algorithms are well-studied, rarely are those algorithms considered solely in the context of producing these defocused renderings. In this paper we present a technique for efficiently producing disparity maps using a novel optimization framework in which inference is performed in “bilateral-space”. Our approach produces higher-quality “defocus” results than other stereo algorithms while also being 10 - 100× faster than comparable techniques.
