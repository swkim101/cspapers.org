We describe a method for preprocessing a weighted planar undirected graph and representing the results of the preprocessing so as to facilitate subsequent approximate distance queries. For any 0 < ε < 1/10, a representation can be constructed so that computing an ε-approximate distance from one node to another takes <i>O</i>(ε<sup>-1</sup>) time, principally consisting of about 15ε<sup>-1</sup> additions. The representation requires storage of 7.2ε<sup>-1</sup><i>n</i> log<inf>2</inf> <i>n</i> distances. By using compressed representation of the distances, the number of bytes required is about .5<i>n</i>ε<sup>-1</sup>(9 + 3 log ε<sup>-1</sup>)log<inf>2</inf> <i>n</i> (at the expense of a small increase in query time).
