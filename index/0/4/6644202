A description will be given of a procedure to assign the most likely probabilities to each of the rules of a given context-free grammar. The grammar developed by S. Kuno at Harvard University was picked as the basis and was successfully augmented with rule probabilities. A brief exposition of the method with some preliminary results, when used as a device for disambiguating parsing English texts picked from natural corpus, will be given.
