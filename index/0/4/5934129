This paper describes an interactive computer-aided design system which converts a state table description of a small scale synchronous digital system into a logic diagram. The input to the design programs is a State Table and a Unit Control Table that is generated by another design automation program. The State Table sequences the operations of the system. The Unit Control Table describes the operations that are to be performed on the defined units of the digital system and the conditions under which the operations are to be performed. The output of the design system is a detailed logical design of the control logic of the digital system. The output is in the form of an interconnection diagram that can be read by a digital hardware simulation program.
 The Computer-Aided Logic Design (CALD) System is interactive to allow the designer to change various parameters and generate many different logic designs for any particular State Table. The user may specify the state assignment, the type of memory element, and the maximum allowed gate fan-in. CALD assists the designer in performing State Table reduction and generates the state assignment at the users option. The tabular description of the digital machine is translated into a Boolean description resulting in a set of cannonical form Boolean equations in sum of product form. Memory element application equations are generated. Boolean equation minimization is performed followed by a factoring routine to enforce the fan-in constraint. The equations are then translated into a logic diagram.
 The CALD system is implemented in FORTRAN and running on a mini-computer with 8K of core.
