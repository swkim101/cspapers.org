User effect in terms of influencing the validity and reliability of results derived from standard usability tests has been studied with different approaches during the last decade, but inconsistent findings were obtained. User effect is further complicated by other confounding variables. With the use of various computational models, we analyze the extent of user effect in a relatively complex arrangement of international usability tests in which four different European countries were involved. We explore five aspects of user effect, including optimality of sample size, evaluator effect, effect of heterogeneous subgroups, performance of task variants, and efficiency of problem discovery. Some implications for future research are drawn.
