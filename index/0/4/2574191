Regular expressions have served as the dominant workhorse of practical information extraction for several years. However, there has been little work on reducing the manual effort involved in building high-quality, complex regular expressions for information extraction tasks. In this paper, we propose ReLIE, a novel transformation-based algorithm for learning such complex regular expressions. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on multiple datasets and compare it against the CRF algorithm. We show that ReLIE, in addition to being an order of magnitude faster, outperforms CRF under conditions of limited training data and cross-domain data. Finally, we show how the accuracy of CRF can be improved by using features extracted by ReLIE.
