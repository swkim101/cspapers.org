The way we watch television is changing with the introduction of attractive Web activities that move users away from TV to other media. The integration of the cultures of TV and Web is still an open issue. How can we make TV more open? How can we enable a possible collaboration of these two different worlds? TV-Web convergence is much more than placing a Web browser into a TV set or putting TV content into a Web media player. The NoTube project, funded by the European Community, is demonstrating how an open and general set of tools adaptable to a number of possible scenarios and allowing a designer to implement the targeted final service with ease can be introduced. A prototype based on the NoTube model in which the Smartphone is used as secondary screen is presented. The video demonstration [11] is available at http://youtu.be/dMM7MH9CZY8.
