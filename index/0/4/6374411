This workshop introduces embedded programming and hardware using Arduino in a creative context to make machines that make drawings. This is a powerful way to introduce programming and physical computing concepts to students from high school to undergraduate and to students who might not normally be intrigued by a computing course. Participants experience this curriculum first hand by using breadboards and electronic components to create circuits that they control programmatically. Using the Arduino C-based software, participants modify and develop code to control light sensors, range finders, pressure sensors, and servos. Provided art materials turn the circuits into mesmerizing contraptions that draw. Laptop required. Arduino and electronic components provided during the workshop.
