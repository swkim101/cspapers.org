We present a fully-automated method for real-time and marker-free 3D human motion capture. The system computes the 3D shape of the person filmed from a synchronized camera set. We obtain a robust and real-time system by using both a fast 3D shape analysis and a skin segmentation algorithm for human tracking. A skeleton-based approach facilitates the shape analysis. We are able to track fast and complex human motion in very difficult cases, like self-occlusion. Results on long video sequences with rapid and complex movements, demonstrate our approach robustness.
