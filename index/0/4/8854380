In this study, we propose floatio: a floating tangible user interface that makes it easy to create a perception of animacy (lifelike movement). It has been pointed out that there are three requirements that make animacy more likely to be perceived: interactivity, irregularities, and automatic movement resisting the force of gravity. Based on these requirements, floatio provides a tangible user interface where a polystyrene ball resembling a pixel is suspended in a stream of air where it can be positioned passively by the user, or autonomously by the system itself. To implement floatio, we developed three mechanisms: a floating field mechanism, a pointer input/output mechanism and a hand-over mechanism. We also measured the precision of the pointer input/output and hand-over mechanisms.
