Set-associative cache architectures are commonly used. These caches consist of a number of ways, each of the same size. We have observed that the different ways have very different utilization, which motivates the design of caches with heterogeneous way sizes. This can potentially result in higher performance for the same area, better capabilities to implement dynamically adaptive schemes, and more flexibility for choosing the size of the cache.This paper proposes a novel cache architecture, the Heterogeneous Way-Size cache (HWS cache), in which the different cache ways may have different sizes. HWS caches are shown to outperform conventional caches for L1 (data and instruction) and L2 caches. For instance, a HWS cache can achieve up to 20% dynamic and leakage energy savings with respect to its conventional cache counterpart, while the hit ratio is practically the same.We also present a Dynamically Adaptive version of the HWS cache (DAHWS cache). DAHWS caches are shown to be more adaptive than conventional architectures. Using state-of-the-art resizing schemes, we show that DAHWS caches achieve higher energy savings and lower miss rates than conventional caches when using the same resizing schemes, due to their higher flexibility. For a L1 instruction cache the active ratio is reduced 4% more (66% total reduction) than state-of-the-art techniques and the DAHWS cache hit ratio is higher. The active ratio is also reduced up to 55% and 41% for L1 data and L2 caches respectively.
