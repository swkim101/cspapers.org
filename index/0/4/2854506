Range queries for querying the current and future positions of the moving objects have received growing interests in the research community. Existing methods, however, assume that an object only moves along an anticipated path. In this paper, we study the problem of answering probabilistic range queries on moving objects based on an uncertainty model, which captures the possible movements of objects with probabilities. We conduct a performance study, which shows our proposal significantly reduces the number of object examinations and the overall cost of the query evaluation.
