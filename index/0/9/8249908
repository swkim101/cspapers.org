Human age estimation has recently become an active research topic in computer vision and pattern recognition, because of many potential applications in reality. In this paper we propose to use the kernel partial least squares (KPLS) regression for age estimation. The KPLS (or linear PLS) method has several advantages over previous approaches: (1) the KPLS can reduce feature dimensionality and learn the aging function simultaneously in a single learning framework, instead of performing each task separately using different techniques; (2) the KPLS can find a small number of latent variables, e.g., 20, to project thousands of features into a very low-dimensional subspace, which may have great impact on real-time applications; and (3) the KPLS regression has an output vector that can contain multiple labels, so that several related problems, e.g., age estimation, gender classification, and ethnicity estimation can be solved altogether. This is the first time that the kernel PLS method is introduced and applied to solve a regression problem in computer vision with high accuracy. Experimental results on a very large database show that the KPLS is significantly better than the popular SVM method, and outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in human age estimation.
