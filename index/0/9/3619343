This paper demonstrates how fault simulation of building blocks found in data-path architectures can be performed extremely efficiently and accurately by taking advantage of their simple functional models and structural regularity. This technique can be used to accelerate the simulation of those blocks in virtually any fault simulation environment, resulting in fault simulation algorithms that can perform fault grading in a very demanding BIST environment.
