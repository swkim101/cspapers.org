Text mining is the technique that helps users find useful information from a large amount of digital text documents on the Web or databases. Instead of the keyword-based approach which is typically used in this field, the pattern-based model containing frequent sequential patterns is employed to perform the same concept of tasks. However, how to effectively use these discovered patterns is still a big challenge. In this study, we propose two approaches based on the use of pattern deploying strategies. The performance of the pattern deploying algorithms for text mining is investigated on the Reuters dataset RCVI and the results show that the effectiveness is improved by using our proposed pattern refinement approaches.
