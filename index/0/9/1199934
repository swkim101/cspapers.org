In this paper, we report results on answering questions for the reading comprehension task, using a machine learning approach. We evaluated our approach on the Remedia data set, a common data set used in several recent papers on the reading comprehension task. Our learning approach achieves accuracy competitive to previous approaches that rely on hand-crafted, deterministic rules and algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reports that the use of a machine learning approach achieves competitive results on answering questions for reading comprehension tests.
