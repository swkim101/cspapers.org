The Steiner tree problem in weighted graphs seeks a minimum weight connected subgraph containing a given subset of the vertices (terminals). We present a new polynomial-time heuristic with an approximation ratio approaching 1 + 1~___33 ~ 1.55, which improves upon the previously best-known approximation algorithm of [10] with performance ratio ~ 1.59. In quasi-bipartite graphs (i.e., in graphs where all non-terminals are pairwise disjoint), our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of ~ 1.28, whereas the previously best method achieves an approximation ratio approachiug 1.5 [19]. For complete graphs with edge weights 1 and 2, we show that our heuristic has an approximation ratio approaching ~ 1.28, which 4 improves upon the previously best-known ratio of ~ [4]. Our method is considerably simpler and easier to implement than previous approaches. Our techniques can also be used to prove that the Iterated 1-Steiner heuristic [14] achieves an approximation ratio of 1.5 in quasi-blpartite graphs, thus providing the first known non-trivial performance ratio of this well-known method. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Given an arbi t rary weighted graph with a distinguished vertex subset, the Steiner Tree Problem asks for a minimum-cost subtree spanning the distinguished vertices. Steiner trees are important in various applications such as VLSI routing [14], wirelength es t imat ion [6], phylogenetic tree reconstruction in biology [11], and network routing [12]. The Steiner Tree Problem is N P h a r d even in the Euclidean or rectilinear metrics [8]. Arora established tha t Euclidean and rectilinear minimum-cost Steiner trees can be efficiently approximated arbitrari ly close to optimal [1]. On the other hand, unless P = N P , the Steiner Tree Problem in general graphs c~.nnot be approximated within a factor of 1 + e for sufficiently small e > 0 [4, 7]. For arbi t rary weighted graphs, the best Steiner approximat ion ratio achievable within polynomial t ime was gradually decreased from 2 to 1.59 in a series of works [20, 21, 2, 22, 18, 15, 10]. In this paper we present a polynomialt ime approximation scheme with a performance ratio approaching 1 + ~ ~ 1.55 which improves upon the previously best -known ratio of 1.59 due to "This work was supported by a Packard Foundation Fellowship, by a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award (MIP-9457412), and by a GSU Research Initiation Grant.
