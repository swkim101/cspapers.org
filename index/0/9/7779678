However, traditional approaches either modeled these two kinds of behaviors in an isolated way or relied on a static assumption of a SNS. Thus, it is still unclear how do the roles of users' historical preferences and the dynamic social network structure affect the evolution of SNSs. Furthermore, can jointly modeling users' temporal behaviors in SNSs benefit both behavior prediction tasks?In this paper, we leverage the underlying social theories(i.e., social influence and the homophily effect) to investigate the interplay and evolution of SNSs. We propose a probabilistic approach to fuse these social theories for jointly modeling users' temporal behaviors in SNSs. Thus our proposed model has both the explanatory ability and predictive power. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.
