This paper describes our design of real-time systems laboratories in an integrated theme of study which includes automatic control. The theme appears at the end of the third year of a 4,5 year master of engineering programme, which adopts Problem-Based Learning (PBL) as a main pedagogical method. We describe the rationale behind our choice of application area, the lab environment, and the operating system used. The paper concludes by giving some qualitative evaluations as well as some quantitative measures based on limited data.
