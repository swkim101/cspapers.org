Parallel computing with more and more cores is here to stay. This workshop presents four independent, class-tested, primarily hands-on modules for incrementally adding parallelism in undergraduate CS courses, each requiring 1 to 3 class days and versatile for diverse courses and curricula: parallelizing loops and sharing memory on Intel's Manycore Testing lab (for a second CS course or for computer organization); parallel web crawler in Java or C++ (second CS course); parallel sorting (algorithms); Ã€- calculus theory for communicating sequential processes (theory of computation). Workshop materials provided, drawn from CSinParallel.org. Intended audience: CS instructors. Laptop recommended (Windows, Mac, Linux).
