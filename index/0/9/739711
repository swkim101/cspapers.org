Ranking is a very important topic in information retrieval. While algorithms for learning ranking models have been intensively studied, this is not the case for feature selection, despite of its importance. The reality is that many feature selection methods used in classification are directly applied to ranking. We argue that because of the striking differences between ranking and classification, it is better to develop different feature selection methods for ranking. To this end, we propose a new feature selection method in this paper. Specifically, for each feature we use its value to rank the training instances, and define the ranking accuracy in terms of a performance measure or a loss function as the importance of the feature. We also define the correlation between the ranking results of two features as the similarity between them. Based on the definitions, we formulate the feature selection issue as an optimization problem, for which it is to find the features with maximum total importance scores and minimum total similarity scores. We also demonstrate how to solve the optimization problem in an efficient way. We have tested the effectiveness of our feature selection method on two information retrieval datasets and with two ranking models. Experimental results show that our method can outperform traditional feature selection methods for the ranking task.
