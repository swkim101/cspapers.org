Passive running robot can run down shallow slope with no energy source without gravity. The robot can generate a stable limit cycle. Dynamics of passive running is very interesting target and important for developing the robot and understanding the human locomotion. By the way, running high jumper can jump very high. The point of jumping is to transfer horizontal velocity into lifting momentum through the hinged-movement. In this paper, we demonstrate the experimental passive running based on the hinged-movement. Moreover, we derive the fixed point of the passive running, and analyze its stability.
