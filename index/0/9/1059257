The last decade of research and practice in user interface design has given us some good models for designing user interfaces. Getting input from users early and continuously throughout the design process, using rapid prototyping and iterative design techniques, and conducting formal usability testing are now proven methods for assuring good user interfaces. In the real world, however, we often work on projects where it is difficult to put these methods into practice. In this paper we will describe some strategies for making the best possible user interface design decisions given extremely tight schedules, shifting market priorities, and other typical constraints.
