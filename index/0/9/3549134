Wireless Sensor networks (WSN) is the most emerging technology and it has great potential to be employed in some of the critical situations which includes battlefields and most emerging commercial applications. Some of them are surveillance of traffic, healthcare and smart homes and habitat monitoring and many other scenarios. WSNs are extremely vulnerable to different types of attacks internally and also mainly external attacks, because of various factors such as nodes with resource that are constrained and packages that are resistant to tamper. As a result, security is an important factor while the infrastructure and protocols of sensor networks are designed. Various types of security threats become possible using wireless communication technology. Sensor networks become vulnerable to a variety of potential attacks, while some of the environment remains unattended. In our comparative study, we discuss a wide variety of attacks that affects the performance of nodes in sensor network and also few mechanisms necessary for intrusion detection that gives right directions for further research work.
