Protocols are modular abstractions that capture patterns of interaction among agents. The compelling vision behind protocols is to enable creating customized interactions by refining and composing existing protocols. Realizing this vision presupposes (1) maintaining repositories of protocols and (2) refining and composing selected protocols. To this end, this paper synthesizes recent advances on protocols and on the knowledge representation of actions. This paper presents MAD-P, a modular action description language tailored for protocols. MAD-P enables building an aggregation hierarchy of protocols via composition. This paper demonstrates the value of such compositions via a simplified, but realistic, business scenario.
