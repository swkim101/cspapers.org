Persistent memory places NVRAM on the memory bus, offering fast access to persistent data. Yet maintaining NVRAM data persistence raises a host of challenges. Most proposed schemes either incur much performance overhead or require substantial modifications to existing architectures. We propose a persistent memory accelerator design, which guarantees NVRAM data persistence by hardware yet leaving cache hierarchy and memory controller operations unaltered. A nonvolatile transaction cache keeps an alternative version of data updates side-by-side with the cache hierarchy and paves a new persistent path without affecting original processor execution path. As a result, our design achieves the performance close to the one without persistence guarantee.
