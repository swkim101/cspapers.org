This paper studies privacy preserving M-estimators using perturbed histograms. The proposed approach allows the release of a wide class of M-estimators with both differential privacy and statistical utility without knowing a priori the particular inference procedure. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through a careful study of the convergence rates. A practical algorithm is given and applied on a real world data set containing both continuous and categorical variables.
