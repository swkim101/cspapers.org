Grading student submissions of webpage assignments is difficult and time-consuming because it involves reading and evaluating source code for compliance with assignment specifications. In addition, the pages must be examined in a browser to check for required functionality such as working links. As a result fewer assignments tend to be given, or instructors spend significant time grading at the expense of working with students or other necessary activities. There is thus a need for automated assessment of webpage assignments. This paper describes WebWolf, a simple framework for automated assessment of assignments in an introductory web programming class. A WebWolf program can load web pages, find and inspect elements, click links and make assertions about expected results. WebWolf was evaluated with assignments from three different classes and on a set of assignment submissions with injected errors. WebWolf correctly identified errors in the submissions. Manual grading of a four page assignment took an average of 17 minutes, while the WebWolf program took 35 seconds.
