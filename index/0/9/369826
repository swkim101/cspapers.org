This prototype demonstrate a novel method for learning to find transliterations of proper nouns on the Web based on query expansion aimed at maximizing the probability of retrieving transliterations from existing search engines. Since the method we used involves learning the morphological relationships between names and their transliterations, we refer to this IR-based approach as morphological query expansion for machine transliteration. The morphological query expansion approach is general in scope and can be applied to translation and transliteration, but we focus on transliteration in this paper.
