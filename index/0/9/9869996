Docx2Go is a new framework to support editing of shared documents on mobile devices. Three high-level requirements influenced its design -- namely, the need to adapt content, especially textual content, on the fly according to the quality of the network connection and the form factor of each device; support for concurrent, uncoordinated editing on different devices, whose effects will later be merged on all devices in a convergent and consistent manner without sacrificing the semantics of the edits; and a flexible replication architecture that accommodates both device-to-device and cloud-mediated synchronization. Docx2Go supports on-the-go editing for XML documents, such as documents in Microsoft Word and other commonly used formats. It combines the best practices from content adaptation systems, weakly consistent replication systems, and collaborative editing systems, while extending the state of the art in each of these fields. The implementation of Docx2Go has been evaluated based on a workload drawn from Wikipedia.
