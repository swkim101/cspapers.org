As popular web sites turn to content delivery networks (CDNs) for full-site delivery, there is an opportunity to improve the end-user experience by optimizing the delivery of entire web pages, rather than just individual objects. In particular, this paper explores page-structure-aware strategies for placing objects in CDN cache hierarchies. The key idea is that the objects in a web page that have the largest impact on page latency should be served out of the closest or fastest caches in the hierarchy. We present schemes for identifying these objects and develop mechanisms to ensure that they are served with higher priority by the CDN, while balancing traditional CDN concerns such as optimizing the delivery of popular objects and minimizing bandwidth costs. To establish a baseline for evaluating improvements in page latencies, we collect and analyze publicly visible HTTP headers that reveal the distribution of objects among the various levels of a major CDN's cache hierarchy. Through extensive experiments on 83 real-world web pages, we show that latency reductions of over 100 ms can be obtained for 30% of the popular pages, with even larger reductions for the less popular pages. Using anonymized server logs provided by the CDN, we show the feasibility of reducing capacity and staleness misses of critical objects by 60% with minimal increase in overall miss rates, and bandwidth overheads of under 0.02%.
