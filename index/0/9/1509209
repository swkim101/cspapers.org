This investigation of gendered experiences in computer science and computer engineering (CSE) doctoral programs uses survey data from a nationwide stratified random sample. Analyses of data from 41 departments show that women CSE doctoral students have less confidence than men students that they can achieve their educational goals. Moreover, women's confidence is significantly affected by their comfort asking questions in class, which is in turn affected by faculty beliefs about the relationship between diversity and student quality. Program rank also has a negative effect on confidence, but affects men and women similarly.
