The problem of appearance-based mapping and navigation in outdoor environments is far from trivial. In this paper, an appearance-based topological map, covering a large, mixed indoor and outdoor environment, is built incrementally by using panoramic images. The map is based on image similarity, so that the resulting segmentation of the world corresponds closely to the human concept of a place. Using high-resolution images and the epipolar constraint, the resulting map is shown to be very suitable for localization, even when the environment has undergone seasonal changes.
