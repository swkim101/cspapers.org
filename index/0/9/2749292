We provide an analysis of the turbo decoding algorithm (TDA) in a setting involving Gaussian densities. In this context, we are able to show that the algorithm converges and that - somewhat surprisingly - though the density generated by the TDA may differ significantly from the desired posterior density, the means of these two densities coincide.
