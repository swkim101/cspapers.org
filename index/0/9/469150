We are designing and developing a mobile clinical decision support system, known as MET (Mobile Emergency Triage), for supporting emergency triage of different types of acute pain presentations. MET needs to interact with an existing hospital information system, run on handheld computing devices and be suitable for operation in weak connectivity conditions (with unstable connections between mobile clients and a server). The MET system captures necessary hospital data, allows for patients' data entry and provides triage support. By operating on handheld computers, it fits to the regular clinical workflow without introducing any hindrances and disruptions. It supports triage anytime and anywhere, directly at the point of care, and can be used as an electronic patient chart that facilitates structured data collection.
