In this special session, we will discuss the role and value of quantitative instruments in gauging student perspectives in computer science education. After creating the appropriate context, we will discuss the road educators have traveled in creating such instruments as well as review one based on a variation of a survey developed by the University of Maryland Physics Education Research Group. Finally, we will present the importance of gathering this information from the perspective of grant agencies. During our conversation, we will invite our audience members to fill out the survey form for a particular instrument. If we are collectively on the same page, then our responses may be used to establish a baseline to which students progress can be compared.
