This paper presents a placement technique for allocation of logic gates to locations. The placement technique involves four different procedures, namely, constructive placement, linear assignment of signal I/Os, pairwise interchange, and wirability evalution.
 The constructive procedure generates an initial placement configuration by adjoining logic gates (vertices) to a subset (nucleus) of already placed gates on a chip. This is followed by linear assignment of signal I/Os. A neighborhood-biased pairwise interchange procedure improves the initial placement by minimizing the total conductor length, and also utilizes wirability evaluation as a placement selection criterion.
