We investigate intrinsic localization and mapping (ILM) for teams of mobile robots, a multi-robot variant of SLAM where the robots themselves are used as landmarks. We develop what is essentially a straightforward application of Bayesian estimation to the problem, and present two complimentary views on the associated optimization problem that provide insight into the problem and allows one to devise initialization strategies, indispensable in practice. We also provide a discussion of the degrees of freedom and ambiguities in the solution. Finally, we introduce two applications of ILM that bring out its potential: Diffusion Mapping and Marco Polo localization.
