We present an algorithm for learning a model of the effects of actions in noisy stochastic worlds. We consider learning in a 3D simulated blocks world with realistic physics. To model this world, we develop a planning representation with explicit mechanisms for expressing object reference and noise. We then present a learning algorithm that can create rules while also learning derived predicates, and evaluate this algorithm in the blocks world simulator, demonstrating that we can learn rules that effectively model the world dynamics.
