Sequential clock-gating can lead to easier equivalence checking problems, compared to the general sequential equivalence checking (SEC) problem. Modern sequential clock-gating techniques introduce control structures to disable unnecessary clocking. This violates combinational equivalence but maintains sequential equivalence between the original and revised circuits. We propose the use of characteristic graphs (CGs) to extract essential LTL clock-gating properties, which when proved imply certain sequential redundancies. The extraction, proof and subsequent removal of the implied redundancies lead to an efficient SEC procedure for clock-gated circuits. Experiments show that the proposed SEC procedure substantially outperforms existing methods in terms of speed and scalability when applied to several difficult cases.
