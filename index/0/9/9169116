Given a directed graph G = (V, A), the mazimzlm acyclic subgraph problem is to find a subset A’ of the arcs such that G’ = (V,A’) is acyclic and A’ has maximum cardinality. In this paper, we present polynomial-time and RNC algorithms which, when given any graph G without two-cycles, find an acyclic subgraph of size at least (l/2+ fi(l/~~))]A], where A(G) is the maximum degree of G. This bound is tight, in terms of IAI, since there exists a class of graphs without two-cycles for which the largest acyclic subgraph has size at most (l/2 + O(l/,/m))lAl. For the common case of low degree graphs, our algorithms provide an even better improvement over the known algorithms that find an acyclic subgraph of size itAl. For example, for graphs without two-cycles, our algorithms find an acyclic subgraph of size at least $IAI when A(G) = 2 or 3, and %lAI when A(G) = 4 or 5. For A(G) = 2, this bound is optimal in the worst case. Curiously, for 3-regular graphs, we can achieve $lAf, which is slightly better that $IAi. As a consequence of this work, we find that all graphs without two-cycles contain large acyclic subgraphs, a fact which was not previously known.
