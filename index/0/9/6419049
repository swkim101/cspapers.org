In this paper we describe a systematic approach for creating a dialog management system based on a Construct Algebra, a collection of relations and operations on a task representation. These relations and operations are analytical components for building higher level abstractions called dialog motivators. The dialog manager, consisting of a collection of dialog motivators, is entirely built using the Construct Algebra.
