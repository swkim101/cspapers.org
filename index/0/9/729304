Constraint answer set programming is a promising research direction that integrates answer set programming with constraint processing. It is often informally related to the field of Satisfiability Modulo Theories. Yet the exact formal link is obscured as the terminology and concepts used in these two research areas differ. In this paper, we make the link between these two areas precise.
