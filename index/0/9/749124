For the past three consecutive years, UCLA Extension and the UCLA Computer Science Department have jointly offered a two-week program entitled, "Computer Science at UCLA ." The program is designed to update working professionals in specific computer science subspecialties, to provide potential graduate students with an overview of the UCLA computer science curriculum, and to assist engineers and managers in gaining a familiarity with basic computer science principles.
