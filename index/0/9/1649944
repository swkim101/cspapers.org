Emerging large-scale scientific applications require to access large data objects in high and robust performance. We propose RobuSTore, a storage architecture that combines erasure codes and speculative access mechanisms for parallel write and read in distributed environments. The mechanisms can effectively aggregate the bandwidth from a large number of distributed disks and statistically tolerate pear-disk performance variation. Our simulation results affirm the high and robust performance of RobuSTore in both write and read operations compared to traditional parallel storage systems. For example, for a 1GB data access using 64 disks, RobuSTore achieves average bandwidth of 186MBps for write and 400MBps for read, nearly 6x and 15x that achieved by a RAID-0 system. The standard deviation of access latency is only 0.5 second, about 9% of the write latency and 20% of the read latency, and a 5-fold improvement from RAID-0. The improvements are achieved at moderate cost: about 40% increase in I/O operations and 2x-3x increase in storage capacity utilization.
