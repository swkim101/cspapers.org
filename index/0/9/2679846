This paper presents development of an autonomous flying robot (unmanned aerial vehicle) and its verification via flight control experiment. The autonomous flying robot has a global positioning system (GPS) sensor to control its altitude and also a wireless camera to gather visual information from the air. First, we construct a longitudinal model of the autonomous flying robot to design a stable controller using a common Lyapunov approach. The longitudinal model has three degree of freedom, i.e., the altitude, the horizontal position and the pitch angle. A stable controller is designed so as to guarantee the stability of the trajectory tracking control system for the three-degree-of-freedom model. The experimental result demonstrates the viability of the stable trajectory tracking control.
