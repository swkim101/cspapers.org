An interactive computer graphics method is presented for generating three-dimensional geometric information by drawing in two-dimensional plans and simultaneously using a powerful three-dimensional editor. The system was initially developed for its suitability in architectural design procedures, but the strength of this method is not unique to architectural applications. The advantage of this approach is that the user may trace a two-dimensional drawing directly onto a plane in the system's three-dimensional data space. To generate a three-dimensional form, the designer may extrude any or all of the lines into planes, creating a three-dimensional representation from the plan. The user receives continuous visual feedback from the graphic screen at all times. This input cycle may be used or the database may be edited any number of times as a complex representation is generated.
 The program has been interfaced to a number of application routines and color display routines. It has been successfully used in structural analysis, energy analysis, and visual applications. The following describes the specific details of the program, a typical scenario, and some of the architectural and engineering applications.
