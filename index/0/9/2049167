The outline of a unified theory of local pragmatics phenomena is presented, including an approach to the problems of reference resolution, metonymy, and interpreting nominal compounds, and the TACITUS system embodying this theory is described. The theory and system are based on the use of a theorem prover to draw the appropriate inferences from a large knowledge base of commonsense and technical knowledge. Issues of control and minimality are discussed.
