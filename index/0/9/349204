We present a new approach to event-driven simulation that does not use a centralized run-time event queue, yet is capable of handling arbitrary models, including those with unclocked feedback and nonunit delay. The elimination of the event queue significantly reduces run-time overhead, resulting in faster simulation. We have implemented our algorithm in a prototype Verilog simulator called VeriSUIF. Using this simulator we demonstrate improved performance vs. a commercial simulator on a small set of programs.
