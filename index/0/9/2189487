We give necessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions characterizing the computational tasks that can be solved by N asynchronous processes, up to t of which can fail by halting. The range of possible input and output values for an asynchronous task can be associated with a high-dimensional geometric structure called a simplicial complex. Our main theorem characterizes computability y in terms of the topological properties of this complex. Most notably, a given task is computable only if it can be associated with a complex that is simply connected with trivial homology groups. In other words, the complex has “no holes!” Applications of this characterization include the first impossibility results for several long-standing open problems in distributed computing, such as the “renaming” problem of Attiya et. al., the “k-set agreement” problem of Chaudhuri, and a generalization of the approximate agreement problem.
