When different drivers received the same traffic condition information through VMS (Variable Message Sigh), they may image the real traffic situation differently due to their dissimilar individual characteristics. Ignoring this dissimilarity and blindly supplying the same traffic condition information to all travelers cause VMS hard to supply high reliable information. This low reliability would induce travelers more likely to ignore what has been told by VMS. In this paper, a model was established to demonstrate the relationship between traffic-condition-division-speed and information-receivers' individual identities including gender, age, driving years, familiarity with road network and trip purpose. Then with the help of multi-agent simulator—SeSAm, a new model for supplying individual traffic condition information and simulating drivers’ route choice behavior was established. It has been proved that providing individual information can significantly enhance the reliability of traffic condition information which leads to a dynamic flow balance more quickly than before.
