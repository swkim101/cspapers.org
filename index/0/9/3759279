With the utilization of TPM-based trusted platforms in real applications, and the subsequent adaption of the specification to the experience gained from such utilization, it increasingly appears that the TPM architecture has some fundamental flaws that result in more and more complex and expensive hardware requirements. In this paper, we propose a new architecture that resets the trust boundary to a much smaller scale, thus allowing for much simpler and more flexible TPM implementations, without sacrificing the security gains from a classical TPM.
