1. Real-time Virtual Walkthrough Data representing virtual environments (VEs) are getting increasingly large in order to better simulate real scenes. This poses interesting challenges to organize, store, and render the data for interactive navigation in VEs, or walkthrough. A large VE usually consists of thousands of 3D objects, each of which can be represented by hundreds of polygons, and may take thousands of megabytes of storage space. The amount of data is so large that it is impossible to store all of them in the main memory. Even for memory resident models, the graphics pipeline can become a bottleneck quickly with a large amount of data and slow down the rendering to an unacceptable frame rate for the walkthrough.
