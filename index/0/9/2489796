We prove the rst exponential lower bound on the size of any depth 3 arithmetic circuit with unbounded fanin computing an explicit function (the determinant) over an arbitrary nite eld. This answers an open problem of N91] and NW95] for the case of nite elds. We intepret here arithmetic circuits in the algebra of polynomials over the given eld. The proof method involves a new argument on the rank of linear functions, and a group symmetry on polynomials vanishing at certain nonsingular matrices, and could be of independent interest.
