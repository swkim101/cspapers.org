We present a theory that defines performance of packet-switching interconnection networks (delay and capacity) and their cost in terms of their geometry. This is used to prove that square banyan networks have optimal performance/cost ratio. These results, together with some known results on the complexity of routing in multistage networks, show that multistage shuffle-exchange networks are the unique networks with both optimal performance and simple routing. Finally, square delta networks are shown to have optimal area complexity.
