Unsupervised learning techniques can take advantage of large amounts of unannotated text, but the largest text corpus (the Web) is not easy to use in its full form. Instead, we have statistics about this corpus in the form of n-gram counts (Brants and Franz, 2006). While n-gram counts do not directly provide sentences, a distribution over sentences can be estimated from them in the same way that n-gram language models are estimated. We treat this distribution over sentences as an approximate corpus and show how unsupervised learning can be performed on such a corpus using variational inference. We compare hidden Markov model (HMM) training on exact and approximate corpora of various sizes, measuring speed and accuracy on unsupervised part-of-speech tagging.
