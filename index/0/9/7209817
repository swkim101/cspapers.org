In this paper, we describe our current work on bio-inspired locomotion systems using a deformable structure and smart materials, concretely Shape Memory Alloys, exploring the possibility of building motor-less and gear-less robots. A swimming underwater robot has been developed whose movements are generated using such actuators, used for bending the backbone of the fish, which in turn causes a change on the curvature of the body. This paper focuses on how standard swimming patterns can be reproduced with the proposed design, using an actuation dynamics model identified in prior work.
