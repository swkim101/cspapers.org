The Temporal Coding Hypothesis of Miller and colleagues [7] suggests that animals integrate related temporal patterns of stimuli into single memory representations. We formalize this concept using quasi-Bayes estimation to update the parameters of a constrained hidden Markov model. This approach allows us to account for some surprising temporal effects in the second order conditioning experiments of Miller et al. [1, 2, 3], which other models are unable to explain.
