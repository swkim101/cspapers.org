System designers today are focusing less on point solutions for complex systems and more on design spaces, often with a focus on understanding tradeoffs among non-functional properties across such spaces. This shift places a premium on the efficient comparative evaluation of non-functional properties of designs in such spaces. While static analysis of designs will sometimes suffice, often one must run designs dynamically, under comparable loads, to determine properties and tradeoffs. Yet variant designs often present variant interfaces, requiring that common loads be specialized to many interfaces. The main contributions of this paper are a mathematical framework, architecture, and tool for specification-driven synthesis of design spaces and common loads specialized to individual designs for dynamic tradeoff analysis of non-functional properties in large design spaces. To test our approach we used it to run an experiment to test the validity of static metrics for object-relational database mappings, requiring design space and load synthesis for, and dynamic analysis of, hundreds of database designs.
