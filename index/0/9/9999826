Therefore an innovative educational project teaching fundamental concepts of AI at high school level will be presented in this paper. We developed an AI-course covering major topics (problem solving, search, planning, graphs, datastructures, automata, agent systems, machine learning) which comprises both theoretical and hands-on components. A pilot project was conducted and empirically evaluated. Results of the evaluation show that the participating pupils have become familiar with those concepts and the various topics addressed. Results and lessons learned from this project form the basis for further projects in different schools which intend to integrate AI in future secondary science education.
