"Walk-In Music" is a system that provides a new walking experience through synchronized music and pseudo-gravity. This system synchronizes each step with the music being listened to and creates a feeling of generating music through walking. It creates a Walk-In state where music and walking are consistent at all times. In this state, when changing the speed of music, the pedestrian may feel pseudo-gravity based on pseudo-haptics. Our results indicate that by changing the speed of music during the Walk-In state, the walking speed became faster and slower. We call this a Walk-Shift. This demonstrated the possibility of controlling personal walking by music. Walk-In Music has created a pleasant experience by music, and proposed a new relationship between people and music that leads to behavior changes.
