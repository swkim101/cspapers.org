The interest in isomorphisms in models for typed langurges mainly arisees from work done in the study d denotational semantics. This work has led to the notion d solving domain equrtiont as a tool for giving mrthematicd meanin to common amstructs in computer sciena, e.g. recursive definitions d data typea.In this p8per we investigrte the question of which domain equations must hold in all models of a paradigmatic functional language, the typed lambda calculus, and of second order (polymorphic) extensions d it.
