Vector computers have dominated the field of hlgh speed scientiSc computation over the past decade because of their effectiveness in performing repetitive floating point operations. The basic design concept of their arithmetic vector units is ptpelinlng, The units are subdivided into several stages, each of which can work on a pair of operands independently and in parallel. ParUally processed work progresses from stage to stage each clock period. The whole unit functions in a fashion similar to an assembly llne with a conveyor bell And although a floating point operation requires several clock cycles, results can be produced each clock cycle after an initial startup period of the pipa
