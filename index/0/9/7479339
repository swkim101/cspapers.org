From social networks to language modeling, the growing scale and importance of graph data has driven the development of new graph-parallel systems. In this talk, I will review the graph-parallel abstraction and describe how it can be used to express important machine learning and graph analytics algorithms like PageRank and Latent factor models. I will present how systems like GraphLab and Pregel exploit restrictions in the graph-parallel abstraction along with advances in distributed graph representation to efficiently execute iterative graph algorithms orders of magnitude faster than more general data-parallel systems. Unfortunately, the same restrictions that enable graph-parallel systems to achieve substantial performance gains also limit their ability to express many of the important stages in a typical graph-analytics pipeline. As a consequence, existing approaches to graph-analytics typically compose multiple systems through brittle and costly file interfaces. To fill the need for a holistic approach to graph-analytics we introduce GraphX, which unifies graph-parallel and data-parallel computation under a single API and system. I will show how a simple set of data-parallel operators can be used to express graph-parallel computation and how, by applying a collection of query optimizations derived from our work on graph-parallel systems, we can execute entire graph-analytics pipelines efficiently in a more general data-parallel distributed fault-tolerant system achieving performance comparable to specialized state-of-the-art systems.
