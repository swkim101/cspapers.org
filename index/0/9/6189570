With the enormous and still growing amount of data and user interaction on the Web, it becomes more and more necessary for data consumers to be able to assess the trustworthiness of data on the Web. In this paper, we present a framework for trust establishment and assessment on the Web of Data. Different from many approaches that build trust metrics within networks of people, we propose a model to represent the trust in concrete pieces of web data for a specific consumer, in which also the context is considered. Further more, we provide three strategies for trust assessment based on the principles of Linked Data, to overcome the shortcomings of the conventional web of documents: i.e. the lack of semantics and interlinking.
