Varieties of Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) platforms are available each with their own propriety functionality to solve specific messaging challenges. At present, it is not possible to mix and match these propriety features into a customized MOM solution. A number of patterns have been identified that allow a software systems implementation to be more flexible and extensible. This work investigates the use of one such pattern, the POSA Interceptor pattern, in the construction of a MOM framework that is easily customised and extended in a structured way. This framework, Chameleon, is designed to support the use of interceptors (message handlers) with a MOM platform to facilitate dynamic changes to the behaviour of the deployed platform. The framework also allows for interceptors to be used on both the client-side and serverside, permitting advance functionality to be deployed to the client, and for co-operation between client-side and server-side interceptors.
