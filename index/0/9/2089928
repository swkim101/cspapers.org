Pouring is a simple task people perform daily. It is the second most frequently executed motion in cooking scenarios, after pick-and-place. We present a pouring trajectory generation approach, which uses force feedback from the cup to determine the future velocity of pouring. The approach uses recurrent neural networks as its building blocks. We collected the pouring demonstrations which we used for training. To test our approach in simulation, we also created and trained a force estimation system. The simulated experiments show that the system is able to generalize to single unseen element of the pouring characteristics.
