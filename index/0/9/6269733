In the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish, descending pathways to a first-order sensory nucleus have been shown to influence the gain of its output neurons. The underlying neural mechanisms that subserve this descending gain control capability are not yet fully understood. We suggest that one possible gain control mechanism could involve the regulation of total membrane conductance of the output neurons. In this paper, a neural model based on this idea is used to demonstrate how activity levels on descending pathways could control both the gain and baseline excitation of a target neuron.
