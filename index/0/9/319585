The standard method for combating spam, either in email or on the web, is to train a classifier on manually labeled instances. As the spammers change their tactics, the performance of such classifiers tends to decrease over time. Gathering and labeling more data to periodically retrain the classifier is expensive. We present a method based on an ensemble of classifiers that can detect when its performance might be degrading and retrain itself, all without manual intervention. Experiments with a real-world dataset from the blog domain show that our methods can significantly reduce the number of times classifiers are retrained when compared to a fixed retraining schedule, and they maintain classification accuracy even in the absence of manually labeled examples.
