The Domain Name System (DNS) is a one of the most widely used services in the Internet. In this paper, we consider the question of how DNS traffic monitoring can provide an important and useful perspective on network traffic in an enterprise. We approach this problem by considering three classes of DNS traffic: canonical (i.e., RFC-intended behaviors), overloaded (e.g.,black-list services), and unwanted (i.e., queries that will never succeed). We describe a context-aware clustering methodology that is applied to DNS query-responses to generate the desired aggregates. Our method enables the analysis to be scaled to expose the desired level of detail of each traffic type, and to expose their time varying characteristics. We implement our method in a tool we call TreeTop, which can be used to analyze and visualize DNS traffic in real-time. We demonstrate the capabilities of our methodology and the utility of TreeTop using a set of DNS traces that we collected from our campus network over a period of three months. Our evaluation highlights both the coarse and fine level of detail that can be revealed by our method. Finally, we show preliminary results on how DNS analysis can be coupled with general network traffic monitoring to provide a useful perspective for network management and operations.
