1. SUMMARY Computing education is in crisis. Enrollments have fallen to such an extent that some academic computing programs are facing significant reductions in staffing levels or even elimination. Of even greater consequence to society, however, is the growing gap between the number of jobs requiring high-level computing skills and the number of graduates who are prepared to take those positions. Over the long term, this growing shortfall threatens the economic security in many countries. Finding strategies to address this problem is complicated because so many different factors are implicated in the enrollment decline. The complexity of the problem makes it critically important to seek a comprehensive solution strategy that takes that underlying complexity into account. This session offers the chance for representatives of ACMâ€™s Education Board to carry on a discussion with the SIGCSE community about possible responses to this crisis that affects us all. 2. BACKGROUND That there is currently a crisis in computing education is not in doubt. Enrollments have been falling steadily for a number of years, so that enrollments are now often half of what they were five years ago. This dramatic decline in student interest has occurred not only in the United States but also in many other countries.
