This paper describes a tutorial program that serves a double role as an educational tool and a research environment. First, it introduces students to fundamental concepts of propositional logic and gives them practice with theorem proving. Secondly, the program provides an environment in which we can track student learning, explore cognitive issues of human problem solving, and investigate the possibilities of interactive human/machine learning. We have tested the tutorial program on two groups of Discrete Mathematics students and report the results of our assessment. We also discuss the contributions and future directions of our research in interactive human/machine learning.
