We present a method for disambiguating syntactic subjects from syntactic objects (a frequent ambiguity) in German sentences taken from an English-German bitext. We exploit the fact that subject and object are usually easily determined in English. We show that a simple method disambiguates some subject-object ambiguities in German, while making few errors. We view this procedure as the first step in automatically acquiring (mostly) correct labeled data. We also evaluate using it to improve a state of the art statistical parser.
