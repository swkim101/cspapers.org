We present a local learning rule in which Hebbian learning is conditional on an incorrect prediction of a reinforcement signal. We propose a biological interpretation of such a framework and display its utility through examples in which the reinforcement signal is cast as the delivery of a neuromodulator to its target. Three examples are presented which illustrate how this framework can be applied to the development of the oculomotor system.
