Traditional vector-based models use word co-occurrence counts from large corpora to represent lexical meaning. In this paper we present a novel approach for constructing semantic spaces that takes syntactic relations into account. We introduce a formalisation for this class of models and evaluate their adequacy on two modelling tasks: semantic priming and automatic discrimination of lexical relations.
