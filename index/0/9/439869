Why does placing an object from one photograph into another often make the colors of that object suddenly look wrong? One possibility is that humans prefer distributions of colors that are often found in nature; that is, we find pleasing these color combinations that we see often. Another possibility is that humans simply prefer colors to be consistent within an image, regardless of what they are. In this paper, we explore some of these issues by studying the color statistics of a large dataset of natural images, and by looking at differences in color distribution in realistic and unrealistic images. We apply our findings to two problems: 1) classifying composite images into realistic vs. non- realistic, and 2) recoloring image regions for realistic compositing.
