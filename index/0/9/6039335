Facing the new challenges of the spacecraft developing, the concept of cellular space robot (CSR) for both space-craft system construction and on-orbit operation is presented in this paper. The system description and design principles are introduced to ensure the flexibility of the system. And dynamics model for takeover control is developed. After that, the regression models for the parameter identification are deduced based on the dynamics model. An interaction model identification algorithm is presented to solve the parameter identification problem for the distributed cells. Besides, the interactive model identification is validated by simulations. The simulations show that the interactive model identification method can achieve the consensus and convergence.
