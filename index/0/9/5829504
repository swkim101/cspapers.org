Conventional search engines such as Bing and Google provide a user with a short answer to some queries as well as a ranked list of documents, in order to better meet her information needs. In this paper we study a class of such queries that we call math. Calculations (e.g. "12% of 24$ ", "square root of 120"), unit conversions (e.g. "convert 10 meter to feet"), and symbolic computations (e.g. "plot x^2+x+1") are examples of math queries. Among the queries that should be answered, math queries are special because of the infinite combinations of numbers and symbols, and rather few keywords that form them. Answering math queries must be done through real time computations rather than keyword searches or database look ups. The lack of a formal definition for the entire range of math queries makes it hard to automatically identify them all. We propose a novel approach for recognizing and classifying math queries using large scale search logs, and investigate its accuracy through empirical experiments and statistical analysis. It allows us to discover classes of math queries even if we do not know their structures in advance. It also helps to identify queries that are not math even though they might look like math queries. We also evaluate the usefulness of math answers based on the implicit feedback from users. Traditional approaches for evaluating the quality of search results mostly rely on the click information and interpret a click on a link as a sign of satisfaction. Answers to math queries do not contain links, therefore such metrics are not applicable to them. In this paper we describe two evaluation metrics that can be applied for math queries, and present the results on a large collection of math queries taken from Bing's search logs.
