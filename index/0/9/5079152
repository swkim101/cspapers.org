We detail the design of autonomous golf cars which were used in public trials in Singapore's Chinese and Japanese Gardens, for the purpose of raising public awareness and gaining user acceptance of autonomous vehicles. The golf cars were designed to be robust, reliable, and safe, while operating under prolonged durations. Considerations that went in to the overall system design included the fact that any member of the public had to not only be able to easily use the system, but to also not have the option to use the system in an unintended manner. This paper details the hardware and software components of the golf cars with these considerations, and also how the booking system and mission planner facilitated users to book for a golf car from any of ten stations within the gardens. We show that the vehicles performed robustly throughout the prolonged operations with a small localization variance, and that users were very receptive from the user survey results.
