QBI is an icon-based query processing and exploration facility for large distributed databases [3]. As opposed to other interactive query interfaces, it combines (1) a pure iconic specification, i.e., no diagrams of any form, only icon manipulation, with (2) intensional browsing or metaquery tools that assist in the formulation of complete queries without involving path specification or access to the actual data in the database.Path expressions are automatically generated by QBI and irrespective of their length, represented by a single icon, allowing for better use of the screen. It requires no special knowledge of the content of the underlying database nor understanding of the details of the database schema. Hence, QBI is domain independent and equally useful to both unsophisticated and expert users.
