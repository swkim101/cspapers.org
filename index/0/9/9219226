Due to node mobility and limitations on bandwidth availability in wireless channels, there exist unique challenges towards achieving efficient and effective information access in wireless ad hoc networks with mobile nodes. In this paper, we address two critical questions: (1) How may information be accessed with the highest degree of bandwidth efficiency? and (2) How should algorithms be designed so that node mobility contributes positively towards high performance and efficiency? We present iFlow, a middleware-based framework for bandwidth-efficient and delay-aware information access for mobile ad hoc applications. We present the case of information rendezvous, where the demands for information are satisfied by the supplies in a fully distributed fashion, across third-party nodes beyond information suppliers and consumers. Such rendezvous is achieved via controlled diffusion of information from the suppliers, matched by the gleaning process on the consumers. We validate our claims using simulation and experimental results.
