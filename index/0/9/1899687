This article demonstrates how meta-modelling can simplify the construction of domain-and formalism-specific modelling environments. Using AToM3 (a tool for multi-formalism and meta-modelling developed at McGill University), a model is constructed of a hybrid formalism, HS, that combines event scheduling constructs with ordinary differential equations. From this specification, an HS-specific visual modelling environment is synthesized. For the purpose of this demonstration, a simple hybrid model of a bouncing ball is modelled in this environment. It is envisioned that the future of modelling and simulation in general, and more specifically in hybrid dynamic systems design lies in domain-specific computer automated multi-paradigm modelling (CAMPaM) which combines multi-abstraction, multi-formalism, and meta-modelling. The small example presented in this article demonstrates the feasibility of this approach
