Perhaps surprisingly, there are infinite sets that admit mechanical exhaustive search in finite time. We investigate three related questions: What kinds of infinite sets admit mechanical exhaustive search in finite time? How do we systematically build such sets? How fast can exhaustive search over infinite sets be performed?
