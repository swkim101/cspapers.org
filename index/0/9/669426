Content-based routing realized through static networks of brokers usually exhibit nice performance when subscribers with similar interest are physically close to each other (e.g. in the same LAN, domain or in the same geographical area) and connected to a broker which is also nearby. If these subscribers are dispersed on the Internet, benefits of such routing strategy significantly decrease. In this paper we present a Topology Management System (TMS) which is a component of a content-based pub/sub system. The aim of a TMS is to mask dynamic changes of the brokersâ€™ topology to the content-based routing. TMS relies on a self-organizing algorithm whose goal is to place close (in terms of TCP hops) brokers that manage subscribers with similar interests keeping acyclic the topology and without compromising network-level performance. TMS is also resilient to broker failures and allows joining of new brokers.
