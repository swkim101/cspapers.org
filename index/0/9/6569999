Skilled programmers, working on natural tasks, navigate large information displays with apparent ease. We present a computational cognitive model suggesting how this navigation may be achieved. We trace the model on two related episodes of behavior. In the first, the user acquires information from the display. In the second, she recalls something about the first display and scrolls back to it. The episodes are separated by time and by intervening displays, suggesting that her navigation is mediated by long-term memory, as well as working memory and the display. In the first episode, the model automatically learns to recognize what it sees on the display. In the second episode, a chain of recollections, cued initially by the new display, leads the model to imagine what it might have seen earlier. The knowledge from the first episode recognizes this image, leading the model to scroll in search of the real thing. This model is a step in developing a psychology of skilled programmers working on their own tasks.
