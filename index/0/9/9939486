We present a new statistical model for predicting discrete events continuously in time, called Reactive Point Processes (RPP’s). RPP’s are a natural fit for many domains where time-series data are available, and their development was motivated by the important problem of predicting serious events (fires, explosions, power failures) in the underground electrical grid of New York City. RPP’s capture several important properties of this domain such as self-exciting and self-regulating properties as well as the diminishing returns of many events or inspections in a row.
