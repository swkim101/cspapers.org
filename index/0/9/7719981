We study the problems of counting and random generation of strings of a fixed length in regular languages. The regular language is described by a non-deterministic finite automaton or regular expression and the length of the desired strings is given in unary. The problem of exact counting is #P-complete. We give randomized algorithms for approximate counting and almost uniform generation that run in expected time n”(‘sn). We also describe a number of special cases that can be solved in polynomial time. This problem has a variety of applications in computational biology. In addition, there has been considerable theoretical interest in recent years[5] in the complexity of counting and random generation. Our result generalizes work by ([6]).
