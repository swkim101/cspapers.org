Scenario-based methods for evaluating software architecture require a large number of stakeholders to be collocated for evaluation sessions. Collocating stakeholders is often an expensive exercise. We have proposed a framework for distributed evaluation process. We present the proposed framework and initial results of a controlled experiment that we ran to assess the effectiveness of the proposed idea.
