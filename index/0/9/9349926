For the past six years design-related computer applications have been presented in our undergraduate curriculum as design tools rather than as a possible design medium. Students are first introduced to programming techniques and principles and to computer graphics through a computer science course in the second year of our four year curriculum. With this course as a background they are introduced to the use of our statistical program packages and our graphics programs as tools in the second semester of our four semester basic design studio. During this second semester students are taught how to use these two basic tools as part of a total methodological approach to the design process. Computer graphics are used for analysis of mass/space and sequential relationships and our local statistical packages are used for evaluating use patterns of a selected building.
