Electron beam lithography is a rapidly maturing technology that has opened the realm of submicron design to the semiconductor device and circuit designer. This improved pattern resolution has already yielded devices and circuits exhibiting higher density, higher operating frequency, and lower operating power than has been possible with other lithography methods. This paper discusses electron beam lithography and the devices and circuits that have been fabricated with this technology.
