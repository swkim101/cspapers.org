This demonstration shows a powerful high-level, heterogeneous sensor networking framework, Cascades. We intend to demonstrate how, with this framework, application designers have great control over implementation designs without the requirement of in-depth development. Several key components and example applications will be demonstrated, along with some important concepts used in this Python-based framework. The emphasis will be on video sensing and application control in heterogeneous sensor networks consisting of Crossbow Stargate (PC-class) and MicaZ (mote-class) devices.
