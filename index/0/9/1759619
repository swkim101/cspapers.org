This paper presents an efficientapproach to path delay fault simulation. We accelerate fault simulation by more than one order of magnitude with a new speed up technique called path hashing. An intelligent path identification method allows to deal with circuits containing two orders of magnitude more paths than state-of-the-art tools. Using these techniques larger circuits can be handled with a reasonable amount of time and memory.
