We demonstrate a system that we have built on our proposed perception-based image retrieval (PBIR) paradigm. This PBIR system achieves accurate similarity measurements by rooting image characterization in human perception and by learning user's query concept through an intelligent sampling process. We show that our system can usually grasp a user's query concept with a small number of labeled instances.
