Series elastic actuators often use linear metal springs in their drivetrains, which requires design compromises between torque resolution and actuation bandwidth. Nonlinear springs (NLSs), with variable stiffness, overcome this limitation, enabling both high torque resolution and high bandwidth. Current NLS designs combine variable cam structures with off-the-shelf linear springs, which increases the overall size of these torque transmitting elements. NLS size could be reduced by using other materials as an elastic element. We present an optimization-based synthesis method for NLSs that are compact and encode a user-defined torque-deflection profile using elastic elements with an arbitrary stiffness profile. We experimentally validate the proposed method by creating a NLS prototype and testing it on an actuator testbed. The prototype uses rubber as the elastic element, resulting in a compact design that generates the desired torque profile, although hysteresis of the rubber material partially compromises performance. The results suggest that the proposed method successfully generates compact NLS designs, but that rubber elements need to be carefully chosen to mitigate hysteresis.
