Contrast data mining is a key tool for finding differences between sets of objects, or classes, and contrast patterns are a popular method for discrimination between two classes. However, such patterns can be limited in two primary ways: i) They do not readily allow second order differentiation - i.e. discovering contrasts of contrasts, ii) Mining contrast patterns often results in an overwhelming volume of output for the user. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a method which can identify contrast behaviour across both classes and also groups of classes. Furthermore, to increase interpretability for the user, it presents a new technique for finding the attributes which represent the key underlying factors behind the contrast behaviour. The associated mining task is computationally challenging and we describe an efficient algorithm to handle it, based on binary decision diagrams. Experimental results demonstrate that our technique can efficiently identify and explain contrast behaviour which would be difficult or impossible to isolate using standard techniques.
