IR and DB integration has been a long-withstanding research challenge. Most of the work trying to integrate the two elds is motivated by specic application scenarios. In this paper we approach this problem from another perspective. Instead of focusing on IR and DB as whole elds, we restrict the focus to search engines and column stores. We present observations of similarities in the two technologies, and aggregate information on parallel developments in the two elds. We argue that these developments point towards a conuence of column stores and search engines, and one may in fact argue that this conuence has already started. We evaluate the potential in developing an engine capable of handling the workloads traditionally supported by the dierent systems, namely decision support and search workloads, by identifying potential opportunities and challenges. The opportunities include potential areas for technology transfer and more ecient support for features. The identied challenges outline areas for future work whose successfulness will help decide whether a conuence of column stores and search engines is feasible.
