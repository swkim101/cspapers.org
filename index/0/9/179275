We consider the problem of finding association rules that make nearly optimal binary segmentations of huge categorical databases. The optimality of segmentation is defined by an objective function suitable for the user’s objective. An objective function is usually defined in terms of the distribution of a given target attribute. Our goal is to find association rules that split databases into two subsets, optimizing the value of an objective function. The problem is intractable for general objective functions, because letting N be the number of records of a given database, there are 2N possible binary segmentations, and we may have to exhaustively examine all of them. However, when the objective function is convex, there are feasible algorithms for finding nearly optimal binary segmentations, and we prove that typical criteria, such as “entropy (mutual information),” “x2 (correlation) ,” and “gini index (mean squared error) ,” are actually convex. We propose practical algorithms that use computational geometry techniques to handle Permission to copy without fee all or part of this material is gmnted provided that the copies are not made or distributed for direct commercial advantage, the VLDB copyright notice and the title of the publication and its date appear, and notice is given that copying is by permission of the Very Large Data Base Endowment.
