During the past several years, there has been much discussion and controversy over what should be taught in high school mathematics, in general, and in high school geometry, in particular. Numerous mathematicians have encouraged the teaching of transformations as part of the standard high school mathematics curriculum[l-4,6-9]. The results of a recent survey of high school teachers of mathematics indicate that 19% have taught geometric transformations, 26% feel adequately prepared to teach such a topic, and 50% would like to teach the topic if materials were available for the average college prep student[5].
 The topic of transformations is important because transformations are a unifying factor in algebra and geometry. Algebra and geometry are essentially the same material taught from different approaches. In particular, the abstract algebraic concept of a group can be conveyed in purely geometric terms by groups of transformations.
