A motion planning method for robot groups is presented. First, groups are classified into a group on common partnership (P-group) and a group in shape (cluster) based on types of common factors among members of the same group. The concept of cohesion is proposed to express changeability of clusters. Next, a motion planning method with dynamic grouping, which changes number of cluster in the group based on cohesion, is presented. The approach is implemented using the virtual impedance method. The effectiveness of the method is verified by simulation results.
