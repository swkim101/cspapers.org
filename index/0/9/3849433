The rapid development of mobile internet attracts end-users to creating mobile applications. The traditional development process cannot meet their needs. In this paper, we present a cross-platform mobile development environment, EasyApp. It provides a highly-integrated, UI-friendly and easily-operating environment. The architecture of this environment is based on OSGi framework. Users could create mobile applications with draggable widgets and package applications for multiple platforms. Native APIs could be invoked with native API plugins.
