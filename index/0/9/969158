Quadruped walking animals have both a static walking manner and a dynamic walking manner. The static walking can keep their stability structurally, but it only appears in slow speed walking. In high speed walking, the dynamic manner is required. Thus, animals change their gaits to be suited for their walking speed. In this paper, the authors propose a new method for transferring the gaits by autonomous distributed control. This control system includes one central rhythm generator and four distributed controllers. The distributed controller receives a phase signal which is a kind of rhythm clock from the central rhythm generator.
