To provide cost-effective performance evaluation or engineering feedback from circuit test results often requires that complex analyses be performed on large volumes of non-standard data. Using a large scale data management system and a modular design philosophy, a system to cope with the above requirements has been developed. TDAS (Test Data Analysis System) has provided timely and economic solutions to test data analysis problems which might have been intractable by other means.
