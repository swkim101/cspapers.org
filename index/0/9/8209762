This paper describes the development and implementation of a reactive visual module utilized on an autonomous mobile robot to automatically correct in trajectory. The authors use a multisensorial mechanism based on inertial and visual cues. The authors report only on the implementation and the experimentation of this module, whereas the main theoretical aspects have been developed elsewhere.
