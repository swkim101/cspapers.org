The robotic travel aid(RTA) described is a motor wheel chair equipped with vision, sonar, and tactile sensors in addition to a map database system. The visually impaired can get orientation, mobility and obstacle information from the RTA, and can inquire about the present location, land marks and an advanced part of the route. This concept is implemented on an RTA called "HITOMI". It can guide the impaired in a lane marked road and on yellow Braille marked sidewalks, avoiding vehicles.<<ETX>>
