In this paper, we propose Nutrilyzer, a novel mobile sensing system for characterizing the nutrients and detecting adulterants in liquid food with the photoacoustic effect. By listening to the sound of the intensity modulated light or electromagnetic wave with different wavelengths, our mobile photoacoustic sensing system captures unique spectra produced by the transmitted and scattered light while passing through various liquid food. As different liquid foods with different chemical compositions yield uniquely different spectral signatures, Nutrilyzer's signal processing and machine learning algorithm learn to map the photoacoustic signature to various liquid food characteristics including nutrients and adulterants. We evaluated Nutrilyzer for milk nutrient prediction (i.e., milk protein) and milk adulterant detection. We have also explored Nutrilyzer for alcohol concentration prediction. The Nutrilyzer mobile system consists of an array of 16 LEDs in ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared region, two piezoelectric sensors and an ARM microcontroller unit, which are designed and fabricated in a printed circuit board and a 3D printed photoacoustic housing.
