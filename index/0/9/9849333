This study examines the effects of multimodal feedback on the performance of older adults with different visual abilities. Older adults possessing normal vision (n=29) and those who have been diagnosed with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (n=30) performed a series of drag-and-drop tasks under varying forms of feedback. User performance was assessed with measures of feedback exposure times and accuracy. Results indicated that for some cases, non-visual (e.g. auditory or haptic) and multimodal (bi- and trimodal) feedback forms demonstrated significant performance gains over the visual feedback form, for both AMD and normally sighted users. In addition to visual acuity, effects of manual dexterity and computer experience are considered.
