The objective of this paper is to develop and analyze high performance hash based search methods for main memory databases. We define optimal search in main memory databases as the search that requires at most one key comparison to locate a record. Existing hashing techniques become impractical when they are adapted to yield optimal search in main memory databases because of their large directory size. Multi-directory hashing techniques can provide significantly improved directory utilization over single-directory hashing techniques. A multi-directory hashing scheme, called fast search multi-directory hashing, and its generalization, called controlled search multi-directory hashing, are presented. Both methods achieve linearly increasing expected directory size with the number of records. Their performance is compared to existing alternatives.
