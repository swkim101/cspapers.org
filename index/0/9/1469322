Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) differ from other caching systems in terms of both workload characteristics and performance metrics. However, there has been little prior work on large-scale measurement and characterization of content requests and caching performance in CDNs. For workload characteristics, CDNs deal with extremely large content volume, high content diversity, and strong temporal dynamics. For performance metrics, other than hit ratio, CDNs also need to minimize the disk operations and the volume of traffic from origin servers. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale measurement study to characterize the content request patterns using real-world data from a commercial CDN provider.
