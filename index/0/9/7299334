This paper considers whether an undergraduate course in operating systems should involve hands on experimentation with the internals of an operating system running on modern workstations. An introductory section sets the stage by summarizing prior approaches, their goals, merits and shortcomings. This section is followed by a description of the evolutionary plan we developed to progress from what we were doing to a modern hands on facility that would combine the best features of previous approaches. Next, a description of what we did and how we did it is presented. We conclude with the lessons we learned from this experiment. Our major conclusion is that undergraduates should not be expected to explore the internals of workstation operating systems. Although the result was not totally what we anticipated, We believe the project was successful in several aspects.
