A number of systems have been developed that demonstrate the utility of knowledge-based techniques in the construction of software reuse systems. The amount of manual effort expended in the development of such systems can be reduced through the use of a knowledge acquisition environment tailored for a reuse-oriented model of the software development process. We present a model of the software development process and then describe the Bauhaus, a knowledge-based user interface to Ada software libraries.
