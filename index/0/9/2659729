This paper presents the Smart2Poster concept, based on a traditional visual communication tool enhanced by the integration of a proximity technology such as the Near Field Communication (NFC). The concept has been designed and prototyped to study a situated interaction modality, bridging digital information and the surrounding physical world, by means of familiar objects (a poster, a smartphone and/or a TV screen). Two different usage scenarios have driven the design and the implementation of one prototype born to enable offline mediated interactions among public administrations and citizens.
