The planning of grasping motions is demanding due to the complexity of modern robot systems. In Programming by Demonstration, the observation of a human teacher allows to draw additional information about grasping strategies. Rosell showed, that the motion planning problem can be simplified by globally restricting the set of valid configurations to a learned subspace. In this work, the transformation of a humanoid grasping strategy to an anthropomorphic robot system is described by a probabilistic model, called variation model, in order to account for modeling and transformation errors. The variation model resembles a soft preference for grasping motions similar to the demonstration and therefore induces a non-uniform sampling distribution on the configuration space. The sampling distribution is used in a standard probabilistic motion planner to plan grasping motions efficiently for new objects in new environments.
