Recently, the body area networks (BAN) is one of the most hot topics in wireless communications. In this paper, the research progress of antennas and propagation for wireless BAN (WBAN) in Southeast University (SEU) is reported. Other than the methods of numerical simulation and statistic measurement, the radiation and propagation characteristics of antenna nearby a human body are analytically studied by means of an elliptic-cylinder model of lossy dielectric. Also, several kinds of printed antennas are developed for different applications in wireless BAN.
