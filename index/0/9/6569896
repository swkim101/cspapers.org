We present a load generator and performance measurement tool AutoPerf which requires minimal input and configuration from the user, and produces a comprehensive capacity analysis as well as server-side resource usage profile of a Web-based distributed system, in an automated fashion. The tool requires only the workload and deployment description of the distributed system, and automatically sets typical parameters that load generator programs need, such as maximum number of users to be emulated, number of users for each experiment, warm-up time, etc. The tool also does all the co-ordination required to generate a critical type of measure, namely, resource usage per transaction or per user for each software server. This is a necessary input for creating a performance model of a software system.
