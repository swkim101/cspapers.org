We introduce a variant of the multi-vehicle routing problem which accounts for nonholonomic constraints and dense, dynamic obstacles, called MVRP-DDO. The problem is strongly motivated by an industrial mining application. This paper illustrates how MVRP-DDO relates to other extensions of the vehicle routing problem. We provide an application-independent formulation of MVRP-DDO, as well as a concrete instantiation in a surface mining application. We propose a multi-abstraction search approach to compute an executable plan for the drilling operations of several machines in a very constrained environment. The approach is evaluated in terms of makespan and computation time, both of which are hard industrial requirements.
