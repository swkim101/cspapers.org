This paper attempts to get at some of the fundamental properties of distributed computing by means of the following question: “How much does each processor in a network of processors need to know about its own identity, the identities of other processors, and the underlying connection network in order for the network to be able to carry out useful functions?” The approach we take is to require that the processors be designed without any knowledge (or only very broad knowledge) of the networks they are to be used in, and furthermore, that all processors with the same number of communication ports be identical. Given a particular network function, e.g., setting up a spanning tree, we ask whether processors may be designed so that when they are embedded in any connected network and started in some initial configuration, they are guaranteed to accomplish the desired function.
