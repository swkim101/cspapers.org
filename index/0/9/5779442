Previous scalability experiments found that early precision improves as collection size increases. However, that was under the assumption that a collection's documents are all sampled with uniform probability from the same population. We contrast this to a large breadth-first web crawl, an important scenario in real-world Web search, where the early documents have quite different characteristics from the later documents.
