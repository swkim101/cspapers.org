We introduce two new techniques for density estimation. Our approach poses the problem as a supervised learning task which can be performed using Neural Networks. We introduce a stochastic method for learning the cumulative distribution and an analogous deterministic technique. We demonstrate convergence of our methods both theoretically and experimentally, and provide comparisons with the Parzen estimate. Our theoretical results demonstrate better convergence properties than the Parzen estimate.
