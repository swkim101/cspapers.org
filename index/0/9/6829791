The aim of this paper is to provide a hasis for a theory of events and processes that can be used for reasoning about arbitrarily complex dynamic domains involving multiple agents. The approach is based on a model of events that explicitly represents the domain of influence of each event. By scoping an event's domain of influence, most of the problems that have plagued the more conventional stated-transition models of events can be avoided. The effect of performing events, either in isolation or concurrently with other events, is described. To represent constraints among events, a model of processes is developed. This allows the modelling of arbitrarily complex behaviours. Finally, a representation of causal influence is provided that allows the ramifications of any given event occurrence to be modelled.
