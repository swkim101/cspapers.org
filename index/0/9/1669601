In this paper, we present an approach to teaching induction that we call the "conceptual route" of teaching induction. Proofs by induction are central to the study of computer science and students come across them in many courses of their curricula. It is documented in the literature that in general students have difficulties with proofs by induction. Even though through the years some solutions were proposed to improve the situation, recent studies show that students are still having difficulties. Currently, proofs by induction take up too little of the computer science curriculum, and they are taught as a step-by-step procedure to be followed, which is not sufficient for students to gain conceptual understanding. In contrast, our approach aims at students' conceptual understanding by shifting their focus from the syntactic form of proofs by induction to their substance. The theoretical underpinning of our approach is an operationalization of the Induction Principle.
