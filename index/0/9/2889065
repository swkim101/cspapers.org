Multi-dimensional (MD) systems are widely used in scientific applications such as image processing, geophysical signal processing and fluid dynamics. Earlier scheduling methods in synthesizing MD systems do not explore loop pipelining across different dimensions. This paper explores the basic properties of MD loop pipelining and presents an algorithm, called multi-dimensional rotation scheduling, to find an efficientschedule based on the multi-dimensional retiming technique we developed. The description and the correctness of our algorithm are presented in the paper. The experiments show that our algorithm can achieve optimal results efficiently.
