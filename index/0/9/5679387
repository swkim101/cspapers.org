We show analytically how the stability of two-dimensional lateral inhibition neural networks depends on the local connection topology. For various network topologies, we calculate the critical time delay for the onset of oscillation in continuous-time networks and present analytic phase diagrams characterizing the dynamics of discrete-time networks.
