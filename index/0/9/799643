This paper presents a device that significantly improves the safety of ceiling-mounted robots whose end effector orientation remains constant with respect to the vertical direction (e.g. Scara-type robots). The device consists of a three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel mechanism with the Delta architecture on which the revolute actuators have been replaced with torque limiters. The resulting Cartesian force limiting device (CFLD) is implemented as a mechanical connection between the robot and the effector. It is rigid unless excessive forces are applied on the end effector, for example during a collision. The magnitude of force that activates the mechanism is set by properly adjusting the threshold of the torque limiters. Furthermore, a collision can be rapidly detected with a limit switch placed on one of the links of the mechanism and a signal can be sent directly to brakes that will stop the robot, without passing through a controller and thus improving the reliability and reaction-time of the safety system. By mechanically disconnecting the robot from its end effector, the device ensures that the person involved in the collision is only subjected to the inertia of the end effector and thus potential injuries are greatly reduced. This work is the extension of a previous 2-DOF CFLD that was sensitive only to horizontal forces. The new architecture reacts to collisions occuring in any direction and is geometrically optimized for the proposed application.
