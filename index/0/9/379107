Single-query sampling-based motion planners are an efficient class of algorithms widely used today to solve challenging motion planning problems. This paper exposes the common core of these planners and presents a tutorial for their implementation. A set of ideas extracted from algorithms existing in the literature is presented. In addition, lower level implementation details that are often skipped in papers due to space limitations are discussed. The purpose of the paper is to improve our understanding of single-query sampling-based motion planners and motivate our community to explore avenues of research that lead to significant improvements of such algorithms.
