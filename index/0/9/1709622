The Partner Units Problem is a specific type of configuration problem with important applications in the area of surveillance and security. In this work we show that a special case of the problem, that is of great interest to our partners in industry, can directly be tackled via a structural problem decompostion method. Combining these theoretical insights with general purpose AI techniques such as constraint satisfaction and SAT solving proves to be particularly effective in practice.
