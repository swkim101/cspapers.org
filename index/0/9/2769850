Configurations for today's IP networks are becoming increasingly complex. As a result, configuration management is becoming a major cost factor for network providers and configuration errors are becoming a major cause of network disruptions. In this paper, we present and evaluate the novel idea of shadow configurations. Shadow configurations allow configuration evaluation before deployment and thus can reduce potential network disruptions. We demonstrate using real implementation that shadow configurations can be implemented with low overhead.
