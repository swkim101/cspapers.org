Browser-Soar models the perceptual, cognitive, and motor operators of a user searching for information in an on-line help browser. The model accounts for 90% of the browsing behavior observed in ten episodes. This result suggests that much of browsing behavior is a routine cognitive task, describably by GOMS, and extends the boundary of tasks to which GOMS applies to include highly interactive tasks. Further, it also suggests that GOMS analyses can be used to evaluate text-editors and other computer applications, and to help focus design effort.
