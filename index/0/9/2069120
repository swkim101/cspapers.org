TRACTOR is the TELRI Research Archive of Computational Tools and Resources. It features monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual corpora and lexicons in a wide variety of languages, as well as tools for language processing. TRACTOR is a key element of TELRI II, a pan-European alliance of focal national language technology institutions with the emphasis on Central and Eastern European and NIS countries. TRACTOR hopes to complement other archives by providing a service for languages and users who are currently under-represented in existing archives. TRACTOR's unique strength lies in the amount of resources provided by centres in Central and Eastern Europe, and its role at the hub of a network of resource creation, standardisation and distribution which links the EU and non-EU European research communities. The TRACTOR User Community brings together resource providers, academic users and industrial users in an ongoing relationship, which is designed to foster the emergence of joint research projects in language engineering.
