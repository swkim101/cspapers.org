Little is clearly understood about, the similarities, differences, and comparative computational and representational advantages of the many proposals extant for organizing minds "into collections of "mental subagents." Using a new mathematical framework fur exactly specifying the structure of mental organizations, we formulate separately the ideas of multiple pe.-spectivcs, re:Lsoned assumptions, and virtual copies. When combined, these notions form a common backbone for systems as diverse as CONLAN, NI'ITL, and FOL, and show many particular characteristics of those systems results of the "language of thought" adopted for representing the contents of mental subagents. The framework also suggests connections between the "strengths" of mental attitudes, the ambiguity of "self," and the possibilities for self-omniscience.
