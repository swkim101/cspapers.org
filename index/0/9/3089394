Modeling of a connectionist rule-based systems (or Neuro-AJ hybrid system) discussed through the paper will be a fruitful step towards the practical modeling of human cognition. This paper investigates a plausible and useful integration method of symbolic AI techniques and connectionist models and proposes a practical implementation, mainly how variables can be included in the structured information provided as facts and rules in the system.
