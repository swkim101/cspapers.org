In this workshop we bring together researchers and practitioners from diverse disciplines to discuss the future of online reputation systems. Our goal is to combine social and technical perspectives to address three challenges: (1) the social challenges around reputation, privacy, and online identity, (2) the technical challenges around designing adaptable reputation systems which cater to users' privacy concerns, and (3) the user experience challenges around transparency and the design or reputation management tools.
