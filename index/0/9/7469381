Program synthesis is a complex task comprising many interacting subactivities and requiring access to a variety of knowledge sourcesr Recent investigations have discovered the inadequaciest;ef current synthesis techniques to keep pace with increasing difficulties of managing large intricate problem solutions* An alternative approach to software methodologies is the development of intelligent computer systems that mana e the vast amount of information assimilated an % accessed during this process= The system's ttintelli ence" is characterized not by an innate ability to P nvent solutions, but by the incorporation of an internal model of the problem domain and corresponding program solution.
