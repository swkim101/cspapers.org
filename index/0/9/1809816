We address the challenge of automatically generating questions from reading materials for educational practice and assessment. Our approach is to overgenerate questions, then rank them. We use manually written rules to perform a sequence of general purpose syntactic transformations (e.g., subject-auxiliary inversion) to turn declarative sentences into questions. These questions are then ranked by a logistic regression model trained on a small, tailored dataset consisting of labeled output from our system. Experimental results show that ranking nearly doubles the percentage of questions rated as acceptable by annotators, from 27% of all questions to 52% of the top ranked 20% of questions.
