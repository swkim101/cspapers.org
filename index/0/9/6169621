Widget containers are used everywhere on the Web, for instance as customizable start pages to Web desktops. In this poster, we describe the extension of a widget container with an inter-widgets communication layer, as well as the subsequent application programming interfaces (APIs) added to the Widget object to support this feature. We present the benefits of a drag and drop facility within widgets and conclude by a call for standardization of inter-widgets communication on the Web.
