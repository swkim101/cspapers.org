textabstractComputers that negotiate on our behalf hold great 
promise for the future and will even become indispensable in emerging 
application domains such as the smart grid and the Internet of Things. 
Much research has thus been expended to create agents that are able to 
negotiate in an abundance of circumstances. However, up until now, truly 
autonomous negotiators have rarely been deployed in real-world 
applications. This paper sizes up current negotiating agents and 
explores a number of technological, societal and ethical challenges that 
autonomous negotiation systems have brought about. The questions we 
address are: in what sense are these systems autonomous, what has been 
holding back their further proliferation, and is their spread something 
we should encourage? We relate the automated negotiation research agenda 
to dimensions of autonomy and distill three major themes that we believe 
will propel autonomous negotiation forward: accurate representation, 
long-term perspective, and user trust. We argue these orthogonal 
research directions need to be aligned and advanced in unison to sustain 
tangible progress in the field.
