We discuss two video series, one that serves as an introduction to Binary Search, and the other to Selection Sort. Each narrated series begins with an overview of the algorithm and step-by-step simulations on an interactive blackboard. The series next proceeds to a video that illustrates how to perform a complexity analysis with guided examples, and then applies that process to the associated algorithm. The series concludes with a video showcasing a song with algorithm pseudocode as lyrics, which are utilized line by line to implement the algorithm in code. These video series were piloted among a set of introductory courses involving coding and algorithmic concepts at two colleges. We assess the effectiveness of each series in terms of conceptual understanding and changes in student attitudes.
