This paper addresses the issue of identifying the artist style. Our focus is given to singer-songwriters, i.e., those who sing their own compositions. We take the standpoint that the artistic style of a singer-songwriter is reflected in consistent use of both the acoustic sounds and the lyrics, and hypothesize that by combining acoustic features and linguistic features of songs, the artistic styles of an artist can be better captured than by using only one type of features . Although we believe that the degree at which a listener finds a piece of music similar to another is influenced by the listener’s cultural and music backgrounds and by the listener’s state of mind, to make our investigation more plausible we choose to use similarity information available at All Music Guide (www.allmusic.com). In our experiments two artists are thought of as similar if this guide asserts one to be an artist similar to the other on the “Similar Artist” lists. We take the standpoint that the artist similarity information in this guide summarizes the opinions of one or more listeners. Identification of artistic styles based on sounds and lyrics boils down to the problem of learning from heterogeneous data. Here we take a semi-supervised learning approach, in which a classification algorithm is trained for each feature set but the target label is adjusted for input data so as to minimized disagreement between the classifiers.
