Entropy-type measures for the heterogeneity of clusters have been used for a long time. This paper studies the entropy-based criterion in clustering categorical data. It first shows that the entropy-based criterion can be derived in the formal framework of probabilistic clustering models and establishes the connection between the criterion and the approach based on dissimilarity co-efficients. An iterative Monte-Carlo procedure is then presented to search for the partitions minimizing the criterion. Experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.
