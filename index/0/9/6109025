Software debugging starts with bug reports. Test engineers confirm bugs and determine the corresponding developers to fix them. However, the analysis of bug reports is time-consuming and manual inspection is difficult and tedious. To improve the efficiency of the whole process, we propose a bug processing framework that integrates bug report analysis and fault localization. An instance of the framework is implemented for regression faults. Preliminary results on a large open source application demonstrate both efficiency and effectiveness.
