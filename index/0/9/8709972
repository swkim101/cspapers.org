The specific architecture which we consider, that of the Boolean Vector Machine [1], is designed to occupy about twice the silicon area as would the memory of a conventional computer, if both machines have the same number of bits of memory. The BVM achieves much higher performance than a typical conventional machine by reorganizing this silicon area into many tiny Processing Elements, each with their own small local memories. The resulting array of PEs is interconnected by a general permutation network, called the Cube Connected Cycles network [2], at trivial additional cost in silicon area. The BVM is compared in performance to a convent~ional machine, M, of memory-size equal to that of the BVM, and implemented in the same memory technology, so that memory references take the same amount of time on M as on BVM. The complete BVM can then perform a wide variety of parallelizable algorithms at a speed roughly N/Iog2N times faster, where N is about 1/8 the number of words of memory of either machine.
