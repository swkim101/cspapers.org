A novel method for identifying dense communities of classes (clusters) within an Object-Oriented system has been developed. Such communities might possibly imply relevance of functionality and thus be used as Reusable Components. The term "Reusable Components" is used to refer to a set of interrelated classes that represent a module that can be used in different software systems. To accomplish this identification we employ Algebraic Graph Theory (Spectral Graph Partitioning Techniques). From a modified class diagram of the software system we create a graph in which classes stand for the nodes and the discrete messages exchanged between the classes stand for the edges. Our approach is based on an iterative method for partitioning the graph in order to identify possible reusable components within the system. The eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix derived from the graph are used for the partitioning.
