The robotic maneuvering of large space structures is key to a number of future orbital missions. In this paper a large space structure maneuver control algorithm, recently proposed, is extended and experimentally validated. The method uses space robots' manipulators to control the vibration of the structures being maneuvered and their reaction jets perform the large motion maneuvers. The algorithm quickly damps out the vibrations and requires less fuel than reaction jet-based vibration control methods. The approach is called maneuver decoupled control. Its performance is demonstrated and quantitatively evaluated in simulation and experiments.
