STRUCT is a system that learns structural decision trees from positive and negative examples. The algorithm uses a modification of Pagallo and Haussler's FRINGE algorithm to construct new features in a first-order representation. Experiments compare the effects of different hypothesis evaluation strategies, domain representation, and feature construction. STRUCT is also compared with Quinlan's FOIL on two domains. The results show that a modified FRINGE algorithm improves accuracy, but that it is sensitive to the distribution of the examples.
