ih.skaa The LUPSort was recently introduced in a paper presented at the 1990 ACM SIGCSE Technical Symposium. Although the algorithm was presented, only a few special cases were analyzed in detail. In this paper we summarize the algorithm and present a new class of key distributions for analysis. These distributions are analyzed both mathematically and empirically, and the consistency of the results is shown. Finally, the significance of this class of distribution in the overall development of the case study is presented.
