We consider the problem of protein folding in the HP model on the two-dimensional square lattice. This problem is combinatorially equivalent to folding a string of 0's and 1's so that the string forms a self-avoiding walk on the lattice and the number of adjacent pairs of 1's is maximized. We present a linear-time 1/3-approximation algorithm for this problem, improving on the previous best approximation factor of 1/4. The approximation guarantee of this algorithm is based on an upper bound presented by Hart and Istrail [6] and used in all previous papers that address this problem. We show that this upper bound cannot be used to obtain an approximation factor better than 1/2.
