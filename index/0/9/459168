This panel will provide information on the current status of the emerging object-oriented features to COBOL to be formalized in what is anticipated to be the 1997 version of the ISOjANSI COBOL Standard. l’hc intent of the X3-authorized task group, X3J4.1, is not to add a few object-oriented extensions to COBOL, but rather to make COBOL, an object-oriented language. The committee’s goal is to have Object-Oriented COBOL be the language of choice for programming organizations moving to the object-oriented paradigm. The committee’s design fosters the co-existence and interaction of both legacy and object-oriented COBOL programs. Legacy programs will be able to be altered to invoke methods; methods will be able to call legacy programs. The panelists are each X3J4.1 participants, some from the committee’s inception.
