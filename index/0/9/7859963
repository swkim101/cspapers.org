A crucial part of the Computer Organization course is the examination of and experimentation with digital logic circuits. In departments with limited budgets, however, this activity can be problematic. Due to historical roots and enrollment sizes, departments tend to focus on software aspects of computer science. This means that hardware concerns are often relegated to textbook and paper-and-pencil examination. This paper details how to use field programmable gate arrays -- hardware gates with a programming interconnection switch -- in the Computer Organization course. We will overview the reasons for using them, outline ways to use them effectively and cheaply, and demonstrate FEWD, our system for integrating visual design with FPGAs for student experimentation.
