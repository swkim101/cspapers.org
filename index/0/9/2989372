Discovering correspondences between schema elements is a crucial task for data integration. Most schema matching tools are semi-automatic, e.g. an expert must tune some parameters (thresholds, weights, etc.). They mainly use several methods to combine and aggregate similarity measures. However, their quality results often decrease when one requires to integrate a new similarity measure or when matching particular domain schemas. This paper describes YAM (Yet Another Matcher), which is a schema matcher factory. Indeed, it enables the generation of a dedicated matcher for a given schema matching scenario, according to user inputs. Our approach is based on machine learning since schema matchers can be seen as classifiers. Several bunches of experiments run against matchers generated by YAM and traditional matching tools show how our approach is able to generate the best matcher for a given scenario.
