This paper describes a simple and principled approach to automatically construct sentiment lexicons using distant supervision. We induce the sentiment association scores for the lexicon items from a model trained on a weakly supervised corpora. Our empirical findings show that features extracted from such a machine-learned lexicon outperform models using manual or other automatically constructed sentiment lexicons. Finally, our system achieves the state-of-the-art in Twitter Sentiment Analysis tasks from Semeval-2013 and ranks 2nd best in Semeval-2014 according to the average rank.
