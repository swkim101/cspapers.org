We consider the problem of organizing and browsing the top ranked portion of the documents returned by an information retrieval system. We study the effectiveness of a document organization in helping a user to locate the relevant material among the retrieved documents as quickly as possible. In this context we examine a set of clustering algorithms and experimentally show that a clustering of the retrieved documents can be significantly more effective than traditional ranked list approach. We also show that the clustering approach can be as effective as the interactive relevance feedback based on query expansion while retaining an important advantage -- it provides the user with a valuable sense of control over the feedback process.
