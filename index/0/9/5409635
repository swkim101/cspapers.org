Recently, discriminative word alignment methods have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies by extending the range of information sources that can be easily incorporated into aligners. The chief advantage of a discriminative framework is the ability to score alignments based on arbitrary features of the matching word tokens, including orthographic form, predictions of other models, lexical context and so on. However, the proposed bipartite matching model of Taskar et al. (2005), despite being tractable and effective, has two important limitations. First, it is limited by the restriction that words have fertility of at most one. More importantly, first order correlations between consecutive words cannot be directly captured by the model. In this work, we address these limitations by enriching the model form. We give estimation and inference algorithms for these enhancements. Our best model achieves a relative AER reduction of 25% over the basic matching formulation, outperforming intersected IBM Model 4 without using any overly compute-intensive features. By including predictions of other models as features, we achieve AER of 3.8 on the standard Hansards dataset.
