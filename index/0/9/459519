We present a geometric view on bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora, which allows to re-interpret the methods proposed so far and identify unresolved problems. This motivates three new methods that aim at solving these problems. Empirical evaluation shows the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, as well as a significant gain in the accuracy of extracted lexicons.
