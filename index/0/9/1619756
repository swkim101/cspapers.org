Because of this misalignment, our previous work has shown that when the agent applies traditional approaches to generate referring expressions for describing target objects with minimum descriptions, the intended objects often cannot be correctly identified by the human. To address this problem, motivated by collaborative behaviors in human referential communication, we have developed two collaborative models - an episodic model and an installment model - for referring expression generation. Both models, instead of generating a single referring expression to describe a target object as in the previous work, generate multiple small expressions that lead to the target object with the goal of minimizing the collaborative effort. In particular, our installment model incorporates human feedback in a reinforcement learning framework to learn the optimal generation strategies. Our empirical results have shown that the episodic model and the installment model outperform previous non-collaborative models with an absolute gain of 6% and 21% respectively.
