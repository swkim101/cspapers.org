We have implemented SmartNotes, a system that automatically acquires labeled meeting data as users take notes during meetings and browse the notes afterwards. Such data can enable meeting understanding components such as topic and action item detectors to automatically improve their performance over a sequence of meetings. The SmartNotes system consists of a laptop based note taking application, and a web based note retrieval system. We shall demonstrate the functionalities of this system, and will also demonstrate the labeled data obtained during typical meetings and browsing sessions.
