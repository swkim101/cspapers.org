Most current sensor nodes are composed of a microcontroller and a radio. Their real-time and peak performance would be a bottleneck when executing compute-intensive tasks. Several works demonstrate that adding a hardware co-processor could accelerate the execution speed of the sensor nodes. So far, no simulators can simulate these new sensor nodes in wireless networks. An extension to SUNSHINE [1], a hardware-software emulator is developed to fill the void.
