This paper bridges wireless communication with wireless power transfer. It shows that mobile phones can be charged remotely, while in the user's pocket by applying the concept of MIMO beamforming. However, unlike MIMO beamforming in communication systems which targets the radiated field, we transfer power by beamforming the non-radiated magnetic field and steering it toward the phone. We design MagMIMO, a new system for wireless charging of cell phones and portable devices. MagMIMO consumes as much power as existing solutions, yet it can charge a phone remotely without being removed from the user's pocket. Furthermore, the phone need not face the charging pad, and can charge independently of its orientation. We have built MagMIMO and demonstrated its ability to charge the iPhone and other smart phones, while in the user's pocket.
