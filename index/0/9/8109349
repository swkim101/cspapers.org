This paper presents a 2-DOF controlled softness display and its application to a tactile tele-presentation system. It has been reported that softness feelings can be displayed by reproducing contact area, or contact width, on a fingertip. Several softness displays based on the contact area control have been reported in past studies, but all of them had only one degree-of-freedom (DOF) for their contact area control. Resultantly, the reproduced contact area was symmetric, which could only produce uniform surface feelings. In some practical deformable surfaces, however, the contact conditions are not uniform over fingertip surfaces; for example, if there is a small lump beneath a soft deformable surface, resultant contact area can become asymmetric. To reproduce such asymmetric contact conditions, a softness display should have more controlled DOFs. This paper reports our trial to realize a multi-DOF controlled softness display. As a first step, this particular paper describes a 2-DOF controlled display. The display has two DC motors which independently control both sides of the contact area. Resultant asymmetric contact area can facilitate, e.g., discrimination of lump location in soft deformable surfaces. The display was integrated into a tactile tele-presentation system together with a contact width sensor, which measures asymmetric contact condition. Using the tele-presentation system, discriminations of lump location are demonstrated.
