We show that a noisy parallel decision tree making O(n) queries needs Î©(log* n) rounds to compute OR of n bits. This answers a question of Newman [21]. We prove more general trade-offs between the number of queries and rounds. We also completely settle a similar question for computing MAX in the noisy comparison tree model; these results bring out interesting differences among the noise models.
