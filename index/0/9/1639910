We introduce a new type of randomized incremental algorithms. Contrary to standard randomized incremental algorithms, theselazy randomized incremental algorithms are suited for computing structures that have a “nonlocal” definition. In order to analyze these algorithms we generalize some results on random sampling to such situations. We apply our techniques to obtain efficient algorithms for the computation of single cells in arrangements of segments in the plane, single cells in arrangements of triangles in space, and zones in arrangements of hyperplanes.
