Recent proposals to apply data mining systems to problems in law enforcement, national security, and fraud detection have attracted both media attention and technical critiques of their expected accuracy and impact on privacy. Unfortunately, the majority of technical critiques have been based on simplistic assumptions about data, classifiers, inference procedures, and the overall architecture of such systems. We consider these critiques in detail, and we construct a simulation model that more closely matches realistic systems. We show how both the accuracy and privacy impact of a hypothetical system could be substantially improved, and we discuss the necessary and sufficient conditions for this improvement to be achieved. This analysis is neither a defense nor a critique of any particular system concept. Rather, our model suggests alternative technical designs that could mitigate some concerns, but also raises more specific conditions that must be met for such systems to be both accurate and socially desirable.
