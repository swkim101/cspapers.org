This paper studies a novel method to deal with the unknown image Jacobian matrix model for the uncalibrated robotic hand-eye coordination. An extended state observer is designed for online estimation of the image Jacobian matrix that is regarded as the system's unmodeled dynamics. A nonlinear feedback control law is then adopted for the coordination controller. With this scheme, a universal calibration-free controller is developed, which is independent from specific tasks and system configuration, for uncalibrated hand-eye coordination. Simulations and experiments of 3-D robotic visual positioning and tracking tasks show the validity and feasibility of the proposed control scheme.
