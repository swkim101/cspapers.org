This paper studies the importance of identifying and categorizing scientific concepts as a way to achieve a deeper understanding of the research literature of a scientific community. To reach this goal, we propose an unsupervised bootstrapping algorithm for identifying and categorizing mentions of concepts. We then propose a new clustering algorithm that uses citations' context as a way to cluster the extracted mentions into coherent concepts. Our evaluation of the algorithms against gold standards shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art results. More importantly, we analyze the computational linguistic literature using the proposed algorithms and show four different ways to summarize and understand the research community which are difficult to obtain using existing techniques.
