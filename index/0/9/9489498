While the format was partly due to our indecisiveness in selecting the “best” papers for presentation, it also reflected the generally good quality of accepted papers and the high standard of background knowledge among the participants. We got several comments to the effect that the lominute slots were “just right,” because nearly all of the attendees had sufficient background that little preparatory explanation was needed-speakers could quickly get to the novel and interesting points of their papers*. Future workshop organizers might want to take the success of this format into account.
