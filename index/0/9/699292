We consider the problem of embedding arbitrary objects (e.g., images, audio, documents) into Euclidean space subject to a partial order over pair-wise distances. Partial order constraints arise naturally when modeling human perception of similarity. Our partial order framework enables the use of graph-theoretic tools to more efficiently produce the embedding, and exploit global structure within the constraint set.
 We present an embedding algorithm based on semidefinite programming, which can be parameterized by multiple kernels to yield a unified space from heterogeneous features.
