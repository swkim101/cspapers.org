This paper proposes an interactive programming approach to the solution of architectural space layout problems. The paper incorporates a brief discussion of some of the problems inherent in existing space layout techniques which may be overcome by the proposed approach. In the suggested computer program, the architectural plan is divided into 3 hierarchical levels of abstract representation; namely, the Graph, The Bubble Diagram, and The Schematic Plan. It is shown how the generation of alternatives at each of these levels is achieved through computer-designer interface. Finally, a representative sample of the questions which may be generated by the interactive system is set forth.
