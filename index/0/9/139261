Users look for information that can suit their level of expertise, but it often takes a mammoth effort to trace such information. One has to sift through multiple pages to look for one that fits the appropriate technical background. In this paper, a query-independent ranking system is proposed for technical web pages. The pages returned by the system are sorted by their relative technical difficulty in either ascending or descending order specified by the user. The technical difficulty of a document i.e. terms in sequence, is first computed by the combination of each individual term's geometry in the low-dimensional latent semantic indexing (LSI) space, which can be visualized as a conceptual terrain. Then the pages are ranked based on the expected cost to get over the terrain. Results indicate that our terrain based method outperforms traditional readability measures.
