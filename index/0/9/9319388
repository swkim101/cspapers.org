VSEM is an open library for visual semantics. Starting from a collection of tagged images, it is possible to automatically construct an image-based representation of concepts by using off-theshelf VSEM functionalities. VSEM is entirely written in MATLAB and its objectoriented design allows a large flexibility and reusability. The software is accompanied by a website with supporting documentation and examples.
