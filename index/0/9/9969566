Synapses are a critical element of biologically-realistic, spike-based neural computation, serving the role of communication, computation, and modification. Many different circuit implementations of synapse function exist with different computational goals in mind. In this paper we describe a new CMOS synapse design that separately controls quiescent leak current, synaptic gain, and time-constant of decay. This circuit implements part of a commonly-used kinetic model of synaptic conductance. We show a theoretical analysis and experimental data for prototypes fabricated in a commercially-available 1.5Âµm CMOS process.
