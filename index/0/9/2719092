We present new algorithms for inferring an unknown finite-state automaton from its input/output behavior <italic>in the absence of a means of resetting the machine to a start state</italic>. A key technique used is inference of a <italic>homing sequence</italic> for the unknown automaton.
Our inference procedures experiment with the unknown machine, and from time to time require a teacher to supply counterexamples to incorrect conjectures about the structure of the unknown automaton. In this setting, we describe a learning algorithm which, with probability 1-δ, outputs a correct description of the unknown machine in time polynomial in the automaton's size, the length of the longest counterexample, and log (1/<italic>δ</italic>). We present an analogous algorithm which makes use of a diversity-based representation of the finite-state system. <italic>Our algorithms are the first which are provably effective for these problems, in the absence of a “reset.”</italic>
We also present probabilistic algorithms for permutation automata which do not require a teacher to supply counterexamples. For inferring a permutation automaton of diversity <italic>D</italic>, we improve the best previous time bound by roughly a factor of <italic>D</italic><supscrpt>3</supscrpt>/log<italic>D</italic>.
