The landscape of computer science education curriculum and tools is rapidly expanding. After President Obama made a call to action for Computer Science For All, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has continued to award curriculum writing projects, and recently non-profits and for-profit offerings have expanded. This poster presents a landscape analysis of a subset of the curriculum available for K-12 computer science (CS). The subset is derived from CSforAll Consortium's (www.csforall.org) 208 current members that are classified as content providers, a resource for stakeholders in CS education who are looking to see the breadth of offerings available, or choose a particular curriculum. The landscape presented in this poster is organized by grade band and concept areas as defined by the K-12 CS Education Framework. In this poster, we will describe a methodology for categorizing the content providers, evaluate whether they have available curriculum for review, and provide summary landscape statistics about the alignment between the content reviewed and the K12 CS Framework.[1] This will enable us to demonstrate both the breadth of CS content areas available in curriculum for stakeholders in CS, as well as the areas in which curriculum is not widely available.
