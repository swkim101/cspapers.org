Response Time Preservation (RTP) is introduced as a general technique for developing approximate analysis procedures for queueing networks. The underlying idea is to replace a subsystem by an equivalent server whose response time in isolation equals that of the entire subsystem in isolation. The RTP based approximations, which belong to the class of decomposition approximations, can be viewed as a dual of the Norton's Theorem approach for solving queueing networks since it matches response times rather than throughputs. The generality of the RTP technique is illustrated by developing solution procedures for several important queueing systems which violate product form assumptions. Examples include FCFS servers with general service times, FCFS servers with different service times for multiple classes, priority scheduling, and distributed systems.
