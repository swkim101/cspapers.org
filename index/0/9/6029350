Let K be a polytope in R<sup>n</sup> defined by m linear inequalities. We give a new Markov Chain algorithm to draw a nearly uniform sample from K. The underlying Markov Chain is the first to have a mixing time that is strongly polynomial when started from a "central" point x<sub>0</sub>. If s is the supremum over all chords pq passing through x<sub>0</sub> of (|p-x<sub>0</sub>|)/(|q-x<sub>0</sub>|) and ε is an upper bound on the desired total variation distance from the uniform, it is sufficient to take O(m n( n log (s m) + log 1/ε)) steps of the random walk. We use this result to design an affine interior point algorithm that does a <i>single</i> random walk to solve linear programs approximately. More precisely, suppose Q = {z | Bz ≤ 1} contains a point z such that c<sup>T</sup> z ≥ d and r := sup<sub>z ∈ Q</sub> |Bz| + 1, where B is an m x n matrix. Then, after τ = O(mn (n ln(mr/ε) + ln 1/δ)) steps, the random walk is at a point x<sub>τ</sub> for which c<sup>T</sup> x<sub>τ</sub> ≥ d(1-ε) with probability greater than 1-δ. The fact that this algorithm has a run-time that is provably polynomial is notable since the analogous deterministic affine algorithm analyzed by Dikin has no known polynomial guarantees.
