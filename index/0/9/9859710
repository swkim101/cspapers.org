The Tate is Britain's premier national art gallery and includes content from internationally-renowned artists such as Constable and Turner. Like most cultural heritage institutions, the Tate provides online access to a large amount of digitized material. Given the international importance of content provided by the Tate Gallery, multilingual access would seem an ideal way in which to increase accessibility to the collections, and thereby increase traffic to the website. In this short paper we propose using the Tate as a case study for cross-language research and evaluation, determining the gallery's requirements and the multilingual needs of their end-users.
