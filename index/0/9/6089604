We present an approach that builds upon previous developments in unmanned air vehicles and climbing robots and seeks to emulate the capabilities of bats, insects and certain birds that combine powered flight with the ability to land and perch on sloped and vertical surfaces. As it approaches a wall, the plane executes an intentional pitch-up maneuver to shed speed and present its feet for landing. On contact, a nonlinear suspension dissipates the remaining kinetic energy and directs interaction forces toward the feet, where microspines can engage small asperities on surfaces such as brick or concrete. The plane can then take off by disengaging the spines and lifting off, pointing its nose up and away from the wall to slowly build forward speed until it can resume normal flight.
