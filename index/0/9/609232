We present a recommender for taxi drivers and people expecting to take a taxi, using the knowledge of 1) passengers' mobility patterns and 2) taxi drivers' pick-up behaviors learned from the GPS trajectories of taxicabs. First, this recommender provides taxi drivers with some locations and the routes to these locations, towards which they are more likely to pick up passengers quickly (during the routes or at these locations) and maximize the profit. Second, it recommends people with some locations (within a walking distance) where they can easily find vacant taxis. In our method, we learn the above knowledge (represented by probabilities) from GPS trajectories of taxis. Then, we feed the knowledge into a probabilistic model which estimates the profit of the candidate locations for a particular driver based on where and when the driver requests for the recommendation. We validate our recommender using historical trajectories generated by over 12,000 taxis during 110 days.
