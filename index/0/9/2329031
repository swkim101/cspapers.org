We study query-efficient Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCPs) and linearity tests. We focus on the number of amortized query bits . A testing algorithm uses q amortized query bits if, for some constant k, it reads qk bits and has error probability at most2 k. The best known PCP construction for NP in this respect uses 3 amortized query bits [13]; at least one amortized query bit is necessary, unless P = NP [5]. This parameter is a fairly natural one and has applications to proving non-approximability results for constr aint satisfaction problems. Furthermore, a PCP characterizatio n of NP with less than 2 amortized query bits implies a separation of the PCP model from the 2-Prover 1-Round model. Our approach is to take an atomic verification procedure and then iterate it several times, saving queries by recycli ng them between different iterations of the atomic test. We first apply this idea in order to develop query-efficient linearity tests. Linearity testing is a problem closely related to testing theLong Codeand making PCP constructions. It is also a significant combinatorial problem still lacking ti ht characterizations, except for the case of three queries [4] . The best known linearity test uses 3 amortized query bits [4] ; a different one achieves 1 amortized free bit (a different pa rameter related to the Max Clique problem) but uses an unbounded number of amortized query bits [5]. We develop a general analysis technique and a linearity test achieving s imultaneously amortized query complexity 1:5 and amortized free bit complexity:5. This test answers an open question raised by Bellare, Goldreich and Sudan. We then show how to adapt a weaker result to the PCP setting, and we obtain a PCP for NP that makes5 queries MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, Room NE43-371, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. luca@theory.lcs.mit.edu. and has error probability1=4, so that its amortized query complexity is2:5.
