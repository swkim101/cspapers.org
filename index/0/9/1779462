We have developed a silicon neuron that is inspired by a mathematical model of the leech heartbeat (HN) interneuron. The temporal and ionic current behaviors of this silicon neuron are close to that of the living cell. Because of this similarity we were able to interface this silicon neuron to a living HN cell using a dynamic clamp technique [8]. We present data showing dynamic behaviors of the hybrid half-center oscillator.
