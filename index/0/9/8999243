The concepts of a user interface management system (UIMS) and user interface designer have become well known in the user interface and graphics community. Most UIMSs developed so far have concentrated on the efficiency of generating the user interface; the user interface designer's interface has received relatively little attention. We identify the important features of the user interface designer's interface. A UIMS incorporating these features in its interface has been developed, and is described in this paper.
