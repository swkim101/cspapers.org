A new pattern operation algorithm effective for VLSI mask data is presented. It conducts intersection-point calculation, slit division, and logical processing simultaneously. A new algorithm for intersection-point calculation is also presented. Using these algorithms, a pattern operation program package (VSOP) has been developed that is applicable to several mask artwork systems in common, and that has 21 functions. The execution time for VSOP varies approximately in proportion to the number of input vectors. CPU time for 1,000,000 vectors is 200 seconds.
