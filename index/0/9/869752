WINACS (Web-based Information Network Analysis for Computer Science) is a project that incorporates many recent, exciting developments in data sciences to construct a Web-based computer science information network and to discover, retrieve, rank, cluster, and analyze such an information network. With the rapid development of the Web, huge amounts of information are available in the form of Web documents, structures, and links. It has been a dream of the database and Web communities to harvest such information and reconcile the unstructured nature of the Web with the neat, semi-structured schemas of the database paradigm. Taking computer science as a dedicated domain, WINACS first discovers related Web entity structures, and then constructs a heterogeneous computer science information network in order to rank, cluster and analyze this network and support intelligent and analytical queries.
