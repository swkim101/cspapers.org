This workshop is an introduction to using Linkbots as a teaching tool to engage students in CS0/CS1 courses, both at the college/university and high school levels. Participants will learn how to program Linkbot robots using RoboBlockly (block-based) and Ch (C/C++ interpreter with ChIDE) in C-STEM Studio through hands-on activities. Additionally, we will present an overview of the curricula developed by the UC Davis Center for Integrated Computing and STEM Education (C-STEM) that integrates robotics into computing and math classes for the elementary school level through the college level. In the second half of the session, participants will gain more hands-on practice and a better understanding of how Linkbots inspire learning in the classroom by forming teams and tackling problems from the annual C-STEM RoboPlay Challenge Competition, which is designed for students to showcase their real-world problem solving skills. Further information about C-STEM is at: http://c-stem.ucdavis.edu/. Laptop with administrative installation privileges is required to install the software used in this workshop.
