This paper proposes a novel approach to generate abstractive summary for multiple documents by extracting semantic information from texts. The concept of Basic Semantic Unit (BSU) is defined to describe the semantics of an event or action. A semantic link network on BSUs is constructed to capture the semantic information of texts. Summary structure is planned with sentences generated based on the semantic link network. Experiments demonstrate that the approach is effective in generating informative, coherent and compact summary.
