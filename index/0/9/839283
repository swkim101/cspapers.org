In modern I O architectures multiple disk drives are at tached to each I O controller A study of the performance of such architectures under I O intensive workloads has re vealed a performance impairment that results from a pre viously unknown form of convoy behavior in disk I O In this paper we describe measurements of the read perfor mance of multiple disks that share a SCSI bus under a heavy workload and develop and validate formulas that accurately characterize the observed performance to within on several platforms for I O sizes in the range KB Two terms in the formula clearly characterize the lost perfor mance seen in our experiments We describe techniques to deal with the performance impairment via user level work arounds that achieve greater overlap of bus transfers with disk seeks and that increase the percentage of transfers that occur at the full bus bandwidth rather than at the lower bandwidth of a disk head Experiments show bandwidth improvements of when using these user level tech niques but only in the case of large I Os
