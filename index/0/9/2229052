This paper presents the architecture of Xmas, an extensible mainmemory storage system for high-performance and real-time database applications. Xmas not only provides the core functionality of a DBMS, such as data persistence, concurrency control, and crash recovery, but aIso has an extensible architecture to deal with requirements from various applications. One crucial aspect of such extensibility is that an application developer can compose applicationspecific, high-level operations with a basic set of operations provided by the system. CalIed composite actions in Xmas, these operations are processed by a customized Xmar server with minimum interaction with application processes, thus increasing the overall performance.
