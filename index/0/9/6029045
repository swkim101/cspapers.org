In this demo we shall present the IBM Patient Empowerment System (PES), and more specifically, its social-medical discovery sub-system. Social and medical data are represented using entities and relationships and are explored using a combination of expressive, yet intuitive, query language, faceted search, and ER graph navigation. While this demonstration focuses on the healthcare domain, the underlining search technology is generic and can be utilized in many other domains. Therefore, this demo has two main contributions. First, we present a novel entity-relationship indexing and retrieval solution, and discuss its implementation challenges. Second, the demonstration depicts a practical entity-relationship discovery technology in a real domain setting within a real IBM system.
