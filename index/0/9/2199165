Due to the recent trend towards building complex real-time cyber-physical systems, system designers need to develop and choose expressive formal models for representing such systems, as the model should be adequately expressive such that it can accurately convey the relevant characteristics of the system being modeled. Compared to the classical sporadic task model, there exist a number of real-time task models that are more expressive. However, such models are often complex and thus are rather difficult to be analyzed efficiently. Due to this reason, prior analysis methods for dealing with such complex task models are pessimistic. In this paper, a novel analysis technique, namely the bur sty-interference analysis, is presented for analyzing two common expressive real-time task models, the general self-suspending task model and the deferrable server task model. This technique is used to derive new uniprocessor utilization-based schedulability tests and rate-monotonic utilization bounds for the two considered task models scheduled under rate-monotonic scheduling. Extensive experiments presented herein show that our proposed tests improve upon prior tests in all scenarios, in many cases by a wide margin. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first techniques that can efficiently analyze the general self-suspending and deferrable server task models on uniprocessors.
