This paper will attempt to consider requirements and problems encountered in the development of digital logic simulation and test generation systems. The procedure for doing this will be to first consider requirements and general considerations for a particular simulation system (TEGAS2<supscrpt>(1,2)</supscrpt><underline>TE</underline>ST <underline>G</underline>ENERATION <underline>A</underline>ND <underline>S</underline>IMULATION) and then to dissect the system into its major constituent parts with a discussion of adopted techniques and experiences. It is obvious that a detailed discussion of this sort would require far more space than permitted in these proceedings. Therefore, an attempt will be made to discuss the most important considerations for system design and development.
