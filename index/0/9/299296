Software support for making effective pen-based applications is currently rudimentary. To facilitate the creation of such applications, we have developed SATIN, a Java-based toolkit designed to support the creation of applications that leverage the informal nature of pens. This support includes a scenegraph for manipulating and rendering objects; support for zooming and rotating objects, switching between multiple views of an object, integration of pen input with interpreters, libraries for manipulating ink strokes, widgets optimized for pens, and compatibility with Javaâ€™s Swing toolkit. SATIN includes a generalized architecture for handling pen input, consisting of recognizers, interpreters, and multi-interpreters. In this paper, we describe the functionality and architecture of SATIN, using two applications built with SATIN as examples.
