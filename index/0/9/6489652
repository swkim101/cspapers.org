Software engineering research and practice provide a wealth of methods that improve the quality of software and lower the costs of producing it. Even though processes mandate their use, methods are not employed consequently. Software developers and development organizations thus cannot fully benefit from these methods. We propose a method that, for a given software engineering method, provides instructions on how to improve its adoption using social software. This employs the intrinsic motivation of software developers rather than prescribing behavior. As a result, we believe that software engineering methods will be applied better and more frequently.
