Online feature selection (OFS) provides an efficient way to sort through a large space of features, particularly in a scenario where the feature space is large and features take a significant amount of memory to store. Image processing operators, and especially combinations of image processing operators, provide a rich space of potential features for use in machine learning for image processing tasks but they are expensive to generate and store. In this paper we apply OFS to the problem of edge detection in grayscale imagery. We use a standard data set and compare our results to those obtained with traditional edge detectors, as well as with results obtained more recently using "statistical edge detection." We compare several different OFS approaches, including hill climbing, best first search, and grafting.
