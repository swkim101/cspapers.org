This invention is directed to a storage container for a magnetic recording tape cartridge comprising a pair of tape hubs each having six hub-toothings located at equal space and projected radially inwardly within a drive shaft inserting hole of the hub. The container comprises an open receptacle container body having a pair of side walls, a bottom wall and an end wall connected with each of the side walls at one end thereof; a lid member connected with the receptacle container body for rotation to close the container; and a pair of hub locking members disposed in either the receptacle container body or the lid member so as to lock the hubs against rotation. Each of the hub locking members comprises a short column like boss engageable within the drive shaft inserting hole of the hub, and having a cone shaped top portion and two engaging keys substantially radially projected from the boss, whereby operation of the lid member for opening and closure can be assured and rotation of the tape hubs can be effectively prevented when the magnetic recording tape cartridge is enclosed in the storage container.
