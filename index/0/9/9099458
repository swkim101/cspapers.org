Based on experiments conducted in a network simulator and over real networks, this paper proposes changes to the congestion control scheme in current TCP implementations to improve its behavior during the start-up period of a TCP connection.The scheme, which includes Slow-start, Fast Retransmit, and Fast Recovery algorithms, uses acknowledgments from a receiver to dynamically calculate reasonable operating values for a sender's TCP parameters governing when and how much a sender can pump into the network. During the start-up period, because a TCP sender starts with default parameters, it often ends up sending too many packets and too fast, leading to multiple losses of packets from the same window. This paper shows that recovery from losses during this start-up period is often unnecessarily time-consuming.In particular, using the current Fast Retransmit algorithm, when multiple packets in the same window are lost, only one of the packet losses may be recovered by each Fast Retransmit; the rest are often recovered by Slow-start after a usually lengthy retransmission timeout. Thus, this paper proposes changes to the Fast Retransmit algorithm so that it can quickly recover from multiple packet losses without waiting unnecessarily for the timeout. These changes, tested in the simulator and on the real networks, show significant performance improvements, especially for short TCP transfers. The paper also proposes other changes to help minimize the number of packets lost during the start-up period.
