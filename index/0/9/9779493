This paper presents a novel robotic hand design that aims at producing a realistic human-robot handshake. A standard characteristic model of the human-palm compliance is developed based on human hand anatomy and an empirical study. Based on this model a realistic palm-compliance rendering is implemented. The backdrivability of the system allows a position-controlled feedback loop which renders human-like agility. An objective and a subjective experimental session, also depicted in the accompanying video, are then presented in order to validate the haptic feedback of the robotic hand in comparison to a real human handshake.
