The extension of human capabilities in procedural tasks by use of computer processing is well established. Significant effort has been expended within the past decade to apply this processing capability to the tasks within engineering design.1 This paper describes the integrated approach adopted by Collins Radio Company in the development and application of computer aids to the design of digital networks.
 The digital networks include those networks, systems, or circuits which exhibit discrete logic states and have waveforms that may be assumed idealized with zero rise and fall times. The design aids include simulation, production test generation, and layout.
 The simulation algorithms provide design verification, computation of production test input/output data, trade-off analysis and timing and loading analysis. The test generation algorithms determine a set of inputs to a unit and the associated outputs for these inputs which can be used for production test of the unit. The layout algorithms provide parts placement, partitioning, pin assignment and interconnect solutions for physical implementation of the circuitry.
 The simulation, test generation and layout algorithms operate on a common set of data which is inputted to the processor system by the designer. This set of data is added to as simulation, test generation and layout are completed. The resultant evolved set can then comprise a functional specification of the unit.
