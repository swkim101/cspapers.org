Secondary memory storage plays a major role in making large knowledge bases usable. This paper presents such a storage architecture for knowledge bases. In particular, the Controlled Decomposition Model, a flexible storage model which takes into account the numerous and expressive features of the knowledge representation model is defined. Second, the indexing problem for the knowledge base context 1s examined and the Temporal Join Index is proposed. An implementation technique for temporal indices, based on a spatial access method, is presented. Finally, an analytical and experimental performance study is conducted to account the performance limits of the proposed methods.
