Online reviews are often accompanied with numerical ratings provided by users for a set of service or product aspects. We propose a statistical model which is able to discover corresponding topics in text and extract textual evidence from reviews supporting each of these aspect ratings ‚Äê a fundamental problem in aspect-based sentiment summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004a). Our model achieves high accuracy, without any explicitly labeled data except the user provided opinion ratings. The proposed approach is general and can be used for segmentation in other applications where sequential data is accompanied with correlated signals.
