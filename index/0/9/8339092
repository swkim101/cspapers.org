We consider the problem of mapping natural language written utterances expressing operational instructions 1 to formal language expressions, applied to French and the R programming language. Developing a learning operational assistant requires the means to train and evaluate it, that is, a baseline system able to interact with the user. After presenting the guidelines of our work, we propose a model to represent the problem and discuss the fit of direct mapping methods to our task. Finally, we show that, while not resulting in excellent scores, a simple approach seems to be sufficient to provide a baseline for an interactive learning system.
