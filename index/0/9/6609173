Wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical communication offers the advantages of increased capacity and decreased latency for signals (traffic) carried across such networks. The devices used for "switching", however, force additional constraints on the mathematical design of such networks. In this paper we explore two such constaints: (i) optical lightpaths must be assigned individual wavelengths and (ii) sometimes lightpaths must unavoidably go through an optical-electronic-optical (OEO) conversion by means of an expensive piece of equipment called an optical transponder. We term the graph theoretical problems related to these constraints path colouring and island hopping. We present a range of upper and lower bounds for these problems. In particular, we extend the work of Winkler and Zhang (2003) and Anshelevich and Zhang (2004).
