This paper describes a new tool for introducing computer graphics and multimedia applications into first year, called QuickDraw, and our experience using it. QuickDraw provides an easy to use language and platform independent interface which permits students to create multimedia applications beginning with their first assignment in an introductory computer science course. QuickDraw has been carefully designed to avoid complex "magical" statements in order to setup, use, or tear down the multimedia environment, making it an appropriate tool for use with students with no prior programming experience. As instructors, we have found that QuickDraw effectively engages students by allowing them to create visually impressive programs with minimal complexity, while continuing to allow us to effectively teach fundamental computer science concepts.
