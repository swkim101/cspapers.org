Advertising on mobile devices has large potential due to the very personal and intimate nature of the devices and high targeting possibilities. We introduce a novel B-MAD system for delivering permission-based location-aware mobile advertisements to mobile phones using Bluetooth positioning and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Push. We present a thorough quantitative evaluation of the system in a laboratory environment and qualitative user evaluation in form of a field trial in the real environment of use. Experimental results show that the system provides a viable solution for realizing permission-based mobile advertising.
