A sophisticated natural language system requires a large knowledge base. A methodology is described for constructing one in a principled way. Facts are selected for the knowledge base by determining what facts are linguistically presupposed by a text in the domain of interest. The facts are sorted into clusters, and within each cluster they are organized according to their logical dependencies. Finally, the facts are encoded as predicate calculus axioms.
