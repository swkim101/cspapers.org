This paper describes new tracing and debugging facilities for logic prograramming (Prolog in particular), based on a selective retrospective analysis of an exhaustive run-time trace. The tracer uses an enriched repertoire of program success/failure 'symptoms' to improve the clarity of the trace, and identifies characteristic 'symptom clusters' in order to work out the true cause of a bug.
