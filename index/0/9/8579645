This paper presents a novel structure gradient and texture decor relating regularization (SGTD) for image decomposition. The motivation of the idea is under the assumption that the structure gradient and texture components should be properly decor related for a successful decomposition. The proposed model consists of the data fidelity term, total variation regularization and the SGTD regularization. An augmented Lagrangian method is proposed to address this optimization issue, by first transforming the unconstrained problem to an equivalent constrained problem and then applying an alternating direction method to iteratively solve the sub problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method presents better or comparable performance as state-of-the-art methods do.
