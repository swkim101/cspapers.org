We describe a theoretical model and an on-going series of experiments aimed at a priori query enhancement. The model presents a synthesis of concepts from retrospective and current awareness retrieval systems, employing the user profile as a factor in interpreting a query. It is expected that this will provide a more personalized response to queries.
