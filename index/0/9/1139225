The relationship between context incongruity and sarcasm has been studied in linguistics. We present a computational system that harnesses context incongruity as a basis for sarcasm detection. Our statistical sarcasm classifiers incorporate two kinds of incongruity features: explicit and implicit. We show the benefit of our incongruity features for two text forms tweets and discussion forum posts. Our system also outperforms two past works (with Fscore improvement of 10-20%). We also show how our features can capture intersentential incongruity.
