This paper presents an analysis of the channel assignment problem in wireless telephone networks with both fixed and dynamic transmitters. It is shown how an assignment plan can be computed for the fixed part of the network so that enough room is left for flexible channel selections by the dynamic transmitters. Optimization criteria are defined for the choice of the best fixed channel allocation plan and fast methods of their evaluation for special graph structures are described.
