HomeSys 2013 will be an inspiring, interactive, cross-disciplinary workshop for anyone conducting research into technology in homes. This includes anyone building novel systems, applications, or devices for the home, or studying existing or novel technology use in domestic settings, or anyone else with an interest in the intersection between technology and the home. Attendance at the workshop will not be limited, anyone may register and attend. To ensure any interactive and enjoyable exchange of ideas during the workshop, we have 4 contribution types: Visionary Presentations, Reflective Presentations, Videos and Posters. To encourage interactivity and discussion, the workshop will have plenary sessions for visionary and reflective presentations, in addition to posters and videos, a keynote, discussant-led panels and a breakout session.
