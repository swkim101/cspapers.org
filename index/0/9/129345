This poster presents a useful tool to capture the content of browsing sessions. Web-R saves systematically all the components sufficient and necessary to visualize offline the page, the same way it was displayed online. In order to avoid the saturation of local disk, Web-R integrates a page comparison mechanism to avoid unnecessary redundancy and, in addition, provides a way to manage the maximum storage space. We give some insights than, in typical cases, this storage is compatible with today's casual hard disk capacities and costs, along years. Moreover, since the full content of visited pages is stored, the Web-R user can access and process (e.g. sort, extract) several information including path and visit statistics, therefore giving him/her a global view on his/her personal navigation.
