We study uncertainty in graphical-based interaction (with special attention to sketches). We argue that a comprehensive model for the problem must include the interaction participants (and their current beliefs), their possible actions and their past sketches. It's yet unclear how to frame and solve the former problem, considering all the latter elements. We suggest framing the problem as a game and solving it with a game-theoretical solution, which leads to a framework for the design of new two-way, sketch-based user interfaces. In special, we use the framework to design a game that can progressively learn visual models of objects from user sketches, and use the models in real-world interactions. Instead of an abstract visual criterion, players in this game learn models to optimize interaction (the game's duration). This two-way sketching game addresses problems essential in emerging interfaces (such as learning and how to deal with interpretation errors). We review possible applications in robotic sketch-to-command, hand gesture recognition, media authoring and visual search, and evaluate two. Evaluations demonstrate how players improve performance with repeated play, and the influence of interaction aspects on learning.
