In this paper, the characterization of the force distribution along a tendon sliding on a curved pathway, subject to friction and visco-elastic effects, is investigated. In order to have a better understanding of the system behavior, a specific setup able to measure tension forces in different points along the tendon's path has been built. Experimental data collected by measuring the tendon tension forces during both the pulling and the release phase are presented, and theoretical models reproducing the tendon behavior with increasing fidelity are proposed. In particular, the friction arising from the interaction between the tendon pathway and the tendon itself is characterized by means of a LuGre-like dynamic friction model. The introduction of a dynamic friction model allows to reproduce in simulation some effects arising during experimental activities that cannot be reproduced employing an equivalent static friction model. Moreover, the adoption of tendons made by polymeric fibers introduces hysteresis in the tendon transmission characteristic due to the plasticity and creep phenomena typical of these materials. With the aim of reproducing this behavior, a visco-elastic model is used for modeling the tendon compliance.
