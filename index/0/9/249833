We present a new algorithm, SIE, for designing lumped parameter models from first principles. Like the IBIS system of Williams [1989, 1990], SIE uses a qualitative representation of parameter interactions to guide its search and speed the test for working designs. But SIE's interaction set representation is considerably simpler than IBIS's space of potential and existing interactions. Furthermore, SIE is both complete and systematic - it explores the space of possible designs in an nonredundant manner.
