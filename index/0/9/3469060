This lightning talk will discuss our experience of developing and managing a new Computer Forensics Minor. The Computer Forensics minor is an interdisciplinary program that integrates criminal justice and computer science and combines both theoretical concepts and practical skills to prepare students for a career in computer forensics-related fields. Students will be prepared for a career in law enforcement or corporate security as a digital investigator and evidence examiner as well as pursue graduate education in the area of information security, digital forensics, or law. The lighting talk will describe the various stages in developing the minor including an analysis of competitive academic programs, evaluation of the current resources, qualifications and faculty considerations, the process of developing the program objectives and learning outcomes, and assessment strategies. The program will be run jointly by Criminal Justice and Computer Science departments, and faculty will communicate regularly to track the number of students in the minor and their progress through the curriculum. Both departments will ensure that the minor provides appropriate course content and learning experiences for graduates seeking employment. In our discussion, we will focus on challenges of designing the balanced curriculum to make it accessible for criminal justice and other non-computer science/computer information systems majors, the need of designing new courses and renovating existing courses to answer growing need to address this new emerging field. Lightning talk will also discuss the anticipated cost of the program, required resources, recruitment strategies, and the administrative approval mechanism.
