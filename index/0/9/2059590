This paper describes a new annotation GUI, called IORelator, which is designed to facilitate rapid semantic annotation in support of high-performance data-driven NLU for spoken dialogue systems. We summarize our requirements for rapid NLU annotation, and discuss how the GUI views and operations that IORelator provides meet these needs by enabling thousands of natural utterances to be quickly annotated with their correct semantics.
