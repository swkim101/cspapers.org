Spontaneously produced speech text often includes disfluencies which make it difficult to analyze underlying structure. Successful reconstruction of this text would transform these errorful utterances into fluent strings and offer an alternate mechanism for analysis. 
 
Our investigation of naturally-occurring spontaneous speaker errors aligned to corrected text with manual semantico-syntactic analysis yields new insight into the syntactic and structural semantic differences between spoken and reconstructed language.
