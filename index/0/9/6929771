An algorithm Is constructed for computing the local dimension of a ocmialgcbmlc set V at a given point z E V. Let V be deflned by a t;ystcm of h inequalities of the form f 2 0 with f E R[Xl,,,., X,], de&) < d, and x E V belong to a stratum of codimcnoion Is in V of a Whitney stratification of V. The algorhhm computes the local dimension dim,(V) with the complexity (Cld) ‘(@), If 1 = rnax=Bv I,, and for every connectedcomponent the local dimension is the same at each point, then the algorhhm computes the dimension of every connected component with complexity (t13) o(Bn), In the case of a real algebraic variety defined by a system of equations the complexity of the algorithm is leas Lhnn d’(““). When 1 is fixed, like in the case of a smooth V, lhc complcxily bounds are (kd)‘(“) and do(“) respectively.
