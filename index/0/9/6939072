This paper presents and discusses the trajectory tracking control design with friction compensation for a three wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot. Firstly, a dynamic model without considering the friction forces is derived. Part of the control effort is used to compensate the friction effects, which is estimated by an extended state observer without using a friction model. Then traditional resolved acceleration control is applied to the robot, based on the derived dynamic model. In addition, stability analysis of the controller and observer is presented. Experimental results show that the proposed control design is efficient in compensating the friction effects and in improving the tracking control performances.
