Although number entry appears to be a trivial task, user errors are still common and could be a result of poorly engineered interaction with the devices. We are challenging the design of universal number entry systems by looking at cases where user errors are frequently made. The telephone is used as a platform to compare input devices for number entry where we can look for speed and accuracy trade-offs between direct and indirect inputs. We will focus on the knob, button, and touchscreen and hope to find guidelines for when each is appropriate to use in a number entry system.
