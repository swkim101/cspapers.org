The recipe might not sound particularly exciting: take a microcontroller, garnish with sensors and various output devices, season with a bit of code, and then network until done: but the result -- the Internet of Things (IoT) -- is a rapidly burgeoning field that provides a novel and enticing context for sophomore to senior level students to hone their networking, coding, problem solving and presentation skills, exercise their creativity, and unleash their entrepreneurial spirit. In short, it is a perfect mid-to-upper division elective course. Faculty considering such a course are faced with a myriad of difficult decisions, however, including the appropriate class level, course structure, prerequisites, and platform choice. The purpose of this session is to bring together people who have taught, or are considering teaching, IoT, to discuss these issues. Topics may include: a) an overview of platforms and tools, b) appropriate course topics, c) platform acquisition, deployment, and costs, d) identification of support materials (e.g., classroom friendly materials/guides/documentation), e) appropriate prerequisites, f) IoT platform fidelity (i.e. will the experience translate to real-world IoT skills), and g) discussion of potential broader curricular advantages that come from including IoT topics..
