Opinion holder extraction research is important for discriminating between opinions that are viewed from different perspectives. In this paper, we describe our experience of participation in the NTCIR-6 Opinion Analysis Pilot Task by focusing on opinion holder extraction results in Japanese and English. Our approach to opinion holder extraction was based on the discrimination between author and authority viewpoints in opinionated sentences, and the evaluation results were fair with respect to the Japanese documents.
