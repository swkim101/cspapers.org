Under the activities of its Education Board, ACM has sponsored the Two-Year College Computer Curriculum Task Force for the past two years. Its work includes the publication of a newsletter, the sponsorship of workshops for curriculum discussions, the development of greater visibility of two-year college faculty at ACM functions, and the future publication of a monograph on computer related issues at two-year colleges.
