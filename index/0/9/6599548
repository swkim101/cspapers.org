We introduce a new approach to GA (Genetic Algorithms) based problem solving. Earlier GAs did not contain local search (i.e. hill climbing) mechanisms, which led to optimization difficulties, especially in higher dimensions. To overcome such difficulties, we introduce a "bug-based" search strategy, and implement a system called BUGS2. The ideas behind this new approach are derived from biologically realistic bug behaviors. These ideas were confirmed empirically by applying them to some optimization and computer vision problems.
