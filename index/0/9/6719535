We present a mesh network for mobile (non static) devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We propose a weight balancing technique to optimize the communication to the entire mesh network. The proposed mesh network has been evaluated by well-designed practical experiments to transmit the data. The preliminary results show that the BLE mesh network consumes less power and can transfer data with low latency.
