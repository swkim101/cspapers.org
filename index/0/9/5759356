Despite of the success of previous plan recognition approaches, they all neglect the impact of human preferences on plans. For example, a kid in a shopping mall might prefer to "executing'' a plan of playing in water park, while an adult might prefer to "executing'' a plan of having a cup of coffee. It could be helpful for improving the plan recognition accuracy to consider human preferences on plans. We assume there are historical rating scores on a subset of plans given by humans, and action sequences observed on humans. We estimate unknown rating scores based on rating scores in hand using an off-the-shelf collaborative filtering approach. We then discover plans to best explain the estimated rating scores and observed actions using a skip-gram based approach. In the experiment, we evaluate our approach in three planning domains to demonstrate its effectiveness.
