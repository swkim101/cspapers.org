We consider the problem of computing bounds on the variance and expectation of the longest path length in a DAG from knowledge of variance and expectation of edge lengths. We focus primarily on the case where all edge lengths are non-negative and the DAG has a single source and sink node. We present analytic bounds for various simple DAG structures, and present a new algorithm to compute bounds for more general DAG structures. Our algorithm is motivated by an analogy with balance of forces in a network of "strange" springs.
