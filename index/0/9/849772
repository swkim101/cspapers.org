This paper describes an interdisciplinary experiment in controlling semi-autonomous animated human forms with natural language input. These computer-generated characters resemble traditional stage actors, in that they are more autonomous than traditional hand-guided animated characters, and less autonomous than fully improvisational agents. We introduce the desktop theater metaphor, reserving for users the creative role of a theatrical writer or director.
