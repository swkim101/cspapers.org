Inspired by recent techniques for reliable bulk data distribution, this paper develops scalable protocols for reliable on-demand delivery of streaming media. Models are developed that quantify the best possible scalability for given client characteristics. The results of the models are used to guide the design and assess the performance of the proposed streaming techniques. The new protocols, RPB and RBS, are relatively simple to implement and achieve nearly the best possible scalability and efficiency for a given set of client characteristics and desirable/feasible media quality.
