In this paper, instead of designing new features based on intuition, linguistic knowledge and domain, we learn some new and effective features using the deep autoencoder (DAE) paradigm for phrase-based translation model. Using the unsupervised pre-trained deep belief net (DBN) to initialize DAEâ€™s parameters and using the input original phrase features as a teacher for semi-supervised fine-tuning, we learn new semi-supervised DAE features, which are more effective and stable than the unsupervised DBN features. Moreover, to learn high dimensional feature representation, we introduce a natural horizontal composition of more DAEs for large hidden layers feature learning. On two ChineseEnglish tasks, our semi-supervised DAE features obtain statistically significant improvements of 1.34/2.45 (IWSLT) and 0.82/1.52 (NIST) BLEU points over the unsupervised DBN features and the baseline features, respectively.
