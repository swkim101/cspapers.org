Concurrent Common LISPT™ (CCLISP) is the LISP environment for the iPSC™ system, the Intel Personal SuperComputer. CCLISP adds message-passing communication and other constructs to the Common LISP environment on each processor node. The iPSC system is configured with Intel 80286 processor nodes. in systems ranging from 8 to 128 nodes. Performance on a per node basis roughly equivalent to AI workstation LISP performance is discussed, as are the implementation details of the CCLISP language constructs.
