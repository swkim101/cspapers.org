Abstrac! This paper discusses simulator and its use in the new simulator is presented a multilevel classroom. A that allows the user to dynamically change the simulated hardware at run time. We also discuss an incremental series of projects that we have successfully used with the simulator. These projects give the student hands-on experience with the advantages and disadvantages of several architectures.
