This paper presents a program transformation that allows languages with polymorphic typing (e.g. ML) to be implemented with unboxed, multi-word data representations. The transformation introduces coercions between various representations, based on a typing derivation. A prototype ML compiler utilizing this transformation demonstrates important speedups.
