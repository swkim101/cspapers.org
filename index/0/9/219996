The recently introduced notion of order dependency in the relational model is generalized to include situations where order dependency is satisfied in an approximate way. Two fundamental types of approximate satisfaction are distinguished and analyzed. It is shown for both types that such approximate satisfaction of order dependencies can be applied to substantially reduce indexing space without significantly increasing access time.
