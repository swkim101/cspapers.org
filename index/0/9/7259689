Over the years, medical informatics researchers have studied how to use software technologies to provide decision support for using evidence-based medical procedures. Software professionals have investigated how to support hospital administration, therapy and laboratory workflows. For many of these efforts, managing the exceptions in the workflows is a key issue since the medical workflows must cope with a wide variety of patient medical situations as well as those of the healthcare environments. This paper presents an analysis of past research in managing medical workflow exceptions, and proposes future research that would benefit the medical applications. The paper is focused on three topics: representing, handling and analyzing exceptions. Based upon our analysis, we believe that techniques for verifying exception management models and for handling dynamic exceptions should be useful and possibly essential for developing large scale, practical medical workflow systems.
