We consider the problem of maintaining the 2-edgeconnected and the 3-edge-connected compoueutti of a graph undergoing repeated dynamic modifications, such as edgeinsertions and edgedeletions. We show how to test at any time whether two vertices belong to the same 2-edge-connected component, and how to insert and delete an edge in 0(m213) time in the worst case, where m is the current number of edges in the graph. This answers a question posed by Westbrook and Tarjan [18]. For planar graphs, we present algorithms that support all these operations in O(~n) worst-case time each, where n is the total number of vertices in the graph. Finally, we show how to answer whether two vertices belong to the same 3-edge-connected component of a connected graph that is undergoing only edge insertions, Any sequence of q query and updates on an n-vertex graph can be performed in O((n + q)a(q, n)) time.
