Folksonomies provide a comfortable way to search and browse the blogosphere. As the tags in the blogosphere are sparse, ambiguous and too general, this paper proposes both a supervised and an unsupervised approach that extract tags from posts using a tag semantic network. We evaluate the two methods on a blog dataset and observe an improvement in F1-measure from 0.23 to 0.50 when compared to the baseline system.
