Recently there has been a lot of interest in graph-based analysis. One of the most important aspects of graph-based analysis is to measure similarity between nodes and to do similarity search in a graph. For example, in social networks such as Facebook, system may want to recommend potential friends to a particular user based on connections between users. In custom-product networks such as eBay, one may wish to recommend products to others based on purchases history. In this talk, I will introduce some methods on vertex similarities computations and their applications on similarity search in real world networks.
