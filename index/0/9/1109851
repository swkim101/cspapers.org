Automatically-tested online programming exercises can be useful in introductory programming courses as self-tests to accompany readings, for in-class assessment, for skills development, and to provide additional practice for students who need it. CloudCoder (http://cloudcoder.org) is an effort to build a community based on an open-source programming exercise system (currently supporting C, Java, and Python) tightly integrated with a repository of freely-redistributable programming exercises written and used by members of the community. The goal of the project is to make programming exercises easy and free to incorporate into any programming course.
