Space-efficient algorithms are presented for a number of intersection searching problems in the plane, including, ray-shooting, segment intersection searching, triangle stabbing, and triangle range searching. The algorithms for ray-shooting and segment intersection searching are improvements upon the results given previously in [Aga89]. All the algorithms can be dynamized efficiently by taking advantage of their decomposability. Several applications of the above results are presented.
