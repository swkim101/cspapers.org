Real-world applications of text categorization often require a system to deal with tens of thousands of categories defined over a large taxonomy. This paper addresses the problem with respect to a set of popular algorithms in text categorization, including Support Vector Machines, k-nearest neighbor, ridge regression, linear least square fit and logistic regression. By providing a formal analysis of the computational complexity of each classification method, followed by an investigation on the usage of different classifiers in a hierarchical setting of categorization, we show how the scalability of a method depends on the topology of the hierarchy and the category distributions. In addition, we are able to obtain tight bounds for the complexities by using the power law to approximate category distributions over a hierarchy. Experiments with kNN and SVM classifiers on the OHSUMED corpus are reported on, as concrete examples.
