We experiment with several chunking models. Deeper architectures achieve better generalization. Quadratic filters, a simplification of a theoretical model of V1 complex cells, reliably increase accuracy. In fact, logistic regression with quadratic filters outperforms a standard single hidden layer neural network. Adding quadratic filters to logistic regression is almost as effective as feature engineering. Despite predicting each output label independently, our model is competitive with ones that use previous decisions.
