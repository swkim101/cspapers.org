We propose a novel algorithm for sentiment summarization that takes account of informativeness and readability, simultaneously. Our algorithm generates a summary by selecting and ordering sentences taken from multiple review texts according to two scores that represent the informativeness and readability of the sentence order. The informativeness score is defined by the number of sentiment expressions and the readability score is learned from the target corpus. We evaluate our method by summarizing reviews on restaurants. Our method outperforms an existing algorithm as indicated by its ROUGE score and human readability experiments.
