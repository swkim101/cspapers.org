To date, work on Non-Local Dependencies (NLDs) has focused almost exclusively on English and it is an open research question how well these approaches migrate to other languages. This paper surveys non-local dependency constructions in Chinese as represented in the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) and provides an approach for generating proper predicate-argument-modifier structures including NLDs from surface contextfree phrase structure trees. Our approach recovers non-local dependencies at the level of Lexical-Functional Grammar f-structures, using automatically acquired subcategorisation frames and f-structure paths linking antecedents and traces in NLDs. Currently our algorithm achieves 92.2% f-score for trace insertion and 84.3% for antecedent recovery evaluating on gold-standard CTB trees, and 64.7% and 54.7%, respectively, on CTBtrained state-of-the-art parser output trees.
