Recursion and iteration are two key topics taught in introductory Computer Science. This is especially so for CS2 students, as CS2 is the course where recursion is typically taught and where control-flow concepts are solidified. When asked to solve a problem that could feasibly be solved with recursion or iteration, what do CS2 students choose to do? And how does this choice relate to the correctness of their code? This paper provides one answer to these questions through an analysis of student exam responses to a problem on finding deepest common ancestors in trees. We find that 19% of students choose to use iteration, 51% choose recursion, and 16% choose to combine both iteration and recursion. In terms of correctness, we find that students who choose iteration perform better than those who choose recursion and the combination of both. Additionally, we find concern in the number of students who seemingly do not understand what the question is asking. We end the paper with some comments on helping students choose an appropriate control-flow strategy and a discussion of this type of question on a final exam.
