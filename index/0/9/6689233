Recently, block copolymer directed self-assembly (DSA) has demonstrated great advantages in patterning contacts/vias for the 7 nm technology node and beyond. The high throughput and low process cost of DSA makes it the most promising candidate in patterning tight pitched dense patterns for the next generation lithography. Since DSA is very sensitive to the shapes and distributions of the guiding templates, it is necessary to develop new EDA algorithms and tools to address the patterning rules and constraints of the process. This paper presents a set of DSA-aware optimization techniques targeting the most urgent problems for DSA technology, including layout optimization and template pattern verification.
