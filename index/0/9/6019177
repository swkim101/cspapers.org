Interaction with unstructured groups of objects allows a robot to discover and manipulate novel items in cluttered environments. We present a framework for interactive singulation of individual items from a pile. The proposed framework provides an overall approach for tasks involving operation on multiple objects, such as counting, arranging, or sorting items in a pile. A perception module combined with pushing actions accumulates evidence of singulated items over multiple pile interactions. A decision module scores the likelihood of a single-item pile to a multiple-item pile based on the magnitude of motion and matching determined from the perception module. Three variations of the singulation framework were evaluated on a physical robot for an arrangement task. The proposed interactive singulation method with adaptive pushing reduces the grasp errors on non-singulated piles compared to alternative methods without the perception and decision modules. This work contributes the general pile interaction framework, a specific method for integrating perception and action plans with grasp decisions, and an experimental evaluation of the cost trade-offs for different singulation methods.
