In this position paper, we propose an approach for Web Observatories that builds on using social media, personal data, and sensors to build Persona for an individual, but also use this data and the concept of Focused Micro Blogs (FMB) for situation detection, helping individual using situation action rules, and finally gaining insights for obtaining insights about society. We demonstrate this in a concrete use case of fitness and health care related sensors for building health persona and using this for understanding societal health issues.
