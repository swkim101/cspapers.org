In this paper we explore the idea of using high-level semantic concepts, also called attributes, to represent human actions from videos and argue that attributes enable the construction of more descriptive models for human action recognition. We propose a unified framework wherein manually specified attributes are: i) selected in a discriminative fashion so as to account for intra-class variability; ii) coherently integrated with data-driven attributes to make the attribute set more descriptive. Data-driven attributes are automatically inferred from the training data using an information theoretic approach. Our framework is built upon a latent SVM formulation where latent variables capture the degree of importance of each attribute for each action class. We also demonstrate that our attribute-based action representation can be effectively used to design a recognition procedure for classifying novel action classes for which no training samples are available. We test our approach on several publicly available datasets and obtain promising results that quantitatively demonstrate our theoretical claims.
