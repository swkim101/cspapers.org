We compare three tools for creating GOMS models, QGOMS [2), CATHCI (17) and GLEAN3 [12], along several dimensions. We examine the representation and available constructs in each tool, the qualitative and quantitative design information provided, the support for building cognitively plausible models, and pragmatics about using each tool (e.g., how easy it is to modify a model). While each tool has its strengths, they all leave something to be desired as a practical UI design tool.
