. Suppose n boys and n girls rank each other at random. We show that any particular girl has at least ( 12 − ǫ ) ln n and at most (1 + ǫ ) ln n diﬀerent husbands in the set of all Gale/Shapley stable matchings deﬁned by these rankings, with probability approaching 1 as n → ∞ , if ǫ is any positive constant. The proof emphasizes general methods that appear to be useful for the analysis of many other combinatorial algorithms.
