Building compilers that generate correct code is difficult. In this paper we present a compiler testing technique that closes the gap between actual compiler implementations and correct compilers. Using formal specifications of procedure calling conventions, we have built a target-sensitive test suite generator that builds test cases for a specific aspect of compiler code generators the procedure calling sequence generator. By exercising compilers with these target-specific test suites, our automated testing tool has exposed bugs in every compiler tested. These compilers include ones that have been in heavy use for many years. The detected bugs cause more than 14,000 test cases to fail.
