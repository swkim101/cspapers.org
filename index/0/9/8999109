Education research has long borne that students who are the most successful are those that are intrinsically motivated. In the computer science education community there have been attempts to create intrinsic motivation in our students through the use of puzzles and games. At the same time, members of the community have advocated the use of storytelling to increase intrinsic motivation and student learning.
 In an undergraduate computer science curriculum, large software projects and challenging lab assignments are necessary elements. While successful students thirst for these experiences, many students dread courses driven by large and challenging assignments.
 In order to increase the intrinsic motivation of students in such a course, the assignments can be structured as elements of an alternate reality game (ARG) where successful participation in and completion of assignments advances a narrative set in the real world.
 The advantage of using a ARG in an educational context is many-fold: its storytelling and puzzle elements increase student engagement, it generates a sense of excitement in the class, and it increase student motivation to complete assignments.
 In an implementation of this course backdrop, student surveys indicate that students find the narrative element of the course fun, that they are more excited to do the lab assignments because of it, and that it makes them more excited about studying computer science. Furthermore, the excitement around the game helped to build community: interested students who completed the course helped in the preparation of the ARG for the next offering of the course.
