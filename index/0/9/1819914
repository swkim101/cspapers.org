We examine the marriage of recent probabilistic generative models for social networks with classical frameworks from mathematical economics. We are particularly interested in how the statistical structure of such networks influences global economic quantities such as price variation. Our findings are a mixture of formal analysis, simulation, and experiments on an international trade data set from the United Nations.
