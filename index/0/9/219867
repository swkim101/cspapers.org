When processing vectors on SIMD computers, the interconnection network may become the bottleneck for performances if it lacks an efficient routing control unit. In the pass, many multistage networks have been designed, but general algorithms to control them cannot be used at execution time : they are too time consuming. This has led many manufacturers to use crossbar networks in the design of SIMD computers. In [Se84a],[Se84b], we defined the Sigma network &Sgr;(n) and we gave realistic algorithms to control it for performing families of permutations covering standard needs in vector processing. Here, we expose the design of a very efficient control unit for the Sigma network &Sgr;(4) (16 entries, 16 exits).
