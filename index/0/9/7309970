This poster presents a tool for the analysis of Java heap snapshots. The tool supports a flexible query language to measure various aspects of the object graph related to the studies of uniqueness, ownership, encapsulation and confinement. One of the applications of our tool was the verification of the power law dependency in the distribution of incoming and outgoing references to objects.
