Online search has become a daily activity and a source of a variety of valuable information, from the finest granularity such as finding the address of a specific restaurant, to more complex tasks like looking for accessories compatible with an iPhone or planning a trip. The latter typically involves running multiple search queries to gather information about different places, reading online reviews to find out about hotels, and checking geographic proximity of places to visit. We refer to this information seeking activity as composite retrieval and propose to organize results into item bundles that together constitute an improved exploratory experience over ranked lists. As a first step towards composite retrieval definition, we need to formalize intuitive desirable properties of item bundles. We distinguish between properties of each bundle in the answer and properties of the answer as a whole. Consider the case of a user selecting the restaurants to try during a visit to a new city. The user has a limited budget which might be either financial, or simply the number of nights spent in the city. The user prefers suggested restaurants to serve different cuisines. The validity of a bundle of restaurants is given by the budget constraint and the complementarity of the restaurants in the bundle w.r.t. the cuisine they serve. Other restaurant attributes could be used for defining valid bundles. For example, instead of cuisines, different dress codes could be required to every restaurant in a single bundle. Moreover, in order to provide meaningful bundles, restaurants forming each bundle must be compatible, e.g., close geographically, or liked by similar reviewers. The degree of compatibility of the items forming a bundle defines the quality of the bundle. Intuitively, in the case geographic distance is used, the closer restaurants are from each other, the higher the quality of the bundle they belong to. Similarly, when common reviewers are used as the
