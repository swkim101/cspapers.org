A general model for "learning by doing" is presented which accounts for a number of phenomena observed in protocols of human subjects solving a series of similar problems. The model is based on the conjecture that skill acquisition is a process of progressive development of problem directed knowledge structures which are to a large extent domain specific. A program is described for encoding protocols of human subjects in terms of the model.
