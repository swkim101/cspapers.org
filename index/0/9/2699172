Improved energy-efficiency and storage capacity of new-generation NAND flash memory makes a compelling case for storage-centric sensor networks. Such a storage-centric sensor network emphasizes the use of platforms with larger storage and more extensive use of the storage capacities on sensors. We demonstrate the feasibility of storage-centric sensor networks using an instance of a storage-centric camera sensor network that is more energy-efficient in comparison to a traditional camera sensor network. We demonstrate multiple camera sensors, each consisting of a Cyclops camera attached to a MicaZ mote, using motion-triggered image capturing. The captured images are archived locally on flash storage and summaries of detected events are transmitted to the base-station. The base-station picks the events of interest from the summaries and requests the original captured image from the sensor as required. The use of high-capacity energy-efficient flash storage at the sensor allows us to trade-off expensive radio communication for cheaper local storage, improving the life-time of the battery and consequently, the life of the storage-centric camera sensor network.
