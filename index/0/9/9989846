Decision augmentation systems differ qualitatively from current man-computer interactive systems because they involve intelligent, complex, and largely symbiotic man-machine relationships. They thus provide the stimulus for the development of a new branch of human factors, one concerned with the human engineering of relationships between humans and intelligent, quasi-autonomous, computer-based systems. The threefold objective of the research described in this paper has therefore been to identify the human factors problems which such a framework should address, to generate the basic information around which it should be built, and to determine the general structure which it should take.
