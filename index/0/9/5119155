Many Internet information resources present relational data|telephone directories, product catalogs, etc. Because these sites are formatted for people, mechanically extracting their content is di(cid:14)cult. Systems using such resources typically use hand-coded wrappers, procedures to extract data from information resources. We introduce wrapper induction, a method for automatically constructing wrappers, and identify hlrt , a wrapper class that is e(cid:14)ciently learnable, yet expressive enough to handle 48% of a recently surveyed sample of Internet resources. We use PAC analysis to bound the problemâ€™s sample complexity, and show that the system degrades gracefully with imperfect labeling knowledge.
