This paper describes a program for automatically computing the delay through LSI/VLSI chips which have been laid out using automatic layout programs. A unique algorithm for synthesizing RC networks from artwork data, which significantly reduces execution time and computer storage, is included. A novel and simple method for determining the delay through logic gates due to arbitrary RC network load at the output is also presented and discussed.
