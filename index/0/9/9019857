A long, long time ago, in a laboratory far, far away, EDA researchers and developers used paper tape instead of Linux, rubylith instead of GDS II, yellow wires instead of ten levels of metal. Sitting around a potbellied stove, in their rocking chairs, practitioners of that era (and this) will offer insight into why some great ideas were immediately put into practice while others stayed on the drawing board or in the ivory tower. They will share remembrances of things past, of simpler days when foundries made steel, when options meant CMOS or bipolar, when real parts were measured instead of benchmarks touted. Their stories of what it was like, what has changed, and whether the "good old days" were then or now will be followed by questions and, possibly, answers.
