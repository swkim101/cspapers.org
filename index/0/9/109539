A new package-level interconnect is described that adapts carbon nanoemissive display technology to create an inexpensive package-level freespace crossbar with single-cycle source-to-target latency. Interconnections are made using filamentary electron beams as the data transmission medium. The beams are electrostatically steered, enabling very large, low latency inter-chip crossbar networks. The crossbar and associated package are built entirely from existing technology. This paper describes the operation of the crossbar and presents a conceptual design for a processor that uses the crossbar.
