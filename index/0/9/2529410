In this work, we explore the mechanical behavior of gecko hairs by means of macromodels. The macromodel has four spatular hairs operating by magnetic forces instead of van der Waals forces. The purpose of the models is to simulate the mechanics of the actual gecko seta. For additional hair compliance, a two degree of freedom double bent spatular hair geometry is chosen. A mathematical model for the displacement and forces (slide, peel, and pull-off) for the macro scale gecko hairs is presented. Experiments showed good agreement with the model and a directional adhesion effect which could be useful for locomotion.
