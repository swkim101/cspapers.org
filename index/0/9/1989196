Fluid models [1] are a powerful tool to investigate the stability of stochastic queueing systems. They relate the stability of a queueing system to the stability of a deterministic fluid system, whose evolution can be described in terms of ordinary differential equations. However, fluid models do not always succeed in providing a unique answer on queueing systems stability. Indeed, the set of differential equations describing the fluid model evolution does not always admit a unique solution for all initial conditions; sometimes the fluid model admits different trajectories with different qualitative behaviors (hinting at stability in some cases and at instability in other cases). A further limit of fluid models is the need for a careful analysis of the set of differential equations describing the fluid model evolution, due to the existence of multiple solutions: this makes very difficult to automate the solution of fluid models. Thus, the applicability of fluid models to large-size queueing systems is rather limited. To overcome these two drawbacks, we present a new analytical approach, called Gated Asymptotic ModEls (GAMEs), that allows the stability analysis of queueing systems through gated fluid systems, whose evolution can be described by a system of finitedifferences equations. The advantage of GAMEs approach is that systems of finite-differences equations always admit a unique solution. For this reason, GAMEs approach allows a more effective stability analysis than the usual fluid models approach. We conjecture that GAMEs can be always successfully applied to prove queueing systems stability/instability. Moreover, we prove that GAMEs instability implies instability of the corresponding queueing system.
