Homophily and stochastic equivalence are two primary features of interest in social networks. Recently, the multiplicative latent factor model (MLFM) is proposed to model social networks with directed links. Although MLFM can capture stochastic equivalence, it cannot model well homophily in networks. However, many real-world networks exhibit homophily or both homophily and stochastic equivalence, and hence the network structure of these networks cannot be modeled well by MLFM. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called generalized latent factor model (GLFM), for social network analysis by enhancing homophily modeling in MLFM. We devise a minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm with linear-time complexity and convergence guarantee to learn the model parameters. Extensive experiments on some real-world networks show that GLFM can effectively model homophily to dramatically outperform state-of-the-art methods.
