The paper describes research efforts to develop efficient implementation techniques for large, shared knowledge bases, focusing on efficient concurrent access of large knowledge bases by multiple users. We present an algorithm, called the Dynamic Directed Graph policy, originally proposed in [Chaudhri et al., 1992], which allows efficient interleaved execution of transactions against a large knowledge base with the intent of optimizing transaction throughput. The implementation of the policy and experimental evaluation results are also presented and discussed. The paper concludes with discussion on lessons learnt from this research.
