The Part environment is a software engineering environment (SEE) being built in the Pact project. The environment is being constructed on the PCTE interfaces. The project has defined an environment architecture which identifies Common Services. These are reusable tool components that factor out code that would otherwise have to be developed in several tools, and which significantly increase the integration of the environment. The main activity of the Part project is to develop "method-independent" tools, independent of a particular engineering technique for the production of software.
