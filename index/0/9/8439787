Source separation, or computational auditory scene analysis, attempts to extract individual acoustic objects from input which contains a mixture of sounds from different sources, altered by the acoustic environment. Unmixing algorithms such as ICA and its extensions recover sources by reweighting multiple observation sequences, and thus cannot operate when only a single observation signal is available. I present a technique called refiltering which recovers sources by a nonstationary reweighting ("masking") of frequency sub-bands from a single recording, and argue for the application of statistical algorithms to learning this masking function. I present results of a simple factorial HMM system which learns on recordings of single speakers and can then separate mixtures using only one observation signal by computing the masking function and then refiltering.
