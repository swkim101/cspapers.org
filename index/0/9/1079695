Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) typically focuses on diagnoses, minimal under some minimality criterion, e.g., the minimal-cardinality set of faulty components that explain an observation α. However, for different α there may be minimal-cardinality diagnoses of differing cardinalities, and several applications (such as test pattern generation and benchmark model analysis) need to identify the α leading to the max-cardinality diagnosis amongst them. We denote this problem as a Max-Fault Min-Cardinality (MFMC) problem. This paper considers the generation of observations that lead to MFMC diagnoses. We present a near-optimal, stochastic algorithm, called MIRANDA (Max-fault mIn-caRdinAlity observatioN Deduction Algorithm), that computes MFMC observations. Compared to optimal, deterministic approaches such as ATPG, the algorithm has very low cost, allowing us to generate observations corresponding to high-cardinality faults. Experiments show that MIRANDA delivers optimal results on the 74XXX circuits, as well as good MFMC cardinality estimates on the larger ISCAS85 circuits.
