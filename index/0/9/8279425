This paper introduces a general method to incorporate the LDA Topic Model into text segmentation algorithms. We show that semantic information added by Topic Models significantly improves the performance of two word-based algorithms, namely TextTiling and C99. Additionally, we introduce the new TopicTiling algorithm that is designed to take better advantage of topic information. We show consistent improvements over word-based methods and achieve state-of-the art performance on a standard dataset.
