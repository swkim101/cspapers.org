Users of the Web are overloaded with information. This medium is “polluted” with redundant, erroneous and low quality information. A WWW survey of 11,700 users conducted from April 10 to May 10, 1996[1] indicates that 30.31% of the users report “finding known info” is their problem and 27.80% of the users report organizing collected information as their problem. An empirical study[2] on users’ revisitation patterns to WWW pages found that 58% of an individual’s pages are revisits. With these study results, we believe the Web users would like to build and organize a larger collection of bookmarks for future references than they can reasonably maintain now.
