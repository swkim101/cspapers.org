The early layers of a deep neural net have the fewest parameters, but take up the most computation. In this extended abstract, we propose to only train the hidden layers for a set portion of the training run, freezing them out one-by-one and excluding them from the backward pass. Through experiments on CIFAR, we empirically demonstrate that FreezeOut yields savings of up to 20% wall-clock time during training with 3% loss in accuracy for DenseNets, a 20% speedup without loss of accuracy for ResNets, and no improvement for VGG networks.
