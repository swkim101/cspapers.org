As the number of available Web pages grows, users experience increasing difficulty finding documents relevant to their interests. One of the underlying reasons for this is that most search engines find matches based on keywords, regardless of their meanings. To provide the user with more useful information, we need a system that disambiguates queries by including information about the user's conceptual framework. This is the goal of KeyConcept, a conceptual search engine. During indexing, KeyConcept automatically classifies documents into concepts selected from a reference concept hierarchy. During retrieval, KeyConcept ranks documents based on a combination of keyword and conceptual similarity. This paper describes the system architecture and discusses the results of experiments that evaluate the effect of exploiting the hierarchical relationships between concepts during retrieval. Our results confirm that conceptual match significantly improves the precision of the search results over keyword match alone. In addition, the use of the concept hierarchy to prune irrelevant search results also significantly increases precision.
