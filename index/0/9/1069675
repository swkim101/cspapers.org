Reinforcement learning is an adaptive and flexible control method for autonomous system. In our previous works, we had proposed a reinforcement learning algorithm for redundant systems: "Q-learning with dynamic structuring of exploration space based on GA (QDSEGA)", and applied it to multi-agent systems. However previous works of the QDSEGA have been restricted to homogeneous agents. In this paper, we extend our previous works of multi-agent systems, and propose a hybrid autonomous control method for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulations of transportation task by 10 heterogeneous mobile robots have been carried out. As a result effective behaviors have been obtained.
