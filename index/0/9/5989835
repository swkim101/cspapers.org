The object of this paper is to present a number of ideas for distributing computer time and power at a University with overtaxed centralized computing. Topics discussed include how to determine who gets computer resources and how much; how to share a centralized facility among administrators, researchers, and students; how to secure a flexible system for the user; and how to devise a system which encourages good user habits.
 The computing history of San Diego State University (SDSU) is very briefly presented as background for the computer allocation proposals to be presented. The proposals themselves arose from an appointed sub-committee1 and are presented in a rather top-down manner much as they were introduced on the SDSU campus. It is hoped that a number of other institutions will find some of the ideas or specific strategies proposed to be worthy of careful consideration.
