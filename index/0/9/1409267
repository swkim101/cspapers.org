A novel approach to controlling the turning operation of MEMS Scratch-Drive-Actuator (SDA) micro-robots has been developed. The operation of MEMS SDA has been well demonstrated by the research of Donald et al. [1][2][3]. An improvement of adding an additional stylus arm to control left and right rotation as well as using both arms to halt is discussed. In order to eliminate the complication of different stress curling to control multiple micro-robots, an alternative solution of controlling electrical connections between the parallel plate body and stylus arms is presented. By applying this new control, a novel onboard parallax algorithm was developed that allows a micro-robot to move towards a target without any external control.
