Optimization of programs that may contain exception handling facilities requires new techniques. Program optimizations that do not account for exception handling facilities may incorrectly transform a procedure that can raise an exception, producing different results from the unoptimized version. Restricted exception handling mechanisms that allow optimization are discussed. Data flow equations for determining the effects of exception handling are presented.
