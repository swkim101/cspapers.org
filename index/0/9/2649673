The majority of value function approximation based reinforcement learning algorithms available today, focus on approximating the state (V) or state-action (Q) value function and efficient action selection comes as an afterthought. On the other hand, real-world problems tend to have large action spaces, where evaluating every possible action becomes impractical. This mismatch presents a major obstacle in successfully applying reinforcement learning to real-world problems. In this paper we present a unified view of V and Q functions and arrive at a new space-efficient representation, where action selection can be done exponentially faster, without the use of a model. We then describe how to calculate this new value function efficiently via approximate linear programming and provide experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
