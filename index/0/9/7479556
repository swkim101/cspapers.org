However, API documents often do not include enough information for developers to fully understand the API usages, while searching for good code examples requires non-trivial efforts.Â To address this problem, we propose a novel code search engine, combining the strength of browsing documents and searching for code examples, by returning documents embedded with high-quality code example summaries mined from the Web. Our evaluation results show that our approach provides code examples with high precision and boosts programmer productivity.
