The nestedmheriterf mdez has been recently proposed as an access structure providing an integrated support for queries in object-oriented databases along both aggregation and inheritance hierarchies. It is very efficient for retrieval operations. However, its high update costs make this structure suitable only for hierarchies with a small number of clzw.es. In this paper we propose an enhanced nestedinherited m dez, able to support update operations more efficiently, whereas supporting nested predicates as efficiently as the nested-inherited index. The new organization supports the construction of several index allocation strategies, from which the most efficient with respect to a given workload can be selected. The new and old indices are compared using an analytical cost model. Results of the analysis show that the enhanced nested-inherited index pr~ vides superior performance than the inherited-multiindex and nested-inherited index.
