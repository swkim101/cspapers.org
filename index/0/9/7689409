Location determination of mobile users within a building has attracted much attention lately due to its many applications in mobile networking including network intrusion detection problems. However, it is challenging due to the complexities of the indoor radio propagation characteristics exacerbated by the mobility of the user. A common practice is to mechanically generate a table showing the radio signal strength at different known locations in the building. A mobile user's location at an arbitrary point in the building is determined by measuring the signal strength at the location in question and determining the location by referring to the above table using a LMSE (least mean square error) criterion. Obviously, this is a very tedious and time consuming task. This paper proposes a novel and automated location determination method called ARIADNE. Using a two dimensional construction floor plan and only a single actual signal strength measurement, ARIADNE generates an estimated signal strength map comparable to those generated manually by actual measurements. Given the signal measurements for a mobile, a proposed clustering algorithm searches that signal strength map to determine the current mobile's location. The results from ARIADNE are comparable and may even be superior to those from existing localization schemes.
