TestableAlgorithmsforSelf-AvoidingWalksDanaRandallyAlistairSinclairzAbstractWe present a p olynomial time Monte Carlo algorithm foralmost uniformly generatingandapproximately count-ing self-avoiding walks in rectangular latticesZd.Theseareclassicalproblemsthatarise,forexample,inthestudy of long p olymer chains.While there are a numb erof Monte Carlo algorithms used to solve these problemsin practice, these are heuristic and their correctnessre-lies on unproven conjectures.In contrast, our algorithmdep endsonasingle,widely-b elievedconjecturethatisweakerthanprecedingassumptions,and,moreimp or-tantly, is one which thealgorithm itself can test.Thusour algorithm isreliable, in the sense that it either out-puts answers that are guaranteed, with high probability,to b e correct, or nds a counter-example to the conjec-ture.1Summary1.1BackgroundAself-avoidingwalkinagraphiswalk whichstartsat a xed origin and passes through each vertex at mostonce.Thispap eris concernedwith self-avoiding walksinlattices,particularthed-dimensional rectangularlatticeZdwith origin0.Self-avoiding walks inZdhae b een studied by math-ematicians and natural scientists for many years and arethe sub ject of an extensive literature; for a state-of-the-yDepartment of Computer Science, University of California atBerkeley.
