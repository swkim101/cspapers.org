This paper presents MiniBox, the first two-way sandbox for x86 native code. MiniBox not only isolates the memory space between OS protection modules and an application, but also provides a minimized and secure communication interface between OS protection modules and the application. MiniBox is cross-platform and can be applied in Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud computing to provide two-way protection between a customerâ€™s application and the cloud platform OS. We implement a prototype of MiniBox on both Intel and AMD multi-core systems and port several applications to MiniBox. Evaluation results show that MiniBox is efficient and practical.
