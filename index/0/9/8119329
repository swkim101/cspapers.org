In data-centric sensor networks, where data processing and transfer are oblivious to node IDs, conventional node-based security models are not suitable. We introduce the novel concept of secure locations to address non-cooperative and malicious behavior in location-aware sensor networks. Our architecture also introduces a scalable trust-based routing protocol (TRANS) to track, update and route around untrusted locations using variants of geographic and trajectory routing. As part of our protocol we provide an efficient algorithm for identifying and isolating misbehaving or compromised sensors based on their approximate locations. Our simulations show the efficacy of our approach in malicious node isolation and route infection reduction.
