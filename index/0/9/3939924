We propose a novel method for mitigating erroneous wake-ups that are commonly associated with ultra-low power wake-up receivers. Recent research in low-power protocols has demonstrated significant improvements in energy-efficiency by employing ultra-low power wake-up receivers. However, due to the low-complexity receiver structures adopted, wake-up receivers are susceptible to external interference, which can cause the detection of non-existent wake-ups. The occurrence of these erroneous wake-ups wastes precious energy resources, thereby negating the potential energy savings in employing wake-up receivers. We address this challenging problem by extracting time-domain features from the output of the wake-up receiver, and construct a classifier to distinguish between correct and erroneous wake-ups. We describe the design of the proposed wake-up classifier and present preliminary results.
