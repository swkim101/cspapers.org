Most current Java textbooks for CS1 (and thus most current courses) begin either with fundamentals from the procedural paradigm (assignment, iteration, selection) or with a brief introduction to using objects followed quickly with writing objects. We have found a third way to be most satisfying for both teachers and students: using interesting predefined classes to introduce the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (object instantiation, method calls, inheritance) followed quickly by the traditional fundamentals of iteration and selection, also taught using the same predefined classes.Karel the Robot, developed by Richard Pattis [6] and well-known to many computer science educators, has aged gracefully and is a vital part of our CS1 curriculum. This paper explains how Karel may be used and the advantages of doing so.
