This paper contributes to the understanding of program structure in terms of stability and reliability in a quantitative sense. Distinctions are made between program structure and control structure.
 The characteristics of a good system will be identified qualitatively and it is apparent that all desirable characteristics concerns system stability. Stability is defined in terms of the resistence to the amplification of changes that has been made to the system.
 Some quantitative analysis is made to measure the quality of program structure. The techniques used here are the method of connectivity matrix and the method of random Markovian process. Program structures are defined as abstract relationships between subportions of a program, and the content of the program or its subportions is left undefined.
 Using these techniques, a collection of program structures is measured and ranked, and the preference of structures based on the stability criteria is shown. Two case studies, based on models of abstract structures, are presented here to show how the above techniques can be used to pick an appropriate system structure.
