I am the Timothy E. Wirth Professor of Learning Technologies at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education. From 2001-2004, I also served as Chair of the Learning & Teaching department in the School. My research interests span emerging technologies for learning, educational policy, and leadership in educational innovation. My funded research includes a grant from the U.S. Department of Education Star Schools initiative to development and study augmented reality simulations using wireless mobile devices, and three grants from the National Science Foundation to (1) aid middle school students learning science via multi-user virtual environments, (2) develop a research agenda for online teacher professional development, and (3) explore the feasibility of a “scalability index” for assessing the potential transferability of a locally successful educational innovation to a wide range of contexts.
