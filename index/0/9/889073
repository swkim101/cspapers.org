A modification of predicate logic, called multilayered logic, is discussed. It is designed as the knowledge representation language for describing the systems that uses engineering knowledge to support the system analysis and design. A multi level data structure is used to represent the complex systems in which an abstract entity at a level of abstraction is formed as the collection of the entities at the next lower level. Multi layered logic adapts to this structure of the system and meets the conditions for supporting analysis and design of complex systems.
