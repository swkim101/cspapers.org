The Australian CSIRONET network links a variety of host mainframes, user terminals, and other systems, via an Australia-wide packet-switching subnetwork comprising over 120 minicomputers. A layered network architecture has been used in integrating different host systems into the network. Portable software has been used extensively in implementing various layers in different systems. This paper discusses the use of portable software in supporting file transfers on CSIRONET. Two important benefits result from the systematic use of portable software. The first is the ease with which a new type of system can be integrated into the network. The second is the high degree of flexibility in changing layer functions and protocols, and propagating these changes to the network interfaces on different systems. The original layer protocols on CSIRONET were CSIRONET-specific. However, as the OSI standards emerge, these are being phased into use through the portable interface software. These portable software concepts have universal value in the present environment of evolving network standards.
