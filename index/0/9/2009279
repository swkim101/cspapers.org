With the rapid emergence of applications in mobile networks, understanding and characterizing their properties becomes extremely important. In this paper, from the fundamental model of time-varying graphs, we introduce Temporal Capacity Graphs (TCG), which characterizes the maximum amount of the data that can be transmitted between any two nodes within any time, and consequently reveals the transmission capacity of the whole network. By applying TCG to several realistic mobile networks, we analyze their unique properties. Moreover, using TCG, we reveal the fundamental relationships and tradeoffs between the mobile network settings and system performance.
