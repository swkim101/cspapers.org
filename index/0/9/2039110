The appropriate management of fall situations - i.e. fast instability detection, avoidance of unintentional falls, falling without damaging the body, fast recovering of the standing position after a fall - is an essential ability of biped humanoid robots. This issue is especially important for humanoid robots carrying out demanding movements such as walking in irregular surfaces, running or practicing a given sport (e.g. soccer). In a former contribution we have addressed the design of low-damage fall sequences, which can be activated/triggered by the robot in case of a detected unintentional fall or an intentional fall (common situation in robot soccer). In this article we tackle the detection of instability and the avoidance of falls in biped humanoids, as well as the integration of all components in a single framework. In this framework a fall can be avoided or a falling sequence can be triggered depending on the detected instability's degree. The proposed fall detection and fall avoidance subsystems are validated in real world-experiments with biped humanoid robots.
