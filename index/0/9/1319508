Digital photo management is becoming indispensable for the explosively growing family photo albums due to the rapid popularization of digital cameras and mobile phone cameras. In an effective photo management system photo annotation is the most challenging task. In this paper, we develop several innovative interaction techniques for semi-automatic photo annotation. Compared with traditional annotation systems, our approach provides the following new features: "cluster annotation" puts similar faces or photos with similar scene together, and enables user label them in one operation; "contextual re-ranking" boosts the labeling productivity by guessing the user intention; "ad hoc annotation" allows user label photos while they are browsing or searching, and improves system performance progressively through learning propagation. Our results show that these technologies provide a more user friendly interface for the annotation of person name, location, and event, and thus substantially improve the annotation performance especially for a large photo album.
