Product Comparison Matrices (PCMs) form a rich source of data for comparing a set of related and competing products over numerous features. Despite their apparent simplicity, PCMs contain heterogeneous, ambiguous, uncontrolled and partial information that hinders their efficient exploitations. In this paper, we formalize PCMs through model-based automated techniques and develop additional tooling to support the edition and re-engineering of PCMs. 20 participants used our editor to evaluate the PCM metamodel and automated transformations. The results over 75 PCMs from Wikipedia show that (1) a significant proportion of the formalization of PCMs can be automated -- 93.11% of the 30061 cells are correctly formalized; (2) the rest of the formalization can be realized by using the editor and mapping cells to existing concepts of the metamodel. The automated approach opens avenues for engaging a community in the mining, re-engineering, edition, and exploitation of PCMs that now abound on the Internet.
