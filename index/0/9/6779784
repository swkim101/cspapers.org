A feedback control to generate jumping motions for compliantly actuated multilegged robots is proposed. The method allows to specify the direction of the jumping motion. This is achieved by a constraint that defines a one-dimensional submanifold and a bang-bang control which generates a limit cycle on this submanifold. The approach is based on classical impedance control with the difference that the stiffness on the submanifold and the force to preserve a predefined nominal body configuration result from the intrinsic mechanical springs in the joints. Furthermore, we propose two controller implementations: the first implementation does not require to detect the contact state, while the second implementation requires contact state detection, but accounts in addition for Coulomb friction constraints. The controller is validated in simulation with a compliantly actuated quadruped.
