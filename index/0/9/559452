Yet, modern media make it increasingly difficult for experts to keep up with the pace at which information is produced. Hence, we believe there is value in tools to assist them in this process. Much of the effort on Web data research has been focused on coping with incompleteness and uncertainty. Comparatively, dealing with context has received less attention, although it is crucial in judging the validity of a claim. For instance, what holds true in a US state, might not in its neighbors, e.g., due to obsolete or superseded laws. In this work, we address the problem of checking the validity of claims in multiple contexts. We define a language to represent and query facts across different dimensions. The approach is non-intrusive and allows relatively easy modeling, while capturing incompleteness and uncertainty. We describe the syntax and semantics of the language. We present algorithms to demonstrate its feasibility, and we illustrate its usefulness through examples.
