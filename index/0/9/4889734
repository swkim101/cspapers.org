Free web proxies promise anonymity and censorship circumvention at no cost. Several websites publish lists of free proxies organized by country, anonymity level, and performance. These lists index hundreds of thousand of hosts discovered via automated tools and crowd-sourcing. A complex free proxy ecosystem has been forming over the years, of which very little is known. In this paper we shed light on this ecosystem via ProxyTorrent, a distributed measurement platform that leverages both active and passive measurements. Active measurements discover free proxies, assess their performance, and detect potential malicious activities. Passive measurements relate to proxy performance and usage in the wild, and are collected by free proxies users via a Chrome plugin we developed. ProxyTorrent has been running since January 2017, monitoring up to 180,000 free proxies and totaling more than 1,500 users over a 10 months period. Our analysis shows that less than 2% of the proxies announced on the Web indeed proxy traffic on behalf of users; further, only half of these proxies have decent performance and can be used reliably. Around 10% of the working proxies exhibit malicious behaviors, e.g., ads injection and TLS interception, and these proxies are also the ones providing the best performance. Through the analysis of more than 2 Terabytes of proxied traffic, we show that web browsing is the primary user activity. Geo-blocking avoidance is not a prominent use-case, with the exception of proxies located in countries hosting popular geo-blocked content.
