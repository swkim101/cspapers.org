Multi-focus distortion-oriented views are useful in viewinglarge information on a small screen, but still have problems inmanaging multiple foci during editing. The user may have tonavigate information space by focusing and defocusing multipleparts to obtain multi-focus layouts that change according tovarious editing situations. As a result, it becomes haphazard tonavigate and edit large nested networks such as hypertexts. Wepropose a user interface for quickly obtaining desirable layouts.The interface uses two techniques: focus size prediction andpredictive focus selection. These techniques are based on a usertest and experiences in applications. We also describe two exampleapplications.
