Wireless sensor network technologies enable a wide variety of applications (e.g., environmental monitoring). Such sensor networks are often deployed in regions that make it difficult to collect and redistribute the nodes for maintenance. However, there is often a need to reprogram all of the nodes in the network, either during application test phases on deployed networks, or to support software upgrades. Therefore, a reliable method of sending a relatively large amount of data to each node in the network is required to support these functions.
