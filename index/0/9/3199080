Even though role-based access control (RBAC) can tremendously help us minimize the complexity in administering users, it is still needed to realize the notion of roles at the resource level. In this paper, we propose a practical cryptographic RBAC model, called role-key hierarchy model, to support various security features including signature and encryption based on role-key hierarchy. With the help of rich algebraic structure of elliptic curve, we introduce a role-based cryptosystem construction to verify the rationality and validity of our proposed model. Also, a proof-of-concept prototype implementation and performance evaluation are discussed to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our mechanisms.
