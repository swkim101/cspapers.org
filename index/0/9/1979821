In this paper, we give a new generalization error bound of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) for a general class of regularizations. Our main target in this paper is dense type regularizations including lp-MKL that imposes lp-mixed-norm regularization instead of l1-mixed-norm regularization. According to the recent numerical experiments, the sparse regularization does not necessarily show a good performance compared with dense type regularizations. Motivated by this fact, this paper gives a general theoretical tool to derive fast learning rates that is applicable to arbitrary mixed-norm-type regularizations in a unifying manner. As a by-product of our general result, we show a fast learning rate of lp-MKL that is tightest among existing bounds. We also show that our general learning rate achieves the minimax lower bound. Finally, we show that, when the complexities of candidate reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are inhomogeneous, dense type regularization shows better learning rate compared with sparse l1 regularization.
