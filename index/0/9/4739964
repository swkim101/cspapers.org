This paper proposes a new method for segmenting and classifying seamines on Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) side scan images. The method uses an active contours approach and superellipse a-priori knowledge to segment the image in object, object-shadow and background areas. In contrast to other methods using superellipse constraints, the shape prior is incorporated directly into the segmentation process. This kind of segmentation has the advantage that afterwards the extracted superellipse parameters that describe the object and the object-shadow can directly be used as feature for a classification - this work is hence also of potential interest for general object recognition tasks in other application domains. Several different perspectives of implementing this idea into a suitable algorithm are introduced and compared with each other. Thus, for the evaluation of each method the extracted superellipse features are used for a support vector machine classification. An one against all confusion matrix is generated on a test data set. This result is compared to a related state of the art algorithm. It is shown that our new method is able to correctly classify 170 of 210 objects in a very challenging real world data set and that it yields significant better results than the state of the art comparison.
