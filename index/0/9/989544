Traditional wisdom holds that once documents are turned into bag-of-words (unigram count) vectors, word orders are completely lost. We introduce an approach that, perhaps surprisingly, is able to learn a bigram language model from a set of bag-of-words documents. At its heart, our approach is an EM algorithm that seeks a model which maximizes the regularized marginal likelihood of the bagof-words documents. In experiments on seven corpora, we observed that our learned bigram language models: i) achieve better test set perplexity than unigram models trained on the same bag-of-words documents, and are not far behind “oracle bigram models” trained on the corresponding ordered documents; ii) assign higher probabilities to sensible bigram word pairs; iii) improve the accuracy of ordereddocument recovery from a bag-of-words. Our approach opens the door to novel phenomena, for example, privacy leakage from index files.
