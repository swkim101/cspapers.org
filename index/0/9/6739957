We propose a simple unsupervised approach to detecting non-compositional components in multiword expressions based on Wiktionary. The approach makes use of the definitions, synonyms and translations in Wiktionary, and is applicable to any type of MWE in any language, assuming the MWE is contained in Wiktionary. Our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves higher F-score than state-of-the-art methods.
