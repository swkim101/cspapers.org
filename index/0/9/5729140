Stochastic Inversion Transduction Grammars constitute a powerful formalism in Machine Translation for which an efficient Dynamic Programming parsing algorithm exists. In this work, we review this parsing algorithm and propose important modifications that enlarge the search space. These modifications allow the parsing algorithm to search for more and better solutions.
