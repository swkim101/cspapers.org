In this paper, we present a method to predict per-frame decoding times of modern video decoder algorithms. By examining especially the MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4 pt. 2 algorithms, we developed a generic model for these decoders, which also applies to a wide range of other decoders. From this model, we derived a method to predict decoding times with an up-to-now unmatched accuracy while keeping the overhead low. We show the effectiveness of this method with an example implementation and compare the resulting predictions with the actual decoding times using video material from commercial DVDs
