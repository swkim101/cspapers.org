Firstly, we give the definition of an $L$-Bifuzzy Scott closed subset and prove its related properties. then, we give the definition of an $L$-Bifuzzy ScottCo-topological space, study its properties and equivalently characterize it which is a generalization of the ScottCo-topological space in the classical topology theory. Finally, we establish the relationships of $L$-Bifuzzy domain, $L$-Bifuzzy lower set and $L$-Bifuzzy Scott Co-topological space. The relationship is that we can use $L$-Bifuzzy domain, $L$-Bifuzzy lower set to construct the $L$-Bifuzzy Scott Co-topological space. All the theories we proposed are new and they present a general framework for the study of the fuzzy data types and fuzzy relations in information systems and database technology.
