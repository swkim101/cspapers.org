We describe a fairly comprehensive handling of the syntax and semantics of comparative constructions. The analysis is largely based on the theory developed by Pinkham, but we advance arguments to support a different handling of phrasal comparatives - in particular, we use direct interpretation instead of C-ellipsis. We explain the reasons for dividing comparative sentences into different categories, and for each category we give an example of the corresponding Montague semantics. The ideas have all been implemented within a large-scale grammar for Swedish.
