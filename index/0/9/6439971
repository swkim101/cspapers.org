In recent years, community structure has attracted increasing attention in social network analysis. However, performances of multifarious approaches to community detection are seldom evaluated in a suite of systematic measurements. Furthermore, we can hardly find works which reveal diverse features based on the detected community structure. In this paper, we build a tool called CoDEM to make both quality evaluations of community detection and an in-depth mining for pivotal nodes inside communities. This tool integrates several effective approaches to community detection, establishes an overall evaluation system and gets the multi-dimensional ranking for the local importance of nodes. Moreover, the tool is built with a friendly user interface.
