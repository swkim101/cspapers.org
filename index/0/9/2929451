When a system fails to correctly recognize a voice search query, the user will frequently retry the query, either by repeating it exactly or rephrasing it in an attempt to adapt to the systemâ€™s failure. It is desirable to be able to identify queries as retries both offline, as a valuable quality signal, and online, as contextual information that can aid recognition. We present a method than can identify retries offline with 81% accuracy using similarity measures between two subsequent queries as well as system and user signals of recognition accuracy. The retry rate predicted by this method correlates significantly with a gold standard measure of accuracy, suggesting that it may be useful as an offline predictor of accuracy.
