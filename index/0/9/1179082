We present a case study of a tangible user interface that implements novel interaction techniques for the construction of complex queries in large data sets. Our interface, Eugenie, utilizes gestural interaction with active physical tokens and a multi-touch interactive surface to aid in the collaborative design process of synthetic biological circuits. We developed new interaction techniques for navigating large hierarchical data sets and for exploring a combinatorial design space. The goal of this research is to study the effect of gestural and tangible interaction with active tokens on sense-making throughout the bio-design process.
