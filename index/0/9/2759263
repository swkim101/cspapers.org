Monitoring systems today often involve continuous queries over streaming data, in a distributed collaborative system. The distribution of query operators over a network of processors, and their processing sequence, form a query configuration with inherent constraints on the throughput it can support. In this paper we propose to optimize stream queries with respect to a version of throughput measure, the profiled input throughput. This measure is focused on matching the expected behavior of the input streams. To prune the search space we used hill-climbing techniques that proved to be efficient and effective.
