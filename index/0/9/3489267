Smart interactive tangible objects (briefly, tangibles) can help teachers in the scaffolding of algorithmic thinking of 10-13 years old children. In this work, tangibles deal with graph algorithmic thinking. By following an action-research design approach, tangibles were rapidly developed and used in studies with children and teachers (Bonani et al., 2017, 2018). This poster shows their evolution and the most recent experience: a field study with 8 middle school children, and 5 primary school children, using tangibles for graph algorithmic thinking. Data collected by researchers were mixed (qualitative and quantitative), concerning engagement and learning (e.g., Gennari et al., 2017). Results suggest that tangibles engage pupils and help them understand simple and connected graphs. Future work will seek their adaptation to classes (e.g., Di Mascio et al., 2012).
