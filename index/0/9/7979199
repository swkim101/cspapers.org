The Very Simple Computer (VSC) was designed in class and breadboarded in the laboratory by the students of an undergraduate-level computer architectures course. The computer uses small and medium scale TTL integrated circuits. It has an 8-bit word with a 3-bit op-code and a 5-bit address, resulting in 8 instructions and 32 words of memory. The VSC uses a rocker switch input and directly monitors (with LEDs) the bus for the output. This relatively inexpensive project (<$100 including power supply, ICS, breadboards and assorted hardware) is a natural for a small computer science department on a limited budget. In addition to providing the students with a sense of accomplishment, the VSC raises many practical architecture issues not encounted when using laboratory simulators: This paper outlines a method for incorporating the design of the VSC into regular classroom lectures, and offers a number of recommendations for instructors who would consider using the VSC in their own course.
