In this paper, we address the correctness and performance issues that arise when implementing logging and crash recovery in a page-server environment. The issues result from two characteristics of page-server systems: 1) the fact that data is modified and cached in client database buffers that are not accessible by the server, and 2) the performance and cost trade-offs that are inherent in a client-server environment. We describe a recovery system that we have implemented for the client-server version of the EXODUS storage manager. The implementation supports efficient buffer management policies, allows flexibility in the interaction between clients and the server, and reduces the server load by generating log records at clients. We also present a preliminary performance analysis of the implementation.
