We demonstrate ultrathin, ultraflexible, large-area pressure sensors based on an organic transistor integrated circuit. A 10-m-thick plastic film with an organic transistor active matrix is developed that can be bent to a bending radius of less than 1 mm to create an electrical artificial skin (E-skin). The thin-film, flexible pressure-sensor matrix is implemented on a curved surface, and the spatial distribution of pressure is successfully obtained in real time.
