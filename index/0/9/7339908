One of the most important points in path tracking applications, is the capability of the robot to track the desired path as accurately as possible. Results presented in the literature in on-road contexts are convincing, but the case of off-road mobile robots introduces other issues, like bad grip conditions or non-flat ground. These issues can lead to a lack of accuracy of the tracking, even more when we consider high speed. The quality of the tracking depends on the modelling and the control laws used, but it depends also on the path to follow and on the soil conditions. If some small errors may be acceptable, it is sometimes mandatory to have a limited error, in particular when avoiding an obstacle or when moving in a narrow pathway. The aim of the algorithm proposed in this paper is to determine the maximum velocity of the robot during the tracking, for the lateral error to stay below a desired limit. In order to achieve this, a predictive approach taking into account for the evolution of a dynamic model, control laws and actuators properties is proposed. It permits to predict the forthcoming tracking error and consequently to estimate the maximum velocity that the robot can reach in accordance with the maximum deviation allowed.
