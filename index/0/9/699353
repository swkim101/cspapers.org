Cybersecurity is a topic of growing interest for CS educators. The goal of this workshop is to provide faculty with tools and interactive exercises that would facilitate adding this topic to their curriculum. We will introduce the EDURange framework for developing interactive cybersecurity exercises. We have several exercises for participants to try, including network scanning and firewall configuration. We will give an introduction to some tools such as nmap, as well as the basic concepts. We have tested our framework several times in classrooms and workshops for students and faculty. One of its advantages is that faculty can use it in their classes with very little set-up. It uses Amazon's EC2/AWS to make the exercises readily available, so instructors will be able to access them with an account. We will also discuss other security exercises, including ones in the RAVE. It also provides each user with a number of VMs with tools and vulnerabilities. We will discuss using exercises as assessment tools. No previous experience in security is necessary. Laptop required. http://blogs.evergreen.edu/edurange
