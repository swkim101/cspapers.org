Thumbnails play such an important role in online videos. As the most representative snapshot, they capture the essence of a video and provide the first impression to the viewers; ultimately, a great thumbnail makes a video more attractive to click and watch. We present an automatic thumbnail selection system that exploits two important characteristics commonly associated with meaningful and attractive thumbnails: high relevance to video content and superior visual aesthetic quality. Our system selects attractive thumbnails by analyzing various visual quality and aesthetic metrics of video frames, and performs a clustering analysis to determine the relevance to video content, thus making the resulting thumbnails more representative of the video. On the task of predicting thumbnails chosen by professional video editors, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system against six baseline methods, using a real-world dataset of 1,118 videos collected from Yahoo Screen. In addition, we study what makes a frame a good thumbnail by analyzing the statistical relationship between thumbnail frames and non-thumbnail frames in terms of various image quality features. Our study suggests that the selection of a good thumbnail is highly correlated with objective visual quality metrics, such as the frame texture and sharpness, implying the possibility of building an automatic thumbnail selection system based on visual aesthetics.
