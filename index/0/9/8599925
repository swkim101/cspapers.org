Federated search is the task of retrieving relevant documents from different information resources. One of the main research problems in federated search is to combine the results from different sources into a single ranked list. Recent work proposed a regression based method to download some documents from each ranked list of the different sources, calculated comparable scores for the documents and estimated mapping functions that transform source-specific scores into comparable scores. Experiments have shown that downloading more documents improves the accuracy of results merging. However downloading more documents increases the computation and communication costs.
 This paper proposes a utility based optimization method that enables the system to automatically decide on the desired number of training documents to download according to the user's need for effectiveness and efficiency.
