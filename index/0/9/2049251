We discuss problems arising in reasoning about on-going processes, using the modal constructs after, throughout, during, and preserves. Earlier work established decidability of the theory whose language included only the first two of these, along with program connectives | , ; and *. Here we give a complete Gentzen-type axiomatizations for useful combinations of the other modalities. We also indicate how such Gentzen-type axiomatizations lead to deterministic exponential time upper bounds on the complexity of decision procedures for these languages. It remains an open problem how to completely axiomatize the combination of modalities during and preserves.
