Lexicalized context-free grammar(LCFG) is an attractive compromise between the parsing efficiency of context-free grammar (CFG) and the elegance and lexical sensitivity of lexicalized tree adjoining grammar (LTAG). LCFG is a restricted form of LTAG that can only generate context-free languages and can be parsed in cubic time. However, LCFG supports much of the elegance of LTAG's analysis of English and shares with LTAG the ability to lexicalize CFGS without changing the trees generated.
