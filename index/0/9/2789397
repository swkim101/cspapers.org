Nowadays, real-time systems are growing in size and complexity as the application field is expanding. Ensuring the correct behavior of safety-critical systems regarding their nonfunctional properties is subsequently more challenging. The respect of timing constraints is essential for these systems because missing a deadline might lead to unacceptable consequences. We propose a verified time-centric ASM metamodel and its implementation that provides a first step towards temporal hardware analysis.
