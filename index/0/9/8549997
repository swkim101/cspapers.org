Digital Naturalism investigates the role that digital media can play in field Ethology. While digital technology plays an increasingly larger role in the Ethologist's process, its use tends to be limited to the experimentation and analysis stages. My goal is to work with scientists to develop context-dependent, behavioral tools promoting novel interactions between animal, man, and environment. The aim is to empower the early exploratory phases of their research as well as the later representation of their work. I will test a methodology combining analytical tool making and interaction studies with modern ethology.
