We present a novel ensemble pruning method based on reordering the classifiers obtained from bagging and then selecting a subset for aggregation. Ordering the classifiers generated in bagging makes it possible to build subensembles of increasing size by including first those classifiers that are expected to perform best when aggregated. Ensemble pruning is achieved by halting the aggregation process before all the classifiers generated are included into the ensemble. Pruned subensembles containing between 15% and 30% of the initial pool of classifiers, besides being smaller, improve the generalization performance of the full bagging ensemble in the classification problems investigated.
