Model management is a generic approach to solving problems of data programmability where precisely engineered mappings are required. Applications include data warehousing, e-commerce, object-to-relational wrappers, enterprise information integration, database portals, and report generators. The goal is to develop a model management engine that can support tools for all of these applications. The engine supports operations to match schemas, compose mappings, diff schemas, merge schemas, translate schemas into different data models, and generate data transformations from mappings.
 Much has been learned about model management since it was proposed seven years ago. This leads us to a revised vision that differs from the original in two main respects: the operations must handle more expressive mappings, and the runtime that executes mappings should be added as an important model management component. We review what has been learned from recent experience, explain the revised model management vision based on that experience, and identify the research problems that the revised vision opens up.
