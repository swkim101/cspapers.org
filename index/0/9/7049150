A series of biorobotic fins has been developed based on the pectoral fin of the bluegill sunfish. These robotic fins model physical properties of the biological fin, and execute kinematics derived from sunfish motions that were identified to be most responsible for thrust. When the physical properties of the robotic fin are tuned appropriately to operating conditions, the robotic fin, like the sunfish, produces positive thrust throughout the entire fin beat. Due to having many degrees of freedom, these fins can be used to generate and control forces for propulsion and maneuvering.
