A principal weakness of conventional (i.e., non-hierarchical) phrase-based statistical machine translation is that it can only exploit continuous phrases. In this paper, we extend phrase-based decoding to allow both source and target phrasal discontinuities, which provide better generalization on unseen data and yield significant improvements to a standard phrase-based system (Moses). More interestingly, our discontinuous phrase-based system also outperforms a state-of-the-art hierarchical system (Joshua) by a very significant margin (+1.03 BLEU on average on five Chinese-English NIST test sets), even though both Joshua and our system support discontinuous phrases. Since the key difference between these two systems is that ours is not hierarchical---i.e., our system uses a string-based decoder instead of CKY, and it imposes no hard hierarchical reordering constraints during training and decoding---this paper sets out to challenge the commonly held belief that the tree-based parameterization of systems such as Hiero and Joshua is crucial to their good performance against Moses.
