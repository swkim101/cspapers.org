This paper focuses on the task of collocation polarity disambiguation. The collocation refers to a binary tuple of a polarity word and a target (such as or ), in which the sentiment orientation of the polarity word ("long") changes along with different targets ("battery life" or "startup"). To disambiguate a collocation's polarity, previous work always turned to investigate the polarities of its surrounding contexts, and then assigned the majority polarity to the collocation. However, these contexts are limited, thus the resulting polarity is insufficient to be reliable. We therefore propose an unsupervised three-component framework to expand some pseudo contexts from web, to help disambiguate a collocation's polarity. Without using any additional labeled data, experiments show that our method is effective.
