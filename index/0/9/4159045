In this paper, we describe the design steps for WWW authoring of adaptive hypermedia via a five layer model. We argu e that we need to introduce the goal and constraints model between the domain model and adaptation and user models, in order to be able to generate adaptive hypermedia on the fly and to a ctu lly implement the so often quoted re-usage paradigm. We also show the operators necessary to implement functionality t the different levels, and exemplify this layered construction wit h MOT, an adaptive hypermedia (in particular, courseware) aut horing system we have built at the Eindhoven University of Techno logy.
