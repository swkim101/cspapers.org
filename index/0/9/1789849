We have implemented the first copying garbage collector that permits continuous unimpeded mutator access to the original objects during copying. The garbage collector incrementally replicates all accessible objects and uses a mutation log to bring the replicas up-to-date with changes made by the mutator. An experimental implementation demonstrates that the costs of using our algorithm are small and that bounded pause times of 50 milliseconds can be readily achieved.
