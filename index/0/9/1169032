In this work the data aggregation problem for a multi-agent system within the framework of Theory of Evidence is investigated. In the proposed scenario, agents are assumed to be independent reliable sources which collect data and collaborate to reach a common knowledge. In particular, each agent is supposed to provide a set of observations which does not change over time. A protocol for distributed data aggregation for graph-like network topologies is designed. Experimental results with a sensor network have been carried out to corroborate the theoretical results and the feasibility of the proposed approach.
