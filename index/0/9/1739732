In this paper we outline an approach to the integration of task planning and motion planning that has the following key properties: It is aggressively hierarchical; it makes choices and commits to them in a top-down fashion in an attempt to limit the length of plans that need to be constructed, and thereby exponentially decrease the amount of search required. It operates on detailed, continuous geometric representations and does not require a-priori discretization of the state or action spaces.
