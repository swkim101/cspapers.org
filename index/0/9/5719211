We consider the use of dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVS) and architectural adaptation for saving energy for realtime multimedia applications. Previous work has considered this problem by invoking architectural and voltage/frequency adaptations at the granularity of a full frame of multimedia applications. The proposed inter-frame adaptation algorithm exploited computation slack in each frame by using the lowest energy configuration that still meets the application deadline. We make two sets of contributions: (1) We explore architectural adaptation within a frame, or intra-frame adaptations, using both old algorithms proposed in the context of non-real-time applications and new algorithms. While inter-frame architectural adaptations can slow the computation, the intra-frame algorithms attempt to save energy without affecting performance. (2) We show how intra-frame and inter-frame architectural adaptations can be combined, and compare pure inter-frame, pure intra-frame, and the combined approaches. We find that intra-frame architectural adaptation is effective for realtime multimedia applications. However , the combined inter-frame and intra-frame architectural adaptation approach saves more energy than either technique alone for systems both without and with support for inter-frame controlled DVS. Without DVS, inter-frame architectural adaptation provides most of the benefits, but with less slack intra-frame is more beneficial. With DVS, intra-frame architectural adaptation provides most of the benefits. However, it is not best for all applications, and, furthermore, the overhead for implementing inter-frame architectural adaptation in a system with inter-frame DVS support is small. Therefore, for systems both without and with DVS, our results indicate that the combined architectural adaptation algorithm is a good design choice. iii To my Father, Mother and Wife iv Acknowledgements
