Modeling activity in online collaboration websites, such as StackExchange Question and Answering portals, is becoming increasingly important, as the success of these websites critically depends on the content contributed by its users. In this paper, we represent user activity as time series and perform an initial analysis of these time series to obtain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern their creation. In particular, we are interested in identifying latent nonlinear behavior in online user activity as opposed to a simpler linear operating mode. To that end, we apply a set of statistical tests for nonlinearity as a means to characterize activity time series derived from $16$ different online collaboration websites. We validate our approach by comparing activity forecast performance from linear and nonlinear models, and study the underlying dynamical systems we derive with nonlinear time series analysis. Our results show that nonlinear characterizations of activity time series help to (i) improve our understanding of activity dynamics in online collaboration websites, and (ii) increase the accuracy of forecasting experiments.
