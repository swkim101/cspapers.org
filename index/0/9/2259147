Machine learning classification is used for numerous tasks nowadays, such as medical or genomics predictions, spam detection, face recognition, and financial predictions. Due to privacy concerns, in some of these applications, it is important that the data and the classifier remain confidential. In this work, we construct three major classification protocols that satisfy this privacy constraint: hyperplane decision, Na√Øve Bayes, and decision trees. We also enable these protocols to be combined with AdaBoost. At the basis of these constructions is a new library of building blocks, which enables constructing a wide range of privacy-preserving classifiers; we demonstrate how this library can be used to construct other classifiers than the three mentioned above, such as a multiplexer and a face detection classifier. We implemented and evaluated our library and our classifiers. Our protocols are efficient, taking milliseconds to a few seconds to perform a classification when running on real medical datasets.
