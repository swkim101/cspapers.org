Bipedal walking could be implemented into a robot by mimicking spring-like leg behaviour. The fundamental model, describing human-like leg function in walking is the bipedal spring-mass model which was investigated in this study. We identified several types of walking patterns, e.g. symmetric and asymmetric walking, that accounts for high variability of gait. The aim of this study is the identification of a stiffness range which allows for stable walking with comparatively large robustness against perturbations. Walking with compliant legs was tested with the bipedal PogoWalker, demonstrating advantages of the underlying leg mechanics, i.e. walking without the necessity of precise leg adjustments, and acceptable impact forces.
