Achievement goals are cognitively-represented end states that individuals strive to reach in competence situations. Well-studied by educational psychologists, achievement goals are robust predictors of grades, interest, and motivation of students. In this paper, we apply achievement goal theory to measure CS1 students' achievement goals and consequent interest in CS and final exam grade. We find that students aiming for topic mastery become interested in CS and, contrary to theoretical expectations, perform well on the exam. A more complex pattern of results surrounds students who orient toward competence demonstration or normative comparison, and the link between such performance goals and outcomes is less clear. We argue for the continued appropriation of educational theory to inform our studies of CS success.
