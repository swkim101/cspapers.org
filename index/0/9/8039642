Given a finite regular graph <i>G</i> = (<i>V, E</i>) and a metric space (<i>X, d</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>), let γ<sub>+</sub>(<i>G, X</i>) denote the smallest constant γ<sub>+</sub> > 0 such that for all <i>f, g</i>: <i>V</i> → <i>X</i> we have:
 [EQUATION]
 In the special case <i>X</i> = R this quantity coincides with the reciprocal of the absolute spectral gap of <i>G</i>, but for other geometries the parameter γ<sub>+</sub>(<i>G, X</i>), which we still think of as measuring the non-linear spectral gap of <i>G</i> with respect to <i>X</i> (even though there is no actual spectrum present here), can behave very differently.
 Non-linear spectral gaps arise often in the theory of metric embeddings, and in the present paper we systematically study the theory of non-linear spectral gaps, partially in order to obtain a combinatorial construction of super-expander --- a family of bounded-degree graphs <i>G</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = (<i>V</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <i>E</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>), with lim<sub><i>i</i>→∞</sub> |<i>V</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>| = ∞, which do not admit a coarse embedding into any uniformly convex normed space. In addition, the bi-Lipschitz distortion of <i>G</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> in any uniformly convex Banach space is Ω(log |<i>V</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>|), which is the worst possible behavior due to Bourgain's embedding theorem [3]. Such remarkable graph families were previously known to exist due to a tour de force algebraic construction of Lafforgue [11]. Our construction is different and combinatorial, relying on the zigzag product of Reingold-Vadhan-Wigderson [28].
 We show that non-linear spectral gaps behave sub-multiplicatively under zigzag products --- a fact that amounts to a simple iteration of the inequality above. This yields as a special case a very simple (linear algebra free) proof of the Reingold-Vadhan-Wigderson theorem which states that zigzag products preserve the property of having an absolute spectral gap (with quantitative control on the size of the gap). The zigzag iteration of Reingold-Vadhan-Wigderson also involves taking graph powers, which is trivial to analyze in the classical "linear" setting. In our work, the behavior of non-linear spectral gaps under graph powers becomes a major geometric obstacle, and we show that for uniformly convex normed spaces there exists a satisfactory substitute for spectral calculus which makes sense in the non-linear setting. These facts, in conjunction with a variant of Ball's notion of Markov cotype and a Fourier analytic proof of the existence of appropriate "base graphs", are shown to imply that Reingold-Vadhan-Wigderson type constructions can be carried out in the non-linear setting.
