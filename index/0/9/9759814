In this paper definitions of unnormalized relation, functional dependency on it and Normal Form are presented. The Normal Form plays a key role in our relational data model in which unnormalized relations are admitted as does the Third Normal Form of Codd in the data model of normalized relation. 
 
Properties pertaining to Normal Form are discussed emphasizing comparison with 3NF along with analysis of some typical examples. 
 
Similarity and dissimilarity between new functional dependency and Fagin's multivalued dependency are also discussed and presented in the form of proposition.
