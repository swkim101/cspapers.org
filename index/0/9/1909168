Linked lists are an important component of the computer science curriculum. JVALL is a software package that provides an animation of linked list operations that is fully compatible with the Java LinkedList class. The animations are driven by a client program that can be either an applet or standalone application. It provides an effective way for students to learn, experiment with, and debug linked list based classes.
