Queueing systems with cyclic service have a broad range of applications in communication systems, e.g., in switching systems, ring networks, burst assembly in OBS and traffic aggregation in edge nodes. While such systems have been extensively studied, the buffer capacity is often assumed to be unlimited. In real systems, queue sizes are always limited. We present an analytical method using state-space modelling, for obtaining the performance of cyclic service systems with finite queues and non-exhaustive service. The effect of switchover time has also been taken into account. We also show the effect of varying traffic loads and queue sizes on the observed queue.
