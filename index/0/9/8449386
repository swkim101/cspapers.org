Typically, commercial Web search engines provide very little feedback to the user concerning how a particular query is processed and interpreted. Specifically, they apply key query transformations without the users knowledge. Although these transformations have a pronounced effect on query results, users have very few resources for recognizing their existence and understanding their practical importance. We conducted a user study to gain a better understanding of users knowledge of and reactions to the operation of several query transformations that web search engines automatically employ. Additionally, we developed and evaluated Transparent Queries, a software system designed to provide users with lightweight feedback about opaque query transformations. The results of the study suggest that users do indeed have difficulties understanding the operation of query transformations without additional assistance. Finally, although transparency is helpful and valuable, interfaces that allow direct control of query transformations might ultimately be more helpful for end-users.
