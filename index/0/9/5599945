This paper presents a corpus-based approach for deriving heuristics to locate the antecedents of relative pronouns. The technique duplicates the performance of hand-coded rules and requires human intervention only during the training phase. Because the training instances are built on parser output rather than word cooccurrences, the technique requires a small number of training examples and can be used on small to medium-sized corpora. Our initial results suggest that the approach may provide a general method for the automated acquisition of a variety of disambiguation heuristics for natural language systems, especially for problems that require the assimilation of syntactic and semantic knowledge.
