The success of a router in automated printed circuit board design depends strongly on board organization prior to routing. One of the steps in board organization is the assignment of connections to pins, which can be made with considerable freedom since most chips have permutable circuits, gates, or gate input pins. Intelligently made pin assignment can reduce the two principal causes of router failure: (1) the crossing of connection paths and (2) the filling of available channels. The method described in this paper assigns a vector to each available chip pin and to each set of connections which are to be connected to a single pin on the chip. These vectors are used to assign the connections to the pins following a heuristic optimization procedure. This procedure was implemented as a FORTRAN program and gave a significant improvement in the number of wires routed on a large sample of typical boards. It is now incorporated into the UNIVAC automated P.C. board design program.
