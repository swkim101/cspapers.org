Animated demonstration systems such as MacroMind Director [6] are becoming popular. Our notion of animation is more restricted. We define user interface animation as the process of emulating the interaction of a user with the interface. The interaction should be real, in the sense that it should engage the actual application. Such systems are powerful because of their ability to invoke actions, and expressive because they can be used to demonstrate interaction techniques. The effect of the presentation may be enhanced by displaying the behavior of input devices audio-visually.
