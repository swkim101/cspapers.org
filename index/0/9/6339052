A new generation of reactive, model-based executives are emerging that make extensive use of componentbased declarative models to analyze anomalous situations and generate novel sequences for the internal control of complex autonomous systems. Burton, a generative, model-based planner offers a core element that bridges the gap between current and target states within the reactive loop. Burton is a sound, complete, reactive planner that generates a single control action of a valid plan in average case constant time, and compensates for anomalies at every step. Burton will not generate irreversible, potentially damaging sequences, except to effect repairs. We present model compilation, causal analysis, and online policy construction methods that are key to Burton's performance.
