WAND is a meta-data management system that provides a file-system tree for users of an internet based P2P network. The tree is robust and retains its structure even when nodes (peers) enter and leave the network. The robustness is based on a concept of virtual folders that are automatically created to retain paths to lower level folders whenever a node hosting a higher-level folder moves away. Other contributions of the WAND system include its novel approach towards managing root directory information and handling network partitions.
