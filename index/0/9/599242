We introduce and evaluate a middleware clustering technology capable of allocating resources to web applications through dynamic application instance placement. We define application instance placement as the problem of placing application instances on a given set of server machines to adjust the amount of resources available to applications in response to varying resource demands of application clusters. The objective is to maximize the amount of demand that may be satisfied using a configured placement. To limit the disturbance to the system caused by starting and stopping application instances, the placement algorithm attempts to minimize the number of placement changes. It also strives to keep resource utilization balanced across all server machines. Two types of resources are managed, one load-dependent and one load-independent. When putting the chosen placement in effect our controller schedules placement changes in a manner that limits the disruption to the system.
