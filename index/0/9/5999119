Real time planning strategy is crucial for robots working in dynamic environments. In particular, robot grasping tasks require quick reactions in many applications such as human-robot interaction. In this paper, we propose an approach for grasp learning that enables robots to plan new grasps rapidly according to the object's position and orientation. This is achieved by taking a three-step approach. In the first step, we compute a variety of stable grasps for a given object. In the second step, we propose a strategy that learns a probability distribution of grasps based on the computed grasps. In the third step, we use the model to quickly generate grasps. We have tested the statistical method on the 9 degrees of freedom hand of the iCub humanoid robot and the 4 degrees of freedom Barrett hand. The average computation time for generating one grasp is less than 10 milliseconds. The experiments were run in Matlab on a machine with 2.8GHz processor.
