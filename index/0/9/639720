Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph, S be a subset of its vertices. The concept of the connectivity carcass of s has been introduced by the authors at STOCW; it provides a tool for studying k-edge-connectivity. In this paper we: (i) suggest and study a new type of graphs, locally orientable graphs, which generalize digraphs and provide a concise description of the connectivity carcass; (ii) introduce and study the cell structure of the carcass; (iii) suggest a new-, cell-oriented algorithm for the incremental maintenance of the carcass. The complexity for an arbitrary sequence of 21 edge insertions preserving the connectivity k of S is reducedfromO(IVI . IEJ + UCY(~, [VI)) to WEI + MY IVl>>, where s is the number of the (k + I)edge-connectivity classes in S.
