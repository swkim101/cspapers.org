In this demo, we present a novel interactive image search system, image search by 2D semantic map. This system enables users to indicate what semantic concepts are expected to appear and even how these concepts are spatially distributed in the desired images. To this end, we design an intuitive interface for users to formulate a query in the form of 2D semantic map, called concept map, by typing textual queries in a blank canvas. In the ranking process, by interpreting each textual concept as a set of representative visual instances, the concept map query is translated into a visual instance map, which is then used for comparison with the images in the database. Besides, in this demo, we also show an image search system with a simplest semantic map, a 2D color map, where the concepts are limited from the colors.
