Visual query systems have traditionally supported a set of pre-defined visual displays. We describe the Delaunay system, which supports visualizations of object-oriented databases specified by the user with a visual constraint-based query language. The highlights of our approach are the expressiveness of the visual query language, the efficiency of the query engine, and the overall flexibility and extensibility of the framework. The user interface is implemented using Java and is available on the WWW.
