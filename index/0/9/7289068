This paper deals with the problem of simulating the behavior of a mobile robot moving on a terrain along a precomputed nominal path. The nominal path is supposed to be provided by a planner. The purpose of the simulator to instantiate the nominal path into a complete trajectory, while verifying that a set of constraints is satisfied all along the motion. The simulator is based on an iterative algorithm to compute configurations for the robot at each time increment. Each iteration consists of two successive steps: determination of a stable configuration and of the associated contact points on the ground, and determination of the motion of all joints by minimization of the sliding at the contact points.
