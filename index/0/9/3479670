Currently, there is a push for integrating computer science education and computational thinking into the classroom. For example, major local and national organizations such as CS4ALL: NYC and Code.org aim to expose all students, including typically underrepresented groups, to computer science education nurturing students' intrinsic motivation. Furthermore, current research indicates that first-exposure to computer science is an important deciding factor as to whether students are open to computer science in future endeavors. Being one of the most diverse campuses in the nation, and a commuter campus, The State University of New York (SUNY) Old Westbury provides a unique opportunity to pilot how one might go about creating a motivating first exposure to computer science. Through a four point student-led strategy, we explore student pre-conceived attitudes towards computer science and programming to better understand what strategies might increase CS engagement. In order to do this, we host workshops revolving around creative computer science activities such as 3D game design and multimedia art projects. During these workshops, we collect pre and post questionnaires and use their data to gain insight into the Old Westbury student body's notions of computer science. Initial analyzed pre-survey data shows that 70% of students thought Computer Science was difficult. However, post-survey data shows that, after the experience, approximately 90% of students want to take additional workshops involving Computer Science.
