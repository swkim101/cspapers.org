A great quantity of information is required to support urban planning. Usually there are many (not integrated) data sources, originating from different government bodies, in distinct formats and variable properties (e.g. reliability, completeness). The effort to handle these data, integrate and analyze them is high, taking to much time for the information to be available to help decision making. We argue that data from location-based social networks (LBSN) could be used to provide useful information in reasonable time, despite several limitations they have. To asses this, as a case study, we used data from different LBSN to calculate the Local Availability Index (IOL) for a Brazilian city. This index is part of a methodology to estimate quality of urban life inside cities and is used to support urban planning. The results suggest that data from LBSN are useful and could be used to provide insights for local governments.
