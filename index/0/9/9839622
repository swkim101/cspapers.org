We define an inference system for modular strictness analysis of functional programs by extending a conjunctive strictness logic with polymorphic and conditional properties. This extended set of properties is used to define a syntax-directed, polymorphic strictness analysis based on polymorphic recursion whose soundness is established via a translation from the polymorphic system into the conjunctive system. From the polymorphic analysis, an inference algorithm based on constraint resolution is derived and shown complete for variant of the polymorphic analysis. The algorithm deduces at the same time a property and a set of hypotheses on the free variables of an expression which makes it suitable for analysis of program with module structure.
