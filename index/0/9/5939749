This paper examines a multi-stage retrieval architecture consisting of a candidate generation stage, a feature extraction stage, and a reranking stage using machine-learned models. Given a fixed set of features and a learning-to-rank model, we explore effectiveness/efficiency tradeoffs with three candidate generation approaches: postings intersection with SvS, conjunctive query evaluation with WAND, and disjunctive query evaluation with WAND. We find no significant differences in end-to-end effectiveness as measured by NDCG between conjunctive and disjunctive WAND, but conjunctive query evaluation is substantially faster. Postings intersection with SvS, while fast, yields substantially lower end-to-end effectiveness, suggesting that document and term frequencies remain important in the initial ranking stage. These findings show that conjunctive WAND is the best overall candidate generation strategy of those we examined.
