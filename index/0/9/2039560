A standard view of memory consolidation is that episodes are stored temporarily in the hippocampus, and are transferred to the neocortex through replay. Various recent experimental challenges to the idea of transfer, particularly for human memory, are forcing its re-evaluation. However, although there is independent neurophysiological evidence for replay, short of transfer, there are few theoretical ideas for what it might be doing. We suggest and demonstrate two important computational roles associated with neocortical indices.
