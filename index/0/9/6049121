This paper proposes methods for extracting loanwords from Cyrillic Mongolian corpora and producing a Japanese-Mongolian bilingual dictionary. We extract loanwords from Mongolian corpora using our own handcrafted rules. To complement the rule-based extraction, we also extract words in Mongolian corpora that are phonetically similar to Japanese Katakana words as loanwords. In addition, we correspond the extracted loanwords to Japanese words and produce a bilingual dictionary. We propose a stemming method for Mongolian to extract loanwords correctly. We verify the effectiveness of our methods experimentally.
