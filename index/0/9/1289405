Reliable precision grasping for unknown objects is a prerequisite for robots that work in the field of logistics, manufacturing and household tasks. The nature of this task requires a simultaneous solution of a mixture of sub-problems. These include estimating object properties, finding viable grasps and executing grasps without displacement. We propose to explicitly take perceptual uncertainty into account during grasp execution. The underlying object representation is a probabilistic signed distance field, which includes both signed distances to the surface and spatially interpretable variances. Based on this representation, we propose a two-stage grasp generation method, which is specifically designed for generating precision grasps. In order to evaluate the whole approach, we perform extensive real world grasping experiments on a set of hard-to-grasp objects. Our approach achieves 78% success rate and shows robustness to the placement orientation.
