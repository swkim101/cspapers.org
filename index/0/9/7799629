Garbled RAM, introduced by Lu and Ostrovsky, enables the task of garbling a RAM (Random Access Machine) program directly, there by avoiding the inefficient process of first converting it into a circuit. Garbled RAM can be seen as a RAM analogue of Yao's garbled circuit construction, except that known realizations of Garbled RAM make non-black-box use of the underlying cryptographic primitives. In this paper we remove this limitation and provide the first black-box construction of Garbled RAM with polylogarithmic overhead. Our scheme allows for garbling multiple RAM programs being executed on a persistent database and its security is based only on the existence of one-way functions. We also obtain the first secure RAM computation protocol that is both constant round and makes only black-box use of one-way functions in the Oblivious Transfer hybrid model.
