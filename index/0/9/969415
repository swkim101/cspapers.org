SPADES is a specification system consisting of a method, a language, and a set of tools. These components are based on a set of concepts, which forms its abstract kernel. SPADES supports the specification of software systems, in particular of real time software. The system to be developed is modelled using the Entity-Relationship-concept. While this seems to be the best way for storing specifications in a computer, it does not automatically lead to representations equally comfortable for humans. This is why SPADES, which has been available for some time, has recently been extended by a graphical interface. This paper gives a brief survey of the system, in particular of its new component.
