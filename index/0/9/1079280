A MATLAB toolbox for analysis and design of sampled-data feedback control systems is developed. The package is an object-oriented library: several classes are defined for concerning systems and signals including sampled-data systems. Functions and operators are overloaded in the class definitions. Moreover, the implementation of analysis and design algorithms for sampled-data systems is also in an object-oriented fashion. Hence the implemented codes keeps high readability even for a general setting of sampled-data systems including multirate and delayed control/measurement cases, by using the class for systems with two point boundary conditions developed as a part of this library
