Data mining research typically assumes that the data to be analyzed has been identified, gathered, cleaned, and processed into a convenient form. While data mining tools greatly enhance the ability of the analyst to make data-driven discoveries, most of the time spent in performing an analysis is spent in data identification, gathering, cleaning and processing the data. Similarly, schema mapping tools have been developed to help automate the task of using legacy or federated data sources for a new purpose, but assume that the structure of the data sources is well understood. However the data sets to be federated may come from dozens of databases containing thousands of tables and tens of thousands of fields, with little reliable documentation about primary keys or foreign keys.We are developing a system, Bellman, which performs data mining on the structure of the database. In this paper, we present techniques for quickly identifying which fields have similar values, identifying join paths, estimating join directions and sizes, and identifying structures in the database. The results of the database structure mining allow the analyst to make sense of the database content. This information can be used to e.g., prepare data for data mining, find foreign key joins for schema mapping, or identify steps to be taken to prevent the database from collapsing under the weight of its complexity.
