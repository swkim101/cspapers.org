We build on recent fast and accurate 3-D reconstruction techniques to segment objects during scene reconstruction. We take object outline information from change detection to build 3-D models of rigid objects and represent the scene as static and dynamic components. Object models are updated online during mapping, and can integrate segmentation information from sources other than change detection.
