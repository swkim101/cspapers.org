The simplicity of the rules belies the complexity of the game. This paper describes our program, Rolling Stone, a rst attempt to solve Sokoban problems. Adapting and extending the standard single-agent search techniques in the literature, we are able to optimally solve 12 of 90 problems from a standard test suite. This result demonstrates how di cult a game Sokoban really is for computers to solve, and underlines the need for more sophisticated search techniques, including planning.
