Generating query-biased summaries can take up a large part of the response time of interactive information retrieval (IIR) systems. This paper proposes to use document titles as an alternative to queries in the generation of summaries. The use of document titles allows us to pre-generate summaries statically, and thus, improve the response speed of IIR systems. Our experiments suggest that title-biased summaries are a promising alternative to query-biased summaries.
