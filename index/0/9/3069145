<italic>We can perform a N-point FFT with time performance T=&Ogr;(log N) and area-time performance AT<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>=&Ogr;(N log<supscrpt>4</supscrpt> N), by using the 3-dimensional VLSI system which is optically interconnected. This performance exceeds the theoretical lower bound of the area-time performance (N<supscrpt>2</supscrpt> log<supscrpt>2</supscrpt> N) of the conventional VLSI.</italic>
