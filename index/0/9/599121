This paper reports on the development of a computational theory of discourse. The theory is based on the thesis that discourse structure is a composite of three structures the structure of the sequence of utterances, the structure of intentions conveyed, and the attentional state. The distinction among these components is essential to provide adequate explanations of such discourse phenomena as clue words, referring expressions and interruptions. We illustrate the use of the theory for four types of interruptions and discuss aspects of interruptions previously overlooked.
