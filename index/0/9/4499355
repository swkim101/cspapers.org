Deploying a classifier to large-scale systems such as the web requires careful feature design and performance evaluation. Evaluation is particularly challenging because these large collections frequently change. In this paper we adapt stratified sampling techniques to evaluate the precision of classifiers deployed in large-scale systems. We investigate different types of stratification strategies, and then we derive a new online sampling algorithm that incrementally approximates the theoretical optimal disproportionate sampling strategy. In experiments, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms both simple random sampling as well as other types of stratified sampling, with an average reduction of about 20% in labeling effort to reach the same confidence and interval-bounds on precision
