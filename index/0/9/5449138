Authentication of smart objects is a major challenge for the Internet of Things (IoT), and has been left open in DTLS. Leveraging locally managed IPv6 addresses with identity-based cryptography (IBC), we propose an efficient end-to-end authentication that (a) assigns a robust and deployment-friendly federation scheme to gateways of IoT subnetworks, and (b) has been evaluated with a modern twisted Edwards elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Our early results demonstrate feasibility and promise efficiency after ongoing optimizations.
