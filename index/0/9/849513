In 1964, an article appeared in Product Engineering with the challenging title, “Are You Ready For Computer-Aided Design?” In this article, the author suggested that computers might become “design assistants” in each of the five design functions of mathematics, analysis checking, logic and graphics. Expanding on each of these functions briefly, typical mathematical problems cited were the solution of multiple sets of simultaneous equations occurring in stress, least squares, or circuit analysis. As the author, Mr. Holstein stated, however, most engineering problems do not lend themselves to straightforward computation. For this larger second category, the design engineer must develop an analytical solution which can both approximate the actual problem and can also be computed. Once the design emerges, it must be converted into engineering sketches which are both reproducible, yet easily modified as the inevitable revision cycle assumes control. Today, however, let us place particular emphasis upon the remaining design functions, the two areas of design logic and graphics.
