SenseClusters is a freely available system that clusters similar contexts. It can be applied to a wide range of problems, although here we focus on word sense and name discrimination. It supports several different measures for automatically determining the number of clusters in which a collection of contexts should be grouped. These can be used to discover the number of senses in which a word is used in a large corpus of text, or the number of entities that share the same name. There are three measures based on clustering criterion functions, and another on the Gap Statistic.
