The conventional storage allocation scheme for block structured languages requires the allocation of stack space and the building of a display with each procedure call. This paper describes a technique for analyzing the call graph of a program in a block structured language that makes it possible to eliminate these operations from many call sequences, even in the presence of recursion.
