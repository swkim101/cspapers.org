Hard real time systems require absolute guarantees in their execution times. Worst case execution time (WCET) of a program has therefore become an important problem to address. However, performance enhancing features of a processor (e.g. cache) make WCET analysis a difficult problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of combining abstract interpretation and model checking for different varieties of cache analysis ranging from single to multi-core platforms. Our modeling is used to develop a precise yet scalable timing analysis method on top of the Chronos WCET analysis tool. Experimental results demonstrate that we can obtain significant improvement in precision with reasonable analysis time overhead.
