Sensor nodes are typically battery powered and operate in unattended environments. Minimizing the energy consumption of sensor nodes is, therefore, important to prolong the network life time. Since the radio is a main energy consumer, most of the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have focused on energy efficiency. With widespread use of sensor network applications, network bandwidth required by the applications tends to increase and even multiple applications may run in a sensor node. For these reasons, maximizing the bandwidth of WSNs has become a major consideration in MAC design.
