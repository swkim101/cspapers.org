Data sparsity is one of the biggest problems faced by collaborative filtering used in recommender systems. Data imputation alleviates the data sparsity problem by inferring missing ratings and imputing them to the original rating matrix. In this paper, we identify the limitations of existing data imputation approaches and suggest three new claims that all data imputation approaches should follow to achieve high recommendation accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a deep-learning based approach to compute imputed values that satisfies all three claims. Based on our hypothesis that most pre-use preferences (e.g., impressions) on items lead to their post-use preferences (e.g., ratings), our approach tries to understand via deep learning how pre-use preferences lead to post-use preferences differently depending on the characteristics of users and items. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we verify our three claims and hypothesis, and also demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.
