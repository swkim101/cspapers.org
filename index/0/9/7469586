This paper studies the Tensor Robust Principal Component (TRPCA) problem which extends the known Robust PCA [4] to the tensor case. Our model is based on a new tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) [14] and its induced tensor tubal rank and tensor nuclear norm. Consider that we have a 3-way tensor X ε R<sup>n1×n2×n3</sup> such that X = L<sub>0</sub> + S<sub>0</sub>, where L<sub>0</sub> has low tubal rank and <sub>S0 is</sub> sparse. Is that possible to recover both components? In this work, we prove that under certain suitable assumptions, we can recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by simply solving a convex program whose objective is a weighted combination of the tensor nuclear norm and the l1-norm, i.e., min L, E ||L||* + λ||ε||1, s.t. X = L + ε, where λ = 1/√max(n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>)n<sub>3</sub>. Interestingly, TRPCA involves RPCA as a special case when n<sub>3</sub> = 1 and thus it is a simple and elegant tensor extension of RPCA. Also numerical experiments verify our theory and the application for the image denoising demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.
