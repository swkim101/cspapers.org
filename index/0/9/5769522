A system is described which can generate programs for machine vision systems whicji have to measure a number of parameters of an industrial object in a camera image. Programs are generated starting from descriptive object models. The object models used are context-free attribute grammars, hence the generated programs are parsers. Errors in generated programs, caused by using inaccurate models, are screened by comparing the measurements produced by generated programs with values of the desired parameters provided for example images.
