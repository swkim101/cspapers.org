Chapter 3 in Geometric Computations* Kurt Mehlhornt S tefan Schirrat The main goal of this paper is to argue against the belief that perturbation is a “theoretical paradise” and to put forward the claim that it is simpler (in terms of programming effort) and more efficient (in terms of running time) to avoid the perturbation technique and to deal directly with degenerate inputs. We substantiate our claim on two basic problems in computational geometry, the line segment intersection problem and the convex hull problem.
