As more aspects of social interaction are digitally recorded, there is a growing need to develop privacy-preserving data analysis methods. Social scientists will be more likely to adopt these methods if doing so entails minimal change to their current methodology. Toward that end, we present a general and modular method for privatizing Bayesian inference for Poisson factorization, a broad class of models that contains some of the most widely used models in the social sciences. Our method satisfies local differential privacy, which ensures that no single centralized server need ever store the non-privatized data. To formulate our local-privacy guarantees, we introduce and focus on limited-precision local privacy---the local privacy analog of limited-precision differential privacy (Flood et al., 2013). We present two case studies, one involving social networks and one involving text corpora, that test our method's ability to form the posterior distribution over latent variables under different levels of noise, and demonstrate our method's utility over a na\"{i}ve approach, wherein inference proceeds as usual, treating the privatized data as if it were not privatized.
