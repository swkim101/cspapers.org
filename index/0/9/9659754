Reconstruction Sibling Relationships is an important problem with applications in conservational biology. A number of methods have been proposed for this problem, and biologists today find it challenging to consolidate different reconstructions into one solution. Towards this end, consensus based methodology has been proposed recently to combine different results. In this paper we study the use of different consensus techniques, including strict consensus, voting consensus, majority consensus, to realize a single solution. We also discuss the relative merits of different consensus techniques and extend their use to data sets with genotyping errors. We explain the implications of Mirkinâ€™s impossibility results in context of the siblings reconstruction problem.
