In this paper we present a thorough evaluation of a corpus resource for Portuguese, CETEMPublico, a 180-million word newspaper corpus free for R&D in Portuguese processing. We provide information that should be useful to those using the resource, and to considerable improvement for later versions. In addition, we think that the procedures presented can be of interest for the larger NLP community, since corpus evaluation and description is unfortunately not a common exercise.
