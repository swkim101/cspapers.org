We propose a framework for learning biped locomotion using dynamical movement primitives based on nonlinear oscillators. In our previous work, we suggested dynamical movement primitives as a central pattern generator (CPG) to learn biped locomotion from demonstration. We introduced an adaptation algorithm for the frequency of the oscillators based on phase resetting at the instance of heel strike and entrainment between the phase oscillator and mechanical system using feedback from the environment. In this paper, we empirically explore the role of phase resetting in the proposed algorithm for robust biped locomotion. We demonstrate that phase resetting contributes to robustness against external perturbations and environmental changes by numerical simulations and experiments with a physical biped robot.
