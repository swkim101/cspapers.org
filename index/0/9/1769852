This work presents a functional assessment of the Vanderbilt Multigrasp Hand prosthesis and Multigrasp Myoelectric Control method which the authors have previously described. In the study, a transradial amputee utilized the prosthetic system to perform the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP), which involves manipulation tasks designed to simulate the activities of daily living. The results of the study indicate 81% restoration of typical hand function and compare favorably to recently published SHAP results for commercially available single-grasp and multigrasp prosthetic hands. A video of the assessment is included as supplementary material.
