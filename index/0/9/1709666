We investigate using the PARADISE framework to develop predictive models of system performance in our spoken dialogue tutoring system. We represent performance with two metrics: user satisfaction and student learning. We train and test predictive models of these metrics in our tutoring system corpora. We predict user satisfaction with 2 parameter types: 1) system-generic, and 2) tutoring-specific. To predict student learning, we also use a third type: 3) user affect. Although generic parameters are useful predictors of user satisfaction in other PARADISE applications, overall our parameters produce less useful user satisfaction models in our system. However, generic and tutoring-specific parameters do produce useful models of student learning in our system. User affect parameters can increase the usefulness of these models.
