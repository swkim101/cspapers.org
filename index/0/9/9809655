This paper describes a navigation system that allowed a robot to complete 26.2 miles of autonomous navigation in a real office environment. We present the methods required to achieve this level of robustness, including an efficient Voxel-based 3D mapping algorithm that explicitly models unknown space. We also provide an open-source implementation of the algorithms used, as well as simulated environments in which our results can be verified.
