We discuss the art of applying theory to practice. In particular, we discuss in detail our interactions with two research projects at IBM Almaden: the Garlic project, which built a multimedia database system on top of various existing systems, and the Clio project, which developed tools for converting data from one format to another. We discuss the problems we resolved, and the impact this had both on the Garlic or Clio systems and on the broader scientific community. We draw morals from these interactions, including why theoreticians do better theory by working with system builders, and why system builders build better systems by working with theoreticians. We present the remarkably simple Threshold Algorithm, which is optimal in an extremely strong sense: optimal not just in the worst case, or in the average case, but in every case! The Threshold Algorithm and its variants have applications to numerous areas, including information retrieval, fuzzy and uncertain databases, group recommendation systems, and the semantic web .
