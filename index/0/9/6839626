A method of reducing the perceived latency of touch input by employing a model to predict touch events before the finger reaches the touch surface is proposed. A corpus of 3D finger movement data was collected, and used to develop a model capable of three granularities at different phases of movement: initial direction, final touch location, time of touchdown. The model is validated for target distances >= 25.5cm, and demonstrated to have a mean accuracy of 1.05cm 128ms before the user touches the screen. Preference study of different levels of latency reveals a strong preference for unperceived latency touchdown feedback. A form of 'soft' feedback, as well as other uses for this prediction to improve performance, is proposed.
