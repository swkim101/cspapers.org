Embedded systems are an integral part of almost every electronic product today. From consumer electronics to industrial components in SCADA systems, their possible fields of application are manifold. While especially in industrial and critical infrastructures the security requirements are high, recent publications have shown that embedded systems do not cope well with this demand. One of the reasons is that embedded systems are being less scrutinized as embedded security analysis is considered to be more time consuming and challenging in comparison to PC systems. One of the key challenges on proprietary, resource constrained embedded devices is dynamic code analysis. The devices typically do not have the capabilities for a full-scale dynamic security evaluation. Likewise, the analyst cannot execute the software implementation inside a virtual machine due to the missing peripheral hardware that is required by the software to run. In this paper, we present PROSPECT, a system that can overcome these shortcomings and enables dynamic code analysis of embedded binary code inside arbitrary analysis environments. By transparently forwarding peripheral hardware accesses from the original host system into a virtual machine, PROSPECT allows security analysts to run the embedded software implementation without the need to know which and how embedded peripheral hardware components are accessed. We evaluated PROSPECT with respect to the performance impact and conducted a case study by doing a full-scale security audit of a widely used commercial fire alarm system in the building automation domain. Our results show that PROSPECT is both practical and usable for real-world application.
