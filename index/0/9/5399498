A summary of the work, aimed to reformulate analytically the theory of intelligent machines is presented. The functions of an Intelligent Machines are executed by Intelligent Controls. The Principle of Increasing Precision with Decreasing Intelligence is used to form a hierarchical structure of the control systems. Distributed Intelligence in compatible with such a structure when it is used for teams of intelligent machines or cooperating coordinators within the machine. The three levels of the Intelligent Control, e.g. the Organization, Coordination and Execution Levels are described as originally conceived. New designs as Neural-nets for the organization level and Petri- nets for the coordination level are proposed. Application to Intelligent Robots for space exploration are suggested.
