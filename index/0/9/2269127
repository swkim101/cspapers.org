We present a method for describing arbitrary human posture as a combination of basic postures. This decomposition allows for recognition of a larger number of postures and gestures from a small set of elementary postures called atoms. We propose a modified version of the matching pursuit algorithm for decomposing an arbitrary input posture into a linear combination of primary and secondary atoms. These atoms are represented through their shape descriptor inferred from the 3D visual-hull of the human body posture. Using an atom-based description of postures increases tremendously the set of recognizable postures while reducing the required training data set. A gesture recognition system based on the atom decomposition and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is also described. Instead of representing gestures as HMM transition of postures, we separate the description of gestures as two HMMs, each describing the transition of Primary/Secondary atoms; thus greatly reducing the size of state space of HMM. We illustrate the proposed approach for posture and gesture recognition method on a set of video streams
