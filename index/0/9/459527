In system identification both the input and the output of a system are available to an observer and an algorithm is sought to identify parameters of a hypothesized model of that system. Here we present a novel formal methodology for identifying dendritic processing in a neural circuit consisting of a linear dendritic processing filter in cascade with a spiking neuron model. The input to the circuit is an analog signal that belongs to the space of bandlimited functions. The output is a time sequence associated with the spike train. We derive an algorithm for identification of the dendritic processing filter and reconstruct its kernel with arbitrary precision.
