The amount of information available on the Web has been increasing daily. However, how one might know what is right or wrong? Does the Web itself can be used as a source for verification of information? NELL (Never-Ending Language Learner) is a computer system that gathers knowledge from Web. Prophet is a link prediction component on NELL that has been successfully used to help populate its knowledge database. However, during link prediction task performance Prophet classify some edges as misplaced edges, that is, edges that we can not assure if they are right or not. In this paper we use the Web itself, using question answer (QA) systems, as a Prophet extension to validate these edges. This is an important issue when working with a self-supervised system where inserted errors might be propagate and generate dangerous concept drifting.
