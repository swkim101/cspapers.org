The well-known periodic task model of Liu and Layland (1973) assumes a worst-case execution time bound for every task and may be too pessimistic if the worst-case execution time of a task is much longer than the average. We give a multiframe real-time task model which allows the execution time of a task to vary from one instance to another by specifying the execution time of a task in terms of a sequence of numbers. We investigate the schedulability problem for this model for the preemptive fixed priority scheduling policy. We show that a significant improvement in the utilization bound can be established in our model.
