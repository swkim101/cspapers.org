Security and privacy in smartphones and mobile devices is an emerging area which has received significant attention from the research community during the past few years. The SPSM workshop was created to bring together these researchers and practitioners. Following the success of the three previous editions, we present this fourth edition of the workshop which has attracted a significant number of great submissions and benefited from the expertise of an international program committee comprising of mobile security experts across the academia and the industry.
