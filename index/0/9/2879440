During the 1970s, there was a steady decline in the cost and size of computing hardware with a corresponding phenomenal growth in computing capability. Computers now help store, manage, duplicate and interpret vast quantities of data with an ease and relative economy undreamed of in the past. These developments have, over the years, fostered the growth of new research methods in a variety of fields, including the social sciences. Large and more complex bodies of quantitative data have been collected as social scientists seek ways to understand human behavior with empirical research methods and scientific sampling techniques. In addition to collecting their own data, researchers have also utilized vast amounts of machine-readable data that have been prepared by other researchers, governmental agencies, and private organizations.The changes in the computing industry combined with the increased demand for services have made it feasible for organizations to consider automating as many tasks as possible. FAST (Facility to Aid Servicing Transactions) is one system that was created in response to these conditions. This paper describes FAST and its impact on the organization which developed it.
