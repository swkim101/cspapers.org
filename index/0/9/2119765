We propose an algorithm, that extends our previous work, to estimate the current configuration of a non-rigid object using energy minimization and graph cuts. Our approach removes the need for feature correspondence or texture information and extends the boundary energy term. The object segmentation process is improved by using graph cuts along with a skin detector. We introduce an automatic mesh generator that provides a triangular mesh encapsulating the entire non-rigid object without predefined values. Our approach also handles in-plane rotation by reinitializing the mesh after data has been lost in the image sequence. Results display the proposed algorithm over a dataset consisting of seven shirts, two pairs of shorts, two posters, and a pair of pants.
