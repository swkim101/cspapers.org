Elderly people have particular needs in performing bathing activities, since these tasks require body flexibility. Our aim is to build an assistive robotic bath system, in order to increase the independence and safety of this procedure. Towards this end, the expertise of professional carers for bathing sequences and appropriate motions has to be adopted, in order to achieve natural, physical human â€” robot interaction. In this paper, a real-time end-effector motion planning method for an assistive bath robot, using on-line Point-Cloud information, is proposed. The visual feedback obtained from Kinect depth sensor is employed to adapt suitable washing paths to the user's body part motion and deformable surface. We make use of a navigation function-based controller, with guarantied globally uniformly asymptotic stability, and bijective transformations for the adaptation of the paths. Experiments were conducted with a rigid rectangular object for validation purposes, while a female subject took part to the experiment in order to evaluate and demonstrate the basic concepts of the proposed methodology.
