The main objective of the DataMine is to provide application development interface to develop knowledge discovery applications on the top of large databases. Current database systems have been designed mainly to support business applications. The success of SQL capitalized on a small number of primitives which are sufficient to support a vast majority of applications today. Unfortunately this is not enough to capture the emerging family of new applications dealing with the so called rule and knowledge discovery. The goal of the DataMine and our work is to make the next step in the development of DBMS and provide much needed support for the rule discovery applications.
