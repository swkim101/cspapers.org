The paper proposes a methodology for dealing with multiword expressions in natural language processing applications. It provides a practically justified taxonomy of such units, and suggests the ways in which the individual classes can be processed computationally. While the study is currently limited to Polish and English, we believe our findings can be successfully employed in the processing of other languages, with emphasis on inflectional ones.
