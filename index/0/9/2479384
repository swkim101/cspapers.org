The subspace approximation problem Subspace(<i>k, p</i>) asks for a <i>k</i> dimensional linear subspace that fits a given set of <i>m</i> points in R<sup><i>n</i></sup> optimally. The error for fitting is a generalization of the least squares fit and uses the <i>l</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> norm of the distances (<i>l</i><sub>2</sub> distances) of the points from the subspace, e.g., <i>p</i> = ∞ means minimizing the <i>l</i><sub>2</sub> distance of the farthest point from the subspace. Previous work on subspace approximation considers either the case of small or constant <i>k</i> and <i>p</i> [27, 11, 14] or the case of <i>p</i> = ∞ [16, 8, 17, 7, 24, 23, 29].
