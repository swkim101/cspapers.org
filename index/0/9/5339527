A web mashup is a web application that integrates content from different providers to create a new service, not offered by the content providers. As mashups grow in popularity, the problem of securing information flow between mashup components becomes increasingly important. This paper presents a security lattice-based approach to mashup security, where the origins of the different components of the mashup are used as levels in the security lattice. Declassification allows controlled information release between the components. We formalize a notion of composite delimited release policy and provide considerations for practical (static as well as runtime) enforcement of mashup information-flow security policies in a web browser.
