Starting from more then ten years of experience and achievements in online cultural content, the panel aims to provide a comprehensive view on controversial issues, or unsolved problems, both in the WWW and Cultural community to stimulate lively, thoughtful, and sometimes provocative discussions. Panelists will outline the relevance of digital collections of intangible heritage and endangered archives and discuss the following topics: the "global" Web vs. the preservation of "local" cultural identities, cultural diversities and their relevance in delivering web based services, preservation & future of digital memories, Web-based development and sustainability models. We expect the panelists to actively engage the audience and help them broaden their understanding of the issues. URL:
