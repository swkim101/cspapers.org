Discovering the location of the mobile nodes carried by people is important issue for many sensor applications. Several localization techniques have been proposed, but human mobility patterns and collaboration between mobile nodes have been seldom considered. In this paper, we propose a mobile node localization system based on collaboration and route information that characterizes human mobility. To validate the feasibility of our approach, the proposed system is implemented and experiments are conducted on real routes and to evaluate various scenarios, simulation experiment was also conducted.
