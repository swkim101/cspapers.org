The computer science community has had a growing research focus in Privacy over the last decade. Much of this has really focused on confidentiality: Anonymization, computing on encrypted data, access control policy, etc. This talk will look at a variety of research results in this area, including "weaker" approaches than the absolutes typically considered in the security community, and how they all come down to the same basic concept of providing confidentiality. Privacy is much more complex. People are often willing to allow use of their data -- but not just for anything. This talk will look at such other privacy issues, such as harm to individuals and society from the fear of disclosure or misuse of private data. The talk will conclude with ideas for new research directions in privacy.
