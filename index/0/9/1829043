This paper examines the extent to which verb diathesis alternations are empirically attested in corpus data. We automatically acquire alternating verbs from large balanced corpora by using partialparsing methods and taxonomic information, and discuss how corpus data can be used to quantify linguistic generalizations. We estimate the productivity of an alternation and the typicality of its members using type and token frequencies.
