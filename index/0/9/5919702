This paper presents a methodology for treating energy consistency when considering multiple simultaneous impacts and contacts with friction in the simulation of systems of multiple interconnected bodies. Hard impact and contact is considered where deformation of the impacting surfaces is negligible. The proposed approach uses a discrete algebraic model of impact in conjunction with moment and tangential co-efficients of restitution (CORs) to develop a general impact law for determining post-impact velocities. This process depends on impulse-momentum theory, complementarity conditions, a principle of maximum dissipation, and the determination of contact forces. The proposed methodology also uses an energy-modifying COR to directly control the system's energy. The approach is illustrated on a bicycle-like structure.
