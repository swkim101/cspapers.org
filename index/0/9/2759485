Conventional scan design imposes considerable area and delay overhead by using larger scan flip-flops and additional scan wires without utilizing the functionality of the combinational logic. We propose a novel low-overhead scan design methodology, called cost-free scan, which exploits the controllability of primary inputs to establish scan paths through the combinational logic. The methodology aims at reducing scan overhead by (1) analyzing the circuit to determine all the cost-free scan flip-flops, and (2) selecting the best primary input vector to establish the maximum number of cost-free scan flip-flops on the scan chain. Significant reduction in the scan overhead is achieved on ISCAS89 benchmarks, where in full scan environment, as many as 89% of the total flip-flops are found cost-free scannable, while in partial scan environment, reduction can be as high as 97% in scan flip-flops needed to break sequential loops.
