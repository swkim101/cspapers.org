The Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm is having a substantial impact on the way software systems are developed. Although significant progress is being made in several fronts, there are not a set of clear, central themes to focus research activity. As a result, there is a danger that important research needs will be overlooked, while other efforts will focus on issues of peripheral long-term significance in practice. The objective of this workshop is to begin developing a long-term community-wide research agenda for the successful development of SOA-based systems. A tentative taxonomy of research issues will be presented, as well as papers that focus on specific parts of the taxonomy. Through an interactive workshop format, researchers will collaboratively identify open research issues and develop a draft research agenda for the community.
