The class of Gupta-Kumar results, which predict the throughput capacity in wireless networks, is restricted to asymptotic regimes. This tutorial presents a methodology to address a corresponding non-asymptotic analysis based on the framework of the stochastic network calculus, in a rigorous mathematical manner. In particular, we derive explicit closed-form results on the distribution of the end-to-end capacity and delay, for a fixed source-destination pair, in a network with broad assumptions on its topology and degree of spatial correlations. The results are non-asymptotic in that they hold for finite time scales and network sizes, as well as bursty arrivals. The generality of the results enables the research of several interesting problems, concerning for instance the effects of time scales or randomness in topology on the network capacity.
