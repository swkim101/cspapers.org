We propose a disk-type I/O interface, IODisk, which helps users browse various digital contents intuitively in their living environment. IODisk mainly consists of a forcefeedback mechanism integrated in the rotation axis of a disk. Users can control the playing speed/direction contents (e.g., videos or picture slideshows) in proportion to the rotational speed/direction of the disk. We developed a prototype system and some applications.
