Skyline is a set of points that are not dominated by any other point. Given uncertain objects, probabilistic skyline has been studied which computes objects with high probability of being skyline. While useful for selecting individual objects, it is not sufficient for scenarios where we wish to compute a subset of skyline objects, i.e., a skyline set. In this paper, we generalize the notion of probabilistic skyline to probabilistic k-skyline sets (Pk-SkylineSets) which computes k-object sets with high probability of being skyline set. We present an efficient algorithm for computing probabilistic k-skyline sets. It uses two heuristic pruning strategies and a novel data structure based on the classic layered range tree to compute the skyline set probability for each instance set with a worst-case time bound. The experimental results on the real NBA dataset and the synthetic datasets show that Pk-SkylineSets is interesting and useful, and our algorithms are efficient and scalable.
