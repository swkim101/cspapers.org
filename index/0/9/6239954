Users often make continued and sustained use of online resources to complement use of a desktop application. For example, users may reference online tutorials to recall how to perform a particular task. While often used in a coordinated fashion, the browser and desktop application provide separate, independent mechanisms for helping users find and re-find task-relevant information. In this paper, we describe InterTwine, a system that links information in the web browser with relevant elements in the desktop application to create interapplication information scent. This explicit link produces a shared interapplication history to assist in re-finding information in both applications. As an example, InterTwine marks all menu items in the desktop application that are currently mentioned in the front-most web page. This paper introduces the notion of interapplication information scent, demonstrates the concept in InterTwine, and describes results from a formative study suggesting the utility of the concept.
