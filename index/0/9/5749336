We present an information extraction system that decouples the tasks of finding relevant regions of text and applying extraction patterns. We create a self-trained relevant sentence classifier to identify relevant regions, and use a semantic affinity measure to automatically learn domain-relevant extraction patterns. We then distinguish primary patterns from secondary patterns and apply the patterns selectively in the relevant regions. The resulting IE system achieves good performance on the MUC-4 terrorism corpus and ProMed disease outbreak stories. This approach requires only a few seed extraction patterns and a collection of relevant and irrelevant documents for training.
