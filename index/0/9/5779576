This paper describes new interprocess communications facilities that have been added to the Locus system [POPEK 81][WALKER 83]. The facilities improve Locus's interprocess communication repertoire by providing distributed support for three separate subsystems from System V UNIX: messages, semaphores, and shared memory. Here we describe these subsystems and their integration into in the Locus architecture.
