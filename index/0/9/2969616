Transit advertising provides frequent exposure to a large number of residents in different urban regions. However, traditional methods are generally manual and qualitatively based on a rough estimation, such as the number of passengers taken by a bus or functional regions covered. How to accurately put an advertisement on appropriate transportations becomes an important task for potential business value. In this paper, our goal is to recommend top-k bus routes for an ad, which can maximize advertising effectiveness, by mining multiple data sources, such as Smart Card Transaction (SCT) data, geographic data and point of interests (POIs) data. We propose a framework that captures the mobility patterns of passengers and the characteristics of bus stations so as to evaluate the influence of an ad for the passengers quantitatively. Specifically, we first extract the passenger trajectories to model passenger mobility from SCT data and then model each bus station over three characteristics (i.e., hub degree, topic distribution, district region) by geographic data and nearby POIs. According to three characteristics of bus stations, we formulate three application scenarios and design the corresponding methods to make top-k bus routes recommendation. Extensive experiments on real-world public transportation data validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
