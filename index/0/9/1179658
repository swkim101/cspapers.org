While the usage of unit-testing frameworks such as JUnit has greatly increased over the last several years, it is not immediately apparent to students and instructors how to best use tools like JUnit and how to integrate testing across a computer science curriculum. We have worked over the last four semesters to infuse testing and JUnit across our curriculum, building from having students use JUnit to having them write their own test cases to building larger integration and use case testing systems to studying JUnit as an example of good application of design patterns. We have found that, based on this increased presentation and structuring of the usage of JUnit and testing, students have an increased understanding and appreciation of the overall value of testing in software development.
