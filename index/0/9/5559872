We discuss technology to help a person monitor changes in news coverage over time. We define temporal summaries of news stories as extracting a single sentence from each event within a news topic, where the stories are presented one at a time and sentences from a story must be ranked before the next story can be considered. We explain a method for evaluation, and describe an evaluation corpus that we have built. We also propose several methods for constructing temporal summaries and evaluate their effectiveness in comparison to degenerate cases. We show that simple approaches are effective, but that the problem is far from solved.
