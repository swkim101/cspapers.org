We present an approach that builds upon previous developments in unmanned air vehicles and climbing robots and seeks to emulate the capabilities of bats, insects and certain birds that combine powered flight with the ability to land and perch on sloped and vertical surfaces. As it approaches a wall, the plane executes an intentional pitch-up maneuver to shed speed and present its feet for landing. On contact, a nonlinear suspension dissipates the remaining kinetic energy and directs interaction forces toward the feet to engage small asperities on surfaces such as brick or concrete. The focus of the work in this paper is on the controller used for sensing a wall and executing vertical landing and take-off procedures and on the mechanisms developed for spine engagement and disengagement.
