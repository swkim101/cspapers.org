We describe a transformational derivation system that semi-automatically derives a simplified version of Mycin's therapy selection algorithm. It uses general transformation rules to explicitly integrate the multiple, sometimes conflicting goals that govern the design of heuristic algorithms. The generality of its transformations is demonstrated by using them to derive a variation based on formulating and integrating the same design goals differently.
