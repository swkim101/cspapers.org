In this paper, we present a novel pose estimation and obstacle avoidance approach for tendon-driven multi-segment continuum manipulators moving in dynamic environments. A novel multi-stage implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter is used to estimate the pose of every point along the manipulator's body using only the position information of each segment tip. Combined with a potential field, the overall algorithm will guide the manipulator tip to a desired target location and, at the same time, keep the manipulator body safe from collisions with obstacles. The results show that the approach works well in a real-time simulation environment that contains moving obstacles in the vicinity of the manipulator.
