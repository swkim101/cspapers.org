This paper presents the identification of contact formations using force torque information. As force torque measurements do not map uniquely to their corresponding contact formations, three steps are performed: Initially, the wrench space for each contact formation is computed automatically. Then, a contact formation graph is augmented with a similarity index that reflects the similarity of contact formations with respect to their spanned wrench spaces. A particle filter is used to represent the likeliness of a contact formation given a force torque measurement. Finally, this probability distribution is resolved taking the similarity index, the transitions of the contact formation graph and the history of identified contact formations into account. This allows the recognition of the order of demonstrated contact formations by a measured set of forces and torques. The approach is verified by experiments.
