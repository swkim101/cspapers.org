We discuss the indexing of cases for use in precedent-based argument. Our focus is on how multiple, related indices into a case base of legal precedents are exploited by an argument-generation program called BankXX. This system's architecture and control scheme are rooted in a conceptualization of legal argument as heuristic search. Although our framing argument as search is not discussed in detail in this paper, we describe the main features of this view to provide context for a discussion of an indexing scheme that facilitates argument creation. We describe five inter-related index types--citation, prototypical story, factor, family resemblance, and legal theory indices-- and show how they can be used to access, view, widen, or filter a set of cases. The application domain is a U.S. Federal statute that governs the approval of bankruptcy plans.
