Attack graphs represent the ways in which an adversary can exploit vulnerabilities to break into a system. System administrators analyze these attack graphs to understand where their system's weaknesses lie and to help decide which security measures will be effective to deploy. In practice, attack graphs are produced manually by Red Teams. Construction by hand, however, is tedious, error-prone, and impractical for attack graphs larger than a hundred nodes. In this talk I present a technique, based on model checking, for generating attack graphs automatically. I also describe different analyses that system administrators can perform in trading off one security measure for another or in using attack graphs in intrusion detection. Work on generating attack graphs is joint with Somesh Jha and Oleg Sheyner; on analyzing them, joint with Oleg Sheyner and Oren Dobzinski.
