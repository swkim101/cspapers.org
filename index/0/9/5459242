Many robotic actuators must generate high torques and accelerations. Exterior-rotor brushless motors seem better suited for these tasks than conventional interior-rotor brushless motors. Models of these two motor types were used to calculate benchmarks and evaluate motor performance in simulated tasks for different motor geometries. Exterior-rotor motors had higher motor constants and efficiency, but lower rated power compared with interior-rotor motors. They required less energy to perform typical robotic tasks. Four exterior-rotor motors were fabricated and compared with manufacturing data from the best existing brushless DC motors. The exterior-rotor motors had more than a 250% increase in stall torque density compared with the best known brushless DC motor (RoboDrive) and more than a 740% increase in stall torque density compared with more common motors such as those produced by MicroMo and Maxon. These exterior-rotor motors appear promising for robotic applications.
