HypTrails is a bayesian approach for comparing different hypotheses about human trails on the web. While a standard implementation exists, it exposes performance issues when working with large-scale data. In this paper, we propose a distributed implementation of HypTrails based on Apache Spark taking advantage of several structural properties inherent to HypTrails. The performance improves substantially. Our implementation is publicly available.
