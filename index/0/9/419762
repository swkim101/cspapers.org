We present a simple, prepackaged solution to generating paraphrases of English sentences. We use the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) for monolingual sentence rewriting and provide machine translation language packs: prepack-aged, tuned models that can be downloaded and used to generate paraphrases on a standard Unix environment. The language packs can be treated as a black box or customized to spe-ciÔ¨Åc tasks. In this demonstration, we will explain how to use the included interactive web-based tool to generate sentential paraphrases.
