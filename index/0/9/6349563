A structured method is described for the analysis of interactions to identify situations where hidden information may exist and where non-speech sound might be used to overcome the associated problems. Interactions are considered in terms of events, status and modes to find any hidden information. This is then categorised in terms of the feedback needed to present it. An auditory-enhanced scrollbar, based on the method described, was then experimentally tested. Timing and error rates were used along with subjective measures of workload. Results from the experiment show a significant reduction in time to complete one task, a decrease in the mental effort required and an overall preference for the auditory-enhanced scrollbar.
