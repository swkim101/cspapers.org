This class of methods comes with strong performance guarantees, and enables planning to be performed in an induced finite (pseudo-)MDP, which approximates the MDP, but can be solved exactly using dynamic programming. Two drawbacks of existing methods exist: firstly, the size of the induced finite (pseudo-)MDP scales quadratically with the amount of data used to learn the model, costing much memory and time when planning with the learned model; secondly, learning the CME itself using powerful kernel least-squares is costly â€“ a second computational bottleneck. We present an algorithm which maintains a rich kernelized CME model class, but solves both problems: firstly we demonstrate that the loss function for the CME model suggests a principled approach to compressing the induced (pseudo-)MDP, leading to faster planning, while maintaining guarantees; secondly we propose to learn the CME model itself using fast sparse-greedy kernel regression well-suited to the RL context. We demonstrate superior performance to existing methods in this class of modelbased approaches on a range of MDPs.
