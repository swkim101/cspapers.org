The paper characterizes natural language inferencing in the TIBAQ method of question-answering, focussing on three aspects: (i) specification of the structures on which the inference rules operate, (ii) Classification of the rules that have been formulated and implemented up to now, according to the kind of modification of the input structure the rules invoke, and (iii) discussion of some points in which a properly designed inference procedure may help the search of the answer, and vice versa.
