This paper describes an object-oriented system that is designed to provide access to databases and high-performance computing systems to process images and other objects found in the databases. The system features a Web-based front-end and CORBA middleware to provide convenient access and management of services. The Kerberos authentication system is used for security to avoid IP address-based approaches that restrict user mobility.
