Abstract : Document describes a vision system which uses a semantic network model and a distributed control structure to accomplish the image analysis process. The system is an attempt to bring together many current ideas in artificial intelligence and vision programming and thereby to cast some light on fundamental problems of computer perception. The semantic network facilities the interplay between geometric and other relational constraints which are used to direct and limit search.
