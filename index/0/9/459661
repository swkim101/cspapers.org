META4 is an object oriented language with first order reasoning capability that also includes reasoning about the change that the classes go through over time, efficient partial evaluation via runtime propagation of specific values, explicit run-time code generation via a source code to machine code compiling engine - not an interpreter.
Coupled with a strong encapsulation principle and certain reasonable language restrictions and programmer supplied annotations, META4 allows all parts of the program, including the compiler itself to be extended and specialized over time. Therefore, META4 is mutable. We introduce the concept of run-time grammar extension, an elegant and powerful facility for custom-programming of new language semantics at the grammar level. In other words, its semantics and grammar can be extended or even modified, even at run time to solve specific problems.
