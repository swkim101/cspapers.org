In this paper, we study whether the need for efficient XML publishing brings any new requirements for relational query engines, or if sorting query results in the relational engine and tagging them in middleware is sufficient. We observe that the mismatch between the XML data model and the relational model requires relational engines to be enhanced for efficiency. Specifically, they need to support relation valued variables. We discuss how such support can be provided through the addition of an operator, GApply, with minimal extensions to existing relational engines. We discuss how the operator may be exposed in SQL syntax and provide a comprehensive study of optimization rules that govern this operator. We report the results of a preliminary performance evaluation showing the speedup obtained through our approach and the effectiveness of our optimization rules.
