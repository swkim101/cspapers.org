Objectivity/DB has delivered to production use a fully distributed objeet DBMS architecture, where full distribution includes distribution of data and control, as deseribed here, Distribution of data allows objects to reside and execute anywhere on the network, and to be used anywhere on the network, transparently, by users and applications that need not be aware of the objeetâ€™s actual location, and without any server bottleneck. This includes any mixture of heterogeneous platforms and operating systems (ffom among those currently supported), with creation, use, sharing, and storage of objeets on any platform and environment, regardless of byte ordering, floating point formatting, dala alignment, etc. Distribution of control allows users and applications to access multiple databases in a federated database. Each database is under separate administrative control, with its owner deciding when to shut it down, control aemss, etc., yet all database services are transparently available across databases, including inter-object associations, transactions, composite objects with propagating methods spanning databases, etc. This allows any mapping of personal, group, departmental, and enterprise databases, or design, test, manufacturing databases, etc. All of this is supported by an architecture of object manager, storage manager, and network manager that uses intelligent clustering, multiple levels of caching, and direct in-memory pointer swizzling to achieve speeds comparable to native in-memory pointer chasing for second traversals, yet scale with approximately constant objects/second performance into the multi-terabyte range, as currently measured in customer applications into the gigabyte-plus range.
