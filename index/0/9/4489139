For such biomedical applications as single cell manipulation and targeted delivery of chemicals, it is important to fabricate microstructures that can be powered and controlled without a tether in fluidic environments. In this work, we describe the construction and operation of micronsized, biocompatible ferromagnetic microtransporters driven by external magnetic fields capable of exerting forces at the pico Newton scale. We develop microtransporters using a simple, single step micro fabrication technique that allows us to produce large numbers in the same step. We also fabricate microgels to deliver drugs. We demonstrate that the microtransporters can be navigated to separate individual targeted cells with micron-scale precision, and deliver microgels without disturbing the cells in the neighborhood and the local microenvironment.
