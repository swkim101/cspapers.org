In this paper we address the problem of assessing quantitatively the quality of traversability maps computed from data collected by an airborne laser range finder. Such data is used to plan paths for an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) prior to the execution of long range traverses. Little attention has been devoted to the problem we address in this paper. We use a unique data set of geodetic control points, real robot navigation data, ground LIDAR (light detection and ranging) data and aerial imagery, collected during a week long demonstration to support our work.
