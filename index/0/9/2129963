This paper presents a novel method for high speed pose and velocity computation from visual sensor. The main problem in high speed vision is the bottleneck phenomenon which limits the video rate transmission. The proposed approach circles the problem out by increasing the information density instead of the data rate transmission. This strategy is based on a rotary sequential acquisition of selected regions of interest (ROI) which provides space-time data. This acquisition mode induces an image projection deformation of dynamic objects. This paper shows how to use this artifact for the simultaneous measure of both pose and velocity, at the same frequency as the ROI's acquisition one.
