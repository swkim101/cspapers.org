Many facets of Computer Science and associated technologies may be profitably viewed as dedicated real time control activities. Production of systems to exercise such control has been difficult and costly. An abstract model of the process of producing these systems is presented. The model indicates three areas of the design problem amenable to automation: l) the selection and configuration of hardware; 2) the production of software, and 3) the selection of a monitor to maintain real time integrity of the entire system. The concept of hardware binding is introduced and it is shown that delaying the point in the design cycle where hardware is functionally bound allows a new approach to machine independence. Techniques which allow expression of repetitive control situations are described, as are methods for automatically selecting a time-wise correct monitor. A language bringing together these concepts is outlined and a system to automate the production of real time control systems is briefly described. The system is intended to produce a hardware configuration listing and software which together form a complete dedicated real time controller.
