In this demonstration we present WoSIT, an API for Word Sense Induction (WSI) algorithms. The toolkit provides implementations of existing graph-based WSI algorithms, but can also be extended with new algorithms. The main mission of WoSIT is to provide a framework for the extrinsic evaluation of WSI algorithms, also within end-user applications such as Web search result clustering and diversification.
