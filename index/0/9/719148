We investigate the power of migration in real-time multi-processor scheduling with preemption. We show that every collection of jobs that can be completed by some schedule S on m processors can also be completed by a nonmigratory schedule S? on 6m?5 processors. We can conclude from this result that, for many scheduling problems, such as P?ri,pmtn??wi(1?Ui) and special cases thereof, the ability of the scheduler to migrate jobs is of only limited advantage. Our proof is constructive, and can be implemented to run in pseudo-polynomial time (or in polynomial time at the cost of raising the bound from 6m?5 to 12m?5). As an example of the usefulness of this result, we give a polynomial-time 6-approximation reduction from the problem P?ri,pmtn??wi(1?Ui) to the problem 1?ri,pmtn??wi(1?Ui). The proof of correctness of this reduction critically uses the fact that there is a nonmigratory schedule that closely approximates the optimal migratory schedule.
