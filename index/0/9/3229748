The characterization of transducers ultimately play an important role in determining the quality of the image. Electrical impedance, pulse-length, bandwidth, and sensitivities are parameters commonly used to characterize the transducer. An achievement of this paper is that these parameters of two single transducers one element have been characterized by combining the measurement results in pulse-echo method with simulations to get more reliable, repeatable and consistent results. The simulations based on MATLAB codes (XTRANS) and COMSOL Multiphysics (Finite Element Model-FEM) are the most powerful and accurate tool available for this application to develop.
