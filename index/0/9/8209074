Many applications require the management of spatial data. Clustering large spatial databases is an important problem which tries to find the densely populated regions in the feature space to be used in data mining, knowledge discovery, or efficient information retrieval. A good clustering approach should be efficient and detect clusters of arbitrary shape. It must be insensitive to the outliers (noise) and the order of input data. We propose WaveCluster, a novel clustering approach based on wavelet transforms, which satisfies all the above requirements. Using multiresolution property of wavelet transforms, we can effectively identify arbitrary shape clusters at different degrees of accuracy. We also demonstrate that WaveCluster is highly efficient in terms of time complexity. Experimental results on very large data sets are presented which show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to the other recent clustering methods.
