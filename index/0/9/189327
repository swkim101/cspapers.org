Consider a database that represents information about moving objects and their location. For example, for a database representing the location of taxi-cabs a typical query may be: retrieve the free cabs that are currently within 1 mile of 33 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago (to pick-up a customer); or for a trucking company database a typical query may be: retrieve the trucks that are currently within 1 mile of truck ABT312 (which needs assistance); or for a database representing the current location of objects in a battlefield a typical query may be: retrieve the friendly helicopters that are in a given region, or, retrieve the friendly helicopters that are expected to enter the region within the next 10 minutes. The queries may originate from the moving objects, or from stationary users. We will refer to applications with the above characteristics as moving-objects-database (MOD) applications, and to queries as the ones mentioned above as MOD queries.
In the military MOD applications arise in the context of the digital battlefield (see [1]), and in the civilian industry they arise in transportation systems. For example, Omnitracs developed by Qualcomm (see[2]) is a commercial system used by the transportation industry, which enables MOD functionality. It provides location management by connecting vehicles (e.g. trucks), via satellites, to company databases. The vehicles are equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS), and they automatically and periodically report their location.
