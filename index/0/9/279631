Tapered slot-line antenna (TSA) is a well known printed end-fire antenna with traveling-wave feature. In order to further improve its performances and extend its functions, several techniques with patents were developed in SEU, and summarized in this article. Here include: grating-loaded TSA for gain enhancement, CPW back-fed TSA for broadening impedance bandwidth, asymmetric TSA structure for beam shaping and optimization, coupled TSA with hybrid network for monopulse beam forming. Both conceptual illumination and simulated/measured results are described.
