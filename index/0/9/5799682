Columbia's Newsblaster tracking and summarization system is a robust system that clusters news into events, categorizes events into broad topics and summarizes multiple articles on each event. Here we outline our most current work on tracking events over days, producing summaries that update a user on new information about an event, outlining the perspectives of news coming from different countries and clustering and summarizing non-English sources.
