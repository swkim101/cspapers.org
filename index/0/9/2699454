This video submission presents the experimental validation and testing of a leg-wheel hybrid mobile robot Quattroped. By combining the smooth and efficient motion of wheels on the flat ground with the great mobility of legs on rough terrains, the design of the robot aims for agile and versatile yet efficient locomotion in both natural and artificial environments. Compared to most hybrid platforms, which have separate mechanisms of wheels and legs, this robot is implemented with a transformation mechanism that directly changes the morphology of wheels (i.e., a full circle) into half-circle legs, each with 2 active degrees-of-freedom (i.e., combining two half circles as a leg ). The experimental testing includes flat terrain driving and turning in the wheeled mode, leg-wheel mode switching, and step crossing, bar crossing, natural rough terrain walking, and stair climbing in the legged mode.
