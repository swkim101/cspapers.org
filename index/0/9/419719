This paper introduces the Graphite open-source distributed parallel multicore simulator infrastructure. Graphite is designed from the ground up for exploration of future multi-core processors containing dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of cores. It provides high performance for fast design space exploration and software development. Several techniques are used to achieve this including: direct execution, seamless multicore and multi-machine distribution, and lax synchronization. Graphite is capable of accelerating simulations by distributing them across multiple commodity Linux machines. When using multiple machines, it provides the illusion of a single process with a single, shared address space, allowing it to run off-the-shelf pthread applications with no source code modification. Our results demonstrate that Graphite can simulate target architectures containing over 1000 cores on ten 8-core servers. Performance scales well as more machines are added with near linear speedup in many cases. Simulation slowdown is as low as 41Ã— versus native execution.
