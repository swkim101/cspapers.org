This paper describes the new architecture and optimizations for parallel SQL execution in the Oracle 10g database. Based on the fundamental shared-disk architecture underpinning Oracle's parallel SQL execution engine since Oracle7, we show in this paper how Oracle's engine responds to the challenges of performing in new grid-computing environments. This is made possible by using advanced optimization techniques, which enable Oracle to exploit data and system architecture dynamically without being constrained by them. We show how we have evolved and re-architected our engine in Oracle 10g to make it more efficient and manageable by using a single global parallel plan model.
