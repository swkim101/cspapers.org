In this paper we describe the adopted and implemented solution to provide secure communications over the extended area Ethernet network of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (U.P.C.). The developed solution is not adapted to the current standards about security on local networks (IEEE-802.10, ISO 7498-2, etc.). This solution is based on the construction of a set of ciphering devices (CRYPTONETS), whose function is similar to the one carried out by a classic bridge, but incorporating ciphering facilities. Moreover, there is a Supervision and Administration Center (SAC), which takes care of the key renewal and System Management. The cryptographic algorithms used are the D.E.S. for the Ethernet frames ciphering, and the R.S.A., for key-management.
Finally, we evaluate the degradation of the network performances due to the introduction of security services within an already working network. The prototype shown here is a second version of the one described in [16]. Although the measures carried out are only partial, it can be asserted that they substantially improve the performances obtained with the first prototype, reaching the desired values.
