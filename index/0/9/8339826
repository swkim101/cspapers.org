With emerging IPv6-based standards such as 6LowPAN and ISA100a, full IPv6 sensor networks are the next major step. With millions of deployed embedded IPv6 devices, interoperability is of major importance, both within the sensor networks and between the sensors and the Internet hosts. We present uIPv6, the first IPv6 stack for memory-constrained devices that passes all Phase-1 IPv6 Ready certification tests. This is an important step for end-to-end interoperability between IPv6 sensors and any IPv6 capable device. To allow widespread community adoption, we release uIPv6 under a permissive open source license that allows both commercial and non-commercial use.
