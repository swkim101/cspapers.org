Many physical synthesis tools interdigitate signal and power lines to reduce cross-talk, and thus, improve signal integrity and timing predictability. Such approaches are extremely effective at reducing cross-talk at circuit speeds where inductive effects are inconsequential. In this paper, we use a detailed distributed RLC model to show that inductive cross-talk effects are substantial in long busses associated with 0.18 micron technology. Simulation experiments are then used to demonstrate that cross-talk in such high speed technologies is much better controlled by re-deploying interdigitated power lines to perform differential signaling.
