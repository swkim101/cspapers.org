Bioinformatics, the study and application of computational methods to life sciences data, is presently enjoying a surge of interest. The main reason for this welcome publicity is the nearing completion of the sequencing of the human genome and the anticipation that the knowledge derived from this process will have a great impact on modern medicine. The pharmaceutical industry, which expects to utilize the knowledge for new drug design, has a particular interest in bioinformatics. The structure of data in this domain has its own characteristics which set it apart from data in other domains. While genomic data have a well-known representation as sequences taken from the fA,C,G,Tg alphabet, there is no clear model for data representing the expression products of genes: proteins and higher forms of organisms e.g., cells and the multitude of forms they assume in response to environmental challenges. Data collected at these levels of information can be often thought of as "broad": meaning that for a relatively small number of records representing biological samples, a very large number of attributes, representing measurements or observations is collected per sample. In contrast, typical data used for mining are "long" i.e., consist of a large number of records in which each record is characterized by a relatively small number of attributes.

Mining broad data presents a new and unique challenge. The presentation will elaborate on some of the issues in this domain.
