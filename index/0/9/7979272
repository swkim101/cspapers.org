1.1 Summary or Results Alternating Turing machines were introduced by Chandra and Stockmeyer [2] and by Kozen [12] as an interesting generalization of nondeterministic Turing machines. In this paper we investigate the effect of adding alternation to the power of auxiliary pushdown automata, first investigated by Cook [3], and to auxiliary stack automata, first investigated by Ibarra [9]. We characterize the power of alternating auxiliary pushdown automata (Alt-Aux-PDA), alternating auxiliary stack automata (Alt-AuxSA) and alternating auxiliary nonerasing stack automata (Alt-AuxNESA) in terms of time bounded Turing machines. See Table 1 for a summary of our results in comparison to known results concerning deterministic and nondeterministic versions of these classes of automata. There are several interesting things to note about Table 1. For each type of auxiliary machine the deterministic and nondeterministic versions have exactly the same power while the alternating version has strictly more power. Alternating auxiliary stack automata and nonerasing stack automata have exactly the same power while it is open whether or not nondeterministic auxiliary stack automata are more powerful than their nonerasing counterpart. Chandra and Stockmeyer [2] and Kozen [12] proved that alternating Turing machines with space bounded by s(n) have exactly the power of deterministic Turing machines that run in time 2cs(n) for some c > O. It is open whether or not DTIME(2cs(n» properly includes DSPACE(s(n». So it is not known whether or not the addition of a pushdown store alone or alternation alone increases the power of space-bounded Turing machines. However, if both alternation and a pushdown store are added to a space-bounded Turing machine then a more powerful device results.
