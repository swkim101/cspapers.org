Knowledge about the architecture of a software-intensive system tends to vaporize easily. This leads to increased maintenance costs. We explore a new idea: utilizing the repertory grid technique to capture tacit architectural knowledge. Particularly, we investigate the elicitation of design decision alternatives and their characteristics. To study the applicability of this idea, we performed an exploratory study. Seven independent subjects applied the repertory grid technique to document a design decision they had to take in previous projects. Then, we interviewed each subject to understand their perception about the technique. We identified advantages and disadvantages of using the technique. The main advantage is the reasoning support it provides; the main disadvantage is the additional effort it requires. Also, applying the technique depends on the context of the project. Using the repertory grid technique is a promising approach for fighting architectural knowledge vaporization.
