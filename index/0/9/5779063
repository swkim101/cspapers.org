An Omnimagnet is an omnidirectional electromagnet comprised of a ferromagnetic core inside of three orthogonal nested solenoids. It generates a magnetic dipole-field with both a variable dipole-moment magnitude and orientation with no moving parts. The design of an Omnimagnet, in which each solenoid has the same dipole moment and minimizes the differences between each of the solenoid's fields, is provided and optimized for strength by tailoring the size of the spherical core used to amplify the solenoids' field. This design is then analyzed using FEA tools and shown to be dipole-like in nature. Various magnetic control methods are then motivated by providing the necessary equations relating the three applied currents to applied field, torque, or force on an adjacent magnetic device. Finally, the optimal design is constructed and its utility is demonstrated by driving a helical capsule endoscope mockup through a transparent lumen.
