A closed solid body separates one point set from another if it contains the former and the closure of its complement contains the latter. We present a near-linear algorithm for deciding whether two sets of n points in 3-space can be separated by a prism, near-quadratic algorithms for separating by a slab or a wedge, and a near-cubic algorithm for separating by a double-wedge. The latter three algorithms improve the previous best known results by an order of magnitude, while the prism separability algorithm constitutes an improvement of two orders of magnitude.
