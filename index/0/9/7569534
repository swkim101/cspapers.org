The paper investigates the scheduling of packets under overload in the context of wireless building control networks. We focus on the transmission specification of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard to provide actual transmission estimates. The paper analyses the optimal conditions for sending periodic packets with 1 or 2 transmission times and fixed deadlines. Simulations provide the transceiver usage values under the calculated optimal scheduling conditions. The simulations extend the results by looking at 8 transmission times and an exponential distribution of packet release times. A counterintuitive result is the occurrence of a performance decrease with increasing deadline, other conditions remaining constant.
