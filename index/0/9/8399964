This paper presents some evolutions over the locomotion planning problem for digital actors. The solution is based both on probabilistic motion planning and on motion capture blending and warping. The paper particularly focuses on a new collision avoidance technique: while the legs and the pelvis of the digital actor follow a planned path, the animation of the upper part of the body is updated for 3D collision avoidance purposes.
