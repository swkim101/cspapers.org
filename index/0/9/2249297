This paper describes a multiple delay simulator for MOS LSI circuits. The basic primitives for this simulator are MOS transistor structures where the transistors are evaluated logically. Integer rise and fall delays are associated with each transition and these delays are computed automatically based on device characteristics and circuit capacitances. The simulator has been extensively used for the design verification of production LSI chips.
