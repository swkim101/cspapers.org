On novel actuator research in the field of cellular muscle-inspired actuators, skeletal muscles are often used as inspiration due to their modular and compact design and seemingly effortless control. Amongst others, the remaining challenges to tackle are robust designs, energy consumption minimization and control strategies. We have developed a discrete muscle-inspired actuator, in which solenoids can be overpowered and locked to recruit springs in series. This paper describes the spring and electronics design and proposes a binary actuator segmentation for increased resolution. Next, we propose and simulate a control strategy based on a lookup table, to cope with multiple discrete inputs, uni-directional force inputs and solenoid cooling time. Currently, the actuation units and springs are modular and can be tailored easily for specific applications. The resolution is maximized without under utilization of the actuator's capabilities, and our control strategy can currently control 12 motor units in real-time, which can be increased to 30. The experiments confirm the working of the control strategy.
