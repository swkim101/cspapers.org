We investigate the modelling of workflows, plans, and other event-generating processes as discrete event sources and reason about the possibility of having event sequences ending in undesirable states. In previous research, the problem is shown to be NP-Complete even if the number of events to occur is fixed in advance. In this paper, we consider possible events sequences of indefinite length and show that many interesting cases of such reasoning task are solvable in polynomial time.
