We propose to investigate test statistics for testing homogeneity based on kernel Fisher discriminant analysis. Asymptotic null distributions under null hypothesis are derived, and consistency against fixed alternatives is assessed. Finally, experimental evidence of the performance of the proposed approach on both artificial and real datasets is provided.
