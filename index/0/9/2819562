Multiple sequence alignment techniques have recently gained popularity in the Natural Language community, especially for tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and paraphrase identification. Prior work falls into two categories, depending on the type of input used: (a) parallel corpora (e.g., multiple translations of the same text) or (b) comparable texts (non-parallel but on the same topic). So far, only techniques based on parallel texts have successfully used syntactic information to guide alignments. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for incorporating syntactic features in the alignment process for non-parallel texts with the goal of generating novel paraphrases of existing texts. Our method uses dynamic programming with alignment decision based on the local syntactic similarity between two sentences. Our results show that syntactic alignment outrivals syntax-free methods by 20% in both grammaticality and fidelity when computed over the novel sentences generated by alignment-induced finite state automata.
