We envision a new better-together mobile application paradigm where multiple mobile devices are placed in a close proximity and study a specific together-viewing video application in which a higher resolution video isplayed back across screens of two mobile devices placed side by side. This new scenario imposes real-time, synchronous decoding and rendering requirements which are difficult to achieve because of the intrinsic complexity of video andthe resource constraints such as processing power and battery life of mobile devices. We develop a novel efficient collaborative half-frame decoding schemeand design a tightly coupled collaborative system architecture that aggregates resources of both devices to achieve the task. We have implemented the system and conducted experimental evaluation. Results confirm that our proposed collaborative and resource aggregation techniques can achieve our vision of better-together mobile experiences.
