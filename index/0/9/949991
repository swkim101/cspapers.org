Humanoid robot has the potential to manipulate wide range of tools in daily life. Arms and legs of humanoid robot contribute this ability. Above all, manipulation tasks for vehicles which are the same size as a life-sized humanoid or larger size than it require the operational motion by both arms and legs of humanoid robot. In addition to the arms and legs cooperative motion control, it is also important for humanoid robot to stabilize self posture during driving vehicle. In this research, we focus on the arms-legs-integrated manipulation task for tricycle controlled by humanoid robot. We propose dual manipulators control law that is defined as active manipulator which works movable objects such as handle and crank, and passive manipulator which follows the movement of this objects. We discuss the self stabilizing strategy for humanoid robot by both active manipulating legs as well as manipulation strategy for objects. Furthermore, this paper contributes the strategy of recognition and planning for outside obstacle situations and configures the tricycle manipulation system. Applying this proposed system, we show the experimental result for tricycle manipulation by life-sized humanoid robot HRP2-JSK on obstacle-mixed situation.
