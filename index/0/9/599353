Noahnet is an experimental flood local area network with features such as high reliability and high performance. Noahnet uses a randomly connected graph topology with four to five interconnections per node and a flooding protocol to route messages.
The purpose of this paper is to present two analytical performance models which we have designed to understand the load-throughput behavior of Noahnet. Both models assume slotted Noahnet operation and also assume that if k messages attempt transmission in a slot, the network gets divided into k partitions of arbitrary sizes - one partition for each message. First, we show that the average number of successful messages in a slot given k partitions of transmissions is (M - k)/(N - 1), where N is the number of nodes in the network and M is the number of nodes out of N that participate in the flooding of k messages. This is an interesting result and is used in both models to derive the load-throughput equations.
Each model is then presented using a set of assumptions, derivations of load-throughput equations, a set of plots, and the discussion of results. Models one and two differ in the way they account for retransmissions.
