In the wearable computing environment, a computer provides many kinds of services by using the values from wearable sensors to recognize the user's movements or situations. In the research on activity recognition, accelerometers are attached on the user's body such as wrists, waist and, feet. Though researches on best sensor placement for context aware systems has been released thus far, they do not use enough number of sensors to really decide the best sensor placement. When using these context aware systems in our daily life, we also need to consider the discomfort that the user gets from attaching the sensors. The sensor might get in the user's way or feel uncomfortable for the user, however, as far as we know, the sensor's wearability is not taken into consideration in these researches. This paper proposes an evaluation function that scores sensor placement considering both recognition accuracy and sensor wearability, with twenty sensors on the user's body and thirty kinds of exercises including aerobic exercise, weight training, and yoga. Then we experimentally evaluated sensor placement, resulted in high degree of accuracy achieved without feeling stressful.
