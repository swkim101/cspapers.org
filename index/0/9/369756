Nearly all robotic grippers have one trait in common: they grasp objects with normal forces, either directly, or indirectly through friction. This method of grasping is effective for objects small enough for a given gripper to partially encompass. However, to grasp larger objects, significant grip forces and a high coefficient of friction are required. We present a new grasping method for convex objects, using almost exclusively shear forces. We achieve shear grasping with a gripper that utilizes thin film gecko-inspired fibrillar adhesives that conform to the curvature of the object. We present a verified model for grasping a range of curvatures and results that demonstrate the thin film fibrillar adhesives' increased contact area on textured surfaces when loaded in shear. Finally, the gripper is implemented on a robotic arm and grasps a variety of convex objects (at rest and ballistic).
