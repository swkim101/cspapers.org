With recent emphasis placed by data warehouse applications on aggregate queries with vatious grouping criteria, it is natural to expect muhiple aggregate queries on the same set of tables. In this paper, we provide a fmmework for global optimization of aggregate queries under the concept of aggregate query blocks. We propose an extension to SQL to allow users to define explicit query blocks. The paper coveys the integration of the gZobaZ aggregate optimization with the oprimization of individual queries. We present easy-to-implement optimization algolithms applicable to aggregate query blocks. We show that these algorirhms add minimum overhead to the fofai optimization cost, whiie dramatically reducing the overall execution cost.
