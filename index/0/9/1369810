Edith Cowan University (ECU) introduced a new curriculum in computer and network technology based upon a market analysis of employer expectations. Uniquely, within Australia, this curriculum has extensive workshop exercises that require students to work on equipment they are likely to meet in the workplace and as such the workshop environment is potentially hazardous to students. It was found that prospective employers often required both an assessment and an assurance that students following this curriculum could work to an acceptable industry standard. The traditional forms of assessment (examinations and assignments) did not fulfil this requirement. The authors therefore designed a Competency-Based Assessment (CBA) to measure procedural knowledge and skills. The CBA designed was simple, easy to use and can be implemented as part of a standard workshop without interrupting student activities.
