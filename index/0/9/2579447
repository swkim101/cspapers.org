It is widely recognised that engaging games can have a profound impact on learning. Integrating a conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the mix makes the experience of learning even more engaging and enriching. In this paper we describe a conversational agent which is built with the purpose of acting as a personal tutor. The tutor can prompt, question, stimulate and guide a learner and then adapt exercises and challenges to specific needs. We illustrate how automatic generation of quizzes can be used to build learning exercises and activities.
