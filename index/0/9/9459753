In order to design and maintain a large scale grammar, the formal system for representing syntactic knowledge should be provided. Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) [Kaplan, Bresnan 82] is a powerful formalism for that purpose. In this paper, the Prolog implementation of LFG system is described. Prolog provides a good tools for the implementation of LFG. LFG can be translated into DCG [Pereira, Warren 80] and functional structures (f-structures) are generated during the parsing process.
