1. EXTENDED ABSTRACT This demonstration presents the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) web service of the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX). As TREC does for text retrieval, MIREX provides standardized datasets and evaluation frameworks to evaluate Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems and algorithms [1]. However, unlike TREC where participants are given the datasets and execute their code locally, MIREX data sets cannot be distributed due to copyright restrictions. In previous years, MIREX participants submitted systems to the International Music Information Retrieval Systems Evaluation Laboratory (IMIRSEL), where they were manually executed, and evaluated.
