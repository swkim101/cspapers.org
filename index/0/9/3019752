The paper describes a low cost remote design station that can be installed in customers offices, giving them the full C.A.D. facilities required to specify, design and verify an Uncommitted Logic Array. The designers can enter and check their logic, layouts and test programs via this remote station. Access is then available, via modem links, to the main Ferranti C.A.D. facility for running of design verification programs etc. The need for such a system came after many years experience in handling customer designed circuits.
