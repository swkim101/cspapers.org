In this paper, we discuss the role of emotions in AI and possible ways to determine their utility for the design of artificial agents. We propose a research methodology for determining the utility of emotional control and apply it to the study of autonomous agents that compete for resources in an artificial life environment. The results show that the emotional control can improve performance in some circumstances.
