INTRODUCTION Teaching things to oneself, in order to solve one’s own problems, is an incredibly effective way of learning. Discovery learning is any process in which instructors create oruse situationsin which students will learn some body of knowledge through such self-teaching. A simple example of discovery learning could be a project in which students are given some goal to reach, but not a cut-anddried means of reaching the goal – instead, they are left to find their own way to the goal, through library research, forming and asking pertinent questions of an expert, independent invention, et cetera.
