This paper derives the basis of a theory of communication from a formal theory of rational interaction. The major result is a demonstration that illocutionary acts need not be primitive, and need not be recognized. As a test case. we derive Searle's conditions on requesting from principles of rationality coupled with a Gricean theory of imperatives. The theory is shown to distinguish insincere or nonserious imperatives from true requests. Extensions to indirect speech acts, and ramifications for natural language systems are also briefly discussed.
