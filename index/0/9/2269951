We investigate the problem of specification based testing with dense sets of inputs and outputs, in particular with imprecision as they might occur due to errors in measurements, numerical instability or noisy channels. Using quantitative transition systems to describe implementations and specifications, we introduce implementation relations that capture a notion of correctness "up to ε", allowing deviations of implementation from the specification of at most ε. These quantitative implementation relations are described as Hausdorff distances between certain sets of traces. They are conservative extensions of the well-known ioco relation. We develop an on-line and an off-line algorithm to generate test cases from a requirement specification, modeled as a quantitative transition system. Both algorithms are shown to be sound and complete with respect to the quantitative implementation relations introduced.
