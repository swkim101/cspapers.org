Most existing methods of reflection components decomposition using a single color image require color segmentation. Few methods that employ local operations are able to avoid the requirement; however, they usually suffer from color discontinuity problems. In this paper, we introduce a decomposition method using a single color image that does not require (global) color segmentation or (local) color discontinuity detection. The method principally utilizes the coefficients of the reflectance basis functions of input image and its specular-free image. Combining those coefficients enables us to find the diffuse coefficients of the specular pixels for every surface color. As a result, the decomposition becomes a well-posed problem and able to be solved in closed-form equations. Our experimental results on real complex textured images show the effectiveness of our proposed method.
