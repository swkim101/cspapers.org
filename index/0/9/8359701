As software systems get more complex, the companies developing them consist of larger teams and therefore results in more complex communication artifacts. As these software systems grow, so does the impact of every action to the product. To prevent software failure created by this growth and complexity, companies need to find more efficient and effective ways to communicate. The method used in this paper presents developer communication in the form of social networks of which have properties that can be used to detect software failures.
