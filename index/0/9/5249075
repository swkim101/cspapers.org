This paper presents a web application and a web service for the diagnostic evaluation of Machine Translation (MT). These web-based tools are built on top of DELiC4MT, an opensource software package that assesses the performance of MT systems over user-defined linguistic phenomena (lexical, morphological, syntactic and semantic). The advantage of the web-based scenario is clear; compared to the standalone tool, the user does not need to carry out any installation, configuration or maintenance of the tool.
