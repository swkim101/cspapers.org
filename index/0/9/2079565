The geographic scope of Web pages is becoming an essential dimension of Web search, especially for mobile users. This paper shows a multistage method for assigning a geographic focus to Web pages (GeoReferencing) according to their text contents. We suggest several heuristics for the disambiguation toponyms and a scoring procedure for focus determination. Furthermore, we provide an experimental methodology for evaluating the accuracy. Finally, we obtained promising results of over 70% accuracy with a city-level resolution.
