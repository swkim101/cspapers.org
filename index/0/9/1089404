The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is the principal ingredient of most efficient quantum algorithms. We present a generic framework for the construction of efficient quantum circuits for the QFT by "quantizing" the highly successful separation of variables technique for the construction of efficient classical Fourier transforms. Specifically, we use Bratteli diagrams, Gel'fand-Tsetlin bases, and strong generating sets of small adapted diameter to provide efficient quantum circuits for the QFT over a wide variety of finite Abelian and non-Abelian groups, including all group families for which efficient QFTs are currently known and many new group families. Moreover, our method provides the first subexponential-size quantum circuits for the QFT over the linear groups GLk(q), SLk(q), and the finite groups of Lie type, for any fixed prime power q.
