Since the first papers on asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE), reduced order models have become standard for improving interconnect simulation efficiency, and very recent work has demonstrated that bi-orthogonalization algorithms can be used to robustly generate AWE-style macromodels. In this paper we describe using block Arnoldi-based orthogonalization methods to generate reduced order models from FastHenry, a multipole-accelerated three dimensional inductance extraction program. Examples are analyzed to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the block Arnoldi algorithm.
