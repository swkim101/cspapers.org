This paper investigates some methods for improving the performance of Single Stage Shuffle Exchange Networks (SENs) and Multistage Interconnection Networks (MINs). The three new switching strategies proposed use extra buffers to enhance performance. Approximate analysis and simulation results indicate significant improvement in performance for both SENs and MINs. An intuitive method for determining the applicability of the approximate analysis is discussed and some performance measures, which should be useful in evaluating the performance of networks are defined.
