It is envisioned in the future that not only smartphones will connect to cellular networks, but all kinds of different wearable devices, sensors, vehicles, home appliances, VR headsets, robots, will also connect to cellular networks. Because the characteristics of these devices differ largely, people argue that future 5G systems should be designed to elastically accommodate to the different users. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable core network called RECO that demonstrates how to implement customized virtual core network entities efficiently to suit for users with different characteristics. We then build a testbed to verify our proposed RECO architecture. Finally, we will open source our RECO in the near future so that the research community can take benefit out of it.
