Changing the landscape of computer science education at the high school level is a key component of several initiatives of (1) the National Science Foundation (NSF), e.g., as the cornerstone of the CE21 program partnered with academic institutions and (2) the private sector with both non-profits such as Code.org, CodeVA, and MassCan; and for-profits such as Tynker, CodeHS, and Trinket. This collaboration between privately and publicly funded initiatives is designed to reach every student; and to achieve this at scale.
