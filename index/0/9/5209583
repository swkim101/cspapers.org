The index suggestion problem for an object database management system (ODBMS) application is to automatically identify indexes which may speed up the application. We discuss how index choice for an ODBMS application differs from relational database (RDBMS) index optimization, present novel parts of an intuitive cost model for index-related ODBMS operations, and describe the results of experiments designed to validate the model. The model is used to find a list of candidate indexes with expected benefits for an example execution of the application with the userâ€™s test data. Our results demonstrate that an intuitive approach can be used to discover and compare access paths which may improve the performance of the application.
