In both flipped classroom settings and distance learning, educational content is typically delivered via video lectures that students watch alone. While flipped classrooms typically provide students with opportunities for social interaction that feature active learning, online learners are not typically afforded these opportunities. Cooperative learning techniques like Lightweight Teams provide social, collaborative learning opportunities to students in flipped classrooms but extending these techniques to distance learning settings is not straightforward. In this paper, we present our experiences with online, distributed Lightweight Teams. We present an in-the-wild study that compares learning outcomes and student preferences between co-located and distributed Lightweight Teams against the base case of individual learning. Our results show that while there are no significant learning differences between the two team conditions and the individual condition, students significantly prefer the team conditions.
