We present the concept of TBDD's which considerably enlarges the class of Boolean functions that can be efficiently manipulated in terms of OBDD's. It extends the idea of using domain transformations, which is well-known in many areas of mathematics, physics, and technical sciences, to the context of OBDD-based Boolean function manipulation in CAD: Instead of working with the OBDD-representation of a function f, TBDD's allow working with an OBDD-representation of a suited cube transformed version of f. Besides of giving some theoretical insights into the new concept, we investigate in some detail cube transformations which are based on complete types. We - show that such TBDD-representations can be derived similarly as OBDD-representations, - give evidence of the practical importance of such TBDD's by presenting very small-size TBDD-representations of the hidden weighted bit functions HWBn which were proved to have only very large OBDD-representations, and - report some promising experimental results with some ISCAS benchmark circuits including the multiplier circuit C6288.
