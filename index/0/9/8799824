In this paper we discuss the problem of how to assess academic productivity based on publication outputs. We are interested in knowing how well a research group in an area of knowledge is doing relatively to a pre-selected set of reference groups, where each group is composed by academics or researchers. To assess academic productivity we adopt a new metric we propose, which we call P-score. We use P-score, citation counts and H-Index to obtain rankings of researchers in Brazil. Experimental results using data from the area of Computer Science show that P-score outperforms citation counts and H-Index when assessed against the official ranking produced by the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq). This is of our interest for two reasons. First, it suggests that citation-based metrics, despite wide adoption, can be improved upon. Second, contrary to citation-based metrics, the P-score metric does not require access to the content of publications to be computed.
