Novel computational strategies are presented for the analysis of large and complex structures. The strategies are based on generating the response of the complex structure using large perturbations from that of a simpler model, associated with a simpler structure (or a simpler mathematical/discrete model of the original structure). Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategies developed.
