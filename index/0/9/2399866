Several problems in specifying aggregate functions in relational systems are investigated. We propose a solution to these problems in the form of an extension of the relational data model. In particular we introduce the concept of summary data. The query language STRAND is presented in order to describe retrieval operations on the extended model. STRAND allows a user to formulate queries involving aggregate functions without conceptualizing the query in terms of aggregation. Two example applications, proposal tracking and socio-demographic data bases, are used to illustrate the concepts of the extended model.
