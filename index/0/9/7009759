A Global Cooperation Project was conducted with computer science classes at the Czech Technical University and North Hennepin Community College. The project was a pilot project for teaching team cooperation on a global scale. For three months the students worked in teams consisting of team members from remote places (Czech Republic and Minnesota). Students learned how to use modern Internet-based communication tools and they were exposed to the experience of working in teams. This text describes the design of the project and summarizes the collected experiences.
