Geometric active contours are formulated in a manner which is parametrization independent. As such, they are amenable to representation as the zero level set of the graph of a higher dimensional function. This representation is able to deal with singularities and changes in topology of the contour. It has been used very successfully in static images for segmentation and registration problems where the contour (represented as an implicit curve) is evolved until it minimizes an image based energy functional. But tracking involves estimating the global motion of the object and its local deformations as a function of time. Some attempts have been made to use geometric active contours for tracking, but most of these minimize the energy at each frame and do not utilize the temporal coherency of the motion or the deformation. On the other hand, tracking algorithms using Kalman filters or particle filters have been proposed for finite dimensional representations of shape. But these are dependent on the chosen parametrization and cannot handle changes in curve topology. In the present work, we formulate a particle filtering algorithm in the geometric active contour framework that can be used for tracking moving and deforming objects.
