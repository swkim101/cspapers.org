Current 2D CAPTCHA mechanisms can be easily defeated by character recognition and segmentation attacks by automated machines. Recently, 3D CAPTCHA schemes have been proposed to overcome the weaknesses of 2D CAPTCHA for a few websites. However, researchers also demonstrate the offline pre-processing techniques to break 3D CAPTCHA. In this work, we propose a novel 3D object based CAPTCHA scheme that projects the CAPTCHA image over a 3D object. We develop the prototype and present the proof-of-concept of 3D object based CAPTCHA scheme to protect websites against automated attacks.
