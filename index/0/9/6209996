Recently, A.K. Lenstra, H.W. Lenstra, Jr., M.S. Manasse and J .M. Pollard [5,6] have introduced a new algorithm for factoring integers of special form. Based on earlier work of Coppersmith, Odlyzko and Schroeppel [2] and of Pollard [10], the new algorithm, the ‘numb er field sieve’, is the fastest known for factoring integers of the form r’ + s where e and s are small. In [5], the authors raise the issue of generalizing the number field sieve to produce an efficient algorithm for all numbers. Beginning with the author’s suggestions, together with those of Buhler and Pomerance as reported in [5], we produce such a general purpose number field sieve along with an heuristic argument that it factors numbers in random time: ~(c+o(l))(log n) ’1 ’(log log n)’j’
