SHOP (Simple Hierarchical Ordered Planner) is a domain-independent HTN planning system with the following characteristics. • SHOP plans for tasks in the same order that they will later be executed. This avoids some goal-interaction issues that arise in other HTN planners, so that the planning algorithm is relatively simple. • Since SHOP knows the complete world-state at each step of the planning process, it can use highly expressive domain representations. For example, it can do planning problems that require complex numeric computations. • In our tests, SHOP was several orders of magnitude faster man Blackbox and several times faster than TLpian, even though SHOP is coded in Lisp and the other planners are coded in C.
