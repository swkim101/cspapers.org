Efficiently entering text on interactive surfaces, such as touch-based tabletops, is an important concern. One novel solution is shape writing - the user strokes through all the letters in the word on a virtual keyboard without lifting his or her finger. While this technique can be used with any keyboard layout, the layout does impact the expected performance. In this paper, I investigate the influence of keyboard layout on expert text-entry performance for stroke-based text entry. Based on empirical data, I create a model of stroking through a series of points based on Fitts's law. I then use that model to evaluate various keyboard layouts for both tapping and stroking input. While the stroke-based technique seems promising by itself (i.e., there is a predicted gain of 17.3% for a Qwerty layout), significant additional gains can be made by using a more-suitable keyboard layout (e.g., the OPTI II layout is predicted to be 29.5% faster than Qwerty).
