In recent years, statistical approaches on ATR (Automatic Term Recognition) have achieved good results. However, there are scopes to improve the performance in extracting terms still further. For example, domain dictionaries can improve the performance in ATR. This paper focuses on a method for extracting terms using a dictionary hierarchy. Our method produces relatively good results for this task.
