MOLE can help domain experts build a heuristic classification problem-solver by working with them to generate an initial knowledge base and then detect and remedy deficiencies in it. By exploiting several heuristic assumptions about the world, MOLE is able to minimize the information it needs to elicit from the domain expert. In particular, by using static techniques of analysis, MOLE is able to infer support values and fill in gaps when a knowledge base is under-specified. And by using dynamic techniques of analysis, MOLE is able to interactively refine the knowledge base.
