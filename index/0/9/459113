Categorial grammar has traditionally used the Î»-calculus to represent meaning. We present an alternative, dependency-based perspective on linguistic meaning and situate it in the computational setting. This perspective is formalized in terms of hybrid logic and has a rich yet perspicuous propositional ontology that enables a wide variety of semantic phenomena to be represented in a single meaning formalism. Finally, we show how we can couple this formalization to Combinatory Categorial Grammar to produce interpretations compositionally.
