We present the Python Classroom Response System, a web-based tool that enables instructors to use code-writing and multiple choice questions in a classroom setting. The system is designed to extend the principles of peer instruction, an active learning technique built around discussion of multiple- choice questions, into the domain of introductory programming education. Code submissions are evaluated by a suite of tests designed to highlight common misconceptions, so the instructor receives real-time feedback as students submit code. The system also allows an instructor to pull specific submissions into an editor and visualizer for use as in-class examples. We motivate the use of this system, describe its support for and extension of peer instruction, and offer use cases and scenarios for classroom implementation.
