Using platform independent models (PIMs) in integrating enterprise systems is much more concerned nowadays. In this demonstration we are going to present an approach to build and integrate enterprise systems which has many commonalities with OMG MDA [1] concepts. There are two major integrity points of view in this approach. First, integrity from business process point of view and the second, integrity from object model point of view. We are going to present how these two are achieved in Nebras Enterprise Framework.
