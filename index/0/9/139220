One of the fundamental issues of Bayesian networks is their representational power, re-ecting what kind of functions they can or cannot represent. In this paper, we rst prove an upper bound on the representational power of Augmented Naive Bayes. We then extend the result to general Bayesian networks. Roughly speaking, if a function contains an m-XOR, there exists no Bayesian networks with node having at most m ? 1 parents to represent it.
