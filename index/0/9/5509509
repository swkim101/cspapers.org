We present a novel approach to dynamic datarace detection for multithreaded object-oriented programs. Past techniques for on-the-fly datarace detection either sacrificed precision for performance, leading to many false positive datarace reports, or maintained precision but incurred significant overheads in the range of 3x to 30x. In contrast, our approach results in very few false positives and runtime overhead in the 13% to 42% range, making it both efficient and precise. This performance improvement is the result of a unique combination of complementary static and dynamic optimization techniques.
