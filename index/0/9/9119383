Advances in microfluidic research has enabled lab-on-a-chip (LoC) technology to achieve miniaturization and integration of biological and chemical analyses to a single chip comprising channels, valves, mixers, heaters, separators, and sensors. These miniature instruments appear to offer the rare combination of faster, cheaper, and higher-precision analyses in comparison to conventional bench-scale methods. LoCs have been applied to diverse domains such as proteomics, genomics, biochemistry, virology, cell biology, and chemical synthesis. However, to date LoCs have been designed as application-specific chips which incurs significant design effort, turn-around time, and cost, and degrades designer and user productivity. To address these limitations, we envision a programmable LoC (PLoC) and propose a comprehensive fluidic instruction set, called AquaCore Instruction Set (AIS), and a fluidic microarchitecture, called AquaCore, to implement AIS. We present four key design aspects in which the AIS and AquaCore differ from their computer counterparts, and our design decisions made on the basis of the implications of these differences. We demonstrate the use of the PLoC in a range of domains by hand-compiling real-world microfluidic assays in AIS, and show a detailed breakdown of the execution times for the assays and an estimate of the chip area.
