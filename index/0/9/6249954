Japanese has many noun phrase patterns of the type A no B consisting of two nouns A and B with an adnominal particle no. As the semantic relations between the two nouns in the noun phrase are not made explicit, the interpretation of the phrases depends mainly on the semantic characteristics of the nouns. This paper describes the semantic diversity of A no B and a method of semantic analysis for such phrases based on feature unification.
