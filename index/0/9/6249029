It is known that clock synchronization can be achieved in the presence of faulty clocks numbering more than one-third of the total number of participating clocks provided that some authentication technique is used. Without authentication the number of faults that can be tolerated has been an open question. Here we show that if we restrict logical clocks to running within some linear function of real time, then clock synchronization is impossible, without authentication, when one-third or more of the processors are faulty. However, if there is a bound on the rate at which a processor can generate messages, then we show that clock synchronization is achievable, without authentication, as long as the faults do not disconnect the network. Finally, we provide a lower bound on the closeness to which simultaneity can be achieved in the network as a function of the transmission and processing delay properties of the network.
