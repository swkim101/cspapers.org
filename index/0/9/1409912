Determining the relationship between the intonational characteristics of an utterance and other features inferable from its text is important both for speech recognition and for speech synthesis. This work investigates the use of text analysis in predicting the location of intonational phrase boundaries in natural speech, through analyzing 298 utterances from the DARPA Air Travel Information Service database. For statistical modeling, we employ Classification and Regression Tree (CART) techniques. We achieve success rates of just over 90%, representing a major improvement over other attempts at boundary prediction from unrestricted text.
