This paper explores a novel mode of mobile manipulation using a car-like robot whose chassis does not extend above the height of its wheels. It transports an object that rests on top of the wheels, so as the robot moves forwards, the object moves forward relative to the robot. The robot must maneuver so that the object stays on top of the robot, or a second robot must be in position to receive the robot as it rolls off the first one. We describe the mechanics of this system, its basic maneuvers and manipulation techniques, present a motion planner for generating plans to transport an object, and give results of our experimental implementation of this system.
