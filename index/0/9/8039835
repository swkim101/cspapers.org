Expressions are found for the throughput and delay performance of a Tree Conflict Resolution Algorithm that is used in a Local Area Network with carrier sensing (and possibly also collision detection). We assume that Massey's constant size window algorithm is used to control access to the channel, and that the resulting conflicts (if any) are resolved using a Capetanakis-like preorder traversal tree algorithm with d-ary splitting. We develop and solve functional equations for various performance metrics of the system and apply the “Moving Server” technique to calculate the main component of the delay. Our results compare very favorably with those for CSMA protocols, which are commonly used in Local Area Networks that support sensing.
