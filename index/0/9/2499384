Data movement over long and highly capacitive interconnects is responsible for a large fraction of the energy consumed in nanometer ICs. DDRx, the most broadly adopted family of DRAM interfaces, contributes significantly to the overall system energy in a wide range of computer systems. To reduce the energy cost of data transfers, DDR4 adopts a pseudo open-drain IO circuit that consumes power only when transmitting or receiving a 0, which makes the IO energy proportional to the number of 0s transferred over the data bus. A data bus invert (DBI) coding technique is therefore supported by the DDR4 standard to encode each byte using a small number of 0s. Although sparse coding techniques that are more advanced than DBI can reduce the IO power further, the relatively high bandwidth overhead of these codes has heretofore prevented their application to the DDRx bus. This paper presents MiL (More is Less), a novel data communication framework built on top of DDR4, which exploits the data bus under-utilization caused by DRAM timing constraints to selectively apply sparse codes, thereby reducing the IO energy without compromising system performance. Evaluation results on a set of eleven parallel applications show that MiL can reduce the average IO interface energy by 49%, and the average DRAM system energy by 8% when added on top of a conventional DDR4 system, with less than 2% performance degradation on average.
