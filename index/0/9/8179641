Systems of Systems (SoS) are dynamic, distributed coalitions of autonomous and heterogeneous systems that collaborate to achieve a common goal. While offering several advantages in terms of scalability and flexibility, the SoS paradigm has a strong impact on system interoperability and on the security requirements of collaborating parties. In this demo we present a prototype implementation of POLIPO, a security framework that combines context-aware access control with trust management and ontology-based services to protect information in SoS.
