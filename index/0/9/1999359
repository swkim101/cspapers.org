The field of software engineering is currently in its formative stages. Consequently, it does not exhibit the structure and discipline present in other, more established engineering disciplines. The technique of morphological analysis is applied to the field of software engineering to identify the form and structure present. Applications in the areas of software engineering research and software engineering curricula are discussed.
