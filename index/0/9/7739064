In this paper, we focused on concepts of behavior modifier. We aim to build a system, which acquires concepts of behavior modifier and applies it to motion generation of robots. For a form of motion representation, an existing research achievement, which statistically abstracts motion with known sets of motion examples and represents motions as points in a space, was adopted. Our system uses tendency of motions with adverbial modifier in the space to represent concepts of behavior modifier. The system has a simple representation form and has interactiveness what has potential advantage of ability to be applied to various motion concepts.
