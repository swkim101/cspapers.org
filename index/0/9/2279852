With the rising popularity of social networks, people's locations are being used for providing rich mobile social services. We present a mobile social service in our office environment called Find & Connect. We use WiFi to record a user's position and allow users to efficiently find, reserve and manage office resources, like meeting rooms and desks, and easily connect to other colleagues through scheduled interactions like having a meeting and/or unscheduled yet implicit interactions like ephemeral encounters. We then describe how we manage office resources and connect with people, followed by a user study that we conducted in our office.
