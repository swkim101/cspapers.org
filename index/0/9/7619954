This paper presents a human dead-reckoning system for beaconless indoor positioning. The system is based on traditional dead-reckoning sensors like compass, gyro, and accelerometers. Due to the difficult kinematics of a human, there are no ready solutions for the odometry. This problem is solved by using a self-made stride length measurement unit and laser odometry. All the sensors are integrated to a complete system including sensor fusion. The functionality of the integrated system is verified with tests in an office environment. Finally the test results are analyzed.
