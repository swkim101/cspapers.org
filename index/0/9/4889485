Popularity prediction for the growing social images has opened unprecedented opportunities for wide commercial applications, such as precision advertising and recommender system. While a few studies have explored this significant task, little research has addressed its unstructured properties of both visual and textual modalities, and further considered to learn effective representation from multi-modalities for popularity prediction. To this end, we propose a model named User-guided Hierarchical Attention Network (UHAN) with two novel user-guided attention mechanisms to hierarchically attend both visual and textual modalities. It is capable of not only learning effective representation for each modality, but also fusing them to obtain an integrated multi-modal representation under the guidance of user embedding. As no benchmark dataset exists, we extend a publicly available social image dataset by adding the descriptions of images. The comprehensive experiments have demonstrated the rationality of our proposed UHAN and its better performance than several strong alternatives.
