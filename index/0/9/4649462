This article presents a literature review within the area of Human-Automation-Interaction in order to find trends and central factors in recent HAI research. These factors will then be used in order to suggest a cognitive automation strategy for final assembly. Trends within final assembly is towards take individual aspects into account, choose an appropriate level of automation and investigate trust and joint-interaction factors. In addition, automation system processes should be made more transparent in order to keep the operator in the decision-loop.
