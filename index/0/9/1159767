The "Bag of Visual Words" (BoW) framework has been widely used in query-by-example video retrieval to model the visual content by a set of quantized local feature descriptors. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to enhance BoW by the selection of Word-of-Interest (WoI) that utilizes the quantified temporal motion coherence of the visual words between the adjacent frames in the query example. Experiments carried out using TRECVID datasets show that our technique improves the retrieval performance of the classical BoW-based approach.
