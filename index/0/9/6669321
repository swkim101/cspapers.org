The extensive use of local networks is beginning to drive requirements for internetwork facilities that connect these local networks. In particular, the availability of multicast addressing in many local networks and its use by sophisticated distributed applications motivates providing multicast across internetworks.
In this paper, we propose a model of service for multicast in an internetwork, describe how this service can be used, and describe aspects of its implementation, including how it would fit into one existing internetwork architecture, namely the US DoD Internet Architecture.1 2
