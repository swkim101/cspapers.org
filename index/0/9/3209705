This paper introduces a novel robot-based approach to the stroke rehabilitation scenario, in which a mobile robot companion accompanies stroke patients during their walking self-training. This assistance enables them to move freely in the clinic practicing both their mobility and spatial orientation skills. Based on a set of questions for systematic evaluating the autonomy and practicability of assistive robots and a three-stage approach in conducting function and user tests in the clinical setting, we present the results of user trials performed with N=30 stroke patients in a stroke rehabilitation center between 4/2015 and 3/2016. This allowed us to make an honest inventory of the strengths and weaknesses of the developed robot companion and its already achieved practicability for clinical use. The results of the user studies show that patients and fellow patients were very open-minded and accepted the robotic coach. The robot motivated them for independent training and leaving their room, despite severe consequences of stroke (lower limbs paralysis, speech/language problems, loss of orientation, depression), provided a very self-determined training regime, and encouraged them to expand the radius of their training in the clinic.
