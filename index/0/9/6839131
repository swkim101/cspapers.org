The paper introduces a number of propositional argumentation systems obtained by gradually extending the underlying language and associated monotonic logics. An assumption-based argumentation framework [Bondarenko et al., 1997] will constitute a special case of this construction. In addition, a stronger argumentation system in a full classical language will be shown to be equivalent to a system of causal reasoning [Giunchiglia et al., 2004]. The implications of this correspondence for the respective nonmonotonic theories of argumentation and causal reasoning are discussed.
