The aim of this paper is two-fold. 1) We raise concerns regarding possible violations of user privacy relative to the use of X509 Certi cates and the Transport Layer Security protocol. We stress that this approach to secure network transactions, while preserving the interests of service providers, neglects to consider the right to privacy of the users. 2) We propose the concept of a crypto certi cate and the Secure and Private Socket Layer protocol (SPSL protocol, in short) and show their e ectiveness in preserving user privacy and, at the same time, protecting the interests of service providers. Focusing on the particular case of web transactions, we describe a system based on SPSL for secure and private web navigation. Our implementation includes an SPSL-proxy for an SSL-enabled web client and a module for the Apache web server along with administrative tools for the server side. The system has been developed starting from the implementation of an API for the SPSL protocol that we describe in the paper. Experimental results show that SPSL is an e ective and e cient solution to the problem of privacy in web transaction. The protocol we propose and, consequently, the implementation we describe are fully dynamic and provide an adjustable level of privacy.
