We present an approach for integrating inter-object constraint maintenance seamlessly into an object-oriented database system. We develop a constraint compilation scheme that accepts declarative global specification of constraints, including relational integrity, referential integrity, and uniqueness requirements, and generates an efficient representation that permits localized processing. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by designing a constraint pre-processor for O*, the programming language interface to the Ode object-oriented database.
