In this paper, we describe some preliminary work on using monolingual projections of document collections for performing cross-language information retrieval tasks. The proposed methodology uses multidimensional scaling for projecting the vector-space representations of a given multilingual document collection into spaces of lower dimensionality. An independent projection is computed for each different language, and the structural similarities of the resulting projections are exploited for information retrieval tasks.
