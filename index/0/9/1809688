Due to larger buses (length, width) and deep sub-micron effects where coupling capacitances between bus lines are in the same order of magnitude as base capacitances, power consumption of interconnects starts to have a significant impact on a system's total power consumption. We present novel address bus encoding schemes that take coupling effects into consideration. The basis is a physical bus model that quantifies coupling capacitances. As a result, we report power/energy savings on the address buses of up to 56% compared to the best known ordinary power/energy efficient encoding schemes. Thereby, we exceed the only to-date approach that also takes coupling effects into consideration. Moreover, our encoding schemes do not assume any a priori knowledge that is particular to a specific application.
