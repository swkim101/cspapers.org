This paper starts from a well-known idea, that structure in irregular problems improves sequential performance, and tries to show that the same structure can also be exploited for parallelization of irregular problems on a distributedmemory multi-computer. Moreover, we will show that this process can be automated through extensions to an HPF/ Fortran-77 distributed-memory compiler and a new run-time support for irregular problems, PILAR. Finally, we will show experimental results on a real multi-computer that validate our approach.
