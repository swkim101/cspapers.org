Autonomous cyber-physical systems rely on modern machine learning methods such as deep neural networks to control their interactions with the physical world. Testing of such intelligent cyberphysical systems is a challenge due to the huge state space associated with high-resolution visual sensory inputs. We demonstrate how fuzzing the input using patterns obtained from the convolutional filters of an unrelated convolutional neural network can be used to test computer vision algorithms implemented in intelligent cyber-physical systems. Our method discovers interesting counterexamples to a pedestrian detection algorithm implemented in the popular OpenCV library. Our approach also unearths counterexamples to the correct behavior of an autonomous car similar to NVIDIAâ€™s end-to-end self-driving deep neural net running on the Udacity open-source simulator.
