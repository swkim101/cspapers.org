GF11 is a parallel computer currently under construction at the IBM Yorktown Research Center. The machine incorporates 576 floating- point processors arranged in a modified SIMD architecture. Each has space for 2 Mbytes of memory and is capable of 20 Mflops, giving the total machine a peak of 1.125 Gbytes of memory and 11.52 Gflops. The floating-point processors are interconnected by a dynamically reconfigurable non-blocking switching network. At each machine cycle any of 1024 pre-selected permutations of data can be realized among the processors. The main intended application of GF11 is a class of calculations arising from quantum chromodynamics.
