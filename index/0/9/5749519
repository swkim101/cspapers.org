In this demonstration, we describe Baya, an extension of Yahoo! Pipes that guides and speeds up development by interactively recommending composition knowledge harvested from a repository of existing pipes. Composition knowledge is delivered in the form of reusable mashup patterns, which are retrieved and ranked on the fly while the developer models his own pipe (the mashup) and that are automatically weaved into his pipe model upon selection. Baya mines candidate patterns from pipe models available online and thereby leverages on the knowledge of the crowd, i.e., of other developers. Baya is an extension for the Firefox browser that seamlessly integrates with Pipes. It enhances Pipes with a powerful new feature for both expert developers and beginners, speeding up the former and enabling the latter. The discovery of composition knowledge is provided as a service and can easily be extended toward other modeling environments.
