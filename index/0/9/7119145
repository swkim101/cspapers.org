An optoelectronic implementation of a spiking neuron model based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations is presented. A tunable semiconductor laser source and a spectral filter provide a nonlinear mapping from driver voltage to detected signal. Linear electronic feedback completes the implementation, which allows either electronic or optical input signals. Experimental results for a single system and numeric results of model interaction confirm that important features of spiking neural models can be implemented through this approach.
