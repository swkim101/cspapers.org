We present a new palm design that features a dense array of micro-spines for the JPL Robosimian human-scale climbing robot. A linearly-constrained spine mechanism is introduced and analyzed using adhesion and stiffness models. This mechanism achieves a spine density of 19/cm2 and a mean adhesion of 67N (207kPa) on coarse concrete surfaces. The models are validated on two different surfaces with two sets of experiments. A 120Ã—100mm palm consisting of 12 spine tiles and a pulley differential system for load sharing are designed and tested on 9 different surfaces. The mean shear adhesion goes up to 710N (183kPa) on concrete blocks. Design considerations include scaling efficiency and maximal single-spine force. Desirable properties for load sharing in the palm design are discussed.
