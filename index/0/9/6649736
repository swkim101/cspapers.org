Interest in teaching object-oriented programming in first year computer science courses has increased substantially over the last few years. While the theoretical advantages are clear, it is not obvious that the available object-oriented languages are suitable for this purpose. None of the existing languages is appropriate for teaching object-oriented principles. In this paper we discuss the requirements for an object-oriented teaching language and draw attention to the deficiencies of existing languages. In particular, the paper examines C++, Smalltalk, Eiffel and Sather. Finally we outline characteristics of a new language, specifically designed for teaching purposes.
