FLUX belongs to the high-level programming languages for cognitive agents that have been developed in recent years. Based on the established, general action representation formalism of the Fluent Calculus, FLUX allows to implement complex strategies in a concise and modular fashion. In this paper, we extend the FLUX language to reason about domains involving continuous change and where actions occur concurrently. Using constraint logic programming, we show that this reasoning is performed in an efficient way.
