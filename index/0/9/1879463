We address the problem of secure remote access to a site’s internal web server from outside the ﬁrewall. The goal is to give authorized users access to sensitive information, while protecting the information from others. We implemented our solution using a one-time password scheme for client authentication and SSL for conﬁdentiality. Our main design considerations were security, performance, ease of use, availability, and scale. We were further constrained by the desire to leave our ﬁrewall and local infrastructure unchanged.
