This work aims to explore whether the sustainability of scientific collaboration including collaboration duration and collaboration times can be predicted. For this purpose, we propose a series of features including structural similarity indices, authorship properties, and research interests. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our proposed model outperforms baseline model by 10% in MAE. Our study may shed light on investigating scientific collaboration from the perspective of sustainability.
