This paper presents M3Express (Modular-Mobile-Multirobot), a new design for a low-cost modular robot. The robot is self-mobile, with three independently driven wheels that also serve as connectors. The new connectors can be automatically operated, and are based on stationary magnets coupled to mechanically actuated ferromagnetic yoke pieces. Extensive use is made of plastic castings, laser cut plastic sheets, and low-cost motors and electronic components. Modules interface with a host PC via BluetoothÂ® radio. An off-board camera, along with a set of modules and a control PC form a convenient, low-cost system for rapidly developing and testing control algorithms for modular reconfigurable robots. Experimental results demonstrate mechanical docking, connector strength, and accuracy of dead reckoning locomotion.
