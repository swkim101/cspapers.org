Randomness is an important computational resource, and has found application in such diverse computational tasks as combinatorial algorithms, synchronization and deadlock resolution protocols, encrypting data and cryptographic protocols. Blum [Bl] pointed out the fundamental fact that whereas all these applications of randomness assume a source of independent, unbiased bits, the available physical sources of randomness (such as zener diodes) suffer seriously from problems of correlation. A general
