Concurrency as a topic for CS 1 and 2 is at that point in its evolution where early adopters have already obtained several years of experience, but the bulk of educators are still considering their options. Thus we are at the perfect moment for a panel where the early adopters report on their experiences to the broader community of educators considering introducing concurrency in the first year. Each of the panelists has at least three iterations of experience with concurrency in the first year, and will report both on the course design decisions they made and on how those designs have played out. We will then leave thirty minutes for discussion.
