The SR programming language supports a simple and elegant set of abstractions for its model of distributed computing. The model provides an effective framework for demonstrating to students the different styles of distributed programming. A small Java toolkit based on SR's model is presented in this paper. This toolkit allows instructors to use the popular Java language as a platform in parallel and distributed processing courses.
