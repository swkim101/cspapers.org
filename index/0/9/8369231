The winner determination problem in combinatorial auctions is the problem of determining the allocation of the items among the bidders that maximizes the sum of the accepted bid prices. While this problem is in general NP-hard, it is known to be feasible in polynomial time on those instances whose associated item graphs have bounded treewidth (called structured item graphs). Formally, an item graph is a graph whose nodes are in one-to-one correspondence with items, and edges are such that for any bid, the items occurring in it induce a connected subgraph. Note that many item graphs might be associated with a given combinatorial auction, depending on the edges selected for guaranteeing the connectedness. In fact, the tractability of determining whether a structured item graph of a fixed treewidth exists (and if so, computing one) was left as a crucial open problem.In this paper, we solve this problem by proving that the existence of a structured item graph is computationally intractable, even for treewidth 3. Motivated by this bad news, we investigate different kinds of structural requirements that can be used to isolate tractable classes of combinatorial auctions. We show that the notion of hypertree decomposition, a recently introduced measure of hypergraph cyclicity, turns out to be most useful here. Indeed, we show that the winner determination problem is solvable in polynomial time on instances whose bidder interactions can be represented with (dual) hypergraphs having bounded hypertree width. Even more surprisingly, we show that the class of tractable instances identified by means of our approach properly contains the class of instances having a structured item graph.
