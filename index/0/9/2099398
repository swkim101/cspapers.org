The management of power consumption in datacenters has become an important problem. This needs a systematic evaluation of the as-is scenario to identify potential areas for improvement and quantify the impact of any strategy. We present a measurement study of a production datacenter from a joint perspective of power and performance at the individual server level. Our observations help correlate power consumption of production servers with their activity, and identify easily implementable improvements. We find that production servers are underutilized from an activity perspective; are overrated from a power perspective; execute temporally similar workloads over a granularity of weeks; do not idle efficiently; and have power consumptions that are well tracked by their CPU utilizations. Our measurements suggest the following steps for improvement: staggering periodic activities on servers; enabling deeper sleep states; and provisioning based on measurement.
