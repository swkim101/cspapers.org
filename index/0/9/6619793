We are exploring a system, called PROMPT, that will be capable of reasoning from first principles and high level knowledge in complex, physical domains. Such problem-solving calls for a representation that will support the different analyses techniques required (e.g. differential, asymptotic, perturbation etc.). Efficiency considerations require that the representation also support heuristic control of reasoning techniques. This paper lays the ground work for our effort by briefly describing the ontology and the representation scheme of PROMPT. Our ontology allows reasoning about multiple pasts and different happenings in the same space-time. The ontology provides important distinctions between materials, objects, bulk and distributed abstractions among physical entities. We organise world knowledgeinto "prototypes" that are used to focus the reasoning process. Problem-solving involves reasoning with and modifying prototypes.
