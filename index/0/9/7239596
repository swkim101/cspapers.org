We have developed a new course on Multimedia Technology, intended for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students majoring in either Computer Science or Computer Engineering. In this paper we describe the topics covered, the method of instruction, the work done by the students, and the facilities needed to teach such a course. The paper concludes with some feedback provided by students, and possible ways in which the course could be improved or extended.
