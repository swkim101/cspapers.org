Spearman's footrule and Kendall's tau are two well established distances between rankings. They, however, fail to take into account concepts crucial to evaluating a result set in information retrieval: element relevance and positional information. That is, changing the rank of a highly-relevant document should result in a higher penalty than changing the rank of an irrelevant document; a similar logic holds for the top versus the bottom of the result ordering. In this work, we extend both of these metrics to those with position and element weights, and show that a variant of the Diaconis-Graham inequality still holds - the generalized two measures remain within a constant factor of each other for all permutations.
 We continue by extending the element weights into a distance metric between elements. For example, in search evaluation, swapping the order of two nearly duplicate results should result in little penalty, even if these two are highly relevant and appear at the top of the list. We extend the distance measures to this more general case and show that they remain within a constant factor of each other.
 We conclude by conducting simple experiments on web search data with the proposed measures. Our experiments show that the weighted generalizations are more robust and consistent with each other than their unweighted counter-parts.
