An increasing fraction of the data disseminated through the the internet is time-varying (i.e., changes frequently). Examples of such data include sports information, news, and financial information such as stock prices. An important issue then is the maintenance of their temporal coherency. A user may be willing to receive sports and news information that may be out-of-sync by a few minutes with respect to the server, but may desire to have stronger coherency requirements for data items such as stock prices. We assume that a user specifies a temporal coherency requirement (tcr) for each item of interest. The value of tcr denotes the maximum permissible deviation of the presented value from the value at the server and thus constitutes the user-specified tolerance. We consider temporal coherency requirements specified in terms of the value of the object (maintaining temporal coherency specified in units of time is a simpler problem that requires less sophisticated techniques). As shown in Figure 1, let S(t), P (t) and U(t) denote the value of the data item at the server, proxy cache and the user, respectively. Then, to maintain temporal coherency we should have jU(t) S(t)j c:
