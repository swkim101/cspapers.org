Delaunay meshes with bounded circumradius to shortest edge length ratio have been proposed in the past for quality meshing. The only poor quality tetrahedra called slivers that can occur in such a mesh can be eliminated by the sliver exudation method. This method has been shown to work for periodic point sets, but not with boundaries. Recently a randomized point-placement strategy has been proposed to remove silvers while conforming to a given boundary. In this paper we present a deterministic algorithm for generating a weighted Delaunay mesh which respects the input boundary and has no poor quality tetrahedron including silvers. This success is achieved by combining the weight pumping method for sliver exudation and the Delaunay refinement method for boundary conformation. We show that an incremental weight pumping can be mixed seamlessly with vertex insertions in our weighted Delaunay refinement paradigm.
