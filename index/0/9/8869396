We compare SAT-checkers and decision diagrams on the evalua-tion of Boolean formulas produced in the formal verification of both correct and buggy versions of superscalar and VLIW micro-processors. We identify one SAT-checker that significantly out-performs the rest. We evaluate ways to enhance its performance by variations in the generation of the Boolean correctness formu-las. We reassess optimizations previously used to speed up the formal verification and probe future challenges.
