Distributed Real-time and Embedded (DRE) systems are becoming increasingly widespread and important in a range of domains, including process automation (e.g., hot rolling mills) and aviation (e.g., avionics mission computing systems). As distributed systems, DRE systems require capabilities to manage connections and message transfers between separate machines; as real-time systems, DRE systems require predictable and efficient control over endto-end system resources; and as embedded systems, DRE systems have weight, cost, and power constraints that limit their computing and memory resources. Designing DRE systems that (1) implement all the required capabilities, (2) are efficient and dependable, and (3) use limited computing resources is hard; building them on time and within budget is even harder. Researchers and developers of DRE systems must therefore address the following research challenges:
