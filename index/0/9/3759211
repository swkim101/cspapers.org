Extracting action sequences from texts is

challenging, as it requires commonsense inferences based on world

knowledge. Although there has been work on extracting action scripts,

instructions, navigation actions, etc., they require either the

set of candidate actions be provided in advance, or action

descriptions are restricted to a specific form, e.g., description

templates. In this paper we aim to extract action sequences from

texts in \emph{free} natural language, i.e., without any restricted

templates, provided the set of actions is unknown. We

propose to extract action sequences from texts based on the deep

reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we view ``selecting''

or ``eliminating'' words from texts as ``actions'', and texts associated with actions as ``states''. We build Q-networks to learn policies of extracting actions and extract plans from the labeled texts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several datasets with comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.
