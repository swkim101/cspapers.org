We encounter problems demanding efficient algorithmic solutions in all spheres of computer science. What then defines an “efficient” algorithm, and how do we design such an algorithm? Turns out that the answers to these questions depend on multiple factors, including the nature of the problem and the input, the computational model being used and the constraints under which our solution must operate, amongst others. In this topic we will explore a number of key factors and considerations relevant to these problems.
