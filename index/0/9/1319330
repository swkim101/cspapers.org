Most current methods for prediction of protein secondary structure use a small window of the protein sequence to predict the structure of the central amino acid. We describe a new method for prediction of the non-local structure called β-sheet, which consists of two or more β-strands that are connected by hydrogen bonds. Since β-strands are often widely separated in the protein chain, a network with two windows is introduced. After training on a set of proteins the network predicts the sheets well, but there are many false positives. By using a global energy function the β-sheet prediction is combined with a local prediction of the three secondary structures α-helix, β-strand and coil. The energy function is minimized using simulated annealing to give a final prediction.
