Cue phrases may be used in a discourse sense to explicitly signal discourse structure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than structural information. This paper explores the use of machine learning for classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning programs (CGRENDEL and C4.5) are used to induce classification rules from sets of pre-classified cue phrases and their features. Machine learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the generation of classification rules, but also for improving upon previous results.
