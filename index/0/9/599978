We show for several planar and geometric problems that the best known approximation schemes are essentially optimal with respect to the dependence on epsi. For example, we show that the 2<sup>O(1/epsi)</sup>ldrn time approximation schemes for planar maximum independent set and for TSP on a metric defined bv a planar graph are essentially optimal: if there is a delta>0 such that any of these problems admits a 2<sup>O((1/epsi)</sup> <sup>1-delta</sup> <sup>)</sup>n<sup>O(1)</sup> time PTAS, then the exponential tune hypothesis (ETH) fails. It is known that maximum independent set on unit disk graphs and the planar logic problems MPSAT. TMIN, TMAX admit n<sup>O(1/epsi)</sup> time approximation schemes. We show that they are optimal in the sense that if there is a delta>0 such that any of these problems admits a 2<sup>(1/epsi)</sup> <sup>O(1)</sup> n<sup>O((1/epsi)</sup> <sup>1-delta</sup> <sup>)</sup> time PTAS, then ETH fails.
