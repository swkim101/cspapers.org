The Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) is a member organization of more than 21,000 educators and supporters of K-12 computer science. It was formed by and is affiliated with ACM, but serves as an independent non-profit with a mission to support K-12 CS teachers and promote computer science education. The past year has been a landmark one for CSTA, with the hiring of a new Executive Director, Dr. Mark R. Nelson, as well as a number of new initiatives. These initiatives include a new Website, expanded member benefits, new partnerships and advocacy programs, and a greater emphasis on professional development and research. This session will provide a brief overview of some of these initiatives, as well as introduce plans for the organization that are currently in development. The majority of the session will be an open forum in which attendees will be encouraged to voice their opinions and provide feedback to the Executive Director and members of the CSTA Board of Directors in attendance. Current CSTA members, along with any SICGSE attendees who have an interest in K-12 CS education, are encouraged to attend, learn about CSTA's efforts, and share experiences that can guide the future of CSTA and K-12 CS education.
