One of the critical problems in putting AI applications into use in the real world is the lack of sufficient formal theories and practical took that aid the process of reliability assessment. Adhoc testing, which is widely used as a means of verification, serves limited purpose. A need for systematic verification by compile-time analysis exists. In this article, we focus our attention on OPS5-based AI applications and present a methodology for verification which is based on compile-time analysis. The methodology is based on the principle of converting the antecedent and action-parts of productions into a linear system of inequalities and equalities and testing them for a feasible solution. The implemented system, called SVEPOA, supports interactive and incremental analysis.
