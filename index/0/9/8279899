We propose a dance partner robot referred to as Ms DanceR (Mobile Smart Dance Robot), which has been developed as platform for realizing the effective human-robot coordination with physical interaction. Ms DanceR consists of an omni-directional mobile base and a Body Force Sensor, which is a force/torque sensor installed between the mobile base and the body of the robot. A human could dance a ballroom dance together with Ms DanceR based on a control architecture referred to as "CAST" (Control Architecture based-on Step Transition), which was designed according to features of ballroom dances.
