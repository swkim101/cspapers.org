Robustness to failures is an important issue to be considered when designing a database management system. A design of a reliable storage component of a distributed database management systerm (DDBMS) is presented in this paper. This design builds on several existing ideas and adds some other crash recovery strategies. The result is an integrated design which can lead to a direct implementation. The interface between the storage component and the rest of the DDBMS is composed of a set of functions which are described bere along with the update strategy used to implement them. A summary of performance analysis results in terms of the price paid to achieve a robust design is also given.
