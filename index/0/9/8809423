Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) was recently employed in the HCI domain to detect hand gestures using an instrumented smartwatch. This prior work demonstrated great promise for non-invasive, high accuracy recognition of gestures for interactive control. We introduce a new system that offers improved sampling speed and resolution. In turn, this enables superior interior reconstruction and gesture recognition. More importantly, we use our new system as a vehicle for experimentation ' we compare two EIT sensing methods and three different electrode resolutions. Results from in-depth empirical evaluations and a user study shed light on the future feasibility of EIT for sensing human input.
