Enhancement of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) by improving the network performance has been researched in recent years. This paper presents the application of queuing theory to evaluate performance of WSNs using queuing network models. The analysis of performance parameters consider both kinds of data and routing packets. Moreover, the optimal values of parameters such as service rate and queue length of each sensor node are also investigated under the consideration of lossy WSNs with the coverage of signal transmission and packet loss ratio. The results of the proposed analytical model is compared with the simulation results in various scenarios for validation.
