This paper presents CROWN, an automatically constructed extension of WordNet that augments its taxonomy with novel lemmas from Wiktionary. CROWN fills the important gap in WordNetâ€™s lexicon for slang, technical, and rare lemmas, and more than doubles its current size. In two evaluations, we demonstrate that the construction procedure is accurate and has a significant impact on a WordNet-based algorithm encountering novel lemmas.
