We present the first planner capable of reasoning with both the full semantics of PDDL2.1 (level 3) temporal planning and with numeric resources. Our planner, CRIKEY3, employs heuristic forward search, using the start-and-end semantics of PDDL2.1 to manage temporal actions. The planning phase is interleaved with a scheduling phase, using a Simple Temporal Network, in order to ensure that temporal constraints are met. To guide search, we introduce a new temporal variant of the Relaxed Planning Graph heuristic that is capable of reasoning with the features of this class of domains, along with the Timed Initial Literals of PDDL2.2. CRIKEY3 extends the state-of-the-art in handling the full temporal expressive power of PDDL2.1, including numeric temporal domains.
