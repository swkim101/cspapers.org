There are two major challenges in universal stair climbing: stairs without riser and with nose, and stairs with various dimensions. In this study, we proposed an indoor robot platform to overcome these challenges. First, to create an angle of attack, the Tusk, a passive, protruded element, was added in front of a 4-wheel robot. For design analysis and optimization of the Tusk, a simplified model of universal stair climbing was applied. To accommodate stairs without risers and with nose, the assistive track mechanism was applied. To climb the stair regardless of its dimension, length-adjustable mechanism was added. The results indicated the robot with these mechanisms successfully overcame each challenge. The performance was better than most conventional stair-climbing robots in terms of the range of compatible stairs. We expect these new approaches to expand the range of indoor robot operation with minimal cost.
