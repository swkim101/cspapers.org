This paper presents a new hybrid path planning approach for autonomous robots navigating in natural unknown environments. The main purpose is to consider perception planning and path planning in a single unified process, so that the most relevant perception can be performed considering the current goal of the robot. We consider this approach as a way to fill the gap between navigation tasks and exploration tasks. In a first part, we introduce the models and notions used in this approach. We then give some algorithmic details, and finally present results in simulation.
