A typical Data Structures (CS 2) course covers a wide variety of topics: elementary algorithm analysis; data structures including dynamic structures, trees, tables, graphs, etc.; large programming projects; and more advanced object-oriented concepts. Integrating these topics into assignments is a challenging task; educators often duplicate work done by others in re-inventing such assignments. At the same time, these assignments and large programs take time to develop and are often changed from semester to semester to preclude cheating. We report on a project that provides modules containing many kinds of programming and lab assignments which can be re-used across semesters with accessible and exciting application-oriented materials. Our project is a collaboration between a research and teaching oriented private university, a teaching oriented public university, and a teaching oriented historically black university. This helps ensure that the modules will be accessible to nearly all student populations. The modules developed are available electronically as hyper-text documents.
