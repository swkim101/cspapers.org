Suppose one has a line arrangement in which many lines are parallel, so that the number of different line orientations is k, and one wants to find a shortest path from one point on a line in the arrangement to another such point. Using known techniques one can find the shortest path in time and space O(n*). We present an algorit.hm that can find the shortest path in time and spat; O(n + Ic*). derived from the nonconvex cells of the arrangement. However, these methods do not seem to generalize to arrangements with more than two orientations.
