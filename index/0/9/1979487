An optimal &OHgr;(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>2</supscrpt>) lower bound is shown for the time-space product of any <italic>R</italic>-way branching program that determines those values which occur exactly once in a list of <italic>n</italic> integers in the range [1, <italic>R</italic>] where <italic>R</italic> â‰¥ <italic>n</italic>. This &OHgr;(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>2</supscrpt>) tradeoff also applies to the sorting problem and thus improves the previous time-space tradeoffs for sorting. Because the <italic>R</italic>-way branching program is a such a powerful model these time-space product tradeoffs also apply to all models of sequential computation that have a fair measure of space such as off-line multi-tape Turing machines and off-line log-cost RAMs.
