We present an approach for extractive single-document summarization. Our approach is based on a weighted graphical representation of documents obtained by topic modeling. We optimize importance, coherence and non-redundancy simultaneously using ILP. We compare ROUGE scores of our system with state-of-the-art results on scientific articles from PLOS Medicine and on DUC 2002 data. Human judges evaluate the coherence of summaries generated by our system in comparision to two baselines. Our approach obtains competitive performance.
