In the era of electronic publishing, there is a need for a comprehensive Web Site Management System (WSMS) that provides an end-to-end solution ranging from integration of web sites to re-structuring and maintenance of new customized web views. Today, while many research efforts focus on generating diversified web sites, our Re-Web system [CRCK98] is the first to look at easing this process for end-users by providing libraries of pre-defined generic t ransformations for web re-structuring and visual tools for the generation and browsing of such transformations. Re-Web translates web information to an OO schema and data, re-structures and integrates information at the OODB level (SERF [CR99]) and finally generates web pages from the information in the database. The Re-Web system uses JDK1.2, Java Swing, and PSE Pro6.0 as its persistent storage. We use LotusXSL and IBM's XML parser for the web generation module. Re-Web system (Figure 1) has been implemented and tested on WinNT and Solaxis. I t provides tools for generating, restructuring and maintaining web sites.
