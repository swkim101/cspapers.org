This paper addresses the problem of producing a diverse set of plausible translations. We present a simple procedure that can be used with any statistical machine translation (MT) system. We explore three ways of using diverse translations: (1) system combination, (2) discriminative reranking with rich features, and (3) a novel post-editing scenario in which multiple translations are presented to users. We find that diversity can improve performance on these tasks, especially for sentences that are difficult for MT.
