The notion of infix probability has been introduced in the literature as a generalization of the notion of prefix (or initial substring) probability, motivated by applications in speech recognition and word error correction. For the case where a probabilistic context-free grammar is used as language model, methods for the computation of infix probabilities have been presented in the literature, based on various simplifying assumptions. Here we present a solution that applies to the problem in its full generality.
