Chinese input is one of the key challenges for Chinese PC users. This paper proposes a statistical approach to Pinyin-based Chinese input. This approach uses a trigram-based language model and a statistically based segmentation. Also, to deal with real input, it also includes a typing model which enables spelling correction in sentence-based Pinyin input, and a spelling model for English which enables modeless Pinyin input.
