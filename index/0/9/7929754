We describe an efficient algorithm for localizing a mobile robot in an environment with landmarks. We assume that the robot has a camera and maybe other sensors that enable it to both identify landmarks and measure the angles subtended by these landmarks. We show how to estimate the robot's position using a new technique that involves a complex number representation of the landmarks. Our algorithm runs in time linear in the number of landmarks. We present results of our simulations and propose how to use our method for robot navigation.<<ETX>>
