Innovation contests have emerged as a viable alternative to the standard research and development process. They are particularly suited for settings that feature a high degree of uncertainty regarding the actual feasibility of the end goal. The objective of the contest designer is to maximize the probability of reaching the innovation goal while minimizing the time it takes to complete the project. Obviously here the important question is how to best design these contests. This paper departs from prior literature through three key modeling features. First, in our model, an agent's progress towards the goal is not a deterministic function of effort. As is typically the case in real-world settings, progress is positively correlated with effort but the mapping involves a stochastic component. Secondly and quite importantly, it is possible that the innovation in question is not attainable, either because the goal is actually infeasible or because it requires too much effort and resources that it makes little economic sense to pursue. We model such a scenario by having an underlying state of the world (whether the innovation is attainable or not) over which participants have some prior belief. Taken together, these two features imply that an agent's lack of progress may be attributed to either an undesirable underlying state (the innovation is not attainable) or simply to the fact that the agent was unlucky in how her effort was stochastically mapped to progress. Thirdly, we consider a dynamic framework that captures how competition between agents evolves over time and incorporates the fact that agents learn from each other's partial progress to discern the underlying reason for their own lack of progress. In particular, our modeling setup includes well-defined intermediate milestones that constitute partial progress towards the end goal.
