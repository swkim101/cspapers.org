The development of a new routing metric that uses hop-count, path load and wireless path loss rate as the basis for selecting paths to SAPs is discussed. The synchronous link-layer NACKs were send when the instantaneous queue size at a node exceeded a high-water threshold. The network used hop-by-hop flow control to reduce congestion-related packet losses proactively avoiding paths that had higher traffic load. Analysis shows that each node propagates the three different quantities in distance-vector fashion corresponding to the path to the node's estimate of the 'best' SAP.
