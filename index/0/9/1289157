The conference this year is the tenth anniversary of UIST. The keynote talk discusses the history of UIST over the last ten years; this panel looks into the future of the field over the next ten. Each of the panelists will describe a scenario for what life will be like when we meet for UIST’O’I, ten years from now. They will also have a chance to challenge or question each others’ scenarios and to participate in open discussion with the audience.
