Nowadays Internet is ubiquitous resulting in an increasing path diversity and content duplication. However, while content can be retrieved from many different places, the paths to those places are not equivalent. Indeed, some paths offer better bandwidth while others are less expensive or more stable. In addition, a new range of applications is sensitive to the performance of the paths that carry their traffic. To support this evolution of the Internet, we propose ISP-Driven Informed Path Selection (IDIPS). Any ISP can easily deploy IDIPS to help its customers to select the paths that best meet their requirements in order to reach their content. IDIPS helps in this selection through pro-active measurements and ISP-defined policies. IDIPS is scalable and can support thousands of clients. IDIPS is also flexible and can thus be used by the ISP to optimize its routing decisions to take the performance of its inter-domain links into account.
