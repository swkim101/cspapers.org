The ubiquity of mobile devices and the popularity of location-based-services have generated, for the first time, rich datasets of people's location information at a very high fidelity. These location datasets can be used to study people's behavior - for example, social studies have shown that people, who are seen together frequently at the same place and at the same time, are most probably socially related. In this paper, we are interested in inferring these social connections by analyzing people's location information, which is useful in a variety of application domains from sales and marketing to intelligence analysis. In particular, we propose an entropy-based model (EBM) that not only infers social connections but also estimates the strength of social connections by analyzing people's co-occurrences in space and time. We examine two independent ways: diversity and weighted frequency, through which co-occurrences contribute to social strength. In addition, we take the characteristics of each location into consideration in order to compensate for cases where only limited location information is available. We conducted extensive sets of experiments with real-world datasets including both people's location data and their social connections, where we used the latter as the ground-truth to verify the results of applying our approach to the former. We show that our approach outperforms the competitors.
