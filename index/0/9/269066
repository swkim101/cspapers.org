We examine the feasibility of harvesting a wide-coverage lexicon of English verbs from the FrameNet semantically annotated corpus, intended for use in a practical natural language understanding (NLU) system. We identify a range of constructions for which current annotation practice leads to problems in deriving appropriate lexical entries, for example imperatives, passives and control, and discuss potential solutions.
