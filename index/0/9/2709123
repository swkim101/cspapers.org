Precise failure analysis requires accurate fault diagnosis. A previously proposed method for diagnosing bridging faults using single stuck-at dictionaries was applied only to small circuits, produced large and imprecise diagnoses, and did not take into account the Byzantine Generals Problem for bridging faults. We analyze the original technique and improve it by introducing the concepts of match restriction, match requirement, and failure recovery. Our new technique, which requires no information other than that used by standard stuck-at methods, produces diagnoses that are an order of magnitude smaller than those produced by the original technique and produces many fewer misleading diagnoses than that of traditional stuck-at diagnosis.
