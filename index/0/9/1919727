Prolonging the lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSN) is one of the most important goals in the sensor network research. A lot of work has been done to achieve this goal; however, current definition of lifetime is either superficial or impractical. In this paper, we take the first step to modeling the lifetime of a wireless sensor network by considering the relationship between the whole sensor network and individual sensors, as well as the importance of different sensors based on their positions. We envision that the proposed lifetime model can be used to evaluate energy-efficient protocols and algorithms, which is validated by simulation results.
