Learning by induction can require a large number of training examples. We show the power of using a simulator to generate training data and test data in learning rules for an expert system. The induction program is RL, a simplified version of Meta-DENDRAL. The expert system is ABLE, a rule-based system that identifies and locates errors in particle beam lines used in high energy physics. A simulator of beam lines allowed forming and testing rules on sufficient numbers of cases that ABLE's performance is demonstrably accurate and precise.
