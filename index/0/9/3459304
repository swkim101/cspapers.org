This study presents and evaluates a scalable approach for improving learning outcomes by having students "teach" peers in the same course via video. The approach was tested in a standard upper-level undergraduate computer algorithms course with material commonly considered challenging to teach: combinatorial optimization and NP-complete problems. An important design goal was to incentivize students to learn deeply in crafting their instructional videos while minimizing the added burden on instructors to review their products, allowing for scalability. A learning assessment administered to two successive cohorts (N=89) showed statistically significant improvement (P<0.0001) in learning for students who make the videos compared to those who merely study the materials or view the videos. Students not only enjoyed applying their creativity in making videos but, in the process, also strengthened their conceptual learning. While much of the existing research on student-created videos has shown its effectiveness in motivating students, few studies exist that directly isolate learning gains in those who craft instructional videos.
