We present a rigorous framework for analyzing timestampbased concurrency control and recovery algorithms for nested transactions. We define a local correctness property, local static atomic@, that affords useful modularity. We show that local static atomicity of each object is sufficient to ensure global serializability. We present generalizations of algorithms due to Reed and Herlihy, and show that each ensures local static atomicity.
