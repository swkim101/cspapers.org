Statistical models on full and partial rankings of n items are often of limited practical use for large n due to computational consideration. We explore the use of non-parametric models for partially ranked data and derive efficient procedures for their use for large n. The derivations are largely possible through combinatorial and algebraic manipulations based on the lattice of partial rankings. In particular, we demonstrate for the first time a non-parametric coherent and consistent model capable of efficiently aggregating partially ranked data of different types.
