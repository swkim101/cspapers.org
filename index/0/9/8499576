Video magnification reveals subtle variations that would be otherwise invisible to the naked eye. Current techniques require all motion in the video to be very small, which is unfortunately not always the case. Tiny yet meaningful motions are often combined with larger motions, such as the small vibrations of a gate as it rotates, or the microsaccades in a moving eye. We present a layer-based video magnification approach that can amplify small motions within large ones. An examined region/layer is temporally aligned and subtle variations are magnified. Matting is used to magnify only region of interest while maintaining integrity of nearby sites. Results show handling larger motions, larger amplification factors and significant reduction in artifacts over state of the art.
