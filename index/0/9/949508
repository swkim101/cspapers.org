Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are widely used to perform information gathering missions in unseen environments. Given the sheer size of the ocean environment, and the time and energy constraints of an AUV, it is important to consider the potential utility of candidate missions when performing survey planning. In this paper, we utilise a multimodal learning approach to capture the relationship between in-situ visual observations, and shipborne bathymetry (ocean depth) data that are freely available a priori. We then derive information-theoretic measures under this model that predict the amount of visual information gain at an unobserved location based on the bathymetric features. Unlike previous approaches, these measures consider the value of additional visual features, rather than just the habitat labels obtained. Experimental results with a toy dataset and real marine data demonstrate that the approach can be used to predict the true utility of unexplored areas.
