We present an approach to laser-based people tracking using a multi-hypothesis tracker that detects and tracks legs separately with Kalman filters, constant velocity motion models, and a multi-hypothesis data association strategy. People are defined as high-level tracks consisting of two legs that are found with little model knowledge. We extend the data association so that it explicitly handles track occlusions in addition to detections and deletions. Additionally, we adapt the corresponding probabilities in a situation-dependent fashion so as to reflect the fact that legs frequently occlude each other. Experimental results carried out with a mobile robot illustrate that our approach can robustly and efficiently track multiple people even in situations of high levels of occlusion.
