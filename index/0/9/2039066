Although researchers have conducted extensive studies on relation extraction in the last decade, supervised approaches are still limited because they require large amounts of training data to achieve high performances. To build a relation extractor without significant annotation effort, we can exploit cross-lingual annotation projection, which leverages parallel corpora as external resources for supervision. This paper proposes a novel graph-based projection approach and demonstrates the merits of it by using a Korean relation extraction system based on projected dataset from an English-Korean parallel corpus.
