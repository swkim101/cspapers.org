Data clustering amounts to a combinatorial optimization problem to reduce the complexity of a data representation and to increase its precision. Central and pairwise data clustering are studied in the maximum entropy framework. For central clustering we derive a set of reestimation equations and a minimization procedure which yields an optimal number of clusters, their centers and their cluster probabilities. A meanfield approximation for pairwise clustering is used to estimate assignment probabilities. A selfconsistent solution to multidimensional scaling and pairwise clustering is derived which yields an optimal embedding and clustering of data points in a d-dimensional Euclidian space.
