ASNs are emergent networks of service-based applications (nodes) which collaborate through agile (i.e. adaptable) transactions. GSE comprises the management of project teams distanced in both space and time, collaborating in the same development effort. The GSE condition poses challenges both technical (e.g. geolocalization of resources, information continuity between timezones, etc.) and social (e.g. collaboration between different cultures, fear of competition, etc.). ASNs can be used to build an adaptable social network (ASNGSE) supporting the collaborations (edges of ASNGSE) of GSE teams (nodes of ASNGSE).
