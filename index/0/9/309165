In this paper we introduce a biped foot placement controller based on capture point (CP) feedback control. This capture point feedback controller generates desired Zero Moment Point (ZMP) according to current capture point error. We call this desired ZMP as Control-ZMP (cZMP). Using this cZMP, we constructed (i) a disturbance adapting walking pattern generator, (ii) an ankle torque reference generator, (iii) a landing foot position adjustor and, (iv) a step time adjustor. By applying these controllers, the biped system becomes robust over uneven terrain and external pushing disturbances. We considered cZMP as a key indicator of bipedal walking stability. If the cZMP is within the support polygon, the robot will track the cZMP by using (i) and (ii). If the cZMP is outside of the support polygon, the robot will change footstep position and time by using (iii) and (iv) (COM pattern will be changed by (i) too). Capture point dynamics is described based on a linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model. The performance of the suggested control algorithm is validated in the Choreonoid simulator with a model of DRC-HUBO+ [11], [12].
