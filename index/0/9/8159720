IPTV, which is based on the universal IP infrastructure, has the inherent nature of heterogeneity in terms of contents, networks, terminals, and users. An important solution to cope with such heterogeneity is content adaptation. This paper reviews the standardization issues related to content adaptation in IPTV standards. We first describe the basic architecture of content adaptation and its integration into the ITU-T IPTV architecture. Then typical methods of content adaptation in practical IPTV systems are discussed in detail. Especially, we highlight the standard metadata tools that are potential to support adaptation methods within ITU-T IPTV architecture. Some recent developments in other standard bodies are also discussed.
