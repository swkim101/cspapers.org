We present methods for finding experts (and their contact details) using e-mail messages. We locate messages on a topic, and then find the associated experts. Our approach is unsupervised: both the list of potential experts and their personal details are obtained automatically from e-mail message headers and signatures, respectively. Evaluation is done using the e-mail lists in the W3C corpus.
