Biterm Topic Model (BTM) is designed to model the generative process of the word co-occurrence patterns in short texts such as tweets. However, two aspects of BTM may restrict its performance: 1) user individualities are ignored to obtain the corpus level words co-occurrence patterns; and 2) the strong assumptions that two co-occurring words will be assigned the same topic label could not distinguish background words from topical words. In this paper, we propose Twitter-BTM model to address those issues by considering user level personalization in BTM. Firstly, we use user based biterms aggregation to learn user specific topic distribution. Secondly, each userâ€™s preference between background words and topical words is estimated by incorporating a background topic. Experiments on a large-scale real-world Twitter dataset show that Twitter-BTM outperforms several stateof-the-art baselines.
