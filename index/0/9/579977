In this paper, we propose a proximal Alternating Direction Method (ADM) for the well-known semi-definite rank regularized minimization problem. Specifically, we first reformulate this NP-hard problem as an equivalent biconvex MPEC (Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints), and then solve it using proximal ADM, which involves solving a sequence of structured convex semi-definite subproblems to find a desirable solution to the original rank regularized optimization problem. Moreover, based on the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality, we prove that the proposed method always converges to a KKT stationary point under mild conditions. We apply the proposed method to the widely studied and popular sensor network localization problem. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank semi-definite minimization algorithms in terms of solution quality.
