In this paper, we present a digital information retrieval systemThe digital information (images) include both low Ieve features such as color, texture, shape and high level features such as spatial constraints of relevant regions and keywords. Features are powerfully represented. For example, shape features are encoded for scale, rotation and translation invariance. Based on object technology, the digital information features and behaviors are modeled and stored in a database. Images can be retrieved by examples (show me images similar to this image) or by selecting properties from pickers such as a sketched shape, a color histogram, a spatial constraint interface, a list of keywords and a combination of these. The integration of high and low level features in the object-oriented database is animportant property of our work.
