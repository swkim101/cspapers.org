We analyze the evolution of smartphone usage from a dataset obtained from three, 15-day-long, user-side, measurements with over 1500 recruited smartphone users in the Greater Tokyo area from 2013 to 2015. This dataset shows users across a diverse range of networks; cellular access (3G to LTE), WiFi access (2.4 to 5GHz), deployment of more public WiFi access points (APs), as they use diverse applications such as video, file synchronization, and major software updates. Our analysis shows that smartphone users select appropriate network interfaces taking into account the deployment of emerging technologies, their bandwidth demand, and their economic constraints. Thus, users show diversity in both how much traffic they send, as well as on what networks they send it. We show that users are gradually but steadily adopting WiFi at home, in offices, and public spaces over these three years. The majority of light users have been shifting their traffic to WiFi. Heavy hitters acquire more bandwidth via WiFi, especially at home. The percentage of users explicitly turning off their WiFi interface during the day decreases from 50% to 40%. Our results highlight that the offloading environment has been improved during the three years, with more than 40% of WiFi users connecting to multiple WiFi APs in one day. WiFi offload at offices is still limited in our dataset due to a few accessible APs, but WiFi APs in public spaces have been an alternative to cellular access for users who request not only simple connectivity but also bandwidth-consuming applications such as video streaming and software updates.
