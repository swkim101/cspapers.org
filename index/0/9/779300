The GCD test and the Banerjee-Wolfe test are the two tests traditionally used to determine statement data dependence, subject to direction vectors, in automatic vectorization / parallelization of loops. In an earlier study [14] a sufficient condition for the accuracy of the Banerjee-Wolfe test was stated and proved. In the original presentation only the case of general data dependence was considered, i.e., the case of data dependence without direction vector information. In this paper we extend the previous work to the case of data dependence subject to an arbitrary direction vector. We also state and prove a sufficient condition for the accuracy of a combination of the GCD and the Banerjee-Wolfe test. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be used in actual practice to obtain exact data dependence information.
