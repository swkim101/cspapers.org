Time is a foundational aspect of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Correct time and timing of system events are critical to optimized responsiveness to the environment, in terms of timeliness, accuracy, and precision in the knowledge, measurement, prediction, and control of CPS behavior. However, both the specification and verification of timing requirements of the CPS are typically done in an ad-hoc manner. While feasible, the system can become costly and difficult to analyze and maintain, and the process of implementing and verifying correct timing behavior can be errorprone. Towards the development of a verification testbed for testing timing behavior in tools and platforms with explicit time support, this paper first describes a way to express the various kinds of timing constraints in distributed CPS. Then, we outline the design and initial implementation of a distributed testbed to verify the timing of a distributed CPS analytically through a systematic framework. Finally, we illustrate the use of the verified timing testbed on two distributed CPS case studies.
