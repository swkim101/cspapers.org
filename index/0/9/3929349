This demonstration will illustrate interactive computer games intended to help a native speaker of English learn Mandarin. These systems provide users with humanlike conversational exercises with contextualized help mechanisms. Two distinctly different activities, a translation game and a dialogue game are illustrated. The level of difficulty can be manipulated, and the sentence variations covered by the systems familiarize users with different expressions of the same meaning. The systems preserve the qualities of a typical computer system, being infinitely patient and available any time of day. Students will be able to repeatedly practice conversation with no embarrassment.
