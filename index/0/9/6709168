We present a Czech-English statistical machine translation system which performs tree-to-tree translation of dependency structures. The only bilingual resource required is a sentence-aligned parallel corpus. All other resources are monolingual. We also refer to an evaluation method and plan to compare our system's output with a benchmark system.
