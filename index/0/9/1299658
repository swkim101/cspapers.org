Nowadays, some developments in the vehicle industry permit a safe and comfortable driving. However, several manufactures and research groups are still working in the improvement of the control strategies and path smoothing algorithms. In this paper, a new trajectory generation approach for autonomous vehicles in urban scenarios, considering parametric equations, is proposed. An algorithm that considers Bezier curves and circumference parametric equations for a real vehicle, specifically in roundabout and urban intersections is presented. This approach is generated in real time and can be adapted to dynamic changes in the route. A smooth trajectory generator computationally efficient and easily implementable is proposed. Moreover, this new trajectory generator reduces the control actions, generated with to a fuzzy controller. Some trials have been performed in an urban circuit with promising performance.
