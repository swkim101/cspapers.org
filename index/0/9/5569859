In this paper, we describe a customized instructional content delivery system named ProgrammingLand with special emphasis on a program evaluation module named TorqueMOODa. The system is fully online and is used as a component of several classroom courses, as well the foundation of comparable distance education classes. The context of these systems is the early programming classes often taken by introductory Computer Science students, among others.
