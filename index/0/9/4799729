The Web has become the largest information repository over the world. Therefore, effectively and efficiently searching the Web becomes a key challenge. Previous research on Web search mainly attempts to exploit the text in the Web pages and the link information between the pages. This paper shows that the Web search performance can be enhanced if image information is considered. In detail, a new Web search framework is proposed, where image snippets are extracted for the Web pages, which are then provided along with text snippets to the user such that it is much easier and more accurate for the user to identify the Web pages he or she expects and to reformulate the initial query. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the promise of the proposed framework.
