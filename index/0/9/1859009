Reacting to challenges that have been observed in human-computer interaction (HCI) education, as well as the multidisciplinary design, science, and engineering underpinnings, we investigate a pedagogical approach based on case methods. Our study of various case method techniques in an undergraduate HCI class provides insights into challenges that can be expected in the employment of case methods, student learning outcomes, and considerations for HCI curriculum planning. In general, case methods show great promise with a wide variety of topics, and we present broad recommendations for future work that will improve integration of HCI professional practice, research, and education.
