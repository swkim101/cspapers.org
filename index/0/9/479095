This paper describes an underwater walking robotic system being developed under the name AQUA, the goals of the AQUA project, the overall hardware and software design, the basic hardware and sensor packages that have been developed, and some initial experiments. The robot is based on the RHex hexapod robot and uses a suite of sensing technologies, primarily based on computer vision and INS, to allow it to navigate and map clear shallow-water environments. The sensor-based navigation and mapping algorithms are based on the use of both artificial floating visual and acoustic landmarks as well as on naturally occurring underwater landmarks and trinocular stereo.
