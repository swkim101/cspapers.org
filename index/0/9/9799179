Sensors that know their location, from microphones to vibration sensors, can support a wider arena of applications than their location unaware counterparts. We offer a method for sensors to determine their own location relative to one another by using only exogenous sounds and the differences in the arrivals of these sounds at different sensors. We present a distributed and computationally efficient solution that offers accuracy on par with more active and computationally intense methods.
