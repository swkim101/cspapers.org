One important process in oil refining is to separate the crude oil into various oil products. This process is called distillation. In designing a complex distillation column, a large computer simulation is conducted. This paper presents our experience with parallelizing an oil refining simulation application that computes the composition of the various oil products in designed refining columns operated under a given set of conditions. Mathematical models for the simulation form large sparse nonlinear systems of equations. Triangular decompositions of sparse nonlinear systems are fundamental numerical methods in this simulation computing. Different approaches have been applied to carry out this simulation in parallel. Parallelisms of the simulation are exploited at three levelsâ€”direct parallelization, structured parallelization and a synchronous parallelization of the problem. The approaches of this practical research provide insight into some important issues of parallel computing for real-world applications. The parallel programs were implemented and run on the Intel iPSC/860. Parallel computing results are presented with comparisons and discussions.
