Eye tracking experiments have shown that titles of Web search results play a crucial role in guiding a user's search process. We present a machine-learned algorithm that trains a boosted tree to pick the most relevant title for a Web search result. We compare two modeling approaches: i) using absolute editorial judgments and ii) using pairwise preference judgments. We find that the pairwise modeling approach gives better results in terms of three offline metrics. We present results of our models in four regions. We also describe a hybrid user satisfaction evaluation process -- search success -- that combines page relevance and user click behavior, and show that our machine-learned algorithm improves in search success.
