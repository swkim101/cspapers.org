In this paper, we study the maintenance of role-based access control (RBAC) models in database environments using transitive closure relations. In particular, the algorithms that express and remove redundancy from a component, a RBAC state, and from conflict constraints. The transitive closure relations on a RBAC state specify the reachability among user groups, roles and from user groups to roles. These relations can assist the process of authorization and make some queries easier to answer. Paper [17] shows that the transitive closure relations on a RBAC model can be used to manage and maintain the model's dynamic changes in a simple and efficient way. In this paper, we firstly show that the transitive closure relations are natural byproducts when formulating RBAC components. We then adapt the conventional RBAC model to accord the inherent reachability of a RBAC model. We show that the use of transitive closure relations as the auxiliary relations for the maintenance of a RBAC state alleviates the process of query evaluation, removing redundancy and the description of hierarchies. Thirdly, in the presence of conflict constraints, we explain how conflicts can be expressed, checked and evaluated under the existence of TC relations, in addition to the removal of conflicts redundancy and finding inferred conflicts. Lastly, we briefly discuss the first-order maintenance operations.All the algorithms for the maintenance are first-order algorithms with simple structures and can be implemented in SQL.
