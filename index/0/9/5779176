NASA provides a wide variety of Earth-observing satellite data products to a diverse community. These data are annotated with quality information in a variety of ways, with the result that many users struggle to understand how to properly account for quality when dealing with satellite data. To address this issue, a Data Quality Screening Service (DQSS) is being implemented for a number of datasets. The DQSS will enable users to obtain data files in which low-quality pixels have been filtered out, based either on quality criteria recommended by the science team or on the user's particular quality criteria. The objective is to increase proper utilization of this critical quality data in science data analysis of satellite data products.
