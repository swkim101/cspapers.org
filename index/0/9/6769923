Constructing time decompositions of time stamped documents is an important first step in extracting temporal information from a document set. Efficient algorithms are described for computing optimal lossy decompositions for a given document set, where the loss of information is constrained to be within a specified bound. A novel and efficient algorithm is proposed for computing information loss values required to construct optimal lossy decompositions. Experimental results are reported comparing optimal lossy decompositions and equal length decompositions in terms of a number of parameters such as information loss. In particular, our results show that optimal lossy decompositions outperform equal length decompositions by preserving more of the information content of the underlying document set. The results also demonstrate that permitting even small amounts of variability in the length of the subintervals of a decomposition results in capturing more of the temporal information content of a document set when compared to equal length decompositions. This paper builds upon our earlier work on time decompositions where the problem of computing optimal lossy decomposition of the time period associated with a document set was first formulated.
