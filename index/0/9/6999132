Query learning models from computational learning theory (CLT) can be adopted to perform elicitation in combinatorial auctions. Indeed, a recent elicitation framework demonstrated that the equivalence queries of CLT can be usefully simulated with price-based demand queries. In this paper, we validate the flexibility of this framework by defining a learning algorithm for atomic bidding languages, a class that includes XOR and OR. We also handle incentives, characterizing the communication requirements of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves outcome rule. This motivates an extension to the earlier learning framework that brings truthful responses to queries into an equilibrium.
