StorM is a storage manager, consisting of a set of classes and objects for the development and tuning of non-standard data intensive applications in Java. It is entirely written in Java (JDK 1.2), and hence it does not require a special compiler or a special abstract machine or a set of (possibly OS speci c) native methods. Exploiting the serialization properties of Java objects, StorM o ers support for persistence for almost an y Java object, and support for an independent notion of persistent homogeneous collection of Java objects. Since StorM aims at pro viding suitable support for a wide range of applications, it has been designed with an emphasis on extensibility.
