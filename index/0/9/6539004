Most of the current work on corpus annotation is concentrated on morphemics, lexical semantics and sentence structure. However, it becomes more and more obvious that attention should and can be also paid to phenomena that reflect the links between a sentence and its context, i.e. the discourse anchoring of utterances. If conceived in this way, an annotated corpus can be used as a resource for linguistic research not only within the limits of the sentence, but also with regard to discourse patterns. Thus, the applications of the research to issues of information retrieval and extraction may be made more effective; also applications in new domains become feasible, be it to serve for inner linguistic (and literary) aims, such as text segmentation, specification of topics of parts of a discourse, or for other disciplines.
