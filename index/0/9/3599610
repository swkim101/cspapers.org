Booming interest in computer science and innovations in the way we teach it have allowed us to teach a larger, more demographically and geographically diverse group of students. One of the new challenges facing us now is that it can be harder for instructors to get to know many of their students, and for students to connect with their peers. Building community in our physical and virtual classrooms is difficult, but important for the success and learning experience of our students. Community is especially important for "non-traditional" CS students, who are more likely to struggle with imposter syndrome, or to feel like they don't belong in a CS classroom. Building Community in Large or Virtual Classrooms In this BoF session, we'll discuss the strategies, activities, and interventions we've tried and found successful or unsuccessful in building course community, and helping students believe they belong in CS.
