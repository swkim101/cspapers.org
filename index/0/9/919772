As disk arrays become widely used, tools for understanding and analyzing their performance become increasingly important. In particular, performance models can be invaluable in both configuring and designing disk arrays. Accurate analytic performance models are preferable to other types of models because they can be quickly evaluated, are applicable under a wide range of system and workload parameters, and can be manipulated by a range of mathematical techniques. Unfortunately, analytic performance models of disk arrays are difficult to formulate due to the presence of queueing and fork-join synchronization; a disk array request is broken up into independent disk requests which must all complete to satisfy the original request. In this paper, we develop and validate an analytic performance model for disk arrays. We derive simple equations for approximating their utilization, response time and throughput. We validate the analytic model via simulation, investigate the error introduced by each approximation used in deriving the analytic model, and examine the validity of some of the conclusions that can be drawn from the model.
