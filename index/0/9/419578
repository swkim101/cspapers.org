For the past two years,there has been a significant increase in research activities related to studying and modeling the Internet's topology, especially at the level of autonomous systems (ASs). A closer look at the measurements that form the basis for all these studies reveals that the data sets used consist of the BGP routing tables collected by the Oregon route server (henceforth, the Oregon route-views) [1]. So far, there has been anecdotal evidence and an intuitive understanding among researchers in the field that BGP-derived AS connectivity is not complete. However, as far as we know, there has been no systematic study on quantifying the completeness of currently known AS-level Internet topologies. Our main objective in this paper is to quantify the completeness of Internet AS maps constructed from the Oregon route-views and to attempt to capture more representative AS-level Internet topology. One of the main contributions of this paper is in developing a methodology that enables quantitative investigations into issues related to the (in)completeness of BGP-derived AS maps.
