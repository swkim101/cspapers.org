Many algorithms of computer vision use light sources to illuminate objects to actively create situation appropriate to extract their characteristics. For example, the shape and reflectance are measured by a projector-camera system, and some human-machine or VR systems use projectors and displays for interaction. As existing active lighting systems usually assume no severe external lights to observe projected lights clearly, it is one of the limitations of active illumination. In this paper, we propose a method of energy-efficient active illumination in an environment with severe external lights. The proposed method extracts the light signals of illuminants by removing external light using spread spectrum modulation. Because an image sequence is needed to observe modulated signals, the proposed method extends signal processing to realize signal detection projected onto moving objects by combining spread spectrum modulation and spatio-temporal filtering. In the experiments, we apply the proposed method to a structured-light system under sunlight, to photometric stereo with external lights, and to insensible image embedding.
