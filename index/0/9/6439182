The new areas of technical exploitation of robotics systems has recently set new trends for the robotic actuation by demanding more versatile systems which can cope with unpredictable interactions within not well defined environments and work in close vicinity with the human. Following these trends, this work presents the development of a new actuation system with embodied characteristics such as passive compliance and variable physical damping. Compared to the other existing compliant linear or rotary actuators the proposed CompAct unit has the ability to regulate the oscillations induced by the introduction of the compliance by means of a variable physical damping actuator (VPDA) unit. Apart from facilitating the control the VPDA unit can assist in managing the energy transfer from/to the compliant module. The mechatronics, model and control scheme of the CompAct are analysed. The overall system is evaluated with experimental trials performed using a prototype unit. Preliminary results are presented to show that the unit and the proposed control scheme are capable of regulating the impedance components (stiffness and damping) within a wide range and with good fidelity.
