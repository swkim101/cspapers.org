Size and code coverage are important attributes of a set of tests. When a program P is executed on elements of the test set T, we can observe the fault detecting capability of T for P. We can also observe the degree to which T induces code coverage on P according to some coverage criterion. We would like to know whether it is the size of T or the coverage of T on P which determines the fault detection effectiveness of T for P. To address this issue we ask the following question: While keeping coverage constant, what is the effect on fault detection of reducing the size of a test set? We report results from an empirical study using the block and all-uses criteria as the coverage measures.
