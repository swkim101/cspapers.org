Previous research on the localization of wireless capsule endoscopes with magnetic fields and sensors has typically utilized incremental methods. This paper provides a non-iterative solution to determine the six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) position and orientation of a wireless capsule endoscope being actuated by a rotating magnetic dipole. Non-iterative solutions in the past have only been used to locate immobile objects. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm calculates the 6-DOF position and orientation of capsules that are truly stationary as well as those that are operated in the “step-out” regime, where the magnetic field is rotated too quickly for the capsule to rotate synchronously, but the capsule does undergo chaotic movement.
