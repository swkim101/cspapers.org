Word-finding problems (anomia) are common in brain-damaged patients suffering from various types of aphasia. An algorithm is described which finds words for patients using a portable microprocessor-based speech prosthesis. The data-structures consist of a lexical-semantic memory which becomes reorganized over time depending on usage. The algorithm finds words based on partial information about them which is input by the user.
