In this paper, we propose an empirical likelihood (EL) based strategy for building confidence intervals for differences between two contrasting groups. The proposed method can deal with the situations when we know little prior knowledge about the two groups, which are referred to as non-parametric situations. We experimentally evaluate our method on UCI datasets and observe that proposed EL based method outperforms other methods.
