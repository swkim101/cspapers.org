When a query is submitted to a search engine, the search engine returns a dynamically generated result page containing the result records, each of which usually consists of a link to and/or snippet of a retrieved Web page. In addition, such a result page often also contains information irrelevant to the query, such as information related to the hosting site of the search engine and advertisements. In this paper, we present a technique for automatically producing wrappers that can be used to extract search result records from dynamically generated result pages returned by search engines. Automatic search result record extraction is very important for many applications that need to interact with search engines such as automatic construction and maintenance of metasearch engines and deep Web crawling. The novel aspect of the proposed technique is that it utilizes both the visual content features on the result page as displayed on a browser and the HTML tag structures of the HTML source file of the result page. Experimental results indicate that this technique can achieve very high extraction accuracy.
