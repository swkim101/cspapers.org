We create a statistical model for inferring hierarchical term relationships about a topic, given only a small set of example web pages on the topic, without prior knowledge of any hierarchical information. The model can utilize either the full text of the pages in the cluster or the context of links to the pages. To support the model, we use "ground truth" data taken from the category labels in the Open Directory. We show that the model accurately separates terms in the following classes: self terms describing the cluster, parent terms describing more general concepts, and child terms describing specializations of the cluster. For example, for a set of biology pages, sample parent, self, and child terms are science, biology, and genetics respectively. We create an algorithm to predict parent, self, and child terms using the new model, and compare the predictions to the ground truth data. The algorithm accurately ranks a majority of the ground truth terms highly, and identifies additional complementary terms missing in the Open Directory.
