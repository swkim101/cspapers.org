We propose a method to induce a realistic two-hand manipulation of virtual objects by representing their reactions to multiple contacts of hands and fingers in a unified way. One of the key problems in achieving physics-based virtual interaction is that there is no accurate haptic feedback to the user's hands and fingers, which must introduce a mismatch between the real hands and their virtual counterparts. This problem becomes more serious when multiple hands or fingers are involved to a single virtual object, for example, a hand-over situation from one hand to the other. The key contribution of this paper is to represent and describe the physical status of a virtual object in the local object space and to change the status in the object point of view in order to avoid its drastic changes by the physical-virtual mismatch. The experiments compare the performance of the proposed method with objects in different shapes when using 2D and 3D visualization devices.
