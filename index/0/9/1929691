This paper presents an axiomatic treatment of exception handling, based on the replacement model [16]. The replacement model, in contrast to other exception handling proposals, supports all the handler responses of resumption, termination, retry and exception propagation, within both statements and expressions, in a modular, simple and uniform fashion. The main result presented in this paper is that the semantics of all these handler responses can be captured using a simple axiomatic definition involving only two proof rules in addition to the rules defining the other aspects of the embedding programming language; these rules place no restrictions on allowable handler effects except for those resulting from scope rules. The model is suitable for any block-structured programming language. A syntactic extension and both operational and axiomatic semantic definitions for embedding the replacement model in ALGOL 68 ([15]) are presented in [16].
