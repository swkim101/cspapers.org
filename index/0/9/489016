We present a method for automatically learning inflectional classes and associated lemmas from morphologically annotated corpora. The method consists of a core languageindependent algorithm, which can be optimized for specific languages. The method is demonstrated on Egyptian Arabic and German, two morphologically rich languages. Our best method for Egyptian Arabic provides an error reduction of 55.6% over a simple baseline; our best method for German achieves a 66.7% error reduction.
