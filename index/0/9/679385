We introduce the Partial View Heat Kernel (PVHK) descriptor, for the purpose of 3D object representation and recognition from partial views, assumed to be partial object surfaces under self occlusion. PVHK describes partial views in a geometrically meaningful way, i.e., by establishing a unique relation between the shape of the view and the descriptor. PVHK is also stable with respect to sensor noise and therefore adequate for sensors, such as the current active 3D cameras. Furthermore, PVHK takes full advantage of the dual 3D/RGB nature of current sensors and seamlessly incorporates appearance information onto the 3D information. We formally define the PVHK descriptor, discuss related work, provide evidence of the PVHK properties and validate them in three purposefully diverse datasets, and demonstrate its potential for recognition tasks.
