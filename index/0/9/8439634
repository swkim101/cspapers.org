Object-oriented modeling has become the de-facto standard in the early phases of a software development process during the last decade. The current state-of-the-art is dominated by the existence of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), the development of which has been initiated and pushed by industry. This paper presents a list of requirements for an ideal object-oriented modeling language and compares it with the achievements of UML and other object-oriented modeling approaches. This forms the base for the discussion of a roadmap for object-oriented modeling, which is structured according to a classification scheme of six different themes, which are language-, modelor process-related, respectively.
