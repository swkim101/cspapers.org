This work presents a weakly supervised framework with deep neural networks for vision-based continuous sign language recognition, where the ordered gloss labels but no exact temporal locations are available with the video of sign sentence, and the amount of labeled sentences for training is limited. Our approach addresses the mapping of video segments to glosses by introducing recurrent convolutional neural network for spatio-temporal feature extraction and sequence learning. We design a three-stage optimization process for our architecture. First, we develop an end-to-end sequence learning scheme and employ connectionist temporal classification (CTC) as the objective function for alignment proposal. Second, we take the alignment proposal as stronger supervision to tune our feature extractor. Finally, we optimize the sequence learning model with the improved feature representations, and design a weakly supervised detection network for regularization. We apply the proposed approach to a real-world continuous sign language recognition benchmark, and our method, with no extra supervision, achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art.
