Heterogeneous multi-robot networks require novel tools for applications that require achieving and maintaining formations. This is the case for distributing sensing devices with heterogeneous mobile sensor networks. Here, we consider a heterogeneous multi-robot network of mobile robots. The robots have a limited range in which they can estimate the relative position of other network members. The network is also heterogeneous in that only a subset of robots have localization ability. We develop a method for automatically configuring the heterogeneous network to deploy a desired formation at a desired location. This method guarantees that network members without localization are deployed to the correct location in the environment for the sensor placement.
