A novel compact metamaterial antenna for wireless area local network (WLAN) applications is proposed in this paper. The antenna is fed by a co-planar waveguide (CPW). Size reduction of the antenna is achieved thanks to the use of a modified conventional composite right/left handed (CRLH) model without vias. As a result, the antenna demonstrates a good size reduction in comparison with the conventional patch antenna resonating at 2.4 GHz. In order to investigate the merits of proposed model, both antennas are simulated and fabricated. Experimental results show a good agreement between the simulated and measured parameters.
