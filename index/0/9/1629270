To avoid tedious and often highly sub-optimal manual tuning of such parameters by means of ad-hoc methods, general-purpose algorithm configuration procedures can be used to automatically find performance-optimizing parameter settings. While impressive performance gains are often achieved in this manner, additional, potentially costly parameter importance analysis is required to gain insights into what parameter changes are most responsible for those improvements. Here, we show how the running time cost of ablation analysis, a well-known general-purpose approach for assessing parameter importance, can be reduced substantially by using regression models of algorithm performance constructed from data collected during the configuration process. In our experiments, we demonstrate speed-up factors between 33 and 14 727 for ablation analysis on various configuration scenarios from AI planning, SAT, ASP and mixed integer programming (MIP).
