This paper describes our implementation of and initial experiences with DipZoom (for "Deep Internet Performance Zoom"), a novel approach to provide focused, on-demand Internet measurements. Unlike existing approaches that face a difficult challenge of building a measurement platform with sufficiently diverse measurements and measuring hosts, DipZoom implements a matchmaking service instead, which uses P2P concepts to bring together experimenters in need of measurements with external measurement providers. DipZoom offers the following two main contributions. First,since it is just a facilitator for an open community of participants, it promises unprecedented availability of diverse measurements and measuring points. Second, it can be used as a veneer over existing measurement platforms, automating the planning and execution of complex measurements.
