Dictionaries contain a rich set of relationships between their senses, but often these relationships are only implicit. We report on our experiments to automatically identify links between the senses in a machine-readable dictionary. In particular, we automatically identify instances of zero-affix morphology, and use that information to find specific linkages between senses. This work has provided insight into the performance of a stochastic tagger.
