String comparison algorithms, inspired by methods used in bioinformatics, have recently gained popularity in network applications. In this paper we demonstrate the need for careful selection of alignment models if such algorithms are to yield the desired results when applied to network traffic. We introduce a novel variant of the Jacobson-Vo algorithm employing a flexible gap-minimising alignment model suitable for network traffic, and find that our software implementation outperforms the commonly used Smith-Waterman approach by a factor of 33 on average and up to 58.5 in the best case on a wide range of network protocols.
