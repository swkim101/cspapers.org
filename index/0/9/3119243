Trusted computing technology aims to enhance the security of platform by the TPM. But there are some drawbacks of TCG's Trusted Computing architecture for user-based applications. This paper presents a new concept of portable TPM (PTM) based on USB Key to solve those problems. At first, we use PTM to establish a trusted path between the verifier and the user in remote attestation so as to propagate the trust chain to the end user. Secondly, we design the trust model and platform management mechanism of PTM. In this model the single point failure of TPM and frequent sensitive data migrations between different platforms are avoided based on PTM. At last, we implement the PTM on the USB Key with Java Card Runtime Environment. The test results show that the PTM scheme is feasible for user-based application.
