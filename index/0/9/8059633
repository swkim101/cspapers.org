Motivated by the need for semantically well-founded and algorithmically managable formalisms for describing the functionality of Web services, we introduce an action formalism that is based on description logics (DLs), but is also rmly grounded on research in the reasoning about action community. Our main contribution is an analysis of how the choice of the DL inuences the complexity of standard reasoning tasks such as projection and executability, which are important for Web service discovery and composition.
