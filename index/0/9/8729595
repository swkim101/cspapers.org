This paper relates two extensively studied formalisms: abstract dialectical frameworks and logic programs with generalized atoms or similar constructs. While the syntactic similarity is easy to see, also a strong relation between various stable model semantics proposed for these formalisms is shown by means of a unifying framework in which these semantics are restated in terms of program reducts and an immediate consequence operator, where program reducts have only minimal differences. This approach has advantages for both formalisms, as for example implemented systems for one formalism are usable for the other, and properties such as computational complexity do not have to be rediscovered. As a first, concrete result of this kind, one stable model semantics based on program reducts and subset-minimality that reached a reasonable consensus for logic programs with generalized atoms provides a novel, alternative semantics for abstract dialectical frameworks.
