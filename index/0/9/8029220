Mobile security and privacy issues are receiving significant attention from the research community. The SPSM workshop was created to provide a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in such issues to get together and exchange ideas. Following the success of the previous editions, we present the sixth edition of the workshop. It brings together the expertise of an international program committee, comprising of 22 mobile security experts from the academia and the industry. The workshop received 31 submissions (regular and short papers combined) from a diverge set of authors located in 19 countries.
