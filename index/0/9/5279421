The system presented in this paper is based on ideas taken from Automated Reasoning and Connectionism. The connectionist inference system Chcl is applied to solve the question whether a given sentence correctly describes the spatial relations of objects shown in a visual scene. The sentence is posed in relational form to a set of rules deening spatial relations among objects and a set of facts describing the objects and their relations in the visual scene. These facts are abductively inferred from an analog representation of the visual scene.
