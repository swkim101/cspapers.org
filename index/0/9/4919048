The problem of minimizing the time overhead of counters and traversal markers is studied. The methodology used to study the problem is based upon Markov processes. A fundamental result is presented that characterizes those flowcharts where the problem can be solved uniquely in the case of counters. Two methods are described that avoid poor choices of counter placement by choosing counter placements from a dominating set. With respect to the problem of traversal marker placement, the basic result that traversal markers must be placed on the complement of a uni-connected sub-graph is extended to flowcharts with circuits. Finally it is shown that complements of uni-connected subgraphs that are minimal in size may not have minimal time overheads.
