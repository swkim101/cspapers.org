Syntactic configurations used in collocation extraction are highly divergent from one system to another, this questioning the validity of results and making comparative evaluation difficult. We describe a corpus-driven approach for inferring an exhaustive set of configurations from actual data by finding, with a parser, all the productive syntactic associations, then by appealing to human expertise for relevance judgements.
