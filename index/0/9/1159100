We further our algorithmic and structural understanding of Nash equilibria. Specifically: We distill the hard core of the complexity of Nash equilibria, showing that even correctly computing a logarithmic number of bits of the equilibrium strategies of a two-player win-lose game is as hard as the general problem. We prove the following structural result about Nash equilibria: “the set of approximate equilibria of a zero-sum game is convex.”
