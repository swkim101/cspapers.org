As XML becomes an increasingly popular format for information exchange, the efficient processing of broadcast XML data on a constrained device (for example, a cell phone or a PDA) becomes a critical task. In this paper we present the EXPedite system: a new model of data processing in an information exchange environment, which "migrates" the power of the data-sending server to receivers for efficient processing. It consists of a simple and general encoding scheme for servers, and streaming query processing algorithms on encoded XML stream for data receivers with constrained computing abilities. Experiments show the impressive performance of EXPedite.
