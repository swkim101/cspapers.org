This paper studies the problem ol memory allocation and scheduling in a multiple query workload with widely varying resource requirements. Several memory allocation and scheduling schemes are presented and their performance is compared using a detailed simulation study. The results demonstrate the inadequacies of static schemes with fixed scheduling and memory allocation policies. A dynamic adaptive scheme which integrates schedtiling and memtiry allocation is developed and is shown to perform effectively under widely varying workloads.
