We describe the design and implementation of a security architecture for a cooperative information system implemented with CORBA technologies. We first define a role-based policy for a specific case study. We then show how this policy is enforced by an architecture made of a selection of commercial off the shelf components and a small number of developed components. Finally, we focus on the interoperability of the security architecture we have designed.
