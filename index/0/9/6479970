Many, if not most, computer science majors plan on careers in some aspect of software development in industry. Software development in industry is characterized by extensive use of tools and specialized software to support large scale projects, such as Git, Maven, Gradle, Jenkins, Hibernate, and Spring. We want our students to have exposure to industry strength tools and systems, but want to avoid having our courses overwhelmed by tools with steep learning curves. In this session, we plan to discuss questions and issues that are raised when choosing, installing, teaching, and using industrial strength tools and frameworks in software project courses. Bring your suggestions for favorite tools and frameworks, ideas on learning activities, and support materials. Some of the questions we might tackle: How do we identify tools that support our course learning objectives? How do we find the time and resources to learn the tools? How do we work with our IT staff in installing and configuring the tools? How many tools and systems should we use in a project course, and when do we merely start overwhelming the students' And finally, what works?
