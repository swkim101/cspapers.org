Given a one-dimensional graph <i>G</i> such that any two consecutive nodes are unit distance away, and such that the minimum number of links between any two nodes (the <i>diameter</i> of <i>G</i>) is <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>), we prove an Î©(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>/log log <i>n</i>) lower bound on the sum of lengths of all the edges (i.e., the <i>weight</i> of <i>G</i>). The problem is a variant of the widely studied <i>partial sum</i> problem. This in turn provides a lower bound on Euclidean spanner graphs with small diameter and low weight, showing that the upper bound from [1] is almost tight.
