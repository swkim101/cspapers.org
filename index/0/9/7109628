For efficient, large scale data mining of publicly available information about libre (free, open source) software projects, automating the retrieval and analysis processes is a must. A system implementing such automation must have into account the many kinds of repositories with interesting information (each with its own structure and access methods), and the many kinds of analysis which can be applied to the retrieved data. In addition, such a system should be capable of interfacing and reusing as much existing software for both retrieving and analyzing data as possible. As a proof of concept of how that system could be, we started sometime ago to implement the GlueTheos system, featuring a modular,flexible architecture which has been already used in several of our studies of libre software projects. In this paper we show its structure, how it can be used, and how it can be extended.
