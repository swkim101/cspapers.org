Nowadays, almost all companies, independently of their size and type of activity, are facing the problematic of having to manage, maintain or even replace their legacy systems. Many times, the first problem they need to solve is to really understand what are the functionalities, architecture, data, etc of all these often huge legacy applications. As a consequence, reverse engineering still remains a major challenge for software engineering today. This paper introduces MoDisco, a generic and extensible open source reverse engineering solution. MoDisco intensively uses MDE principles and techniques to improve existing approaches for reverse engineering.
