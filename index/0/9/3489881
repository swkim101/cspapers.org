This paper presents the design and evaluation of a novel project designed to facilitate the learning of memory management concepts and interactions between different components. This project removes the complexity of a full or specific operating system by implementing memory management inside the user space. Evaluation results show that the mean exam scores improved by about 29% to 34%. On average, the total code size is less than 300 lines and time spent working on this project is under 17 hours. Therefore, this project is beneficial in helping students learn memory management while maintaining a reasonable project workload.
