We present algorithms for fast quantile and frequency estimation in large data streams using graphics processors (GPUs). We exploit the high computation power and memory bandwidth of graphics processors and present a new sorting algorithm that performs rasterization operations on the GPUs. We use sorting as the main computational component for histogram approximation and construction of Îµ-approximate quantile and frequency summaries. Our algorithms for numerical statistics computation on data streams are deterministic, applicable to fixed or variable-sized sliding windows and use a limited memory footprint. We use GPU as a co-processor and minimize the data transmission between the CPU and GPU by taking into account the low bus bandwidth. We implemented our algorithms on a PC with a NVIDIA GeForce FX 6800 Ultra GPU and a 3.4 GHz Pentium IV CPU and applied them to large data streams consisting of more than 100 million values. We also compared the performance of our GPU-based algorithms with optimized implementations of prior CPU-based algorithms. Overall, our results demonstrate that the graphics processors available on a commodity computer system are efficient stream-processor and useful co-processors for mining data streams.
