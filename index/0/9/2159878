We present a new Web middleware architecture that allows users to customize their view of the Web for optimal interaction and system operation when using non-traditional resource-limited client machines such as wireless PDAs (personal digital assistants). Web Stream Customizers (WSC) are dynamically deployable software modules and can be strategically located between client and server to achieve improvements in performance, reliability, or security. An important design feature is that Customizers provide two points of control in the communication path between client and server, supporting adaptive system-based and content-based customization. Our architecture exploits HTTP's proxy capabilities, allowing Customizers to be seamlessly integrated with the basic Web transaction model. We describe the WSC architecture and implementation, and illustrate its use with three non-trivial, adaptive Customizer applications that we have built. We show that the overhead in our implementation is small and tolerable, and is outweighed by the benefits that Customizers provide.
