This paper introduces a set of unique undergraduate computer science programs, some of which have been operating for more than two years at Rochester Institute of Technology. These programs are intended to meet current computer science manpower demands where as a generalized computer science curriculum is not sufficient to cover the range of students required by such demands. As is shown in Figure 1, the set of programs extend from a general computer science curriculum to cover several quasi-specialized areas.
