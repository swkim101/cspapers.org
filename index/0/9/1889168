This paper provides an overview of the embedded joint-space control approach developed for THOR, a new series elastic humanoid. The 60 kg robot features electromechanical linear series elastic actuators (SEAs), enabling low-impedance control of each joint in the lower body via linear to rotary and parallel mechanisms. We present a distributed joint impedance control framework that leverages a custom dual-axis motor controller to track position, velocity, and torque setpoints for each pair of joints. The required actuator forces are tracked using an inner force control loop combining feedforward and PID control with a model-based disturbance observer (DOB). Unlike previous approaches, we utilize an inverse plant model based on the open-loop actuator dynamics to simplify tuning of the cascaded controller by decoupling DOB estimates from the inner loop gains. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified through trajectory tracking and dynamic walking experiments conducted on the THOR humanoid utilizing a complementary optimization-based whole-body controller.
