Multimedia-rich Web interfaces offer an increasingly attractive option for teaching distance and large-scale courses. We explore our experience of publishing CS1 to over 200 students and the resulting student performance. Our approach included streaming QuickTime audio and video synchronized with animated PowerPoint slides; in addition, a "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQ) list was compiled from previous students' questions and made available. We demonstrate that the on-line lecture material enhanced students' learning of those enrolled in the traditional, lecture-based sections and those enrolled in the on-line section. The process is cost-effective, scalable, and affords use in other disciplines beyond CS1. Our future research is also discussed.
