Web caching and prefetching are well known strategies for improving the performance of Internet systems. When combined with web log mining, these strategies can decide to cache and prefetch web documents with higher accuracy. In this paper, we present an application of web log mining to obtain web-document access patterns and use these patterns to extend the well-known GDSF caching policies and prefetching policies. Using real web logs, we show that this application of data mining can achieve dramatic improvement to web-access performance.
