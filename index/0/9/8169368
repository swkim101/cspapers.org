There is a growing interest in researching null instantiations, which are those implicit semantic arguments. Many of these implicit arguments can be linked to referents in context, and their discoveries are of great benefits to semantic processing. We address the issue of automatically identifying and resolving implicit arguments in Chinese discourse. For their resolutions, we present an approach that combines the information about overtly labeled arguments and frame-to-frame relations defined by FrameNet. Experimental results on our created corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
