Understanding strategies of attacks is crucial for security applications such as computer and network forensics, intrusion response, and prevention of future attacks. This paper presents techniques to automatically learn attack strategies from correlated intrusion alerts. Central to these techniques is a model that represents an attack strategy as a graph of attacks with constraints on the attack attributes and the temporal order among these attacks. To learn the intrusion strategy is then to extract such a graph from a sequences of intrusion alerts. To further facilitate the analysis of attack strategies, which is essential to many security applications such as computer and network forensics, this paper presents techniques to measure the similarity between attack strategies. The basic idea is to reduces the similarity measurement of attack strategies into error-tolerant graph/subgraph isomorphism problem, and measures the similarity between attack strategies in terms of the cost to transform one strategy into another. Finally, this paper presents some experimental results, which demonstrate the potential of the proposed techniques.
