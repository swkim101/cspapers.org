We present a Semantic Web application that we callCS AKTive Space. The application exploits a wide range of semantically heterogeneousand distributed content relating to Computer Science research in theUK. This content is gathered on a continuous basis using a variety of methods including harvesting and scraping as well as adopting a range models for content acquisition. The content currently comprises aroundten million RDF triples and we have developed storage, retrieval andmaintenance methods to support its management. The content is mediated through an ontology constructed for the application domainand incorporates components from other published ontologies. CS AKTive Spacesupports the exploration of patterns and implications inherent in the content and exploits a variety of visualisations and multi dimensional representations. Knowledge services supported in the applicationinclude investigating communities of practice: who is working, researching or publishing with whom. This work illustrates a number ofsubstantial challenges for the Semantic Web. These include problems of referential integrity, tractable inference and interaction support. Wereview our approaches to these issues and discuss relevant related work.
