In the paper, we propose a portable A/D USB dongle architecture for the NB/PC-based software DVB-T receiver. It includes a tuner, A/D chip and USB bridge. During the field trials, the proposed portable A/D USB dongle and the baseband processing software we develop before can successfully demodulate the DVB-T signal in a NB/PC when the moving speed of the receiver is 0km/hr and 100km/hr.
