In this paper we describe ClayVision, a new quasi-immersive urban navigation system that rethinks the design conventions of existing Augmented Reality (AR) applications, by aggressively incorporating knowledge from non-Computer Science fields - namely Information Design and Urban Planning. Instead of the prevailing approach of pasting "information bubbles" onto the existing urban scenery, ClayVision communicates through real-time 3D transformations of city elements. In other words, the system dynamically probes and reassembles the city into a better-designed copy of the original, that is both easier to navigate and tailored to suit the user's needs and preferences. We provide extensive discussions that cover the technical details of the system, the types of city-morphing operations that can be effectively applied, and what people's experiences will be in the newly "elastic" city.
