Separation of concerns is a key goal in achieving software reusability. Meta-Level Programming approaches pave the way to separation of concerns by handling functional and non-functional aspects in different levels, but provide little help for software composition, verification and evolution activities. Approaches based on Software Architecture Description Languages can overcome these deficiencies and additionally may discipline, and make explicit, the deployment of meta-level programming. R-RIO combines both approaches providing a useful framework to develop, implement and maintain applications.
