We solve the problem of computing the shortest closed path inside a given polygon which visits every edge at least once (Aquarium Z{eeperâ€™s Tour). For convex polygons, we present a linear-time algorithm which uses the reflection principle and shortest-path maps. We then generalize that method by using relative convex hulls to provide a linear algorithm for polygons which are not convex.
