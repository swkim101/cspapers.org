Two versions of the extended plausible reasoning system were implemented, one using dominance weights (described in the paper) and the other using &idâ€™ (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) weights. Experiments were conducted using the titles and abstracts of the CACM collection and it was found that both versions of the extended plausible reasoning system are better than the vector space model and the system using dominance weights performed better than the system with ~. id~weights.
