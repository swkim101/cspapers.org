Notwithstanding the latest buzzword (grid, cloud, utility computing, SaaS, etc.), large-scale computing and cloud-like infrastructures are here to stay. How exactly they will look like tomorrow is still for the markets to decide, yet one thing is certain: clouds bring with them new untested deployment and associated adversarial models and vulnerabilities. It is essential that our community becomes involved at this early stage. The CCSW workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in all security aspects of cloud-centric and outsourced computing to act as a fertile ground for creative debate and interaction in security-sensitive areas of computing impacted by clouds.
