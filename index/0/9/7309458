In this paper we present a novel on-line method to recursively align point clouds. By considering each point together with the local features of the surface (normal and curvature), our method takes advantage of the 3D structure around the points for the determination of the data association between two clouds. The algorithm relies on a least squares formulation of the alignment problem, that minimizes an error metric depending on these surface characteristics. We named the approach Normal Iterative Closest Point (NICP in short). Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmark data show that NICP outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.
