This paper describes a practical solution to on-line dictionary update in XTRA, a machine translation system developed by Xiuming Huang at the Computing Research Laboratory of New Mexico State University. The focus of the discussion in on IVES - an Interactive Vocabulary Enrichment System built by this writer for XTRA, It reflects an on-going effort at the laboratory to build embedded learning mechanisms in machine translation systems. Two types of learning are discussed, word learning and word sense learning. Each type of learning undergoes three routine processes: detection, acquisition, and evaluation. The emphasis of this paper is on the use of semantic preference violations in the detection of the need to learn new word senses.
