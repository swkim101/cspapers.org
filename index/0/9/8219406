It is now routine for biologists to conduct evolutionary analyses of large DNA and protein sequence datasets. A computational bott leneck in these analyses is the recovery" of the topology of the evolutionary tree for a set of sequences. This paper presents a practical solution to this challenging problem. In particular, a new technique, called hypercleaning, is presented that can be combined with various tree-building algorithms to efficiently reconstruct from sequence da ta the best supported edges of the evolutionary tree. More precisely, the hypercleaning technique computes from sequence da ta a small subset of edges that is likely to contain most edges of the correct tree. A tree-building algorithm then a t tempts to identify edges in the subset that are compatible with each other and hereby produces an evolutionary tree. We also propose a simple greedy agorithm that builds a tree by *.-~4-d~ress: D~partement d'Informatique Fondamentale et Applications, LIRMM, Universit4 de Montpellier II, France.

This technique is a substantial improvement over previous algor i thms in its ability to recover edges of the evolutionary tree. Hypercleaning also incorporates a detailed error model tha t relates errors in the data to the topology of the evolutionary tree. The results of a simulation study that strongly support the practicality, efficiency and effectiveness of hypercleaning are also presented. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Advances in D N A sequencing technology this decade have resu l t ed in an exponen t i a l g rowth in the amoun t of sequence d a t a avai lable for biological analys is [8]. As a consequence, it is now rou t ine for biologists to c onduc t evo lu t i ona ry ana lyses of large sequence d a t a s e t s [16, 17, 21]. However , s t a n d a r d me thods for inferr ing evo lu t iona ry t rees f rom sequence da ta , such as m a x i m u m l ikel ihood [14] and m a x i m u m pa r s imony [26], a re p lagued by c o m p u t a t i o n a l difficulties. An e vo lu t i ona ry t ree T for a set S of sequences is a r oo t ed and edge weighted t ree where the leaves of T are l abe led b i jec t ive ly by S. The topo logy of T ( tha t is, T w i t h o u t edge weights) descr ibes the spec ia t ion events r esu l t ing in the evolu t ion of sequences in S from the root . The edge weights of T are p ropo r t i ona l to t he a m o u n t of evolu t ion (sequence subs t i tu t ions , inser t ions and dele t ions) be tween spec ia t ion events. Th i s p a p e r presen ts new insights on the difficult c o m p u t a t i o n a l p rob lem of de t e rmin ing the topology of an unknown evo lu t iona ry t ree T given only the set S of sequences t ha t label the leaves of T. This problem is of p rac t i ca l i m p o r t a n c e since once the topology of T is known, T can be roo ted and edge weights d e t e r m i n e d , resul t ing in a hypo thes i s descr ib ing the e vo lu t i ona ry h i s tory of the sequences in S. De te rmining the t o p o l o g y of T is cons idered to be the most difficult c o m p u t a t i o n a l s t ep in the recons t ruc t ion of T f rom S. I t is we l l -known t h a t t he topo logy of an evolut i ona ry t ree can be specif ied by its set of edgeinduced b ipa r t i t i ons . An evo lu t i ona ry t ree T l abe led by S
