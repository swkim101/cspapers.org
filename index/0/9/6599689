With the proliferation of mobile wireless devices such as smartphones and tablets that are used in a wide range of locations and movement conditions, it has become important for wireless protocols to adapt to different settings over short periods of time. Network protocols that perform well in static settings where channel conditions are relatively stable tend to perform poorly in mobile settings where channel conditions change rapidly, and vice versa. To adapt to the conditions under which communication is occurring, we propose the use of external sensor hints to augment network protocols. Commodity smartphones and tablet devices come equipped with a variety of sensors, including GPS, accelerometers, magnetic compasses, and gyroscopes, which can provide hints about the device's mobility state and its operating environment. We present a wireless protocol architecture that integrates sensor hints in adaptation algorithms. We validate the idea and architecture by implementing and evaluating sensor-augmented wireless protocols for bit rate adaptation, access point association, neighbor maintenance in mobile mesh networks, and path selection in vehicular networks.
