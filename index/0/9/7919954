We present here two methods for extraction o, meronymic relation : (a) the first one relies solely on syntactic information. Unlike other approaches based on simple patterns, we determine their optimal combination to extract word pairs linked via a given semantic relation; (b) the second approach consists in combining syntactic patterns with the semantic information extracted from the Wikipedia hyperlink hierarchy ( WHH ) of the constituent words. By comparing our work with SemEval 2007 (Task 4 test set) and WordNet (WN) we found that our system clearly outperforms its competitors.
