The Web is rapidly evolving towards a highly heterogeneous ac-cessed environment, due to the variety of new devices with diverseprocessing, storage, display capabilities, and network interfacesthat are gaining access to the Internet. Studies have shown thatin a few years these emerging consumer devices will be the pre-dominant fraction of Internet clients. Hence, there is an increasingdemand for solutions that enable the transformation of Web contentfor adapting and delivering it to diverse destination devices.Tailoring Web content to match the speciﬁc device capabilit iesrequires functionalities for content adaptation, namely transcoding.These transcoding services are typically carried out by the contentWeb server or by some edge proxy server. In the latter approach(e.g., [3, 4]), a proxy server, located in an intermediate position inthe delivery chain between the client device and the content server,fetches and transcodes the desired content on-the-ﬂy, before de-livering the result to the client. The proxy server can cache theresult of the transcoding, thus avoiding round-trips to thecontentserver and transcoding operations when transcodable content canbe served from the cache [4]. So far, the proxy-based approachto content adaptation is typically carried out by some edge proxyserver that directly connects to the clients.As the proxy-based approach may be subject to a limited scal-ability [3], we believe that alternative solutions are necessary toimprove the user response time. In this paper, we propose a newalternative that considers distributed systems of cooperative proxyservers which collaborate in discovering, transcoding, and deliver-ing multiple versions of Web objects. The goals are to reduce theuser response time and bound its variability by exploiting the bene-ﬁts deriving from resource discovery and adaptation throug h otherproxy servers.The presence of multi-version content in the proxy caches aug-ments the traditional cache cooperation issues, because we have toconsider the possibility of recognizing, discovering, and cachingmultiple variants of the same resource. We investigate differentschemes for cooperative proxy caching and transcoding that can beimplemented in the existing Web infrastructure and compare theirperformance through prototypes that extend Squid operations to anheterogeneous client environment. The ﬁrst extension enha nces thetraditional cache server, and transforms it into an active smart inter-
