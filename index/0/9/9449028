XML retrieval provides a focused access to the relevant content of documents. However, in evaluation, full document retrieval has appeared competitive to focused XML retrieval. We analyze the density of relevance in documents, and show that in sparsely relevant documents focused retrieval performs better, whereas in densely relevant documents the performance of focused and document retrieval is equal.
