We study linear programming relaxations of Vertex Cover and Max Cutarising from repeated applications of the "lift-and-project" method of Lovasz and Schrijver starting from the standard linear programming relaxation.
 For Vertex Cover, Arora, Bollobas, Lovasz and Tourlakis prove thatthe integrality gap remains at least 2-ε after Ω<sub>ε</sub>(log n) rounds, where <i>n</i> is the number ofvertices, and Tourlakis proves that integrality gap remains at least 1.5-ε after Ω((log n)<sup>2</sup>) rounds. Fernandez de laVega and Kenyon prove that the integrality gap of Max Cut is at most 12 + ε after any constant number of rounds. (Theirresult also applies to the more powerful Sherali-Adams method.
 We prove that the integrality gap of Vertex Cover remains at least 2-ε after Ω<sub>ε</sub> (n) rounds, and that theintegrality gap of Max Cut remains at most 1/2 +ε after Ω<sub>ε</sub>(n) rounds.
