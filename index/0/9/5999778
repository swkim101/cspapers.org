This paper deals with a well known problem in AI planning: detecting and resolving conflicts in nonlinear plans. We sketch a theory of restricted conflict detection and resolution that subsumes conflict handling in classical nonlinear planners. By relaxing the restrictions, we develop a more general concept of conflicts suggesting practical and theoretical limitations of conflict handling in nonlinear plans.
