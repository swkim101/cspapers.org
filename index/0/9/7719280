The goal of this poster is to describe our implementation of a newarchitecture enabling efficient integration between mobile phoneapplications and Web Services. Using this architecture, we haveimplemented a mobile shopping assistant described further. In orderto build this architecture, we designed an innovative XMLcompression mechanism to facilitate data exchange between mobilephones and Web Services. We also designed a smart connection managerto control asynchronous communication for all possible channels of amobile phone. In addition, we used diverse input modes in order toextend users' access to Web Services.
