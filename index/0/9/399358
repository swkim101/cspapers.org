Representation learning is the dominant technique for unsupervised domain adaptation, but existing approaches often require the specification of "pivot features" that generalize across domains, which are selected by task-specific heuristics. We show that a novel but simple feature embedding approach provides better performance, by exploiting the feature template structure common in NLP problems.
