We examine the effect of incorporating gaze-based attention feedback from the user on personalizing the search process. Employing eye tracking data, we keep track of document parts the user read in some way. We use this information on the subdocument level as implicit feedback for query expansion and reranking.
 We evaluated three different variants incorporating gaze data on the subdocument level and compared them against a baseline based on context on the document level. Our results show that considering reading behavior as feedback yields powerful improvements of the search result accuracy of ca. 32% in the general case. However, the extent of the improvements varies depending on the internal structure of the viewed documents and the type of the current information need.
