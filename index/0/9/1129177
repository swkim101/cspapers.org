As part of the 1995 Apple Design Project, we designed and prototyped the muse, a digital music stand for the symphony musician. Our group consisted of four students from Carnegie Mellon University. We worked closely with members of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra during the development of our product. By observing their practice, rehearsal, and performance habits, we studied the symphony culture and generated the concept of a product that would replace a number of conventional tools and processes with a single digital device. The integration of the interface and industrial design resulted in a cohesive look and feel to the .... muse. The muse contains a metronome with audio and visual feedback, a pitch-generating tuner, stylus-based-onscreen annotation, inter-symphony communicat ion capabilities, a music library, and manual or automatic page turning with indexing. The muse is fashioned from mahogany, aluminum, and steel to reflect the timeless beauty of the instruments with which it shares the stage.
