Recent years have seen a growing interest in the deployment of sophisticated replication based storage architecture in data-intensive computing. Existing placement-ideal data layout solutions place an emphasis on declustered parity based storage. However, there exist major differences between parity and replication architectures, especially in data layouts. We retrofit the desirable properties of optimal parallelism in parity architectures for replication architectures, and propose a novel placement-ideal data layout ---- shifted declustering for replication based storage. Shifted declustering layout obtains optimal parallelism in a wide range of configurations, and obtains optimal high performance and load balancing in both fault-free and degraded modes. Our theoretical proofs and comprehensive simulation results show that shifted declustering is superiour in performance and load balancing to traditional replication layout schemes such as standard mirroring, chained declustering, group rotational declustering and existing parity layout schemes PRIME and RELPR in reference [4].
