Presents experimentally derived performance data on the N. mPc system. Data describing the type, size, and speed of simulations is presented. The implications of using the ISP' Hardware Description Language in constructing various models of the same components are considered. A set of design examples are presented to illustrate the range of simulation capabilities.
