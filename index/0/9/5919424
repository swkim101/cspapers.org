The VIMSYS project provides environmental scientists with the ability to perform content-based querying over a database of satellite images. This paper descriks the enduser query interface which facilitates identification of multiple object types, reduces emphasis on numerical data, and simplifies the use of numerous sets of parameters. To address these issues in a way that can be applied to similar databases, the end-user query interface utilizes abstract query structures called clusters, in addition to frames and links. We describe the requirements of the system, review commonly available query methods, discuss how the VIMSYS interface meets the needs of the audience, present user reaction to the prototype, and summarize other relevant details of VIMSYS.
