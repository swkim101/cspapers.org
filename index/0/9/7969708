USENET is a distributed bulletin board with approximately 2.7 million users. Some schools, particularly those without Intemet access, do not have USENET available locally. Many schools already have local USENET sites, but do not take advantage of this resource in a formal way. In the first case this paper should serve as a point of departure to becoming a USENET site. In both cases I hope to inspire faculty to consider how USENET can contribute to their studentsâ€™ learning experience. This paper explains what USENET is, what resources are required to be a USENET site, and how USENET has been used in upper-level computer science courses.
