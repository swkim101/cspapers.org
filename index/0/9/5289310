This film shows an autonomus robot in action. the goal of the NRL research effert is to establish a technical base for an autonomous under-water robot. It is expected that such a robot would be able to do only simple taske, but would be able to do only simple tasks, but would be able to do them one or two orders of magnitude cheaper than other methods. (The economy is mainly because it is not necessary for ship to standby on the surface). 
 
The robot vehicle would be progrenuned at a base and proceed to its assigned dentination on the floor of the ocean. It would then carry out its work autonomously, without even a communications link. 
 
This project is concerned with software nather than hardware. The Mark I Robot is a system designed to operute in the laborutory as a research. It is a simplified robot a first out at providing the minimal intelligence necessary for an autonomous underwater robot. The robot performed as exjected, sucessfully carrying out the task it was assigned.
