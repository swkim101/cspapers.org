We show how to construct holographic (or transparent) proofs of size nl” that can be checked by a verifier that is allowed to read only O(1) bits of the proof and has access to O(log n) random bits, for all c > 0. In general, we construct proofs of size ~1+2 ‘0(9(”)) (log n)q’(n)l checkable by the query of 2q~(n)) bits, for any q(n) = O(log log n). An essential element of our construction is a proof that the low-degree test used by Arora and Safra [AS92] is effective on domains of size linear in the degree of the encoded polynomial.
