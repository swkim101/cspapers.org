Traditional web search engines enable users to find documents based on topics. However, in finding entities such as restaurants, hotels and products, traditional search engines fail to suffice as users are often interested in finding entities based on structured attributes such as price and brand and unstructured information such as opinions of other web users. In this paper, we showcase a preference driven search system, that enables users to find entities of interest based on a set of structured preferences as well as unstructured opinion preferences. We demonstrate our system in the context of hotel search.
