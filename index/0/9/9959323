This paper describes (very briefly) a parallel hardware implementation for NETL-type semantic network memories. A million-element system can be built with about 7000 IC chips, including 4000 64K RAM chips. This compares favorably with the hardware cost of holding the same body of knowledge in a standard computer memory, and offers significant advantages in flexibility of access and the speed of performing certain searches and deductions.
