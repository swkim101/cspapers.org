We present a new approach to IP traceback based on the probabilistic packet marking paradigm. Our approach, which we call randomize-and-link, uses large checksum cords to "link" message fragments in a way that is highly scalable, for the checksums serve both as associative addresses and data integrity verifiers. The main advantage of these checksum cords is that they spread the addresses of possible router messages across a spectrum that is too large for the attacker to easily create messages that collide with legitimate messages. Our methods therefore scale to attack trees containing hundreds of routers and do not require that a victim know the topology of the attack tree a priori. In addition, by utilizing authenticated dictionaries in a novel way, our methods do not require routers sign any setup messages individually.
