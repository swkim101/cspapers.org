A recently proposed active queue management, CHOKe, aims to protect TCP from UDP flows. Simulations have shown that as UDP rate increases, its bandwidth share initially rises but eventually drops. We derive an approximate model of CHOKe and show that, provided the number of TCP flows is large, the UDP bandwidth share peaks at (e+1)-1 = 0.269 when the UDP input rate is slightly larger than the link capacity, and drops to zero as UDP input rate tends to infinity, regardless of the TCP algorithm.
