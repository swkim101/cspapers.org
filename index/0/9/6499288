The traditional approach for network tomography (called Analogue tomography) tries to estimate the actual performance (e.g., loss rate) of every link in the monitored network [1]. This approach is very challenging for several reasons, some of which are related to the underlying path measurements. For instance, those early methods assume that if two paths go through a single and shared lossy link, their measured path loss rates will be equal. This may be true if the measurements last for a very long period, assuming that the network load is stationary and the routes do not change. In practice, however, network conditions change significantly with time, and so the path measurements must be performed in short time intervals (e.g., one minute) before they become stale [2]. To make things worse, the probing frequency cannot be too high because the path measurements can then affect the underlying network performance. In 2003, Duffield proposed a paradigm shift in network tomography [3] where the link’s performance is inferred as “good” versus “bad”. This approach (referred to as Boolean tomography) needs much simpler path measurements. Of course, the problem is now that the result of the tomographic process has low resolution: just a single bit for each link. This may be sufficient if the objective is to simply identify severe congestion. In practice, however, the congestion level of network links varies widely and even though an operator may be satisfied with a loss rate of 0.1%, another may find this congestion level unacceptable. Our tomography approach (referred to as Range Tomography) attempts to combine the higher resolution of Analogue tomography with the practicality of Boolean tomography. The path measurements are still classified as good or bad, to exploit the fact that most network paths typically operate without congestion. This allows us to quickly remove a large number of links from the problem, as long as they
