To provide students with hands-on exercises in computer security education, we have developed a laboratory environment (SEED) for computer security education. It is based on VMware, Minix, and linux, all of which are free for educational uses. Based on this environment, we have developed ten labs, covering a wide range of security principles. We have used these labs in our three courses in the last four years. This paper presents our SEED lab environment, SEED labs, and our evaluation results.
