Multilingual instructions generation has been the object of many studies recently, motivated by the increased need to produce multilingual manuals coupled with the cost of technical writing and translating. These studies concentrate on the automatic generation of instructions, leaving technical writers out of the loop. In many cases, however it is not possible to dispense with human intervention entirely, for at least two reasons. First, the system must be provided with a semantic knowledge base from which the instructions can be generated. Second, it is the technical writers who have the expertise necessary for producing instructions appropriate for a specific product or company, and it is not necessarily an easy task to make this expertise available to a system. The results of a requirement analysis study confirm the view that the most useful tool is not a stand-alone writing tool but rather one that supports technical writers in their task. In this paper, we describe such a support tool, which we developed based on the results of our user requirement analysis.
