Finding significant contextual features is a challenging task in the development of interactive information retrieval (IR) systems. This paper investigated a simple method to facilitate such a task by looking at aggregated relevance judgements of retrieved documents. Our study suggested that the agreement on relevance judgements can indicate the effectiveness of retrieved documents as the source of significant features. The effect of highly agreed documents gives us practical implication for the design of adaptive search models in interactive IR systems.
