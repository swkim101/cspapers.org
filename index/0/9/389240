This paper describes a scheduling algorithm for high speed, TDMA communication networks. The problem is to find a route and determine switch schedules so that a burst of information can traverse the network from source to destination. We show that this problem is difficult, i.e., that several simple variations are NP-complete. We present an algorithm that finds schedules, and within a simplifying assumption, is guaranteed to find a route if one exists. Simulations indicate that this algorithm runs quickly in practice and overall scheduling efficiencies of 80-90% can be achieved. We also describe a variation in which the problem is to find a repeating schedule and we show how to adapt the basic algorithm for this variation.
