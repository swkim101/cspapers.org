Structural monitoring---the collection and analysis of structural response to ambient or forced excitation--is an important application of networked embedded sensing with significant commercial potential. The first generation of sensor networks for structural monitoring are likely to be data acquisition systems that collect data at a single node for centralized processing. In this paper, we discuss the design and evaluation of a wireless sensor network system (called Wisden for structural data acquisition. Wisden incorporates two novel mechanisms, reliable data transport using a hybrid of end-to-end and hop-by-hop recovery, and low-overhead data time-stamping that does not require global clock synchronization. We also study the applicability of wavelet-based compression techniques to overcome the bandwidth limitations imposed by low-power wireless radios. We describe our implementation of these mechanisms on the Mica-2 motes and evaluate the performance of our implementation. We also report experiences from deploying Wisden on a large structure.
