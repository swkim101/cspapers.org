A new design method of the repetitive control system for linear systems with time-varying norm-bounded uncertainties is presented, which can design a low-pass filter of the repetitive controller and a stabilizing controller simultaneously in the repetitive control system. Using a Lyapunov functional for the repetitive control system, sufficient conditions are derived in terms of a linear matrix inequality (LMI), which ensure robust stability of the repetitive control system and achieve the prescribed  H∞  performance. Based on derived conditions, the problem of designing a stabilizing controller and finding the cut-off frequency of a low-pass filter is reformulated as an optimization problem with an LMI constraint of the  free parameter. Then, an iterative algorithm is presented to calculate the largest cut-off frequency of a low-pass filter and design the corresponding state-feedback controller simultaneously. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.
