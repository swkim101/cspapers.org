The latency of a perception system is crucial for a robot performing interactive tasks in dynamic human environments. We present MOPED, a fast and scalable perception system for object recognition and pose estimation. MOPED builds on POSESEQ, a state of the art object recognition algorithm, demonstrating a massive improvement in scalability and latency without sacrificing robustness. We achieve this with both algorithmic and architecture improvements, with a novel feature matching algorithm, a hybrid GPU/CPU architecture that exploits parallelism at all levels, and an optimized resource scheduler. Using the same standard hardware, we achieve up to 30x improvement on real-world scenes.
