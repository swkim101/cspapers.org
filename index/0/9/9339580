We present a new elimination-based framework for exhaustive and incremental data flow analysis using the DJ graph representation of a program. Unlike the previous approaches to elimination-based incremental data flow analysis, our approach can handle arbitrary non-structural and structural changes to program flowgraphs, including those causing irreducibility. We show how our approach is related to (iterated) dominance frontiers, and exploit this relationship to establish the complexity of our exhaustive analysis and to aid the design of our incremental analysis.
