Semantic video classification has become an active research topic to enable more effective video retrieval and knowledge discovery from large-scale video databases. However, most existing techniques for classifier training require a large number of hand-labeled samples to learn correctly. To address this problem, we have proposed a semi-supervised framework to achieve incremental classifier training by integrating a limited number of labeled samples with a large number of unlabeled samples. Specifically, this emi-supervised framework includes: (a) Modeling the semantic video concepts by using the finite mixture models to approximate the class distributions of the relevant salient objects; (b) Developing an adaptive EM algorithm to integrate the unlabeled samples to achieve parameter estimation and model selection simultaneously; The experimental results in a certain domain of medical videos are also provided.
