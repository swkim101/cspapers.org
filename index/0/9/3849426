In this paper, emotion analysis on blog texts has been carried out for a less privileged language like Bengali. Ekman's six basic emotion types have been selected for reliable and semi automatic word level annotation. An automatic classifier has been applied for recognizing six basic emotion types for different words in a sentence. Application of different scoring strategies to identify sentence level emotion tag based on the acquired word level emotion constituents have produced satisfactory performance.
