This HCI course incorporated unit testing as a quality improvement initiative with an Experiential Learning Model. The focus of the research was on observation and conceptualization---students should be able to associate the benefits of usability and unit testing and apply them to more general situations. Based on our survey results and student interviews, the most difficult challenge incorporating unit testing in an experiential course was ensuring students overcome their negative bias to discover the benefits of functional testing. We recommend emphasizing the concrete benefits of unit tests and ensuring that all students fully participate in the testing experience.
