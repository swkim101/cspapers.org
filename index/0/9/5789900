The recommendations of the ACM Curriculum Committee on Information Systems indicate an attempt to keep abreast of both curricular changes in academia and job skill demands of the computing profession. As tie needs of both changed, new recommendations were made. The latest modell published in 1981, was the culmination of a process to update the ACM 1973 recommendations for undergraduate programs. It has been more than a decade however, since the publication of the 1981 model curriculum. Much has changed over the last dozen years in the job skills demands of undergraduate students and the curricular offerings of universities. The makeup of information systems has changed quite dramatically, with an increasing use of microcomputers and advances in telecommunications as evidence. As part of the process to keep the information systems curriculum up-to-date, this panel reviews the recommendations of 1981. The purpose of this panel is to address the following issues: (1) changes in the information systems profession which demand a response in curricular change, (2) the adequacy of the 1981 model in meeting the needs of the IS graduate in the 90s, and (3) specific recommendations for an Information System Curriculum for the 90s. 1 Jay F.
