Multi-person pose estimation in the wild is challenging. Although state-of-the-art human detectors have demonstrated good performance, small errors in localization and recognition are inevitable. These errors can cause failures for a single-person pose estimator (SPPE), especially for methods that solely depend on human detection results. In this paper, we propose a novel regional multi-person pose estimation (RMPE) framework to facilitate pose estimation in the presence of inaccurate human bounding boxes. Our framework consists of three components: Symmetric Spatial Transformer Network (SSTN), Parametric Pose Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS), and Pose-Guided Proposals Generator (PGPG). Our method is able to handle inaccurate bounding boxes and redundant detections, allowing it to achieve 76:7 mAP on the MPII (multi person) dataset[3]. Our model and source codes are made publicly available.
