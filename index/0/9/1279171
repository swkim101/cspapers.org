This paper describes the potential of systems in which many people collectively control a single constructed identity mediated by socio-technical networks. By looking to examples of identities that have spontaneously emerged from anonymous communities online, a model for pseudonym design in social machines is proposed. A framework of identity dimensions is presented as a means of exploring the functional types of identity encountered in social machines, and design guidelines are outlined that suggest possible approaches to this task.
