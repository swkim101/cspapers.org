Since its formation in World War II, and under a series of distinguished directors (Craik, Bartlett, Mackworth, Broadbent, and currently, Baddeley), the APU has developed a broad base of research capability. Areas now covered are audition, vision, attention, memory, language, reasoning, motor behavior, psychophysiology, clinical and neuropsychology. Our work on human interaction with real world artifacts focuses on the preparation and comprehension of information in documents, car driving, and, of course, the use of computers. Across these areas, the APU has often played a pioneering role, not only in individual research contributions, but in helping to establish the paradigms, theory, and practice of a given field of research.
The Unit is funded by the Department of Education and Science through the Medical Research Council. Our core budget is supplemented by external grants and contracts, providing in total for a research staff of around 45 and a support staff of 30. Each year we also have 10-12 graduate students and 6-15 visiting scientists.
