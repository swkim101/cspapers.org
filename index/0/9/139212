Social media services have spread throughout the world in just a few years. They have become not only a new source of information, but also new mechanisms for societies world-wide to organize themselves and communicate. Therefore, social media has a very strong impact in many aspects -- at personal level, in business, and in politics, among many others. In spite of its fast adoption, little is known about social media usage in different countries, and whether patterns of behavior remain the same or not. To provide deep understanding of differences between countries can be useful in many ways, e.g.: to improve the design of social media systems (which features work best for which country?), and influence marketing and political campaigns. Moreover, this type of analysis can provide relevant insight into how societies might differ. In this paper we present a summary of a large-scale analysis of Twitter for an extended period of time. We analyze in detail various aspects of social media for the ten countries we identified as most active. We collected one year's worth of data and report differences and similarities in terms of activity, sentiment, use of languages, and network structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first on-line social network study of such characteristics.
