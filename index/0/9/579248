Modern processors optimize for cache energy and performance by employing multiple levels of caching that address bandwidth, low-latency and high-capacity. A request typically traverses the cache hierarchy, level by level, until the data is found, thereby wasting time and energy in each level. In this paper, we present the Direct-to-Data (D2D) cache that locates data across the entire cache hierarchy with a single lookup.
