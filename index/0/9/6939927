We introduce a logic-based system which improves the performance of intelligent help systems by supplying them with plan generation and plan recognition components. Both components work in close mutual cooperation There are two modes of cross-talk between them, one where plan recognition is done on the basis of abstract plans provided by the planner and the other where optimal plans are generated based on recognition results The examples which are presented are taken from an operating system domain, namely from the UNIX mail domain.
