Zara the Supergirl is an interactive system that, while having a conversation with a user, uses its built in sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, facial and speech recognition modules, to exhibit the human-like response of sharing emotions. In addition, at the end of a 5-10 minute conversation with the user, it can give a comprehensive personality analysis based on the user’s interaction with Zara. This is a ﬁrst prototype that has incorporated a full empathy module, the recognition and response of human emotions, into a spoken language interactive system that enhances human-robot understanding. Zara was shown at the World Economic Forum in Dalian in September 2015
