Multimodal interfaces provide more flexible and compelling interaction and can enable public information kiosks to support more complex tasks for a broader community of users. MATCHKiosk is a multimodal interactive city guide which provides users with the freedom to interact using speech, pen, touch or multimodal inputs. The system responds by generating multimodal presentations that synchronize synthetic speech with a life-like virtual agent and dynamically generated graphics.
