As an innovative approach to the system requirements analysis, this paper proposes a computer aided method to develop objectives trees. This method consists of a procedure, algorithms and, a man-machine interactive graphic system. And two typical kinds of applications of the objectives tree in computer applications system planning are described. By this method, working man-hours to develop an objectives tree can be decreased, and quality of communication among system venders, end-users of a computer system, EDP managers and top executives, can be highly improved.
