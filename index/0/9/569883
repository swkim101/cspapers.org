Protein interaction networks are one of the most promising types of biological data for the discovery of functional modules and the prediction of individual protein functions. However, it is known that these networks are both incomplete and inaccurate, i.e., they have spurious edges and lackbiologically valid edges. One way to handle this problem is by transforming the original interaction graph into new graphs that remove spurious edges, add biologically valid ones, and assign reliability scores to the edges constituting the final network. We investigate currently existing methods, as well as propose a robust association analysis-based method for this task. This method is based on the concept of h-confidence, which is a measure that can be used to extract groups of objects having high similarity with each other. Experimental evaluation on several protein interaction data sets show that hyperclique-based transformations enhance the performance of standard function prediction algorithms significantly, and thus have merit.
