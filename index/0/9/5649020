What is the smallest constant c so that the planar point location queries can be answered in c log 2 n + o(log n) steps (i.e., point-line comparisons) in the worst case? M. T. Goodrich, M. Orletsky, and K. Ramaiyer (1997, in Proc 8th ACM-SIAM Symp on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), pp. 757-766) showed that c = 2 is possible using linear space and conjectured this to be optimal. We disprove this conjecture and show that c = 1 can be achieved. Moreover by giving upper and lower bounds we show that without space restrictions the worst case query complexity of planar point location differs from log 2 n + 2√log 2 n at most by an additive factor of (1/2)log 2 log 2 n + O(1). For the case of linear space we show the query complexity to be bounded by log 2 n √ 2√log 2 n + O(log 1/4 n).
