In many sensor-network application areas, control of the accuracy of acquired data is often crucial. Application control of accuracy can then be implemented and exploited for energy-efficiency. This view differs from the approach of Distributed Regression (DR) [1] which aggregates data and represents it efficiently using linear regression. While DR achieves a compact representation, it delivers a single accuracy. Another limitation of DR is outlier detection, a critical activity in sensor networks. We propose a system which allows application consumers of sensor data to control data accuracy, and reflects that requirement in a flexible energy-efficient data representation. This system enables these sensor networks to be “accuracyaware” in their management of resource usage.
