Argumentative Zoning (AZ) is an analysis of the argumentative and rhetorical structure of a scientific paper. It has been shown to be reliably used by independent human coders, and has proven useful for various information access tasks. Annotation experiments have however so far been restricted to one discipline, computational linguistics (CL). Here, we present a more informative AZ scheme with 15 categories in place of the original 7, and show that it can be applied to the life sciences as well as to CL. We use a domain expert to encode basic knowledge about the subject (such as terminology and domain specific rules for individual categories) as part of the annotation guidelines. Our results show that non-expert human coders can then use these guidelines to reliably annotate this scheme in two domains, chemistry and computational linguistics.
