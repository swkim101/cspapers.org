This demo paper presents a new sensor focusing on the measurement of real time foot plantar pressure distribution. IEE S.A. releases a single insole-solution for daily usage in order to acquire information on the plantar load dispersion in a large range of shoe configurations. The new High-Dynamic Force-Sensing Resistor (HD-FSR) multi-cell smart insole sensor enables advanced real-time gait analysis applications.
