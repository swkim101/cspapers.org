In IaaS clouds, virtual machines are booted on demand from user-provided disk images. Both the number of virtual machine images (VMIs) and their large size(GBs), challenge storage and network transfer solutions, and lead to perceivably slow VM startup times. In previous work, we proposed using small VMI caches (O(100MB)) that contain those parts of a VMI that are actually needed for booting. Here, we present Squirrel, a fully replicated storage architecture that exploits deduplication, compression, and snapshots from the ZFS file system, and lets us keep large quantities of VMI caches on all compute nodes of a data center with modest storage requirements. (Much like rodents cache precious food in many distributed places.) Our evaluation shows that we can store VMI caches for all 600+ community images of Windows Azure, worth 16.4TB of raw data, within 10GB of disk space and 60MB of main memory on each compute node of our DAS-4 cluster. Extrapolation to several thousands of images predicts the scalability of our approach.
