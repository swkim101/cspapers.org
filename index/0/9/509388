In a node-labeled graph, keyword search finds subtrees of the graph whose nodes contain all of the query keywords. This provides a way to query graph databases that neither requires mastery of a query language such as SPARQL, nor a deep knowledge of the database schema. We demonstrate eGraphSearch, a new system for effective keyword search in graph databases. Previous work ranks answer trees using combinations of structural and content-based metrics, such as path length between keywords or relevance of the labels in the answer tree to the query keywords. However, different nodes in the graph might have different importance, which affects the utility of the answer. In the proposed system, we implemented two new ways to rank keyword search results over graphs: the first one takes node importance into account while the second one is a bi-objective optimization of edge weights and node importance. In the demonstration, participants will execute keyword queries against several popular graph datasets.
