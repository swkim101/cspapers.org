This paper argues that understanding how professional software developers use diagrams and sketches in their work is an underexplored terrain. We illustrate this by summarizing a number of studies on sketching and diagramming across a variety of domains, and arguing for their limited generalizability. In order to develop further insight, we describe the design of a research project we are embarking upon and its grounding theoretical assumptions.
