In this paper, we approach the problem of real-time filtering in the Twitter Microblogging platform. We adapt an effective traditional news filtering technique, which uses a text classifier inspired by Rocchio's relevance feedback algorithm, to build and dynamically update a profile of the user's interests in real-time. In our adaptation, we tackle two challenges that are particularly prevalent in Twitter: sparsity and drift. In particular, sparsity stems from the brevity of tweets, while drift occurs as events related to the topic develop or the interests of the user change. First, to tackle the acute sparsity problem, we apply query expansion to derive terms or related tweets for a richer initialisation of the user interests within the profile. Second, to deal with drift, we modify the user profile to balance between the importance of the short-term interests, i.e. emerging subtopics, and the long-term interests in the overall topic. Moreover, we investigate an event detection method from Twitter and newswire streams to predict times at which drift may happen. Through experiments using the TREC Microblog track 2012, we show that our approach is effective for a number of common filtering metrics such as the user's utility, and that it compares favourably with state-of-the-art news filtering baselines. Our results also uncover the impact of different factors on handling topic drifting.
