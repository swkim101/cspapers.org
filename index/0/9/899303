We present a generalization of the ideal model for recursive polymorphic types. Types are defined as sets of terms instead of sets of elements of a semantic domain. Our proof of the existence of types (computed by fixpoint of a typing operator) does not rely on metric properties, but on the fact that the identity is the limit of a sequence of projection terms. This establishes a connection with the work of Pitts on relational properties of domains. This also suggests that ideals are better understood as closed sets of terms defined by orthogonality with respect to a set of contexts.
