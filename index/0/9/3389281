Software Engineering courses are essential for undergraduates to achieve a smooth transition from higher education to a career. However, many of these courses encounter complications that forbid them from meeting their goals such as: Real products and customers, project duration, software sophistication and more. At Chico State, we have implemented the Tech Startup Model in which the Software Engineering students partner with entrepreneurship students to allow for more collaboration and the creation of a customer-employee relation to address some of these issues. This model utilizes both Lean Startup as well as Agile Development to continuously test a student's ability to adapt to the customer's needs. The data accumulated from the past couple of semesters allowed us to analyze student behavior when exposed to the Tech Startup Model as opposed to other methods tested from previous semesters.
