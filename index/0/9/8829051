Measuring semantic similarity between words is vital for various applications in natural language processing, such as language modeling, information retrieval, and document clustering. We propose a method that utilizes the information available on the Web to measure semantic similarity between a pair of words or entities. We integrate page counts for each word in the pair and lexico-syntactic patterns that occur among the top ranking snippets for the AND query using support vector machines. Experimental results on MillerCharlesâ€™ benchmark data set show that the proposed measure outperforms all the existing web based semantic similarity measures by a wide margin, achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.834. Moreover, the proposed semantic similarity measure significantly improves the accuracy ( F measure of0.78) in a named entity clustering task, proving the capability of the proposed measure to capture semantic similarity using web content.
