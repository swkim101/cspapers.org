Predicting the arrival and residence time of individuals at their relevant places enables a plethora of novel applications. In this work we first analyze the theoretical predictability of arrival and residence times and then evaluate the performance of eight different residence time predictors. We show that these predictors tend to underestimate the time a user will spend at her relevant places.
