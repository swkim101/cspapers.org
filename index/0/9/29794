Computer science courses have increasingly made use of visualization tools to illustrate common algorithms. This paper describes Algorithm Explorer, an educational tool designed for use by instructors and students to examine algorithms in a rich environment composed of 3D data representations, 3D audio cues, and easy-to-use controls. Instructors and students can easily add calls to Algorithm Explorer's C++ API to their programs to quickly develop engaging visualizations, and every detail of the scene can be customized as the developer desires.
