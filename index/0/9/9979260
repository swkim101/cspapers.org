The literature on distributed robotic teams working in adversarial settings focuses primarily on external entities attempting to thwart the team. The question is raised, however, about what can be done when the adversary is within the team itself? That is, if one team member turns traitor? This paper presents an initial investigation into this question. A method is developed which can be used to classify the behavior of other team members, and provide a measure of how similar their behavior is to the expected behavior. A simulation and a real-world experiment are presented, and results show that expected and traitorous behavior are distinguishable in an example real-world setting.
