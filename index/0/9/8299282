In France, there is a generalized file transfer method used forcustomer-bank information exchange, on X25 networks and ontelephone switched lines (BSC 2780/3780 like protocol). It is usedby (almost) all France-based banks, and thousands of customers.
RONDO is an 00 file server, supporting these protocols. It wasdeveloped in BORLAND C++, with TURBO VISION graphics library.Without the included files, the overall code lines, as reported bythe project manager, are 22,000. The server works fine on a 386based PC, DOS 5.0. RONDOs capabilities are:
support up to four file transfers on public switchedcommunication lines, and four file transfers on X25 virtualcircuits, simultaneously,on-line verification of incoming files for format correctness,andon-line surveillance and administration.The demonstrations purposes are:
present a real-time application of the 00 technology, includinginterrupt control and encapsulation of an OEM X25 driver (not00);present a brand new user comfort for DOS communicationapplications;real time information about incoming transfers;optional operator zoom on different monitors: status,statistics, log, traffic, trace, file verification;configuration control;client diagnosis and support;present the internal objects grouped in 4 domains:communication, administration, user interface, and systemextension. Through graphic objects, this technology brings a spectacularnew comfort to DOS users with less overhead than in graphicalenvironments. For developers it provides reusable objects andsimple building logic.
