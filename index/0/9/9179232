Dexterous manipulation of everyday objects requires a precise tactile sense. Slip detection is mandatory to overcome uncertainty and compensate for external disturbances. We compare three different approaches for detecting slip. The methods are model-based slip detection via friction cones, vibration-based detection via bandpass filtering, and a common learning algorithm. They are implemented and tested on a tendon-driven two-finger setup equipped with two tactile BioTacÂ® sensors. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate each approach. The characteristics of the methods are discussed and compared.
