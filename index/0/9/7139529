Classic news summarization plays an important role with the exponential document growth on the Web. Many approaches are proposed to generate summaries but seldom simultaneously consider evolutionary characteristics of news plus to traditional summary elements. Therefore, we present a novel framework for the web mining problem named Evolutionary Timeline Summarization (ETS). Given the massive collection of time-stamped web documents related to a general news query, ETS aims to return the evolution trajectory along the timeline, consisting of individual but correlated summaries of each date, emphasizing relevance, coverage, coherence and cross-date diversity. ETS greatly facilitates fast news browsing and knowledge comprehension and hence is a necessity. We formally formulate the task as an optimization problem via iterative substitution from a set of sentences to a subset of sentences that satisfies the above requirements, balancing coherence/diversity measurement and local/global summary quality. The optimized substitution is iteratively conducted by incorporating several constraints until convergence. We develop experimental systems to evaluate on 6 instinctively different datasets which amount to 10251 documents. Performance comparisons between different system-generated timelines and manually created ones by human editors demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in terms of ROUGE metrics.
