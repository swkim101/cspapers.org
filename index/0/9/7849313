We consider labeling schemes for trees, supporting various relationships between nodes at small distance. For instance, we show that given a tree <i>T</i> and an integer <i>k</i> we can assign labels to each node of <i>T</i> such that given the label of two nodes we can decide, from these two labels alone, if the distance between <i>v</i> and <i>w</i> is at most <i>k</i> and if so compute it. For trees with <i>n</i> nodes and <i>k</i> ≥ 2, we give a lower bound on the maximum label length of log <i>n</i> + Ω(log log <i>n</i>) bits, and for constant <i>k</i>, we give an upper bound of log <i>n</i> + <i>O</i>(log log <i>n</i>). Bounds for ancestor, sibling, connectivity and bi- and triconnectivity labeling schemes are also presented.
