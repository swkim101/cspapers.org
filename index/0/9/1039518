In this paper we consider global fixed-priority preemptive multiprocessor scheduling of constrained-deadline sporadic tasks that share resources in a non-nested manner. We develop a novel resource-sharing protocol and a corresponding schedulability test for this system. We also develop the first schedulability analysis of priority inheritance protocol for the aforementioned system. Finally, we show that these protocols are efficient (based on the developed schedulability tests) for a class of priority-assignments called reasonable priority-assignments.
