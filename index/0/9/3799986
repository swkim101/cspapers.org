ABSTRACT We present a unique approa h to identifying news stories that in uen e the behavior of nan ial markets. Spe i ally, we des ribe the design and implementation of nalyst, a system that an re ommend interesting news stories { stories that are likely to a e t market behavior. nalyst operates by orrelating the ontent of news stories with trends in nan ial time series. We identify trends in time series using pie ewise linear tting and then assign labels to the trends a ording to an automated binning pro edure. We use language models to represent patterns of language that are highly asso iated with parti ular labeled trends. nalyst an then identify and re ommend news stories that are highly indi ative of future trends. We evaluate the system in terms of its ability to re ommend the stories that will a e t the behavior of the sto k market. We demonstrate that stories re ommended by nalyst ould be used to pro tably predi t forth oming trends in sto k pri es.
