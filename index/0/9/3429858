Processing data streams with Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees is an emerging area in existing streaming applications. Although it is possible to negotiate the result quality and to reserve the required processing resources in advance, it remains a challenge to adapt the DSMS to data stream characteristics which are not known in advance or are difficult to obtain. Within this paper we present the second generation of our QStream DSMS which addresses the above challenge by using a real-time capable operating system environment for resource reservation and by applying an adaptation mechanism if the data stream characteristics change spontaneously.
