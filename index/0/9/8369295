Human Odometry (HO) is the process of providing a person with a continuous estimate of their location, on the basis of information acquired solely by sensors carried around by the person themselves. In an effort towards the development of effective and robust HO systems, we present the Human Odometry Outdoor Dataset (HOOD), a public collection of labelled accelerometer and gyroscope data recordings. We compare four sensor placements (foot, waist, wrist, chest) to identify the most suitable placement for different types of motions (ranging from walking to slithering), occurring in highly diverse real environments (such as flat grass fields, staircases and rough terrains).
