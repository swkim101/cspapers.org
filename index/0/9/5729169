This paper describes an operating computer-aided system (COMET), which processes Automated Wire List data into many forms required in manufacturing, assembly, installation and automated check out of electrical and electronic systems. The presentation presumes an operating Automated Wire List system and specifies some of the value benefits achieved at North American Aviation, Inc. The COMET description is presented from the viewpoint of Manufacturing Engineering as an interface communication link between Engineering Design, at the point of information generation, and those Production functions which must build and check out complex wiring systems using this same information. Description of the computer programming involved is not included.
