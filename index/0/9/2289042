The goal of this paper is to use innovative text and graph mining algorithms along with full-text citation analysis and topic modeling to enhance classical bibliometric analysis and publication ranking. By utilizing citation contexts extracted from a large number of full-text publications, each citation or publication is represented by a probability distribution over a set of predefined topics, where each topic is labeled by an author contributed keyword. We then used publication/citation topic distribution to generate a citation graph with vertex prior and edge transitioning probability distributions. The publication importance score for each given topic is calculated by PageRank with edge and vertex prior distributions. Based on 104 topics (labeled with keywords) and their review papers, the cited publications of each review paper are assumed as "important publications" for ranking evaluation. The result shows that full text citation and publication content prior topic distribution along with the PageRank algorithm can significantly enhance bibliometric analysis and scientific publication ranking performance for academic IR system.
