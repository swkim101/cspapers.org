Braid groups have recently attracted the attention of many cryptographers as an alternative to number-theoretic public key cryptography. But the published braid-based signatures have failed to reach the most desired security, i.e., existential unforgeability under adaptively chosen message attack (EUF-CMA). In this paper, we at first prompt a new kind of braid-based assumption --- one-more matching conjugate assumption; and then based on it, we prove that some braid-based signatures are EUF-CMA secure in the random oracle model.
