It is known that human controls muscles for hand poses in a coordinated manner and the coordination is referred to as a postural synergy. Using postural synergies, dexterous grasping tasks could be accomplished on a prosthetic hand via only a few (usually two) control inputs. Instead of implementing postural synergies digitally, this paper presents the design of a simple continuum mechanism for implementing the postural synergies mechanically. The design, fabrication and assembly of a prosthetic hand are firstly presented, followed by the synthesis of postural synergies from various grasping poses. Referring to the extracted postural synergies, structural parameters of the continuum mechanism are calculated based on a kinematics model. Experimental verifications are also presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed idea.
