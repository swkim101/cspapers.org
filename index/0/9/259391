Since the publication of the Curriculum 68 report of the ACM Committee [CUR 68], undergraduate computer science programs have undergone substantial changes. Notably, many courses previously taught at the graduate level have shifted down to the undergraduate level; new areas have developed and consolidated but were not covered by the ACM report. These facts make it necessary to revise and update the Curriculum 68 report. An important factor which could help the revision is the actual experience gained through the development of many new undergraduate computer science programs since the publication of Curriculum 68 report five years ago. More specifically, most recommendations of the ACM report contain just the subject areas to be taught. The actual teaching experiences of these courses have formulated certain basic philosophies and formats of presentation. It is helpful, in our opinion, to compare the merits of these philosophies and formats of presentation.
 In this paper, we shall discuss the basic philosophies and formats of presentation of two undergraduate computer science coursesâ€”Introduction to Discrete Structures, and Computational Analysis. The former coincides with the B3 course of the Curriculum 68 report; the latter is a new course not covered by the ACM report.
