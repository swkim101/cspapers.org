Staff in the Departments of Computer Science and Psychology at the University of York have been cooperating in interdisciplinary research since 1983. The mainstream of York's approach is to apply theory developed in these parent disciplines to HCI design. Our goal is to integrate formal and empirical methods. By formal methods we mean mathematical models that are capable of capturing properties of a user interface. By empirical methods we mean the observation and measurement of user behaviour. Integration of these two approaches is achieved by an iterative design process in which formal models are successively refined by testing their predictions against the results of user trials.
