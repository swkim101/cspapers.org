In this paper we present the PorSimples project, whose aim is to develop text adaptations tools for Brazilian Portuguese. The tools developed cater for both people at poor literacy levels and authors that want to produce texts for this audience. Here we describe the tools and resources developed over two years of this project and point directions for future work and collaboration. Since Portuguese and Spanish have many aspects in common, we believe our main point for collaboration lies in transferring our knowledge and experience to researches willing to developed simplification and elaboration tools for Spanish.
