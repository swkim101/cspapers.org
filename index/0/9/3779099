Computer networks have historically considered support for mobile devices as an extra overhead to be borne by the system. Recently however, researchers have proposed methods by which the network can take advantage of mobile components. We exploit mobility to develop a fluid infrastructure: mobile components are deliberately built into the system infrastructure for enabling specific functionality that is very hard to achieve using other methods. Built-in intelligence helps our system adapt to run time dynamics when pursuing pre-defined performance objectives. Our approach yields significant advantages for energy constrained systems, sparsely deployed networks, delay tolerant networks, and in security sensitive situations. We first show why our approach is advantageous in terms of network lifetime and data fidelity. Second, we present adaptive algorithms that are used to control mobility. Third, we design the communication protocol supporting a fluid infrastructure and long sleep durations on energy-constrained devices. Our algorithms are not based on abstract radio range models or idealized unobstructed environments but founded on real world behavior of wireless devices. We implement a prototype system in which infrastructure components move autonomously to carry out important networking tasks. The prototype is used to validate and evaluate our suggested mobility control methods.
