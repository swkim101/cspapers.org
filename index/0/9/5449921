In this paper, we show decidabil i ty of a rather expressive fragment of the situation calculus. We allow second order quantif ication over finite and inf inite sets of situations. We do not impose a domain closure assumption on actions; therefore, infinite and even uncountable domains are allowed. The decision procedure is based on automata accepting infinite trees.
