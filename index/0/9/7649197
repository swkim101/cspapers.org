Much has been said about the need to teach computer programming and the fundamental ideas of computer science in STEM education. Initiatives aimed at this audience propose new requirements, curricula, tools, and teaching methodologies to encourage widespread computational literacy. But what is being done in non-STEM disciplines to promote literacy? The goal of this panel is to open a discussion about advancing computer science education within the digital arts and humanities and how this might relate or combine with similar efforts in STEM. What can members of the digital arts and humanities community learn from each other about starting new curricula and teaching these subjects, and what can be learned and borrowed from STEM education? To begin the discussion, we will present a report on a computational methods course we developed for beginning architecture students and how this has led to an ongoing collaboration with our computer science department.
