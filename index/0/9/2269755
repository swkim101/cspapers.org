The RPM is considered to be one of the premier psychometric measures of general intelligence. Current computational accounts of the RPM assume that visual test inputs are translated into propositional representations before further reasoning takes place. We propose that visual strategies can also solve RPM problems, in line with behavioral evidence showing that humans do use visual strategies to some extent on the RPM. Our two visual methods currently solve RPM problems at the level of typical 9- to 10-year-olds.
