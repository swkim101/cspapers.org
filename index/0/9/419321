While traditional question answering (QA) systems tailored to the TREC QA task work relatively well for simple questions, they do not suffice to answer real world questions. The community-based QA systems offer this service well, as they contain large archives of such questions where manually crafted answers are directly available. However, finding similar questions in the QA archive is not trivial. In this paper, we propose a new retrieval framework based on syntactic tree structure to tackle the similar question matching problem. We build a ground-truth set from Yahoo! Answers, and experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional bag-of-word or tree kernel based methods by 8.3% in mean average precision. It further achieves up to 50% improvement by incorporating semantic features as well as matching of potential answers. Our model does not rely on training, and it is demonstrated to be robust against grammatical errors as well.
