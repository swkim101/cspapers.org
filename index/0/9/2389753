This session introduces a set of intriguing, colorful, and illustrative problems and shows how problem solving techniques can be used throughout the curriculum in solving them. These problems could be introduced in courses on Data Structures, Algorithms, or in programming contest preparations. The intriguing and challenging nature of the problems makes them attractive pedagogically and the techniques used in solving the problems should be part of every computer science educator's bag-of-tricks.
