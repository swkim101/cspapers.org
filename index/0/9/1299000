As a user interacts with a database or expert system, s/he may reveal a misconception about the objects modeled by the system. This paper discusses the ROMPER system for responding to such misconceptions in a domain independent and context sensitive fashion. ROMPER reasons about possible sources of the misconception. It operates on a model of the user and generates a cooperative response based on this reasoning. The process is made context sensitive by augmenting the user model with a new notion of object perspective which highlights certain aspects of the user model due to previous discourse.
