The phase holds crucial information about image structures and features, but only the real part or the magnitude of the transform coefficients is often used for image processing applications. In this paper, a method for the feature extraction of images called Phase-based LBP is presented. Proposed method is based on the combination of phase of complex wavelet coefficients and the Local Binary Pattern operator (LBP). We also perform the comparative analysis about retrieval effectiveness of phase information of some complex wavelet transforms using for Phase-based LBP. Experimental results, achieved with the standard rotated Brodatz dataset, show the interest of this method comparing with another methods only based on the real part or the magnitude of the wavelet coefficients for texture image retrieval.
