There are many difficulties in dexterous object manipulation by multi-fingered hands, due to redundant degree-of-freedom of the entire system and uncertainties in interaction with the object. In this paper, however, 3D object manipulation without any external sensors are attempted. Under the assumption of point contact without rolling, the object position and orientation are computed in relative sense and used as the feedback for object manipulation. Overall system dynamics including two cone-shaped finger robots and an arbitrary object is modeled, and the closed-loop system stability is analyzed based with the proposed controllers for stable grasping and object position/orientation control. In order to validate the proposed method, dynamic simulation is conducted, and showed complacent results.
