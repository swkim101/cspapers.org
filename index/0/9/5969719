A major factor in the effectiveness of the interaction which users have with Web applications is the ease with which they can locate information and functionality which they are seeking. Effective design is however complicated by the multiple design purposes and diverse users which Web applications typically support. In this paper we describe a navigational design method aimed at optimising designs through minimizing navigational entropy. The approach uses a theoretical navigational depth for the various information and service components to moderate a nested hierarchical clustering of the content.
