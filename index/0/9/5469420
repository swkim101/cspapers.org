The task of finding the largest empty ellipsoid defined by a set of n point sites in Rd is investigated. It is shown that this can be solved by enumerating the facets of the convex hull of the sites projected onto a manifold in R[d(d+3)/2]. While O(n[d(d+3)/4]) time is required in the worst case, it is found that O(nd) suffices on average for independent uniform points when d is fixed and n increases without bound. The effects on the running time caused by imposing certain restrictions on the orientation and shape of the ellipsoid are also described. Applications to motion planning and design centering are considered briefly.
