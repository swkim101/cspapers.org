At the present manufacturers' network architectures do not provide co-operation between systems exceeding the boundaries of their own homogeneous networks, i.e. open systems as defined the ISO Reference Model of Open Systems Inter-connection do not yet exist. Project SNATCH shows to open the closed network architectures of two important computer manufacturers by means of gateway system. Mapping the manufacturers protocols onto neutral protocols and vice versa, gateway system acts as a channel between the closed manufacturers' networks. Since this solution is in principle not restricted to systems of only two manufacturers, SNATCH points out a practicable way to a generally open system.
