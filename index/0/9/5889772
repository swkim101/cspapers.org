In light of the declining number of new students pursuing education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, informal science educators have adopted public participation in scientific research as a tool to produce gains in engagement. Following their lead, we propose to use a form of public participation in scientific research known as participatory sensing to increase engagement in these academic areas. Participatory sensing involves volunteers using mobile phones and the embedded sensing capabilities to collect data, and is well suited for the task as it provides the students with a familiar tool for conducting complex scientific research. To accomplish this goal, we have developed two components: a toolkit for defining, creating, and managing a participatory sensing campaign, including automated generation of mobile applications; and a curriculum designed around the toolkit, where students conduct scientific research with mobile phones as their primary data collection tools. Thus far, the results of this work have shown the potential for participatory sensing as an informal education tool to increase engagement and interest in pursuing careers in science and technology.
