Much attention has recently been given to a printing method because they are easily designable, have a low cost, and can be mass produced. Numerous electronic devices are fabricated using printing methods because of these advantages. In paper mechatronics, attempts have been made to fabricate robots by printing on paper substrates. The robots are given structures through self-folding and functions using printed actuators. We developed a new system and device to fabricate more sophisticated printed robots. First, we successfully fabricated complex self-folding structures by applying an automatic cutting. Second, a rapidly created and low-voltage electrothermal actuator was developed using an inkjet printed circuit. Finally, a printed robot was fabricated by combining two techniques and two types of paper; a structure design paper and a circuit design paper. Gripper and conveyor robots were fabricated, and their functions were verified. These works demonstrate the possibility of paper mechatronics for rapid and low-cost prototyping as well as of printed robots.
