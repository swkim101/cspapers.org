We do not have a good understanding of how theoretical principles of learning are realized in neural systems. To address this problem we built a computational model of development in the owl's sound localization system. The structure of the model is drawn from known experimental data while the learning principles come from recent work in the field of brain style computation. The model accounts for numerous properties of the owl's sound localization system, makes specific and testable predictions for future experiments, and provides a theory of the developmental process.
