The proposed demonstration requests DBPedia.org, gets the results and uses them to populate wiki pages with semantic annotations using RDFaLite. These annotations are persisted in a RDF store and we will show how this data can be reused by other applications, e.g. for a semantic mashup that displays all collected metadata about cities on a single map page. It has been developed using WikiNEXT, a mix between a semantic wiki and a web-based IDE. The tool is online , open source ; screencasts are available on YouTube (look for "WikiNext").
