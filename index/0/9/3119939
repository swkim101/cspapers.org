The problem of modeling and controlling resources in a system with interaction between hardware and software is considered. A model encompassing both hardware and software dynamics is developed together with an on-line estimation scheme in order reduce dependence on a-priori information. A control structure is presented in order to control performance under constrained resource situations and to reduce effects of estimation errors and disturbances. The approach is applied to a conversational video case and evaluated through simulations.
