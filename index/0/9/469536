Discriminative methods for visual object category recognition are typically non-probabilistic, predicting class labels but not directly providing an estimate of uncertainty. Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful regression techniques with explicit uncertainty models; we show here how Gaussian Processes with covariance functions defined based on a Pyramid Match Kernel (PMK) can be used for probabilistic object category recognition. The uncertainty model provided by GPs offers confidence estimates at test points, and naturally allows for an active learning paradigm in which points are optimally selected for interactive labeling. We derive a novel active category learning method based on our probabilistic regression model, and show that a significant boost in classification performance is possible, especially when the amount of training data for a category is ultimately very small.
