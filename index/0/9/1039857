The rapid growth in use of interactive graphic systems for geo-coded data bases has expanded interest about the computer-aided mapping processes by many groups involved in automation. Surveying and mapping were early users of computer technology and the current systems and practices are evolving through changes to modern classical analog mapping. The various phases of the process, from aerial photography acquisition through computer-driven hard copy output plots are reviewed as a basis for understanding and appreciating the problems associated with data preparation and entry.
