The purpose of the present paper is to study systems in which different job types are present at the various servers and are processed according to a variety of scheduling disciplines, in particular in “first-come, first-served” order. Our approach is numerical, and is applied to an example which is also analyzed by means of the Gordon and Newell (GN) model. Using a plausible method of fitting the latter provides a reasonably, satisfactory approximation to the “true” multitype system parameters.
