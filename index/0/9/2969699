This paper explores the idea of reducing a robot's energy consumption while following a trajectory by turning off the main localisation subsystem and switching to a lower-powered, less accurate odometry source at appropriate times. This applies to scenarios where the robot is permitted to deviate from the original trajectory, which allows for energy savings. Sensor scheduling is formulated as a probabilistic belief planning problem. Two algorithms are presented which generate feasible perception schedules: the first is based upon a simple heuristic; the second leverages dynamic programming to obtain optimal plans. Both simulations and real-world experiments on a planetary rover prototype demonstrate over 50% savings in perception-related energy, which translates into a 12% reduction in total energy consumption.
