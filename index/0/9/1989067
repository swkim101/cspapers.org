In creative introspection, whether in art or in science, framing the right question is as important as finding the right answer. Presupposition-laden questions are themselves a source of knowledge, and in this paper we show how widely-held beliefs about the world can be dynamically acquired by harvesting such questions from the Web. We show how metaphorical reasoning can be modeled as an introspective process, one that builds on questions harvested from the Web to pose further speculative questions and queries. Metaphor is much more than a knowledge-hungry rhetorical device: it is a conceptual lever that allows a system to extend its model of the world.
