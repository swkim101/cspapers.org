Comprehensive yet personalized information for a location is usually desired by mobile users in situ. Traditional navigation systems provide complete static information, such as address, contact, even photos and reviews for a certain place. However, such information does not reflect the real time situation (e.g. popularity/crowdness). Location-based social networks provide opportunity to build social dynamics between the place and potential visitors. In this work, we propose a design by leveraging public online information with users' social network resources to provide real time exploration in novel environments. A mobile application is implemented using Wikipedia, Panoramio, and Foursquare data to provide complete, updated, and trustworthy information. Design highlights and implementation are reported.
