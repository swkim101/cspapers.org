Some user needs in real life can only be accomplished by leveraging the intelligence and labor of other people via crowdsourcing tasks. For example, one may want to confirm the validity of the description of a secondhand laptop by asking someone else to inspect the laptop on site. To integrate these crowdsourcing tasks into user applications, it is required that crowd intelligence and labor be provided as easily accessible services (e.g., Web services), which can be called crowd services. In this paper, we develop a framework named CrowdService which supplies crowd intelligence and labor as publicly accessible crowd services via mobile crowd-sourcing. We implement the proposed framework on the Android platform and evaluate its usability with a user study.
