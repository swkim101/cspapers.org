In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to the identification and resolution of Chinese anaphoric zero pronouns. We perform both identification and resolution automatically, with two sets of easily computable features. Experimental results show that our proposed learning approach achieves anaphoric zero pronoun resolution accuracy comparable to a previous state-ofthe-art, heuristic rule-based approach. To our knowledge, our work is the first to perform both identification and resolution of Chinese anaphoric zero pronouns using a machine learning approach.
