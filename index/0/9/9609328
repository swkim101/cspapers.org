Designing computer-based learning environments must account for the context in which activity occurs, the tasks that students perform, and the tools that facilitate these tasks. When designing for school use, it is also crucial to consider how the software will be integrated into the organization of the classroom workplace and how teacher practices influence the adoption and success of interactive learning environments. This paper discusses our experiences in designing and deploying an interactive video tool to high school classrooms. We stress a classroom-centered design that tries to integrate usable software with interactions that occur “outside of the box” to alter traditional school learning.
