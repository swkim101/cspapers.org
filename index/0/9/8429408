The run-flat tire has a tread for contacting a ground surface and a belt package with belt plies interior to the tread for support of the tread. A plurality of radially reinforced carcass layers are positioned interior to the belt plies and include at least one carcass layer that extends between spaced apart annular beads. The tire has a pair of sidewalls each extending radially inward from shoulders at lateral edges of the belt package to the annular beads. The sidewalls have a plurality of sidewall stiffening members to support the tire during a loss of inflation pressure. The carcass layers are disposed with the sidewall stiffening members to help support the run-flat tire with a loss of inflation pressure. The spaced apart beads have a unique design including bead cores placed at a predetermined diameter with respect to a rim diameter, dual bead fillers above the bead cores, a heel corner spaced at a radial gap distance from a rim flange and rim interface components having a seat interface distance below the bead core for mounting the run-flat tire on a conventional rim and for sustaining the run-flat tire on the conventional rim with a loss of inflation pressure within the run-flat tire.
