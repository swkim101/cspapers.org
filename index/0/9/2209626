Recognizing and manipulating objects is an important task for mobile robots performing useful services in everyday environments. In this paper, we develop a system that enables a robot to grasp an object and to move it in front of its depth camera so as to build a 3D surface model of the object. We derive an information gain based variant of the next best view algorithm in order to determine how the manipulator should move the object in front of the camera. By considering occlusions caused by the robot manipulator, our technique also determines when and how the robot should re-grasp the object in order to build a complete model.
