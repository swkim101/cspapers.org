This paper describes a course designed to fill the need for education in the HumanComputer Communication area as described in the Denning report [4]. The course is still evolving, but it seems to illustrate a successful approach to undergraduate computer science education in this increasingly important area. User Interface Programming is an upper-division elective for computer science majors. Since it is taught in the January term of a 4-1-4 curriculum, its lectures are somewhat abbreviated so it might serve as a model for only part of a similar course in a full semester. Its focus is on the implementation of user interfaces for fairly simple programs but it also gives an overview of human-computer interaction examples, theory and principles. It uses no single text
