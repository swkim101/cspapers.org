In previous studies, Chinese text retrieval has often been dealt with on the character basis. This approach is not suited to deal with complex queries. We suggest that Chirmse text retrieval should work with words inslead of characters. The crucial problem is to segment originally continuous Chinese texts into words. In this paper, wc Ilrsi propose a hybrid segmentation approach which unifies the commonly used approaches. The systcm SMART is then udaptcd to index the segmented Chinese texls. Finally, wc suggest that Chinese text retrieval should move further to include a thesaurus in order to cope with dle rich vocabulary of Chinese.
