Cable driven power transmission is popular in many manipulator applications including medical arms. In spite of advantages obtained by removing motors from the mechanism, cable transmission introduces higher non-linearity and more uncertainties such as cable stretch and cable coupling. In order to improve the control precision and robustness of the Raven-II surgical robot, particularly for automation applications, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) was adopted for state estimation. The UKF estimated state variables of the Raven-II dynamic model from sensor data. The dual UKF was used offline to estimate cable coupling parameters. The experimental results showed that the proposed method improved joint position estimation precision and the estimation consistency, especially on the more elastic links. The improvements for links 2 and 3 of the Raven were 36.76%, and 62.99%, respectively. For link 1 the improvement was 1.43% because the transmission is very stiff.
