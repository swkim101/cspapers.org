However, in general, model-based revision operators are limited due to lack of efficient algorithms and inexpressibility of the revision results. In this paper, we make both theoretical and practical contribution to efficient computation of model-based revisions in DL-Lite. Specifically, we show that maximal approximations of two well-known model-based revisions for DL-Lite_R can be computed using a syntactic algorithm. However, such a coincidence of model-based and syntactic approaches does not hold when role functionality axioms are allowed. As a result, we identify conditions that guarantee such a coincidence for DL-Lite_FR. Our result shows that both model-based and syntactic revisions can co-exist seamlessly and the advantages of both approaches can be taken in one revision operator. Based on our theoretical results, we develop a graph-based algorithm for the revision operat
