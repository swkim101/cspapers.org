A common complaint about PKI is that it is simply too hard to use at the end-user level. Somewhat surprisingly, there exists no PKI equivalent of DHCP or BOOTP for automated, transparent PKI setup, leaving the certificate user experience similar to the process of bringing up an X.25 link. This paper provides a PKI equivalent of these basic bootstrap services that provides automatic, transparent configuration and setup of certificate information, with the user needing to supply no more than their user name and password. The work covers the design process involved and tradeoffs made, implementation details, and experiences with actual operation. The overall purpose of the work is to design and implement a plug-and-play certificate setup mechanism usable by even the most inexperienced user, a "PKI your mother can use".
