Stubs on Wikipedia often lack comprehensive information. The huge cost of editing Wikipedia and the presence of only a limited number of active contributors curb the consistent growth of Wikipedia. In this work, we present WikiKreator, a system that is capable of generating content automatically to improve existing stubs on Wikipedia. The system has two components. First, a text classifier built using topic distribution vectors is used to assign content from the web to various sections on a Wikipedia article. Second, we propose a novel abstractive summarization technique based on an optimization framework that generates section-specific summaries for Wikipedia stubs. Experiments show that WikiKreator is capable of generating well-formed informative content. Further, automatically generated content from our system have been appended to Wikipedia stubs and the content has been retained successfully proving the effectiveness of our approach.
