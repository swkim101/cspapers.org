ABSTRACT With the growth and a eptan e of the Internet, there has been in reased interest in maintaining anonymity in the network. This paper presents a new proto ol for initiator anonymity alled Hordes, whi h uses forwarding me hanisms similar to those used in previous proto ols for sending data, but is the rst proto ol to make use of the anonymity inherent in multi ast routing to re eive data. We show this results in shorter transmission laten ies and requires less work of the proto ol parti ipants, in terms of the messages pro essed. We also present a omparison of the se urity and anonymity of Hordes with previous proto ols, using the rst quantitative de nition of anonymity and unlinkability. Our analysis shows that Hordes provides anonymity in a degree similar to that of Crowds and Onion Routing, but also that Hordes has numerous performan e advantages.
