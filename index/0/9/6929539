This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of TBBT, the first comprehensive NFS trace replay tool. Given an NFS trace, TBBT automatically detects and repairs missing operations in the trace, derives a file system image required to successfully replay the trace, ages the file system image appropriately, initializes the file server under test with that image, and finally drives the file server with a workload that is derived from replaying the trace according to user-specified parameters. TBBT can scale a trace temporally or spatially to meet the need of a simulation run without violating dependencies among file system operations in the trace.
