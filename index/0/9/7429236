Caching query results is an efficient technique for Web search engines. Admission policy can prevent infrequent queries from taking space of more frequent queries in the cache. In this paper we present two novel admission policies tailored for query results cache. These policies are based on query results prefetching information. We also propose a demote operation for the query results cache to improve the cache hit ratio. We then use a trace of over 5 million queries to evaluate our admission policies, as well as traditional policies. Experimental results show that our prefetch-aware admission policies can achieve hit ratios better than state-of-the-art admission policies.
