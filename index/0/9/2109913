We investigate the problem of general entity retrieval for enterprise websites. Our framework transforms the webpage content into a structured content representation, which captures hierarchical information blocks and semi-structured data records information. To facilitate entity retrieval given a user query, we develop a structured positional entity language model suitable for ranking entities extracted from the webpage content incorporating the structured content representation. Different from existing language models for retrieval, our proposed model considers both the proximity and the structured webpage content in a unified manner. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
