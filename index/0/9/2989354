We present an experiment to compare a standard, minimally distinguishing algorithm for the generation of relational referring expressions with two alternatives that produce overspecified descriptions. The experiment shows that discrimination which normally plays a major role in the disambiguation task is also a major influence in referential overspecification, even though disambiguation is in principle not relevant.
