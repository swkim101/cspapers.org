Microblogs have recently received widespread interest from NLP researchers. However, current tools for Japanese word segmentation and POS tagging still perform poorly on microblog texts. We developed an annotated corpus and proposed a joint model for overcoming this situation. Our annotated corpus of microblog texts enables not only training of accurate statistical models but also quantitative evaluation of their performance. Our joint model with lexical normalization handles the orthographic diversity of microblog texts. We conducted an experiment to demonstrate that the corpus and model substantially contribute to boosting accuracy.
