To enable the prospect of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks(WMSNs), in this paper the lightweight image processing algorithms embeddable on the camera sensor node are proposed. (1) the target segmentation algorithm effectively solves the influence of changing light and low gray contrast, and reserves complete target shape. (2) the target shape feature extraction algorithm well removes the influence of segmentation holes and scatter noise, and accurately extracts key shape features. In the evaluation, the renderings processed by the algorithms illustrate fully the effectiveness of target segmentation and the accuracy of target shape feature extraction.
