Race conditions are common in web applicationsbut are difficult to diagnose and repair. Although there existtools for detecting races in web applications, they all report alarge number of false positives. That is, the races they report areeither bogus, meaning they can never occur in practice, or benign, meaning they do not lead to erroneous behaviors. Since manuallydiagnosing them is tedious and error prone, reporting theserace warnings to developers would be counter-productive. Wepropose a platform-agnostic, deterministic replay-based methodfor identifying not only the real but also the truly harmful raceconditions. It relies on executing each pair of racing events in twodifferent orders and assessing their impact on the program state:we say a race is harmful only if (1) both of the two executions arefeasible and (2) they lead to different program states. We haveevaluated our evidence-based classification method on a large setof real websites from Fortune-500 companies and demonstratedthat it significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art techniques.
