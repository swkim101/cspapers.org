Supply chains are ubiquitous in the manufacturing of many complex products. Traditionally, supply chains have been created through the interactions of human representatives of the companies involved, but advances in autonomous agent technologies have sparked an interest in automating the process. The Trading Agent Competition Supply Chain Management (TAC SCM) scenario provides a unique testbed for studying supply chain management agents. This paper introduces TacTex-05 (the champion agent from the 2005 competition), describes its constituent intelligent components, and examines the success of the complete agent through analysis of competition results and controlled experiments.
