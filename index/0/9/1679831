TeraGrid (www.teragrid.org) is launching a new program to establish partnerships with campuses. Opportunities for partnership are in the developmental stage and may include one or more of the following possibilities: 1) authentication and authorization for access from a campus grid to TeraGrid resources, 2) provisioning of computational resources to the community, 3) provisioning of scientific data collections to the community, 4) campus affiliations, and 5) training programs for campus faculty, staff and students.Community input is needed at this time to help shape and define the nature of these partnerships to create a win-win environment that will benefit the research and education community.Participants will be provided with information about the goals and objectives of the campus partnership program and will be encouraged to share their perspectives on how a campus partnership program can best be structured to benefit campus communities. These discussions will help shape the development of the program.
