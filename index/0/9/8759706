Student programmers have difficulty finding and fixing syntax, logic and style errors in their programs. The Code Analyzer for Pascal (CAP) analyzes programs that use a subset of the Pascal language and provides user-friendly feedback on the errors that it finds. This paper describes CAP and reports its use in teaching introductory programming at the United States Air Force Academy.
