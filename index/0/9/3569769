Since security education is not required in CS curriculum, many CS undergraduates can successfully achieve their degree without being exposed to any security courses during their course of study and enter the digital workforce with no knowledge or basic understanding of information security -- one of the essential skill sets for the 21st century. To address this concern, Information Assurance and Security (IAS) has been designated as a new knowledge area in the new ACM/IEEE-CS Curricula 2013. This workshop empowers CS faculty to access and use freely available resources to integrate security in to their CS curriculum will help institutions to meet ACM/IEEE-CS guideline. With support from NSF (Award# DUE-1140864, #1438861), at the CyberSecurity Education, Research and Outreach Center at Tennessee Tech, we have developed a set of readily available resources called SecKnitKit (Security Knitting Kit, www.secknitkit.org), which offers a suite of instructional material for non-security faculty (faculty whose primary teaching/research focus is not security) to integrate security in upper division CS courses such as operating systems, software engineering, computer networks and databases. Resources include lecture slides with notes, assessment questions and homework/classroom assignments with all details and technical support. The participants will receive access to all SecKnitKit materials (instructional and assessment) of interest and demonstrated use of the active learning exercises. There are six participant slots for each of the four courses mentioned above and participants will have an option to select their courses of choice at registration time.
