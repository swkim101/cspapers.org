An analog focal-plane processor having a 128 x 128 photodiode array has been developed for directional edge filtering. It can perform 4 x 4-pixel kernel convolution for entire pixels only with 256 steps of simple analog processing. Newly developed cyclic line access and row-parallel processing scheme in conjunction with the "only-nearest-neighbor interconnects" architecture has enabled a very simple implementation. A proof-of-concept chip was fabricated in a 0.35-Î¼m 2-poly 3-metal CMOS technology and the edge filtering at a rate of 200 frames/sec. has been experimentally demonstrated.
