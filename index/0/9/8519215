In this paper, we propose an initial structure to support a taxonomy for Web Observatories (WO). The work is based on a small sample of cases drawn from the work of the Web Science Trust and the Web Science Institute and reflects aspects of academic, business and government Observatories. Whilst this is early work it is hoped, by drawing broad brushstrokes at the edges of different types of Observatory, that future work based on a more systematic review will refine this model and hence refine our understanding of the nature of Observatories. We also seek here to enhance a faceted classification scheme (which is thought to be weak in the area of visualisation) through the use of simplified concept maps.
