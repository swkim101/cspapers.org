In this paper, we propose a new feature extraction technique for program execution logs. First, we automatically extract complex patterns from a program's behavior graph. Then, we embed these patterns into a continuous space by training an autoencoder. We evaluate the proposed features on a real-world malicious software detection task. We also find that the embedding space captures interpretable structures in the space of pattern parts.
