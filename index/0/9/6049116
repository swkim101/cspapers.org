This paper describes the design and development of an automated construction quality assessment robot system (QuicaBot) for hollowness, crack, evenness, alignments and inclination problems. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to pave the way towards a fully autonomous robotic system for post construction quality assessment of buildings. The main goal of the novel robot is twofold: to systematize the manual inspection work through automation resulting in more reliable and objective inspection reports, and to speed up the inspection process resulting in a cost reduction. Based-on our initial on-site tests, the developed robot increases the overall efficiency in all the aforementioned five problems.
