Through clean-slate implementation of two storage optimizations--track-aligned extents and track-aligned RAIDs--this paper shows the values of independent validations. The experience revealed many unanticipated disk and storage data path behaviors as potential roadblocks for wide deployment of these optimizations, and also identified implementation issues to retrofit these concepts to legacy data paths.
