The Web, similar to other successful man made systems is continuously evolving. With the miniaturization and increased performance of computing devices which are also being embedded in common physical objects, it is natural that the Web evolved to also include these - therefore the Web of Things. This tutorial provides an overview of the system vertical structure by identifying the relevant components, illustrating their functionality and showing existing tools and systems. The aim is to show how small devices can be connected to the Web at various levels of abstraction and transform them into "first-class" Web residents.
