There is an increasing demand for systems that can automatically analyze images and extract semantically meaningful information. IRIS, an Integrated Retinal Information system, has been developed to provide medical professionals easy and unified access to the screening, trend and progression of diabetic-related eye diseases in a diabetic patient database. This paper shows how mining techniques can be used to accurately extract features in the retinal images. In particular, we apply a classification approach to determine the conditions for tortuousity in retinal blood vessels.
