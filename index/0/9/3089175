Morphological inflection generation is the task of generating the inflected form of a given lemma corresponding to a particular linguistic transformation. We model the problem of inflection generation as a character sequence to sequence learning problem and present a variant of the neural encoder-decoder model for solving it. Our model is language independent and can be trained in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. We evaluate our system on seven datasets of morphologically rich languages and achieve either better or comparable results to existing state-of-the-art models of inflection generation.
