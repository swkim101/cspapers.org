The testability of a VLSI design is strongly affected by its register-transfer level (RTL) structure. Since the high-level synthesis process determines the RTL structure, it is necessary to consider testability during high-level synthesis. A synthesis system composed of scheduling and binding components minimizes the number of hardware sharing conicts between tests in the test schedule. Novel test conict estimates are used to direct the synthesis process. The test conflict estimation is based on examination of the interconnect structure of the partial design state during synthesis. Test conict estimates enable our synthesis system to select design options which increase test concurrency, thereby decreasing test time. Experimental results show that designs generated by this approach are testable in a highly concurrent manner.
