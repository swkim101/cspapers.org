The dissemination model is becoming increasingly important in wide-area information system. In this model, the user subscribes to an information dissemination service by submitting profiles that describe his interests. He then passively receives new, filtered information. The Stanford Information Filtering Tool (SIFT) is a tool to help provide such service. It supports full-text filtering using well-known information retrieval models. The SIFT filtering engine implements novel indexing techniques, capable of processing large volumes of information against a large number of profiles. It runs on several major Unix platforms and is freely available to the public. In this paper we present SIFT's approach to user interest modeling and user-server communication. We demonstrate the processing capability of SIFT by describing a running server that disseminates USENET News. We present an empirical study of SIFT's performance, examining its main memory requirement and ability to scale with information volume and user population.
