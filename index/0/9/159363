The freedom to combine information stored in a database using the opera tors provided by its datamodel introduces many caveats, such as with view updates and integrity preservation, for the database designer. To alleviate these problems we define a formal model that explicates the database semantics through entity definitions and limits their use along well-defined paths. Our approach is based on six design axioms and concepts borrowed topology. This way we achieve an unified description of both the database intension and its extension. In particular, we show that generalisation I specialisation hierarchies are naturally cast into proper subset hierarchies in the entity type topology. Moreover, the limitations posed on the construction of entity types preserve the Armstrong axioms for functional dependencies. This way our model captures much of the real-world semantic constraints and remains sound and complete.
