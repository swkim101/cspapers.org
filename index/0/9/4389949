In this paper, we describe transaction management in ORION, an object-oriented database system. The application environments for which ORION is intended led us to implement the notions of sessions of transactions, and hypothetical transactions (transactions which always abort). The object-oriented data model which ORION implements complicates locking requirements. ORION supports a concurrency control mechanism based on extensions to the current theory of locking, and a transaction recovery mechanism based on conventional logging.
