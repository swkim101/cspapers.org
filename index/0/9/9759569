This paper proposes a novel two-stage method for opinion words and opinion targets co-extraction. In the first stage, a Sentiment Graph Walking algorithm is proposed, which naturally incorporates syntactic patterns in a graph to extract opinion word/target candidates. In the second stage, we adopt a self-Learning strategy to refine the results from the first stage, especially for filtering out noises with high frequency and capturing long-tail terms. Preliminary experimental evaluation shows that considering pattern confidence in the graph is beneficial and our approach achieves promising improvement over three competitive baselines.
