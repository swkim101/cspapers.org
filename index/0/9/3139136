Web-CAT is the most widely used open-source automated grading system, with about 10,000 users at over 65 institutions worldwide. Its plug-in architecture supports extensibility, with plug-ins for Java (including Objectdraw, JTF, Swing, and Android), C++, Python, Haskell, and more. It is also a powerful tool for educational research data collection. It supports a wide variety of assessment strategies, but is famous for "grading students on how well they test their own code". Web-CAT won the 2006 Premier Award, recognizing high-quality, non-commercial courseware for engineering education. This BOF will allow existing users and new adopters to meet, share experiences, and talk about what works and what doesn't. Information on getting started quickly with Web-CAT will also be provided.
