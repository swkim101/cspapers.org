The social world that most of us navigate effortlessly can prove to be a perplexing and disconcerting place for individuals with autism. Interactive tools to teach social skills that are personalized to the individual's needs show promise, but it is challenging to author them. We describe the design, development, and preliminary evaluation of an approach to using human computation that enables the creation of models of complex and interesting social scenarios, possible obstacles that may arise in those scenarios, and potential solutions to those obstacles. Our preliminary evaluation of the models confirms that these models have the potential to help an author create a social skills instructional module.
