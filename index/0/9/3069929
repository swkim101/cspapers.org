Modern brain sensing technologies provide a variety of methods for detecting specific forms of brain activity. In this paper, we present an initial step in exploring how these technologies may be used to perform task classification and applied in a relevant manner to HCI research. We describe two experiments showing successful classification between tasks using a low-cost off-the-shelf electroencephalograph (EEG) system. In the first study, we achieved a mean classification accuracy of 84.0% in subjects performing one of three cognitive tasks - rest, mental arithmetic, and mental rotation - while sitting in a controlled posture. In the second study, conducted in more ecologically valid setting for HCI research, we attained a mean classification accuracy of 92.4% using three tasks that included non-cognitive features: a relaxation task, playing a PC based game without opponents, and engaging opponents within the game. Throughout the paper, we provide lessons learned and discuss how HCI researchers may utilize these technologies in their work.
