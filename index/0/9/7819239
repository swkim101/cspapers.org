A new model for broadcast in wormhole-routed networks is proposed. The model uses and extends the concept of dominating sets in order to systematically develop efficient broadcast algorithms for <italic>all-port</italic> wormhole-routed systems, in which each node can simultaneously transmit messages on different outgoing channels. In this paper, two broadcast algorithms for two-dimensional (2D) mesh networks are presented. In the first approach, the source node uses a multicast algorithm to deliver the message to a set of <italic>dominating nodes</italic>, which can subsequently deliver the message to all other nodes in the network in a single message-passing step. This algorithm requires at most [log<subscrpt>2</subscrpt><italic>N</italic>] steps, where <italic>N</italic> is the total number of nodes in the network, although in many cases only [log<subscrpt>2</subscrpt><italic>N</italic>]−1 steps are needed. The second algorithm, called the <italic>D-node</italic> algorithm, reduces the number of steps by using multiple levels of dominating nodes in a recursive manner. For square meshes containing <italic>N</italic>=2<supscrpt>2(<italic>k</italic>+2)</supscrpt> nodes, <italic>k</italic>≥0, the D-node algorithm requires at most <italic>k</italic>+4 steps. Similar upper bounds are shown to hold for meshes of other sizes and shapes. For specific source nodes and mesh shapes, the number of steps is shown to equal the theoretical lower bound of [log<subscrpt>5</subscrpt><italic>N</italic>]. A simulation study confirms the advantage of the D-node algorithm, under various system parameters and conditions, over other broadcast algorithms.
