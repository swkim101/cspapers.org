Our research involves the creation of a plug and play environment where different devices and services can be made to function together effortlessly. Currently the connection of any entity to another entity, through a network, needs prior setup and configuration. We aim to design an architecture, which requires minimal setup processes or none, for easy access to remote services using the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and Jini.
