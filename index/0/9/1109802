Some wags, in moments of profound realism, declare that the words “information technology” should never be uttered by man. Instead, they should be replaced by a tetgramation such as the Hebrew: YHVH—the sacred word for the Ineffable Name of God. The implication being, that the phrase “information technology” connotes such as expanse of knowledge and is so totally incomprehensible that it is nearly a description of the Almighty Himself. Much merit may be seen in this allusion if one considers the actual expanse of the subject in comparison to the provincial concepts of some of its most ardent practitioners.
