In this paper, the authors study the problem of efficient path query processing in the context of automobile navigation systems. To guarantee efficient response for path queries, a path view materialization strategy is used for pre-computing the best paths. A hierarchical encoded path view (HEPV) approach, which addresses issues of capacity, efficiency, and cost, is proposed. Experimental results reveal that HEPV is more efficient than previously known path-finding approaches.
