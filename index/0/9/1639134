With the growth of interest on the web services, people pay increasinglyattention to the choreography, that is, to describe collaborations ofparticipants in accomplishing a common business goal from a globalviewpoint. In this paper, based on a simple choreography language and arole-oriented process language, we study some fundamental issues relatedto choreography, especially those related to implementation, includingsemantics, projection and natural projection, dominant role in choices anditerations, etc. We propose the concept of dominant role and somenovel languages structures related to it. The study reveals some cluesabout the language, the semantics, the specification and theimplementation of choreography.
