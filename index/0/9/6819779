WEIRD is an automatic document retrieval system designed and implemented at Syracuse University, which attempts to advance the art of computerized retrieval from word-matching to judging conceptual similarity. WEIRD uses a vector space model to represent the relations among terms and documents. Items in the space are located according to their -&-ldquo;meaning-&-rdquo;, which is their proximity to all other items in the data base as measured by co-occurrence frequencies. This is done without manipulating large matrices. The dimensions of the space are not used to define relations; items are defined solely by their position relative to the other items. Retrieval is determined by Euclidean distance from the plotted query. In the first section of the paper the basic characteristics of WEIRD are described. Second, the results of a preliminary evaluation are reported. Alternatives for further development of WEIRD are then considered.
