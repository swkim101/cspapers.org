This seminar/workshop on ethics and the social impact in computer science, supported by studies of the applicability of alternative teaching and learning strategies, is targeted towards doctoral candidates in computer science whose life-goal is to teach in a university or college setting. Based on the concept of “ethics across the curriculum” the seminar/workshop will prepare future faculty to incorporate ethical and social impact concerns in their technical courses. At the same time they will be exposed to modern teaching and learning techniques that will assist them in making a good start in their teaching careers.
