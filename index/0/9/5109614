of Results. We establish that several problems are highly parallelizable. For each of these problems, we design an optimal 0 (loglogn ) time parallel algorithm on the Common CRCW PRAM model which is the weakest among the CRCW PRAM models. These problems include: 0 all nearest smaller values, l preprocessing for answering range maxima queries, l several problems in Computational Geometry, l string matching. Until recently, such algorithms were known only for finding the maximum and merging.
