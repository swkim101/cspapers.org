The precise analysis of a patient's or an elderly person's walking pattern is very important for an effective intelligent active mobility assistance robot. This walking pattern can be described by a cyclic motion, which can be modeled using the consecutive gait phases. In this paper, we present a completely non-invasive framework for analyzing and recognizing a pathological human walking gait pattern. Our framework utilizes a laser range finder sensor to detect and track the human legs, and an appropriately synthesized Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for state estimation, and recognition of the gait patterns. We demonstrate the applicability of this setup using real data, collected from an ensemble of different elderly persons with a number of pathologies. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed human data analysis scheme has the potential to provide the necessary methodological (modeling, inference, and learning) framework for a cognitive behavior-based robot control system. More specifically, the proposed framework has the potential to be used for the classification of specific walking pathologies, which is needed for the development of a context-aware robot mobility assistant.
