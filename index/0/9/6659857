Relational database management systems are an essential component of many data intensive applications. At USC, a course entitled "File and Database Management" introduces students to fundamental concepts in relational databases. Students are introduced to conceptual, logical and physical organization of data, use of both formal and commercial query languages, e.g., SQL, indexing techniques for efficient retrieval of data, the concept of a transaction, concurrency control and crash recovery techniques. This paper summarizes our experiences with this course and the challenges of educating students on use of object-oriented concepts and their mapping to tables.
