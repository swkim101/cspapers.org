This paper presents a universal morphological feature schema that represents the finest distinctions in meaning that are expressed by overt, affixal inflectional morphology across languages. This schema is used to universalize data extracted from Wiktionary via a robust multidimensional table parsing algorithm and feature mapping algorithms, yielding 883,965 instantiated paradigms in 352 languages. These data are shown to be effective for training morphological analyzers, yielding significant accuracy gains when applied to Durrett and DeNeroâ€™s (2013) paradigm learning framework.
