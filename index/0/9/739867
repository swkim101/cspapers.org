This paper examines how a new class of nonparametric Bayesian models can be effectively applied to an open-domain event coreference task. Designed with the purpose of clustering complex linguistic objects, these models consider a potentially infinite number of features and categorical outcomes. The evaluation performed for solving both within- and cross-document event coreference shows significant improvements of the models when compared against two baselines for this task.
