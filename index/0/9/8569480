Transactional memory is a promising mechanism for synchronizing concurrent programs that eliminates locks at the expense of hardware complexity. Transactional memory is a hard feature to verify. First, transactions comprise several instructions that must be observed as a single global atomic operation. In addition, there are many reasons a transaction can fail. This results in a high level of non-determinism which must be tamed by the verification methodology. This paper describes the innovation that was applied to tools and methodology in pre-silicon simulation, acceleration and post-silicon in order to verify transactional memory in the IBM POWER8 processor core.
