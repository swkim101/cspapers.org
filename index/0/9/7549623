After joint discussions between the House and the Senate, a bill authorizing the creation of Federal City College (and the Washington Technical Institute) was signed into law in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson as Public Law 89-791.
 The Federal City College Computer Center is organized as a consolidated center designed to support both academic and administrative data processing requirements of the College. The Center has chosen this organizational structure because it provides the College with the best cost effective means of providing a wide range of data processing services to all areas of the College. The management of one centralized Computer Center and its supporting staff obviates the necessity for the College to staff and support an array of decentralized computing staffs and facilities in each school.
