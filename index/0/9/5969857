This paper proposes a data mining approach to modeling relationships among categories in image collection. In our approach, with image feature grouping, a visual dictionary is created for color, texture, and shape feature attributes respectively. Labeling each training image with the keywords in the visual dictionary, a classification tree is built. Based on the statistical properties of the feature space we define a structure, called α-Semantics Graph, to discover the hidden semantic relationships among the semantic categories embodied in the image collection. With the α-Semantics Graph, each semantic category is modeled as a unique fuzzy set to explicitly address the semantic uncertainty and semantic overlap among the categories in the feature space. The model is utilized in the semantics-intensive image retrieval application. An algorithm using the classification accuracy measures is developed to combine the built classification tree with the fuzzy set modeling method to deliver semantically relevant image retrieval for a given query image. The experimental evaluations have demonstrated that the proposed approach models the semantic relationships effectively and the image retrieval prototype system utilizing the derived model is promising both in effectiveness and efficiency.
