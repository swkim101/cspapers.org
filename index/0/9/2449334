When logic programming is used for database access, there is a need to improve the backtracking behaviour of the interpreter. Rather than putting on the programmer the onus of using extra-logical operators such as cut to improve performance, we show that some uses of the cut can be automated by inferring them from functional dependencies. This requires some knowledge of which variables are guaranteed to be bound at query execution time; we give a method for deriving such information using data flow analysis.
