We consider loopy belief propagation for approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models. A limitation of the standard algorithm is that clique marginals are computed as if there were no loops in the graph. To overcome this limitation, we introduce fractional belief propagation. Fractional belief propagation is formulated in terms of a family of approximate free energies, which includes the Bethe free energy and the naive mean-field free as special cases. Using the linear response correction of the clique marginals, the scale parameters can be tuned. Simulation results illustrate the potential merits of the approach.
