Ab,stract-We present a new class of asymptotically good, linear error-correcting codes. These codes can be both encoded and decoded in linear time. They can also be encoded by logarithmicdepth circuits of linear size and decoded by logarithmic depth circuits of size 0 (n log n) . We present both randomized and explicit constructions of these codes. Zndex Terms- Asymptotically good error-correcting code, linear-time, expander graph, superconcentrators.
