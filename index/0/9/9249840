Tims has been studied by logicians for a long time and recently it has been modelled in more and more researches in AI. There exists a gap between the logics built by temporal logicians and those used in AI. This paper aims at filing this gap and providing a formal study on temporal logics for AI. In this paper, we present a new axiomatization of Allen & Hayes' temporal logic and locate their logic in the spectrum of logics built by temporal logicians. We also relate point-, event- and interval-based time structures to one another.
