In one of the largest multidisciplinary projects in basic HCI research to date, multiple analytic HCI techniques were combined and applied witiiin an innovative d e s i ^ context to problems identif ied by designers of an AV communication system, or media space. The problems were presented to user-, systemand design-analysts distributed across Europe. The results of analyses were integrated and passed back to the designers, and to other domain experts, for assessment. The aim of this paper is to illustrate some theory-based insights gained into key problems in media space design and to convey lessons learned about the process of contributing to design using multiple theoretical perspectives. We also describe some obstacles which must be overcome if such techniques are to be transferred successfully to practice.
