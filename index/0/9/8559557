A flexure-based parallel manipulator (FPM) is a closed-loop compliant mechanism in which the moving platform is connected to the base through a number of flexural legs. Utilizing parallel-kinematics configurations and flexure joints, the FPMs can achieve extremely high motion resolution and accuracy. In this work, we focus on the analysis and design of a 3-DOF (θx -θy -Z) zero-torsion FPM for nano-alignment applications. Among various possible zero-torsion parallel-kinematics configurations, it is identified that the 3-legged Prismatic-Prismatic-Spherical (3PPS) is a suitable candidate. Based on the concept of instantaneous rotation, the critical kinematic design issues, such as displacement and workspace analyses, are addressed. With these analysis algorithms, the major kinematic parameters are readily determined to meet the task requirements. To achieve a large workspace, beam-based flexure joints are employed in the FPM design. As the beam-based Universal (U) flexure joints are able to accommodate the required passive prismatic and spherical motions, each flexure PPS leg can be replaced by a simple flexure PU leg. A research prototype of the 3-DOF 3PU FPM has been developed, which achieves position and orientation resolutions of 20 nm and 0.05 arcsecond throughout a workspace of 5° × 5° × 5 mm, respectively.
