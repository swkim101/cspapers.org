We address the challenging large-scale content-based face image retrieval problem, intended as searching images based on the presence of specific subject, given one face image of him/her. To this end, one natural demand is a supervised binary code learning method. While the learned codes might be discriminating, people often have a further expectation that whether some semantic message (e.g., visual attributes) can be read from the human-incomprehensible codes. For this purpose, we propose a novel binary code learning framework by jointly encoding identity discriminability and a number of facial attributes into unified binary code. In this way, the learned binary codes can be applied to not only fine-grained face image retrieval, but also facial attributes prediction, which is the very innovation of this work, just like killing two birds with one stone. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on a new purified large-scale web celebrity database, named CFW 60K, with abundant manual identity and attributes annotation, and experimental results exhibit the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art.
