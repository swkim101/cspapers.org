The power consumption of modern high-performance processors is becoming a major concern because it leads to increased heat dissipation and decreased reliability. While many techniques have been proposed to reduce power consumption for uni-processors, there has been considerably less work on multi-processor systems. In this paper we focus on power-aware scheduling for multi-processor real-time systems. Based on the idea of slack sharing among processors, we propose two novel scheduling algorithms for task sets with and without precedence constraints. These scheduling techniques reclaim the time unused by a task to reduce the execution speed of future tasks, and thus reduce the total energy consumption of the system. Simulation results indicate that our algorithms achieve up to 60% energy savings on multi-processor systems with variable voltage processors.
