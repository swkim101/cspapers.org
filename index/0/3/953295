This study demonstrates soft, epidermal resistive strain gauges capable of tracking finger joint angle during dexterous manipulation tasks. Intrinsically stretchable, biphasic, gallium-based metal films embedded in an elastomeric substrate allow for extremely thin (<;50 μm) and skin-conforming wearable sensors with outstanding robustness. The sensors sustain repeated cycling to 50% strain and are insensitive to normal pressure up to 100 kPa. Following a calibration phase, we recorded flexions of a human finger using the soft sensors and compared their joint angle estimation to that of a commercial marker-based visual motion tracking system. The accuracy of our system (defined as the mean angular deviation between our sensors' output and the reference system) was below 9° over a set of 11 different grasping and motion tasks. We demonstrate the scalability and wearability of our technology with a three-finger sensing system used to track the fine movements of a pianist hand. Our soft technology is a promising candidate for implementation of truly wearable proprioceptive sensing systems.
