Users routinely access cloud services through third-party apps on smartphones by giving apps login credentials (i.e., a username and password). Unfortunately, users have no assurance that their apps will properly handle this sensitive information. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of ScreenPass, which significantly improves the security of passwords on touchscreen devices. ScreenPass secures passwords by ensuring that they are entered securely, and uses taint-tracking to monitor where apps send password data. The primary technical challenge addressed by ScreenPass is guaranteeing that trusted code is always aware of when a user is entering a password. ScreenPass provides this guarantee through two techniques. First, ScreenPass includes a trusted software keyboard that encourages users to specify their passwords' domains as they are entered (i.e., to tag their passwords). Second, ScreenPass performs optical character recognition (OCR) on a device's screenbuffer to ensure that passwords are entered only through the trusted software keyboard. We have evaluated ScreenPass through experiments with a prototype implementation, two in-situ user studies, and a small app study. Our prototype detected a wide range of dynamic and static keyboard-spoofing attacks and generated zero false positives. As long as a screen is off, not updated, or not tapped, our prototype consumes zero additional energy; in the worst case, when a highly interactive app rapidly updates the screen, our prototype under a typical configuration introduces only 12% energy overhead. Participants in our user studies tagged their passwords at a high rate and reported that tagging imposed no additional burden. Finally, a study of malicious and non-malicious apps running under ScreenPass revealed several cases of password mishandling.
