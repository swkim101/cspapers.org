In the process of a cooperative search in a distributed robotic system, the local information and local knowledge, as well as the limitation of sensing range and communication range must be considered. The authors present a distributed genetic algorithm with a supplement operation as a method for cooperative searching. The distributed genetic algorithm is a search algorithm modified for a distributed robotic system. As an example of a cooperative search, path planning for configuring the structure of a cellular robot is considered. The cellular robot or cellular robotic system (CEBOT) is a distributed robotic system which consists of a large number of autonomous robotic units called cells. The process of cooperative path planning using the proposed genetic algorithm with communication between the cells is presented. The influence of the local sensing and local communication is considered.
