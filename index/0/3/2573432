This paper describes some of the work we have done to evaluate and compare the use of three IR systems (Verity, LSI, and SMART) as black boxes within an automated classification environment. We use automated classification to make a quantitative comparison of the effectiveness of the systems within this context. In so doing, we also develop criteria for the construction of a useful training set. These results lead to metrics useful in the integration of IR systems into larger applications. We conclude with an initial API for an IR component within an automated classification architecture.
