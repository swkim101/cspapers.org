coordi- nates, then there exists a unique integer whose corresponding codesword differs from the corrupted word in at most places. Furthermore, Mandelbaum (25), (26) shows how can be recovered efficiently given the corrupted word provided that the 's are very close to one another. To deal with arbitrary 's, we present a variant of his algorithm that runs in almost linear time and recovers from errors. Our main contribution is an efficient decoding algorithm for the case in which the error may be larger than . Specif- ically, given residues and an agreement parameter , we find a list of all integers such that for at least values of , provided
