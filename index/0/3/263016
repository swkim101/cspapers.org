Power-aware computing has become popular recently and many techniques have been proposed to manage processor energy consumption for traditional real-time applications. To reduce the power consumption, the power management should consider the effect of checking pending periodic tasks. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper proposes an efficient scheduling method to manage the periodic tasks. Then, this management has been implemented and validated in a real-time operating system (RTOS). The experimental results show that an optimistic result can be achieved with this method.
