As part of our work on Cooperative Bug Isolation (CBI) we have undertaken to instrument and distribute binaries for a number of large open source projects. This public deployment is an important step toward a large experiment involving (we hope) hundreds or thousands of users that will measure the effectiveness of CBI. This paper describes several of the significant engineering issues that arise in instrumenting the source code of realistic applications.
