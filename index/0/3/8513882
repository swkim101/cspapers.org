Cross-lingual adaptation aims to learn a prediction model in a label-scarce target language by exploiting labeled data from a labelrich source language. An effective crosslingual adaptation system can substantially reduce the manual annotation effort required in many natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose a new cross-lingual adaptation approach for document classification based on learning cross-lingual discriminative distributed representations of words. Specifically, we propose to maximize the loglikelihood of the documents from both language domains under a cross-lingual logbilinear document model, while minimizing the prediction log-losses of labeled documents. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks of Amazon product reviews. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed cross-lingual adaptation approach.
