Internet search is one of the most important applications of the Web. A search engine takes the user's keywords to retrieve and to rank those pages that contain the keywords. One shortcoming of existing search techniques is that they do not give due consideration to the micro-structures of a Web page. A Web page is often populated with a number of small information units, which we call micro information units (MIU). Each unit focuses on a specific topic and occupies a specific area of the page. During the search, if all the keywords in the user query occur in a single MIU of a page, the top ranking results returned by a search engine are generally relevant and useful. However, if the query words scatter at different MIUs in a page, the pages returned can be quite irrelevant (which causes low precision). The reason for this is that although a page has information on individual MIUs, it may not have information on their intersections. In this paper, we propose a technique to solve this problem. At the off-line pre-processing stage, we segment each page to identify the MIUs in the page, and index the keywords of the page according to the MIUs in which they occur. In searching, our retrieval and ranking algorithm utilizes this additional information to return those most relevant pages. Experimental results show that this method is able to significantly improve the search precision.
