The organization of the data structure has traditionally been a key element in the design of successful interactive systems, either aiming at specific technical applications as the ones related to computer aided design procedures or at more general information systems within a project or a production process. Data are created and retrieved in a dynamic unpredicted occurrence; some data share common properties which, if taken into account, could reduce the amount of stored data; efficiency in response time to user's action is a requirement which is often satisfied through pointers and other programming techniques which result in heavy system dependency and difficulty in a precise system documentation. These deficiencies lead to inability for the casual user to understand and use the system without extensive training when non-standard applications are needed and to inadequacy for the procedure devised to cope with an overall system optimization, where a system means not only a single design process but its influence on the design of other related processes, its consequences on the production scheduling and more generally its effects on the company management.
 With these problems in mind, this paper investigates the concept of organizing the data as sets. Thus it is possible to formalize the operations upon data as set operations, borrowing and extending from set theory. Common fields in different sets could be either replicated or not, depending upon the user's decision concerning the most efficient way of organizing the data.
