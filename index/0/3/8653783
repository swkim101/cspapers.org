In this video we present a teleoperation system which is capable of solving complex tasks in human-sized wide area environments. The system consists of two mobile teleoperators controlled by two operators, and offers haptic, visual, and auditory feedback. The task examined here, consists of repairing a robot by removing a computer and replacing a defective hard-drive. To cope with the complexity of such a task, we go beyond classical teleoperation by integrating several advanced software algorithms into the system.
