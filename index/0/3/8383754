Two experiments examined the utility of a menu-based question-construction help system as part of basic instruction for UNIX. The first experiment indicated that novice or naive users have great difficulty formulating their own questions; a menu-based interface that helps structure questions increased question asking and improved performance during training. A second experiment demonstrated that initial learning benefits more from “procedural” than from “causal” questions. A retention test showed that “correct response” feedback, when coupled with an appropriate problem-solving learning environment, can produce performance comparable to that in the question asking conditions; such feedback, however, did not provide equivalent understanding of the system. These results are discussed in the context of user models of the system and the potential role of constraint in designing question-asking systems.
