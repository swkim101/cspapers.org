CSAB states in its guidelines that one of its six undergraduate core curriculum subject areas is computer theory. It appears that the ACM Core Curriculum Committee will also suggest a core course in this area. However, courses in computer theory, under the titles “Formal Languages” or “Theory of Computation”, have traditionally been taught on the senior or graduate level. There has been little discussion concerning the development of a computer theory course for use at the sophomore or junior level. Also, computer theory is also becoming a larger part of other computer science courses such as discrete structures and compiler design theory. A clearer understanding is needed of how different aspects of computer theory should be developed throughout the undergraduate computer science curriculum.
