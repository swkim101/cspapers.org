In this paper, we will present an efficient method to compute the co-occurrence counts of any pair of substring in a parallel corpus, and an algorithm that make use of these counts to create sub-sentential alignments on such a corpus. This algorithm has the advantage of being as general as possible regarding the segmentation of text.
