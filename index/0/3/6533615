In this paper, we present a novel stereo algorithm that combines the strengths of region-based stereo and dynamic programming on a tree approaches. Instead of formulating an image as individual scan-lines or as a pixel tree, a new region tree structure, which is built as a minimum spanning tree on the adjacency-graph of an over-segmented image, is used for the global dynamic programming optimization. The resulting disparity maps do not contain any streaking problem as is common in scanline-based algorithms because of the tree structure. The performance evaluation using the Middlebury benchmark datasets shows that the performance of our algorithm is comparable in accuracy and efficiency with top ranking algorithms.
