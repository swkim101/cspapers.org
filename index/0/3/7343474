Relation extraction is the task of finding semantic relations between two entities from text. In this paper, we propose a novel feature-based Chinese relation extraction approach that explicitly defines and explores nine positional structures between two entities. We also suggest some correction and inference mechanisms based on relation hierarchy and co-reference information etc. The approach is effective when evaluated on the ACE 2005 Chinese data set.
