Sybase is a leading RDBMS vendor that started by providing OLTP systems for the client-server environment and is currently maturing into an enterprise-wide data management solution provider. As a critical part of this enterprise-wide data management strategy, Sybase Replication Server supports data replication in a distributed environment. In such an enviromnent, the same data may be replicated at multiple sites for quick data access and for high data availability. Replicated data can be maintained using strong consistency or weak consistence algorithms. Algorithms for maintaining strong consistency, such as primary copy and quorum consensus, severely limit data availability during network partition.
