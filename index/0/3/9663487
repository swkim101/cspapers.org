Direct Memory Access Translation (DMTRANS) is a theory of translation developed at CMT of CMU in which translation is viewd as an integrated part of cognitive processing. In this paradigm, understanding in source language is a recognition of input in terms of existing knowledge in memory and integration of the input into the memory. Context of sentences are established as what is left in memory after understanding previous sentences (or a preceding part of a sentence). Decisions made during translation are influenced by what is dynamically modified in memory through preceding recognitions. Since knowledge in memory is directly shared with the rest of cognition, during translation other cognitive processes such as inference can dynamically participate in the translation process.
