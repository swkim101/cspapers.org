We present a vision cognition framework for tomato harvesting humanoid robot based on geometrical and physical reasoning. Inspired from the natural human harvesting behaviour, our goal is to build a humanoid robot to pick tomatoes autonomously or with minimal human efforts. The proposed vision approach uses fusion of calibrated observation data from two RGB-D sensors installed on the head and the hand of the humanoid. We observe the natural human harvesting behaviour and equip our robot with similar grippers to follow the same picking processes for a specific fruit. In the vision approach, we mainly focus on modelling fruits in one branch and then estimating the pedicel direction of each fruit in a branch. Through pointcloud model segmentation, the primitive shape model of each fruit can be obtained and we consider a simple fact that crops in one branch should remain stable with respect to gravity and interaction forces from neighbouring crops in the branch. According to this assumption, a probabilistic model is created and the picking order in the branch is assigned under the evaluated geometrical structure. In the experiments, we tested harvesting of real tomatoes on actual branches and evaluated the successful harvesting rate.
