Caching data by maintaining materialized views typically requires updating the cache appropriately to reflect dynamic source updates. Extensive research has addressed the problem of incremental view maintenance for relational data but only few works have addressed it for semi-structured data. In this paper we address the problem of incremental maintenance of views defined over XML documents using path-expressions. The approach described in this paper has the following main features that distinguish it from the previous works: (1) The view specification language is powerful and standardized enough to be used in realistic applications. (2) The size of the auxiliary data maintained with the views depends on the expression size and the answer size regardless of the source data size.(3) No source schema is assumed to exist; the source data can be any general well-formed XML document. Experimental evaluation is conducted to assess the performance benefits of the proposed approach.
