Content-based publish/subscrbe systems provide an useful alternative to traditional address-based communication due to their ability to decouple communication between participants. It has remained a challenge to design a scalable overlay supporting the complexity of content-based networks, while satisfying the desirable properties large distributed systems should have. This paper presents a new peer-to-peer overlay called HOMED for distributed publish/subscribe systems. It can construct a flexible and efficient event dissemination tree by organizing participants based on their interest. The delivery depth of an event as well as subscribing/unsubscribing overhead scales logarithmically with the number of participating nodes.
