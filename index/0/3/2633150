This paper presents a new perspective of the probability ranking principle (PRP) by defining retrieval effectiveness in terms of our novel expected rank measure of a set of documents for a particular query. This perspective is based on preserving decision preferences, and it imposes weaker conditions on PRP than the utility-theoretic perspective of PRP.
