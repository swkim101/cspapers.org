We present the results of an evaluation where we studied the effectiveness of automatic test generation for graphical user interface (GUI) testing of smartphone applications. To describe the context of our evaluation, the tools and the test model library we have developed for the evaluation are also presented. The library contains test models for basic S60 applications, such as camera, contacts, etc. The tools include an on-line test generator that produces sequences of so called keywords to be executed on the test targets. In our evaluation, we managed to find over 20 defects from applications that had been on the market for several months. We also describe the problems we faced during the evaluation.
