Focused retrieval (a.k.a., passage retrieval) is important at its own right and as an intermediate step in question answering systems. We present a new Web-based collection for focused retrieval. The document corpus is the Category A of the ClueWeb12 collection. Forty-nine queries from the educational domain were created. The $100$ documents most highly ranked for each query by a highly effective learning-to-rank method were judged for relevance using crowdsourcing. All sentences in the relevant documents were judged for relevance.
