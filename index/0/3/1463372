We study the problem of scheduling in OFDMA-based relay networks with emphasis on IEEE 802.16j based WiMAX relay networks. In such networks, in addition to a base station, multiple relay stations are used for enhancing the throughput, and/or improving the range of the base station. We solve the problem of MAC scheduling in such networks so as to serve the mobiles in a fair manner while exploiting the multiuser diversity, as well as the frequency selectivity of the wireless channel. The scheduling resources consist of tiles in a two-dimensional scheduling frame with time slots along one axis, and frequency bands or sub-channels along the other axis. The resource allocation problem has to be solved once every scheduling frame which is about 5 - 10 ms long. While the original scheduling problem is computationally complex, we provide an easy-to-compute upper bound on the optimum. We also propose three fast heuristic algorithms that perform close to the optimum (within 99.5%), and outperform other algorithms such as OFDM2A proposed in the past. Through extensive simulation results, we demonstrate the benefits of relaying in throughput enhancement (an improvement in the median throughput of about 25%), and feasibility of range extension (for e.g., 7 relays can be used to extend the cell-radius by 60% but mean throughput reduces by 36%). Our algorithms are easy to implement, and have an average running time of less than 0.05 ms making them appropriate for WiMAX relay networks.
