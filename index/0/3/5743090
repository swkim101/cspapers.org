This paper describes a new discourse module within our multilingual NLP system. Because of its unique data-driven architecture, the discourse module is language-independent. Moreover, the use of hierarchically organized multiple knowledge sources makes the module robust and trainable using discourse-tagged corpora. Separating discourse phenomena from knowledge sources makes the discourse module easily extensible to additional phenomena.
