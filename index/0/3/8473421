The Scalable Vector Graphics format SVG is already substantially improving graphics delivery on the web, but some important issues still remain to be addressed. In particular, SVG does not support client-side adaption of documents to different viewing conditions, such as varying screen sizes, style preferences or different device capabilities. Based on our earlier work we show how SVG can be extended with constraint-based specification of document layout to augment it with adaptive capabilities. The core of our proposal is to include one-way constraints into SVG, which offer more expressiveness than the previously suggested class of linear constraints and at the same time require substantially less computational effort.
