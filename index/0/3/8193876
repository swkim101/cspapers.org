We study how the SVM-based binary classifiers can be effectively combined to tackle the multi-class image classification problem. We study several ensemble schemes, including OPC (one per class), PWC (pairwise coupling), and ECOC (error-correction output coding), that aim to achieve good error correction capability through redundancy. To enhance these ensemble schemes' accuracy, we propose methods that on the one hand boost the margins (i.e., confidence) of the SVM-based binary classifiers, and, on the other hand, remove the noise of irrelevant classifiers from class prediction. From empirical study we show that our margin boosting and noise reduction methods lead to higher classification accuracy than ensemble schemes that are solely designed for maximum error correction capability.
