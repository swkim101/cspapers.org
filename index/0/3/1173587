This paper presents the LIG-CRIStAL submission to the shared Automatic Post- Editing task of WMT 2017. We propose two neural post-editing models: a monosource model with a task-specific attention mechanism, which performs particularly well in a low-resource scenario; and a chained architecture which makes use of the source sentence to provide extra context. This latter architecture manages to slightly improve our results when more training data is available. We present and discuss our results on two datasets (en-de and de-en) that are made available for the task.
