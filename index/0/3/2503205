1 Motivation operation. Parallel algorithms for the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) and closely related Coarse Gained Multicomputer (CGM) programming model assume that all data can be distributed over the main memories of the processors involved. In practice, this may not be the case. For large scale applications where parallel processing is helpful, the total amount of data often exceeds the total main memory available and parallel disk I/O becomes a necessity. A common scenario for distributed memory parallel machines assumes that each processor has multiple local hard disks available, where each disk is only accessible by the respective local processor. Parallel disk I/O has been identified as a critical component of a suitable high performance computer for a number of the Grand Challenge problems see for instance the Scalable I/O Initiative project [5] \ .
