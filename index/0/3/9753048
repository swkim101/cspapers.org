These days, smart watches have drawn more attention of users, and many smart watch products have been launched (Samsung Gear series, apple watch and etc.). Since a smart watch is put on the wrist, the device should be small and unobtrusive. Because of these features, display of the smart watch is small and there is a limitation to interaction. To overcome the limitation, many studies are conducted. In this paper, we propose a two-hand interaction technique that obtains posture information of a hand using electromyography (EMG) sensor attached to the arm and to make input interaction to a smart watch different depending on each posture. EMG sensors recognize information about a user's hand posture, and the non-dominant hand is used for smart watch inputs. In this way, different function is executed depending on postures. As a result, a smart watch that has limited input methods is given a variety of interaction functions with users.
