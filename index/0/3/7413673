There are a variety of potential uses for interactive spatial sound in human-computer interfaces, but hardware costs have made most of these applications impractical. Recently, however, single-chip digital signal processors have made real-time spatial audio an affordable possibility for many workstations. This paper describes an efficient spatialization technique and the associated computational requirements. Issues specific to the use of spatial audio in user interfaces are addressed. The paper also describes the design of a network server for spatial audio that can support a number of users at modest cost.
