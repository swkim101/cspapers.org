The overall goal is to reduce spacecraft weight, volume, and cost by online adaptive non-linear control of flexible structural components. The objective of this effort is to develop an adaptive Neural Network (NN) controller for the Ball C-Side 1m Ã— 3m antenna with embedded actuators and the RAMS sensor system. A traditional optimal controller for the major modes is provided perturbations by the NN to compensate for unknown residual modes. On-line training of recurrent and feed-forward NN architectures have achieved adaptive vibration control with unknown modal variations and noisy measurements. On-line training feedback to each actuator NN output is computed via Newton's method to reduce the difference between desired and achieved antenna positions.
