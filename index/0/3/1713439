The growing maturity of computer graphics technology now makes it possible to view the introductory graphics course in a general computer science curriculum in a new light. Instead of requiring highly specialized techniques and a great deal of mathematics before a student can produce significant work, the course can now be built around generally-accepted standard graphics standard APIs. This opens the door to making computer graphics available to a wider audience and moves the introductory computer graphics course in exciting new directions.
