Camera relocalization plays a vital role in many robotics and computer vision applications, such as self-driving cars and virtual reality. Recent random forests based methods exploit randomly sampled pixel comparison features to predict 3D world locations for 2D image locations to guide the camera pose optimization. However, these point features are only sampled randomly in images, without considering geometric information such as lines, leading to large errors with the existence of poorly textured areas or in motion blur. Line segments are more robust in these environments. In this work, we propose to jointly exploit points and lines within the framework of uncertainty driven regression forests. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated on three publicly available datasets against several strong state-of-the-art baselines in terms of several different error metrics. Experimental results prove the efficacy of our method, showing superior or on-par state-of-the-art performance.
