In this paper we report on query processing experiments that were performed in one distributed data base environment. In this environment we compared the strategy produced by a collection of algorithms on the basis of number of bytes moved. Among other conclusions we found that limited search algorithms do not perform very well compared to algorithms which exhaust all possible processing plans.
