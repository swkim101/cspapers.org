One of the more important problems of computer science is to establish precise bounds on computational complexity and, in particular, to understand the relationship between P. NP, the polynomial hierarchy, PSPACE, EXPTIME, etc. This paper approaches these questions from the viewpoint of mathematical logic, in the hope that eventually the techniques of mathematical logic can shed light on the nature of computation.
