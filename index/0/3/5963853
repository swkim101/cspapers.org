It is essential to control V<inf>DD</inf> and V<inf>TH</inf> for low-power, high-speed CMOS design. In this paper, it is shown that these two parameters can be controlled by designers as objectives of design optimization to find better trade-offs between power and speed. Quantitative analysis of trade-offs between power and speed is presented. Some of the popular circuit techniques and design examples to control V<inf>DD</inf> and V<inf>TH</inf> are introduced. A simple theory to compute optimum multiple V<inf>DD</inf>'s and V<inf>TH</inf>'s is described. Scaling scenarios of variable and/or multiple V<inf>DD</inf>'s and V<inf>TH</inf>'s is discussed to show future technology directions.
