This paper extends language understanding and plan inference to information graphics. We identify the kinds of communicative signals that appear in information graphics, describe how we utilize them in a Bayesian network that hypothesizes the graphic's intended message, and discuss the performance of our implemented system. This work is part of a larger project aimed at making information graphics accessible to individuals with sight impairments.
