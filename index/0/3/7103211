We show that for any ε >; 0, and positive integers k and q such that q ≥ 2<sup>k</sup> + 1, given a graph on N vertices that has a q-colorable induced subgraph of (1 - ε)N vertices, it is NP-hard to find an independent set of N/q<sup>k+1</sup> vertices. This substantially improves upon the work of Dinur et al. [1] who gave a corresponding bound of N/q<sup>2</sup>. Our result implies that for any positive integer k, given a graph that has an independent set of ≈ (2<sup>k</sup> + 1)<sup>-1</sup> fraction of vertices, it is NP-hard to find an independent set of (2<sup>k</sup> + 1)<sup>-(k+1)</sup> fraction of vertices. This improves on the previous work of Engebretsen and Holmerin [2] who proved a gap of ≈ 2<sup>-k</sup> vs 2<sup>-(k:2)</sup>, which is best possible using techniques (including those of [2]) based on the query efficient PCP of Samorodnitsky and Trevisan [3].
