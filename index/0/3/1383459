This paper describes a deductive approach to "region use" planning problems. The planning task is viewed as one of devising a complete set of policy rules by iteratively modifying the rules and making their deductive consequences readily available to the planner. The application of this approach to a National Park region zoning problem is also described. Central to the system are the representation of management policy as knowledge based rules and the detection of inconsistencies in the rules. The implementation of the system has three closely coupled components; a spatial database, an interactive graphics server and the deduction subsystem. The last of these is briefly described in the paper.
