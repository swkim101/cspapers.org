We introduce a fast parallel approximation algorithm for the positive linear programming optimization problem, i.e. the special case of the linear programming optimization problem where the input constraint matrix and constraint vector consist entirely of positive entries. The algorithm is elementary, and has a simple parallel implementation that runs in polylog time using a linear number of processors.
