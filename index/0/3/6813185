This paper describes the outline of a linguistic annotation framework under development by ISO TC37 SC WG1-1. This international standard provides an architecture for the creation, annotation, and manipulation of linguistic resources and processing software. The goal is to provide maximum flexibility for encoders and annotators, while at the same time enabling interchange and re-use of annotated linguistic resources. We describe here the outline of the standard for the purposes of enabling annotators to begin to explore how their schemes may map into the framework.
