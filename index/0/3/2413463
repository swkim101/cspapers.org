Users expect that systems react instantly. This is specifically the case for user-centric workflows in business process-driven environments. In today's enterprise systems most actions executed by a user have to be checked against the system's access control policy and require a call to the access control component. Hence, improving the performance of access control decisions will improve the overall performance experienced by the end user significantly. In this paper we propose a caching strategy which pre-computes caching entries by exploiting the fact that the executions of business processes are based on the execution of actions in a predefined order. We propose an accompanying architecture and present the results of our conducted benchmark.
