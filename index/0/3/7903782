The assembly language course at Georgia State University is taught using a PDP-11/40 Assembler and Simulator, written in Pascal, running on a Sperry UNIVAC mainframe. In the past two years most of the computer science program has been switched to IBM PC compatible microcomputers. This, coupled with the fact that the UNIVAC system is about to be retired, motivated us to translate the PDP-11/40 system to the microcomputers. The translation is from the mainframe Pascal version to Ada for the PC's. The use of the assembler and simulator, the rationale for the use of Ada, and the problems encountered in the translation are all discussed.
