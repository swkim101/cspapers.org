As mobile remote presence (MRP) systems become more pervasive in everyday environments such as office spaces, it is important for operators to navigate through remote locations without running into obstacles. Human-populated environments frequently change (e.g., doors open and close, furniture is moved around) and mobile remote presence systems must be able to adapt to such changes and to avoid running into obstacles. As such, we implemented an assisted teleoperation feature for a MRP system and evaluated its effectiveness with a controlled user study, focusing on both the system-oriented dimensions (e.g., autonomous assistance vs. no assistance) and human-oriented dimensions (e.g., gaming experience, locus of control, and spatial cognitive abilities) (N=24). In a systems-only analysis, we found that the assisted teleoperation helped people avoid obstacles. However, assisted teleoperation also increased time to complete an obstacle course. When human-oriented dimensions were evaluated, gaming experience and locus of control affected speed of completing the course. Implications for future research and design are discussed.
