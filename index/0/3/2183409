There has been extensive work on network architectures that support multi-path routing to improve performance in wireless mesh networks. However, previous work uses ad-hoc design principles that cannot guarantee any network-wide performance objectives such as conjointly maximizing resource utilization and improving fairness. In parallel, numerous theoretical results have addressed the issue of optimizing a combined metric of network utilization and fairness using techniques based on back-pressure scheduling, routing and flow control. However, the proposed theoretical algorithms are extremely difficult to implement in practice, especially in the presence of the 802.11 MAC and TCP. We propose Horizon, a novel system design for multi-path forwarding in wireless meshes, based on the theoretical results on back-pressure. Our design works with an unmodified TCP stack and on top of the existing 802.11 MAC. We modified the back-pressure approach to obtain a simple 802.11-compatible packet-forwarding heuristic and a novel, light-weight path estimator, while maintaining global optimality properties. We propose a delayed reordering algorithm that eliminates TCP timeouts while keeping TCP packet reordering to a minimum. We have evaluated our implementation on a 22-node testbed. We have shown that Horizon effectively utilizes available resources (disjoint paths). In contrast to previous work, our design not only avoids bottlenecks but also optimally load-balances traffic across them when needed, improving fairness among competing flows. To our knowledge, Horizon is the first practical wireless system based on back-pressure.
