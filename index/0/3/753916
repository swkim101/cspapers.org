We are witnessing an exciting revival of interest in recursive Datalog queries in a variety of emerging application domains such as data integration, information extraction, networking, program analysis, security, and cloud computing. This tutorial briefly reviews the Datalog language and recursive query processing and optimization techniques, then discusses applications of Datalog in three application domains: data integration, declarative networking, and program analysis. Throughout the tutorial, we use LogicBlox, a commercial Datalog engine for enterprise software systems, to allow the audience to walk through code examples presented in the tutorial.
