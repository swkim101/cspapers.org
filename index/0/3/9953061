Multicommodity facility location refers to the extension of facility location to allow for different clients having demand for different goods, from among a finite set of goods. This leads to several optimization problems, depending on the costs of opening facilities (now a function of the commodities it serves). In this paper, we introduce and study some variants of multicommodity facility location, and provide approximation algorithms and hardness results for them.
