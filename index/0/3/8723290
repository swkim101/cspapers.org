In this paper we discuss the use of cascaded finite state transducers for machine translation. A number of small, dedicated transducers is applied to convert sentence pairs from a bilingual corpus into generalized translation patterns. These patterns, together with the transducers are then used as a hierarchical translation memory for fully automatic translation. Results on the German--English VERBMOBIL corpus are given.
