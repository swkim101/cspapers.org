Computing systems that make security decisions often fail to take into account human expectations. This failure occurs because human expectations are typically drawn from in textual sources (e.g., mobile application description and requirements documents) and are hard to extract and codify. Recently, researchers in security and software engineering have begun using text analytics to create initial models of human expectation. In this tutorial, we will provide an introduction to popular techniques and tools of natural language processing (NLP) and text mining, and share our experiences in applying text analytics to security problems. We will also highlight the current challenges of applying these techniques and tools for addressing security problems. We conclude with discussion of future research directions.
