Matching the visual appearances of the target over consecutive image frames is the most critical issue in video-based object tracking. Choosing an appropriate distance metric for matching determines its accuracy and robustness, and significantly influences the tracking performance. This paper presents a new tracking approach that incorporates adaptive metric into differential tracking method. This new approach automatically learns an optimal distance metric for more accurate matching, and obtains a closed-form analytical solution to motion estimation and differential tracking. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of adaptive metric, and demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed new tracking method.
