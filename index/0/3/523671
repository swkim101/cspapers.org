Panning and zooming interfaces for exploring very large images containing billions of pixels (gigapixel images) have recently appeared on the internet. This paper addresses issues that arise when creating and rendering auditory and textual annotations for such images. In particular, we define a distance metric between each annotation and any view resulting from panning and zooming on the image. The distance then informs the rendering of audio annotations and text labels. We demonstrate the annotation system on a number of panoramic images.
