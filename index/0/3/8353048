We exploit the fact that the set of all polynomials Pε@@@@[x<subscrpt>1</subscrpt>,..,x<subscrpt>n</subscrpt>] of degree ≤d which can be evaluated with ≤v nonscalar steps can be embedded into a Zariski-closed affine set W(d,n,v),dim W(d,n,v)≤(v+1 +n)<supscrpt>2</supscrpt> and deg W(d,n,v)≤(2vd)<supscrpt>(v+1+n)</supscrpt><supscrpt>2</supscrpt>. As a consequence we prove that for u:&equil; 2v(d+1)<supscrpt>2</supscrpt> and s:&equil; 6(v+1+n)<supscrpt>2</supscrpt> there exist &abarbelow;<supscrpt>1</supscrpt>,..,&abarbelow;<supscrpt>s</supscrpt>ε [u]<supscrpt>n</supscrpt> &equil; {1,2,..,u}<supscrpt>n</supscrpt> such that for all polynomials PεW(d,n,v):P(&abarbelow;<supscrpt>1</supscrpt>) &equil; p(&abarbelow;<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>) &equil;...&equil; p(&abarbelow;<supscrpt>s</supscrpt>) &equil; O implies P&Xgr;O. This means that &abarbelow;<supscrpt>1</supscrpt>,...,&abarbelow;<supscrpt>s</supscrpt> is a <underline>correct test sequence</underline> for a zero test on all polynomials in W(d,n,v). Moreover, “almost every” sequence &abarbelow;<supscrpt>1</supscrpt>,..,&abarbelow;<supscrpt>s</supscrpt>ε[u]<supscrpt>n</supscrpt> is such a correct test sequence for W(d,n,v). The existence of correct test sequences &abarbelow;<supscrpt>1</supscrpt>,..,&abarbelow;<supscrpt>s</supscrpt>ε [u]<supscrpt>n</supscrpt> is established by a counting argument without constructing a correct test sequence. We even show that it is beyond the known methods to establish (i.e. to construct and to prove correctness) of such a short correct test sequence for W(d,n,v). We prove that given such a short, correct test sequence for W(d,n,v) we can efficiently construct a multivariate polynomial Pε@@@@[x<subscrpt>1</subscrpt>,..,x<subscrpt>n</subscrpt>] with deg(P) &equil; d and small integer coefficients such that P@@@@ W(d,n,v). For v>n log d lower bounds of this type are beyond our present methods in algebraic complexity theory.
