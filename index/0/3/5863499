In this paper, the problem of assigning N parallel tasks onto a hypercube with N processors is considered. Three heuristics are developed to map arbitrary process graphs, in a one-to-one fashion, onto a hypercube architecture, in order to minimize the communication cost between processors:<italic>bit-toggling</italic> (BT), <italic>bit-swapping</italic> (BS), and <italic>node-swapping</italic> (NS). The effectiveness of the methods is evaluated using a number of sample process graphs, and compared with the results obtained from <italic>simulated annealing</italic> (SA). With respect to solution quality, between the three approaches proposed, the <italic>node-swapping</italic> technique is superior.
