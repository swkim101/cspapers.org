Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) involving actuation are increasingly envisioned in a range of fields. For instance, there is considerable interest in leveraging off WSNs to improve safety in road tunnels [3]. Researchers are envisioning tunnels equipped with WSN nodes that gather physical readings (e.g., light), monitor the structural integrity of the tunnel, and sense the presence of vehicles to detect a possible traffic congestion. Based on sensed data, the system operates a variety of devices, such as ventilation fans inside the tunnel, and traffic lights at the entrances. For instance, when a sensor detects the presence of a fire in a sector, the fans in the same sector are activated, and the traffic lights are turned red to prevent further vehicles from entering the tunnel.
