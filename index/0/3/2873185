We propose a new method for integrity checking in deductive databases. The method augments a database with a set of transition and internal events rules,which explicitly define the insertions and deletions induced by a database update. Standard SLDNF resolution can then be used to check satisfaction of integrity constraints. The method has the full power of the methods developed so far, and its implementation in Prolog does not require any meta-interpreter. A second main advantage is that it deals with both static anddynamicintegrityconstraints,providing a simple and uniform approach in which both classes of integrity constraints can be defined and efficiently enforced.
