We exploit the recently proposed Concept Abduction inference service in Description Logics to solve Concept Covering problems. We propose a framework and polynomial greedy algorithm for semantic based automated Web service orchestration, fully compliant with Semantic Web technologies. We show the proposed approach is able to deal with not exact solutions, computing an approximate orchestration with respect to an agent request modeled a subset of OWL-DL.
