This paper reports a comparative experimental evaluation of proportional derivative and adaptive model-based control for underwater vehicles. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first such evaluation of model-based adaptive tracking control for underwater vehicles during simultaneous dynamic motion in all 6 degrees-of-freedom. This experimental evaluation revealed the presence of unmodeled thruster dynamics arising during reversals of the vehicle's thrusters, and that the unmodeled thruster dynamics can destabilize parameter adaptation. The three major contributions of this paper are: an experimental analysis of how unmodeled thruster dynamics can destabilize parameter adaptation, a two-step adaptive model-based control algorithm which is robust to the thruster modeling errors present, and a comparative experimental evaluation of adaptive model-based control and proportional derivative control for fully-actuated underwater vehicles preforming simultaneous 6 degree-of-freedom trajectory tracking.
