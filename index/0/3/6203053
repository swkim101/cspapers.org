In the application of digital data processing techniques to comparative musicology, it is an interesting subject to determine the type of scale in folk music and to compare the similarities in melody and rhythm between different musics. This paper describes two subjects: data entry technique for the realization of a music database and its application to comparative musicology. The former deals with dictation of melody sound. The latter concerns a method to find what scale is included in the melody, using knowledge in the modern ethno-musicology, and describes a certain measure of similarity of music.
