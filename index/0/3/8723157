Typical Web search engines are designed to run short queries against a huge collection of hyperlinked documents quickly and cheaply, and are often tuned for the types of queries people submit most often [2]. Many other types of applications exist for which large, open collections like the Web would be a valuable resource. However, these applications may require much more advanced support from information retrieval technology than is currently available. In particular, an application may have to describe more complex information needs, with a varied set of properties and data models, including aspects of the userâ€™s context and goals.
