A sensing device for a touchless, hand gesture, user interface based on an inexpensive passive infrared pyroelectric detector array is presented. The 2 x 2 element sensor responds to changing infrared radiation generated by hand movement over the array. The sensing range is from a few millimetres to tens of centimetres. The low power consumption (< 50 Î¼W) enables the sensor's use in mobile devices and in low energy applications. Detection rates of 77% have been demonstrated using a prototype system that differentiates the four main hand motion trajectories -- up, down, left and right. This device allows greater non-contact control capability without an increase in size, cost or power consumption over existing on/off devices.
