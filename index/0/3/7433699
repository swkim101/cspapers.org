This year, 2016, marks the 11th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security (PLAS). For the first time since PLAS began in 2006, PLAS is co-located with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). Over its now ten-year history, PLAS has provided a forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas about programming language and program analysis techniques that improve the security of software systems.
