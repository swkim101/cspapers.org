Undirected st-connectivity is an important problem in computing. There are algorithms for this problem that use O(n) time and ones that use O(log n) space. The main result of this paper is that in a very naturat structured model, these upper bounds are not simultaneously achievable. More formalty, for every constant z z O, the expected time to solve undirected sr-connectivity on a probabilistic JAG with p ~ & & pebbles and q < n’”< n states isn x ZQ(*J when theinputgraph is chosen unifortnly from a family of 3-regular graphs. 1
