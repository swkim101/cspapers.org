This task becomes feasible with MIML (Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning), a recently developed learning framework, where each data object is represented by multiple instances and is allowed to be associated with multiple labels simultaneously. In this paper, we propose KISAR, an MIML algorithm that is able to discover what instances trigger what labels. By considering the fact that highly relevant labels usually share some patterns, we develop a convex optimization formulation and provide an alternating optimization solution. Experiments show that KISAR is able to discover reasonable relations between input patterns and output labels, and achieves performances that are highly competitive with many state-of-the-art MIML algorithms.
