We present a randomised polynomial time algorithm for approximating the volume of a convex body <italic>K</italic> in <italic>n</italic>-dimensional Euclidean space. The proof of correctness of the algorithm relies on recent theory of rapidly mixing Markov chains and isoperimetric inequalities to show that a certain random walk can be used to sample nearly uniformly from within <italic>K</italic>.
