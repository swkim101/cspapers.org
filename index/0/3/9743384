This paper deals with mental models of interactive systems and their role in human - computer interaction. In the first section, mental models are differentiated from two other kinds of cognitive phenomena: production rules and "functional cognitive maps". Next, an experiment is described, in which an interactive system was presented to students with the help of a state transition diagram or a set of "production rules". The use of production rules was found to be an advantage in this experiment. The paper concludes with a discussion of mental models in the context of skill automatization and user interface transparency problems.
