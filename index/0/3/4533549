The performance of web browsers has become a major bottleneck when dealing with complex webpages. Many calculation redundancies exist when processing similar webpages, thus it is possible to cache and reuse previously calculated intermediate results to improve web browser performance significantly. In this paper, we propose a similarity-based optimization approach to improve webpage processing performance of web browsers. Through caching and reusing of style properties calculated previously, we are able to eliminate the redundancies caused by processing similar webpages from the same website. We propose a tree-structured architecture to store style properties to facilitate efficient caching and reuse. Experiments on webpages of various websites show that the proposed technique can speed up the webpage loading process by up to 68% and reduce the redundant style calculations by up to 77% for the first visit to a webpage with almost negligible overhead.
