The increased complexities in communication, collaboration, and coordination associated with distributed development coupled with the lack of support for organizational learning in agile practices present challenges to tool developers for agile teams. This paper describes a suite of integrated tools that (1) accommodates various collaboration styles; (2) provides process support for specific agile practices; and (3) facilitates organizational learning.
