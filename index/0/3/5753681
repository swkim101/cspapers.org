This demonstration illustrates the APDF tree: an adaptive tree that supports the effective and effcient computation of continuous density information. The APDF tree allocates more partition points in non-linear areas of the density function and fewer points in linear areas of the density function. This yields not only a bounded, but a tight control of the error. The demonstration explains the core steps of the computation of the APDF tree (split, kernel additions, tree optimization, kernel additions, unsplit) and demos the implementation for different datasets.
