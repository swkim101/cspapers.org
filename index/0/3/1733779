By considering both common and discriminative features, KMTPLS effectively fuses the information from multiple tensorial data sources and unifies the single and multiblock tensor regression scenarios into one general model. Moreover, in contrast to multilinear model, KMTPLS successfully addresses the nonlinear dependencies between multiple response and predictor tensor blocks by combining kernel machines with joint Tucker decomposition, resulting in a significant performance gain in terms of predictability. An efficient learning algorithm for KMTPLS based on sequentially extracting common and discriminative latent vectors is also presented. Finally, to show the effectiveness and advantages of our approach, we test it on the real-life regression task in computer vision, i.e., reconstruction of human pose from multiview video sequences.
