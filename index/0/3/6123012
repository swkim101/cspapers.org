This paper deals with the construction of shift-invariant maximal filters on â„¤ and their relation to hormonal cellular automata, a generalization of the cellular automata computation model with some information about the global state shared among all the cells. We first design shift-invariant maximal filters in order to define this new model of computation. Starting from different assumptions, we show how to construct such filters, and analyze the computation power of the induced cellular automata computation model.
