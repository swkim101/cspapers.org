Many residential and small business users connect to the Internet via home gateways, such as DSL and cable modems. The characteristics of these devices heavily influence the quality and performance of the Internet service that these users receive. Anecdotal evidence suggests that an extremely diverse set of behaviors exists in the deployed base, forcing application developers to design for the lowest common denominator. This paper experimentally analyzes some characteristics of a substantial number of different home gateways: binding timeouts, queuing delays, throughput, protocol support and others.
