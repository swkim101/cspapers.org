Let H be a k-graph on n vertices, with minimum codegree at least n/k + cn for some fixed c > 0. In this paper we construct a polynomial-time algorithm which finds either a perfect matching in H or a certificate that none exists. This essentially solves a problem of Karpinski, Rucinski and Szymanska, who previously showed that this problem is NP-hard for a minimum codegree of n/k - cn. Our algorithm relies on a theoretical result of independent interest, in which we characterise any such hypergraph with no perfect matching using a family of lattice-based constructions.
