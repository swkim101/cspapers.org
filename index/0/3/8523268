For a very long time, it has been considered that the only way of automatically extracting similar groups of words from a text collection for which no semantic information exists is to use document co-occurrence data. But, with robust syntactic parsers that are becoming more frequently available, syntactically recognizable phenomena about word usage can be confidently noted in large collections of texts. We present here a new system called SEXTANT which uses these parsers and the finer-grained contexts they produce to judge word similarity.
