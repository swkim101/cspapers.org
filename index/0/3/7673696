To predict such sensori-motor behavior, it is necessary to model what is sensed and how actions are chosen based on the obtained sensory measurements. Although several models of human sensing haven been proposed, rarely data of the assumed sensory measurements is available. This makes statistical estimation of sensor models problematic. To overcome this issue, we propose an abstract structural estimation approach building on the ideas of Herman et al.'s Simultaneous Estimation of Rewards and Dynamics (SERD). Assuming optimal fusion of sensory information and rational choice of actions the proposed method allows to infer sensor models even in absence of data of the sensory measurements. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first general approach for joint inference of sensor and policy models. Furthermore, we consider its concrete implementation in the important class of sensor scheduling linear quadratic Gaussian problems. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated for prediction of the behavior of automobile drivers. Specifically, we model the glance and steering behavior of driving in the presence of visually demanding secondary tasks. The results show, that prediction benefits from the inference of sensor models. This is the case, especially, if also information is considered, that is contained in gaze switching behavior.
