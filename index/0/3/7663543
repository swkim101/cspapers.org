This paper presents a new name form for the OSI X.500 directory system. The primary function of the directory is to provide a name-to-object look-up facility for OSI objects. The directory consists of a set of agents and a database which is distributed among the agents. The directory database is structured as a tree where each node, or entry, corresponds to an object. An entry consists of a set of attributes where one or more attributes are designated as the object name relative to the entry's immediate superior. X.500 defines a name as an ordered sequence of entry names starting from the root and terminating at the object. Therefore, a user must know the names of all the superiors of an object. In contrast, the descriptive name form is an unordered set of attributes. Only enough attributes need be given to distinguish the object from other objects. As a result, users do not have to know or understand the underlying hierarchy of the directory in order to do name look-up.
