In this paper we present a probabilistic framework for the reduction in the uncertainty of a moving robot pose during exploration by using a second robot to assist. A Monte Carlo Simulation technique (specifically, a Particle Filter) is employed in order to model and reduce the accumulated odometric error. Furthermore, we study the requirements to obtain an accurate yet timely pose estimate. A team of two robots is employed to explore an indoor environment in this paper, although several aspects of the approach have been extended to larger groups. The concept behind our exploration strategy has been presented previously and is based on having one robot carry a sensor that acts as a "robot tracker" to estimate the position of the other robot. By suitable use of the tracker as an appropriate motion-control mechanism we can sweep areas of free space between the stationary and the moving robot and generate an accurate graph-based description of the environment. This graph is used to guide the exploration process. Complete exploration without any overlaps is guaranteed as a result of the guidance provided by the dual graph of the spatial decomposition (triangulation) of the environment. We present experimental results from indoor experiments in our laboratory and from more complex simulated experiments.
