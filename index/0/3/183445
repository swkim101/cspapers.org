Current general aspect-oriented programming solutions fall short of helping the problem of separation of concerns for several concern domains. Because of this limitation good solutions for these concern domains do not get used and the opportunity to benefit from separation of these concerns is missed. By using XAspects, a plug-in mechanism for domain-specific aspect languages, separation of concerns can be achieved at a level beyond what is possible for object-oriented programming languages. As a result, XAspects allows for certain domain-specific solutions to be used as easily as a new language feature.
