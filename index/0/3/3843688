For Securing BGP Protocol, this paper proposes an identity-based private key infrastructure (iPKI) for managing self-attested IP (sIP) addresses. An sIP address endows the current IP address self-attested characteristic, which does not rely on any credential based PKI. Based on the sIP address, we design the In-Band Self Origin Verification (IBSOV) protocol and self Route Origin Authorization (sROA) to provide a lightweight origin verification for the BGP protocol, which has a much lower overhead than the existing works.
