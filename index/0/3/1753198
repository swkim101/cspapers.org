In this paper, we present an extension of LTSA that facilitates our approach to reliability prediction. LTSA allows the use of behavioural models for distributed systems as prototypes to explore system behaviour, and automated checking of model compliance to properties (i.e., model checking). To support reliability prediction, our new extensions allow annotating a scenario specification with probabilities and using LTSA to process the resulting scenarios. In this context, scenarios are partial descriptions of how components interact to provide system functionality. A scenario specification is formed by composing multiple scenarios possibly from different stakeholders.
