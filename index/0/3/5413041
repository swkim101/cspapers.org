We describe the design and implementation of real-time data management services. These services combine technologies developed in the context of real-time distributed object management, object DBMSs, and scheduling. This combination simplifies many of the services, and produces a result which is greater than the sum of its parts, because it can be used to improve the portability and flexibility of real-time applications.
