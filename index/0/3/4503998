We show that the shortest vector problem in lattices with La norm is NP-hard for randomized reductions. Moreover we also show that there is an absolute constant E > 0 so that to find a vector which is longer than the shortest non-zero vector by no more than a factor of 1 + 2'** (with respect to the Es norm) is also NP-hard for randomized reductions. The corresponding decision problem is NP-complete for randomized reductions. 1. Introduction. A lattice in R* is the set of all integer linear combinations of It fixed linearly independent vectors. T'he question of finding the shortest non-zero vector in a lattice with repsect to the L, norm was proved to be NP-hard by Van Emde Boas. However the corresponding problem for the Lz norm (or any other &norms for 1 5 p < OD) remained unsolved. Van Emde Boas conjectured almost twenty years ago (cf. [vEB]) that the L2 shortest vector problem for lattices in Z* is NP-hard and the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete. The cr-approximate version of the problem is the following: find a non-zero vector 11 in the lattice 1; so that its length is at most ~1]vc]] where ~0 is a shortest non-zero vector of the lattice. It has been shown by J. Lagarias, H.W Lens&a and, C. I? Schnorr (cf. [LLS]) that if the cr-appro,ximate problem is NP-hard for any Q > nl*a (where n is the dimension of the lattice) than NP = co-NP. According to recent a result of 0. Goldreich and S. Goldwasser it is unlikeley that the a-approximation problem is NP-hard even for Q: = $, since this problem is in NP tl coAM (see [GG]). In this paper we show that the shortest vector problem is NP-hard for randomized reductions. That is, there is a prob-abilistic Turing-machine which in polynomial time reduces any problem in NP to instances of the shortest vector problem. In other words this probabilistic 'Ruing machine can solve in polynomial time any problem in NP, provided that it can use an oracle which returns the solution of the shortest vector problem if an instance of it presented (by giving a basis of the corresponding lattice). We prove the same result about the 1 + 2-*'-approximate problem where E > 0 is n sufficiently small absolute constant and n is the dimension ot the lattice. (Recently J.-Y. Cai and A. Nerurkar has â€¦
