XQForms is the first generator of Web-based query forms and reports for XML data. XQForms takes as input (i) XML Schemas that model the data to be queried and presented, (ii) declarative specifications, called annotations, of the logic of the query forms and reports that will be generated, and (iii) a set of template presentation libraries. The output is a set of query forms and reports that provide automated query construction and report formatting in order for the end users to query and browse the underlying XML data. Thus XQForms separates content (given by the XML Schema of the data), query form logic (specified by the annotations) and presentation of the forms and reports. The system architecture is modular and consists of four main components: (a) a collection of query form controls that incorporate query capabilities and allow parameter passing from the end users via the form page. A set of query form controls makes up a query form. (b) An annotation scheme for binding these controls to data elements of the XML Schema and for specifying their properties, (c) a compiler for creating the HTML representation of the query forms, and (d) a runtime engine that constructs and executes the queries against the XML data and renders the query results to create the reports.
