To improve the precision at the very top ranks of a document list presented in response to a query, researchers suggested to exploit information induced from clustering of documents highly ranked by some initial search. We propose a novel model for ranking such (query-specific) clusters by the presumed percentage of relevant documents that they contain. The model is based on (i) proposing a palette of "witness" cluster properties that purportedly correlate with this percentage, (ii) devising concrete quantitative measures for these properties, and (iii) ordering the clusters via aggregation of rankings induced by these individual measures. Empirical evaluation shows that our model is consistently more effective than previously suggested methods in detecting clusters containing a high relevant-document percentage. Furthermore, the precision-at-top-ranks performance of this model transcends that of standard document-based retrieval, and competes with that of a state-of-the-art document-based retrieval approach.
