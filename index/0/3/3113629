The challenge of equation-based analog synthesis comes from its dual nature: functions producing good least-square fits to SPICE-generated data are non-convex, hence not amenable to efficient optimization. In this paper, we leverage recent progress on Semidefinite Programming (SDP) relaxations of polynomial (non-convex) optimization. Using a general polynomial allows for much more accurate fitting of SPICE data compared to the more restricted functional forms. Recent SDP techniques for convex relaxations of polynomial optimizations are powerful but alone still insufficient: even for small problems, the resulting relaxations are prohibitively high dimensional.
