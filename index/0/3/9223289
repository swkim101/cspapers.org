This paperintroduces methods for tightening the bounds. Thelower bound is tightened by using more informed variablegroupings when creating the pattern databases, andthe upper bound is tightened using an anytime learningalgorithm. Empirical results show that these boundsimprove the efficiency of Bayesian network learning bytwo to three orders of magnitude.
