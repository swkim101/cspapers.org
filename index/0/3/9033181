This paper deals with the little publicized problem of cable signal assignment, or as I refer to it, “bundling.” That is, the “bundling” together of signals that have the common property that they travel between the same two general areas. (Boards in the terminology of this paper.) Thus, these signals can be grouped together into a cable and their connections to the general areas are called cable connectors. Before continuing with the “bundling” problem, it is best to define some terms that will be used in the remainder of this paper. They are not original definitions nor are they necessarily the universal definitions. They are only terms which the author has chosen to use.
