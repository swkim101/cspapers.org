We introduce GoWvis 1 , an interactive web application that represents any piece of text inputted by the user as a graph-of-words and leverages graph degeneracy and community detection to generate an ex-tractive summary (keyphrases and sentences) of the inputted text in an un-supervised fashion. The entire analysis can be fully customized via the tuning of many text preprocessing, graph building, and graph mining parameters. Our sys-tem is thus well suited to educational purposes, exploration and early research experiments. The new summarization strategy we propose also shows promise.
