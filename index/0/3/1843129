The paper reports on new algorithms for solving partially observable games. Whereas existing algorithms apply AND-OR search to a tree of blackbox belief states, our "incremental" versions treat uncertainty as a new search dimension, examining the physical states within a belief state to construct solution trees incrementally. On a newly created database of checkmate problems for Kriegspiel (a partially observable form of chess), incrementalization yields speedups of two or more orders of magnitude on hard instances.
