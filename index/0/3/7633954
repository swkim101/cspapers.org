We present an algorithm for the following problem. Given a triangulated 3-manifold M and a (possibly non-simple) closed curve on the boundary of M, decide whether this curve is contractible in M. Our algorithm is combinatorial and runs in exponential time. This is the first algorithm that is specifically designed for this problem; its running time considerably improves upon the existing bounds implicit in the literature for the more general problem of contractibility of closed curves in a 3-manifold. The proof of the correctness of the algorithm relies on methods of 3-manifold topology and in particular on those used in the proof of the Loop Theorem.
