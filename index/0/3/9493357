In this paper we present the original method of intensive hands-on training in Object-oriented Analysis and Design (OOA/OOD) with the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The method has been successfully used by the authors for three years.During the training, the students:go through the communication problems that are typical for large software development projects obtain the successful experience of applying UML to overcome these problems.The essence of the method is that a team of students is supposed to design a software system. They have several hours to complete the task. During this timeframe verbal and written communication is forbidden, and the UML is the only allowed language. This training is a kind of experiment for students -- they are to discover whether UML is "a real language" that is suitable and beneficial for a project team.The training was successfully delivered more than ten times in both academic and corporate environments and generated positive feedback from students and customers.
