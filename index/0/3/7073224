Parameterized linear systems allow for modelling and reasoning over classes of polyhedra. Collections of squares, rectangles, polytopes, and so on, can readily be defined by means of linear systems with parameters. In this paper, we investigate the problem of learning a parameterized linear system whose class of polyhedra includes a given set of example polyhedral sets and it is minimal.
