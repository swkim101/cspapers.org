This paper describes the development of a second database course for undergraduates, preparing students for the advanced database concepts they will experience in industry. Assuming an introductory course on relational database systems as a prerequisite, the topics addressed in the course include object-oriented data modeling, object-oriented database systems, object-relational database systems, Web access to databases, and professionalism and ethics. We present our experience with teaching the course, elaborating on the topics and assignments. We also present feedback from students and industry partners as well as our own assessment of future course refinements.
