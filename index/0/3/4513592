Abstract. We consider embedding metrics induced by trees into Euclidean spaces with a restricted number of dimensions. We show that any weighted tree T with n vertices and L leaves can be embedded into d -dimensional Euclidean space with Õ (L1/(d-1)) distortion. Furthermore, we exhibit an embedding with almost the same distortion which can be computed efficiently. This distortion substantially improves the previous best upper bound of \tilde O (n2/d) and almost matches the best known lower bound of Ω(L1/d) .
