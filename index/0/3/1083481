We study the interaction between unary inclusion dependencies (UIND's) and other known classes of dependencies, in the context of both unrestricted and finite implication. We provide complete axiomatizations for unrestricted and finite implication of UIND's and functional dependencies, and polynomial-time algorithms for the inference problems. The inference problem becomes, however, NP-hard, if we require that some attribute have a bounded domain. We show that for unrestricted implication, the interaction between UIND's and unary functional dependencies completely characterizes the interaction between UIND's and embedded implicational dependencies. Also, for finite implication, the interaction between UIND's and unary functional dependencies completely characterizes the interaction between UIND's and full implicational dependencies (but not UIND's and embedded implicational dependencies).
