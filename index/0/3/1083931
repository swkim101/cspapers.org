This paper presents SUD, a system for running existing Linux device drivers as untrusted user-space processes. Even if the device driver is controlled by a malicious adversary, it cannot compromise the rest of the system. One significant challenge of fully isolating a driver is to confine the actions of its hardware device. SUD relies on IOMMU hardware, PCI express bridges, and messagesignaled interrupts to confine hardware devices. SUD runs unmodified Linux device drivers, by emulating a Linux kernel environment in user-space. A prototype of SUD runs drivers for Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11 wireless, sound cards, USB host controllers, and USB devices, and it is easy to add a new device class. SUD achieves the same performance as an in-kernel driver on networking benchmarks, and can saturate a Gigabit Ethernet link. SUD incurs a CPU overhead comparable to existing runtime driver isolation techniques, while providing much stronger isolation guarantees for untrusted drivers. Finally, SUD requires minimal changes to the kernel--just two kernel modules comprising 4,000 lines of code--which may at last allow the adoption of these ideas in practice.
