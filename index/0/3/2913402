Even though collaboration in peer learning has been shown to have a positive impact for students, there has been little research into collaborative peer learning dialogues. We analyze such dialogues in order to derive a model of knowledge co-construction that incorporates initiative and the balance of initiative. This model will be embedded in an artificial agent that will collaborate with students.
