The Web of Data is increasingly producing large RDF datasets from diverse fields of knowledge, pushing the Web to a data-to-data cloud. However, traditional RDF representations were inspired by a document-centric view, which results in verbose/redundant data, costly to exchange and post-process. This article discusses an ongoing doctoral thesis addressing efficient formats for publication, exchange and consumption of RDF on a large scale. First, a binary serialization format for RDF, called HDT, is proposed. Then, we focus on compressed rich-functional structures which take part of efficient HDT representation as well as most applications performing on huge RDF datasets.
