We propose a Case-Based Reasoning approach for action selection in the robot soccer domain presented in the 8th European Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (2006). Based on the current state of a game, the robots retrieve the most similar past situation and then the team reproduces the sequence of actions performed in that occasion. In this domain we have to deal with all the difficulties that a real environment involves.
