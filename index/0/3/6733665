Evolving semiconductor and circuit technology has greatly increased the pin bandwidth available to a router chip. In the early 90s, routers were limited to 10Gb/s of pin bandwidth. Today 1Tb/s is feasible, and we expect 20Tb/s of I/O bandwidth by 2010. A high-radix router that provides many narrow Dalports is more effective in converting pin band-width to reduced latency and reduced cost than the alternative of building a router with a few wide ports. However, increasing the radix (or degree) of a router raises several challenges as internal switches and allocators scale as the square of the radix. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing and evaluating alternative microarchitectures for high radix routers. We show that the use of a hierarchical switch organization with per-virtual-channel buffers in each subswitch enables an area savings of 40% compared to a fully buffered crossbar and a throughput increase of 20-60% compared to a conventional crossbar implementation.
