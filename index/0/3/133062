A recent area in which recommender systems have shown their value is in online discussion forums and question-answer sites. Earlier work in this space has focused on the problem of matching participants to opportunities but has not adequately addressed the problem that in these social contexts, multiple dimensions of constraints must be satisfied, including limitations on capacity and minimal requirements for expertise. In this work, we propose such a constrained question recommendation problem with load balance constraints in discussion forums and use flow based model to generate the optimal solution. In particular, to address the introduced computation complexity, we investigate the concept of submodularity of the objective function and propose a specific submodular method to give an approximated solution. We present experiments conducted on two Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) discussion forum datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our submodular method in solving constrained question recommendation tasks.
