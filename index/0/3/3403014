For a given a graph, a distance oracle is a data structure that answers distance queries between pairs of vertices. We introduce an O(n 5/3)-space distance oracle which answers exact distance queries in O(log n) time for n-vertex planar edge-weighted digraphs. All previous distance oracles for planar graphs with truly subquadratic space (i.e., space O(n 2- ) for some constant 0) either required query time polynomial in n or could only answer approximate distance queries.Furthermore, we show how to trade-off time and space: for any S &#x2265; n 3/2, we show how to obtain an S-space distance 5/2 oracle that answers queries in time O(S n 3/2 log n). This is a polynomial improvement over the previous planar distance oracles with o(n 1/4) query time.
