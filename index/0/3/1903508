While CS educators may agree that computer science involves much more than programming, different perspectives emerge concerning the introduction of non-programming topics within the first or second year of the undergraduate curriculum. Some common questions include: ● How can we give. beginning students a sense of the breadth of our discipline? ● What (non-programming) topics might be covered early in the curriculum? ● The Denning Report identifies major research areas within CS. How does this set of research topics relate to the topics which should be covered for undergraduates? ● Once we have identified appropriate topics to teach, how can we bring these ideas into the first few courses?
