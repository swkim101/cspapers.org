CrewScout is an expert-team finding system based on the concept of skyline teams and efficient algorithms for finding such teams. Given a set of experts, CrewScout finds all k-expert skyline teams, which are not dominated by any other k-expert teams. The dominance between teams is governed by comparing their aggregated expertise vectors. The need for finding expert teams prevails in applications such as question answering, crowdsourcing, panel selection, and project team formation. The new contributions of this paper include an end-to-end system with an interactive user interface that assists users in choosing teams and an demonstration of its application domains.
