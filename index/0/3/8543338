We discuss a study conducted during a summer program for middle school girls that emphasized possible future careers that rely on computer technology. During the weeklong camp middle school girls created an original computer project, visited campus computer labs and listened to invited speakers - all with computer technology as the central theme. This paper discusses the program, girls' reactions to their experiences, and the projects they created during the summer camp.
