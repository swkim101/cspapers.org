Dialog applications for managing calendars have been developed for every generation of dialog systems research (Heidorn, 1978; Yankelovich, 1994; Constantinides and others, 1998; Horvitz and Paek, 2000; Vo and Wood, 1996; Huang and others, 2001). Today, Web-based calendar applications are widely used. A spoken dialog interface to a Web-based calendar application permits convenient use of the system on a handheld device or over the telephone.
