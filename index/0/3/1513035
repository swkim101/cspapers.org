Metonymic language is a pervasive phenomenon. Metonymic type shifting, or argument type coercion, results in a selectional restriction violation where the argument's semantic class differs from the class the predicate expects. In this paper we present an un-supervised method that learns the selectional restriction of arguments and enables the detection of argument coercion. This method also generates an enhanced probabilistic resolution of logical metonymies. The experimental results indicate substantial improvements the detection of coercions and the ranking of metonymic interpretations.
