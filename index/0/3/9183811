The data structure that drives the General Problem Solver is the Connection Table. This paper describes the theoretical basis for the automatic construction of this table by computer programs.The programs for this purpose have been developed at the Case Western Reserve University. They basically isolate certain attributes of the problem states which are invariant under certain moves and then put those attributes together to "triangularize" the Connection Table.
