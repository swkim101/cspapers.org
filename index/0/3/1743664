Representation learning of knowledge graphs aims to encode both entities and relations into a continuous low-dimensional vector space. Most existing methods only concentrate on learning representations with structured information located in triples, regardless of the rich information located in hierarchical types of entities, which could be collected in most knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Type-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning (TKRL) to take advantages of hierarchical entity types. We suggest that entities should have multiple representations in different types. More specifically, we consider hierarchical types as projection matrices for entities, with two type encoders designed to model hierarchical structures. Meanwhile, type information is also utilized as relation-specific type constraints. We evaluate our models on two tasks including knowledge graph completion and triple classification, and further explore the performances on long-tail dataset. Experimental results show that our models significantly outperform all baselines on both tasks, especially with long-tail distribution. It indicates that our models are capable of capturing hierarchical type information which is significant when constructing representations of knowledge graphs.
