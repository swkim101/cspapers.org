In this dissertation, we prove a coding theorem for distributed network protocols. We show that any distributed protocol which runs on a noiseless network in time T, can be simulated on an identical noisy network with a slow-down factor proportional to log(d + 1), where d is the maximum degree in the network, and with exponentially small probability of error. 
Our theorem is a network analog of the classical coding theorem of Shannon (1948), which addresses the issue of the transmission of data over a noisy link. Although Shannon's original theorem is non-constructive--it proves the existence of codes that transfer data at asymptotically optimal rates--the subsequent development of coding theory makes this result constructive. 
Shannon's theory, however, does not address issues that arise when noise occurs in the communications of a wide area computational network with a number of links available for simultaneous use. This question of what happens when computation is interleaved with noisy communications was proposed and first addressed by Schulman in the special case of a pair of computers connected by a bidirectional communication link. In this case, Schulman obtains an analog of Shannon's theorem. 
Like those of Shannon and Schulman, the results we exhibit are non constructive. However, in our case, it is possible to obtain constructive simulations by compromising the reliability with which they run. For a particular problem, the 'telephone' game, we exhibit a constructive solution for which this compromise is unnecessary. 
Work reported in this dissertation stems from that done jointly with Leonard Schulman.
