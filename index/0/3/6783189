We present the first low power backscatter system that can be deployed completely using commodity WiFi infrastructure. With this system, a low power tag reflects existing 802.11b transmissions from a commodity WiFi transmitter, and the backscattered signals can be decoded as a standard WiFi packet by a commodity 802.11b receiver. The key invention is a novel technique called \textbf{codeword translation}, which allows a backscatter tag to embed its information on standard 802.11b packets by just translating the original transmitted 802.11b codeword to another valid 802.11b codeword. This allows any 802.11b receiver to decode the backscattered packet, thus opening the doors for widespread deployment of low-power backscatter communication using widely available WiFi infrastructure. We show experimentally that we can achieve an uplink throughput of up to 1Mbps at ranges of up to 8m and ranges of up to 50m where it achieves a throughput of around 100Kbps, which is twice as better than the recently published passive WiFi system.
