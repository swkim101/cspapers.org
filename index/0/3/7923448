The interpretive process corresponds to creating a virtual machine to extend the capabilities of a hardware system. One of the drawbacks is that the interpreter and its instruction set are not implemented in the base hardware system; they are implemented as a series of routines written in the language of the base hardware system (machine code). This means, in many cases, that the interpreter is slower than the base system since it must be executed when a virtual instruction is fetched and executed. This paper presents the technique of interpretation through instruction execution which eliminates much of this overhead.
