We present an approach for detecting and matching building facades between aerial view and street-view images. We exploit the regularity of urban scene facades as captured by their lattice structures and deduced from median-tiles' shape context, color, texture and spatial similarities. Our experimental results demonstrate effective matching of oblique and partially-occluded facades between aerial and ground views. Quantitative comparisons for automated urban scene facade matching from three cities show superior performance of our method over baseline SIFT, Root-SIFT and the more sophisticated Scale-Selective Self-Similarity and Binary Coherent Edge descriptors. We also illustrate regularity-based applications of occlusion removal from street views and higher-resolution texture-replacement in aerial views.
