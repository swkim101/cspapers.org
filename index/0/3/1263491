Rhombic like vehicles are characterized for high maneuverability in cluttered environments. This type of vehicles will be used on remote handling operations of maintenance in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). Previous work was done in motion planning using Constrained Delaunay Triangulation for rhombic like vehicles operating in ITER. This paper shows that the integration of Fast Marching Square improves the motion planning methodology, decreasing also the computational effort, which can be applied not only in ITER but also in other complex and cluttered environments. Simulated results are presented comparing the initial and the improved motion planning.
