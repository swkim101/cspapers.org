An affine disperser over F<sub>2</sub><sup>n</sup> for sources of dimension d is a function f: F<sub>2</sub><sup>n</sup> → F<sub>2</sub> such that for any affine space S ⊆ F<sub>2</sub><sup>n</sup> of dimension at least d, we have {f(s) : s in S} = F<sub>2</sub>. Affine dispersers have been considered in the context of deterministic extraction of randomness from structured sources of imperfect randomness. Previously, explicit constructions of affine dispersers were known for every d = Ω(n), due to Barak et. al.[2] and Bourgain[10] (the latter in fact gives stronger objects called affine extractors). In this work we give the first explicit affine dispersers for <i>sublinear</i> dimension. Specifically, our dispersers work even when d = Ω(n<sup>4/5</sup>). The main novelty in our construction lies in the method of proof, which relies on elementary properties of <i>subspace polynomials</i>. In contrast, the previous works mentioned above relied on sum-product theorems for finite fields.
