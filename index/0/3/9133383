Reliable detection of obstacles at long range is crucial for the timely response to hazards by fast-moving safety-critical platforms like autonomous cars. We present a novel method for the joint detection and localization of distant obstacles using a stereo vision system on a moving platform. The approach is applicable to both static and moving obstacles and pushes the limits of detection performance as well as localization accuracy.
