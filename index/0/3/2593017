In this paper, we use matting to separate foreground layers from light fields captured with a plenoptic camera. We represent the input 4D light field as a 4D background light field, plus a 2D spatially varying foreground color layer with alpha. Our method can be used to both pull a foreground matte and estimate an occluded background light field. Our method assumes that the foreground layer is thin and fronto-parallel, and is composed of a limited set of colors that are distinct from the background layer colors. Our method works well for thin, translucent, and blurred foreground occluders. Our representation can be used to render the light field from novel views, handling disocclusions while avoiding common artifacts.
