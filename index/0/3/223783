In this paper we define a compositional semantics for a generalized composition operator on logic programs. Static and dynamic inheritance as well as composition by union of clauses can all be obtained by specializing the general operator. The semantics is based on the notion of differential programs, logic programs annotated with declarations that establish the programs' external interfaces.
