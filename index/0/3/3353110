Image generation has been successfully cast as an autoregressive sequence generation or transformation problem. Recent work has shown that self-attention is an effective way of modeling textual sequences. In this work, we generalize a recently proposed model architecture based on self-attention, the Transformer, to a sequence modeling formulation of image generation with a tractable likelihood. By restricting the self-attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods we significantly increase the size of images the model can process in practice, despite maintaining significantly larger receptive fields per layer than typical convolutional neural networks. We propose another extension of self-attention allowing it to efficiently take advantage of the two-dimensional nature of images. While conceptually simple, our generative models trained on two image data sets are competitive with or significantly outperform the current state of the art in autoregressive image generation on two different data sets, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. We also present results on image super-resolution with a large magnification ratio, applying an encoder-decoder configuration of our architecture. In a human evaluation study, we show that our super-resolution models improve significantly over previously published autoregressive super-resolution models. Images they generate fool human observers three times more often than the previous state of the art.
