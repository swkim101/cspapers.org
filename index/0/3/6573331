Recognizing definition sentences from free text corpora often requires hand-crafted patterns or explicitly labeled training instances. We present a distant supervision approach addressing this challenge without using explicitly labeled data. We use plausibly good but imperfect definition sentences from Wikipedia as references to annotate sentences in a target corpus based on text similarity measures such as ROUGE. Experimental results show our approach is highly effective, generating noisy but large, useful, and localized training instances. Definition sentence retrieval models trained using the synthesized training examples are more effective than those learned from manual judgments of a few thousand sentences. We also examine different text similarity measures for annotation, including both unsupervised and supervised ones. We show that our method can significantly benefit from supervised text similarity measures learned from either external training data (from the SemEval Semantic Text Similarity task) or local ones (a few hundred judged sentences on the target corpus). Our method offers a cheap, effective, and flexible solution to this task and can benefit a broad range of applications such as web search engines and QA systems.
