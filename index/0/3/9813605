The performance of a special purpose multiple processor system with a shared bus for the transmission of output data is studied. A finite population queueing model with Poisson arrivals and services is developed and analyzed. The number of states is found to increase factorially with the number of customers. In the special case of equal arrival and service rates, the model reduces to a simpler one, whose solution is obtained by a recursive technique that reduces significantly the computation time. Under certain conditions, the simplified model provides a good approximation to the throughput predicted by the general model.
