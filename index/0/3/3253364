Stochastic models are widely used for the performance evaluation of parallel programs and systems. The stochastic assumptions in such models exe intended to represent non-deterministic processing requirements as well as random delays due to inter-process communication end resource contention. In this paper, we provide compelling analytical and experimental evidence that in current and foreseeable shared-memory programs, communication delays introduce negligible variance into the execution time between synchronization points. Furthermore, we show using direct measurements of variance that other sources of randomness, particularly non-deterministic computational requirements, also do not introduce significant variance in many programs. We then use two examples to demonstrate the implications of these results for parallel program performance prediction models, as well as for general stochastic models of parallel systems.
