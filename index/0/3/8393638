We present a novel framework that combines strengths from surface syntactic parsing and deep syntactic parsing to increase deep parsing accuracy, specifically by combining dependency and HPSG parsing. We show that by using surface dependencies to constrain the application of wide-coverage HPSG rules, we can benefit from a number of parsing techniques designed for highaccuracy dependency parsing, while actually performing deep syntactic analysis. Our framework results in a 1.4% absolute improvement over a state-of-the-art approach for wide coverage HPSG parsing.
