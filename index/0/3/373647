In 1986, Tanner and Mead [1] implemented an interesting constraint satisfaction circuit for global motion sensing in a VLSI. We report here a new and improved a VLSI implementation that provides smooth optical flow as well as global motion in a two dimensional visual field. The computation of optical flow is an ill-posed problem, which expresses itself as the aperture problem. However, the optical flow can be estimated by the use of regularization methods, in which additional constraints are introduced in terms of a global energy functional that must be minimized . We show how the algorithmic constraints of Hom and Schunck [2] on computing smooth optical flow can be mapped onto the physical constraints of an equivalent electronic network.
