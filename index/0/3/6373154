Traditional Information Extraction (IE) systems identify many unconnected facts. The objective of this paper is to define a new cross-document information extraction task and demonstrate a system which can extract, rank and track events in two dimensions: temporal and spatial. The system can automatically label the person entities involved in significant events as 'centroid arguments', and then present the events involving the same centroid on a time line and on a geographical map.
