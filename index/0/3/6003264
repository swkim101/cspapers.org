We present an extension to our feature based mapping technique that allows for the use of planar surfaces such as walls, tables, counters, or other planar surfaces as landmarks in our mapper. These planar surfaces are measured both in 3D point clouds, as well as 2D laser scans. These sensing modalities compliment each other well, as they differ significantly in their measurable fields of view and maximum ranges. We present experiments to evaluate the contributions of each type of sensor.
