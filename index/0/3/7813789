Intel SGX is the next-generation trusted computing infrastructure. It can e effctively protect data inside enclaves from being stolen. Similar to traditional programs, SGX enclaves are likely to have security vulnerabilities and can be exploited as well. This gives an adversary a great opportunity to steal secret data or perform other malicious operations. Rust is one of the system programming languages with promising security properties. It has powerful checkers and guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety. In this paper, we show Rust SGX SDK, which combines Intel SGX and Rust programming language together. By using Rust SGX SDK, developers could write memory-safe secure enclaves easily, eliminating the most possibility of being pwned through memory vulnerabilities. What's more, the Rust enclaves are able to run as fast as the ones written in C/C++.
