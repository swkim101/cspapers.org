Several example vehicle deceleration manoeuvres arising in automated transportation systems are specified, and their correctness verified, using the hybrid I/O automaton model of (Lynch et al., 1995). All system components are formalized using hybrid I/O automata, and their combination described using automaton composition. The proofs use invariant assertions, simulation mappings, and differential calculus.
