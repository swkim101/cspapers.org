This paper reports an ongoing work in applying Common Sense knowledge to Machine Translation aiming at generating more culturally contextualized translations. Common Sense can be defined as the knowledge shared by a group of people in a given time, space and culture; and this knowledge, here, is represented by a semantic network called ConceptNet. Machine Translation, in turn, is the automatic process of generating an equivalent translated version of a source sentence. In this work we intend to use the knowledge represented in two ConceptNets, one in Brazilian Portuguese and another in English, to fix/filter translations built automatically. So, this paper presents the initial ideas of our work, the steps taken so far as well as some opportunities for collaboration.
