We introduce a new approach to disjunctive ASP solving that aims at an equitable interplay between "generating" and "testing" solver units. To this end, we develop novel characterizations of answer sets and unfounded sets allowing for a bidirectional dynamic information exchange between solver units for orthogonal tasks. This results in the new multithreaded disjunctive ASP solver claspD-2, greatly improving the performance of existing systems.
