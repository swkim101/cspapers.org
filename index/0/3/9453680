This paper presents TypingRing, a wearable ring platform that enables text input into computers of different forms, such as PCs, smartphones, tablets, or even wearables with tiny screens. The basic idea of TypingRing is to have a user wear a ring on his middle finger and let him type on a surface - such as a table, a wall, or his lap. The user types as if a standard QWERTY keyboard is lying underneath his hand but is invisible to him. By using the embedded sensors TypingRing determines what key is pressed by the user. Further, the platform provides visual feedback to the user and communicates with the computing device wirelessly. This paper describes the hardware and software prototype of TypingRing and provides an in-depth evaluation of the platform. Our evaluation shows that TypingRing is capable of detecting and sending key events in real-time with an average accuracy of 98.67%. In a field study, we let seven users type a paragraph with the ring, and we find that TypingRing yields a reasonable typing speed (e.g., 33-50 keys per minute) and their typing speed improves over time.
