Most of the text summarization research carried out to date has been concerned with the summarization of short documents (e.g., news stories, technical reports), and very little work if any has been done on the summarization of very long documents. In this paper, we try to address this gap and explore the problem of book summarization. We introduce a new data set specifically designed for the evaluation of systems for book summarization, and describe summarization techniques that explicitly account for the length of the documents.
