We define and discuss an architecture for a knowledge base management system (KBMS) to support the efficient manipulation of large and diverse bodies of knowledge. The architecture has been formulated within an amalgamated language-metalanguage framework. All aspects of the system possess a logical semantics. Our emphasis is on modularity, the organization of theories and their metatheories within the system theory, and the clean integration of multiple representation languages. The expressivity of the architecture is discussed and an implementation based on an extended Prolog reported. Its utility is currently being investigated in a number of diverse applications.
