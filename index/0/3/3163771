Near Field Communications (NFC) is an emerging technology that conveniently establishes radio communication by bringing two entities in close proximity of one another. Many use cases for devices equipped with this technology have been proposed ranging from payment systems to convenient data exchange.
 In this demo, we implement a prototype NFC-based sensor device that periodically writes sensor data into a non-volatile memory; this data may be read out at a later time with an NFC-equipped smartphone or other device. The sensor features an ambient energy harvesting unit that allows sensing operations while disconnected from the phone; the phone is used as a supplemental harvesting source in addition to a way to offload collected sensor data.
