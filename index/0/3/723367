In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure to compute the pairwise similarity of text-based documents based on suffix tree document model. By applying the new suffix tree similarity measure in Group-average Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (GAHC) algorithm, we developed a new suffix tree document clustering algorithm (NSTC). Experimental results on two standard document clustering benchmark corpus OHSUMED and RCV1 indicate that the new clustering algorithm is a very effective document clustering algorithm. Comparing with the results of traditional word term weight tf-idf similarity measure in the same GAHC algorithm, NSTC achieved an improvement of 51% on the average of F-measure score. Furthermore, we apply the new clustering algorithm in analyzing the Web documents in online forum communities. A topic oriented clustering algorithm is developed to help people in assessing, classifying and searching the the Web documents in a large forum community.
