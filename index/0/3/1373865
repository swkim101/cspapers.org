This research explores the synergies between object-oriented application frameworks and model-driven engineering. We propose Framework-Specific Modeling Languages (FSMLs) which are domain-specific modeling languages designed for areas of concern to object-oriented frameworks. A framework-specific model expressed using an FSML describes how an application built on top of a framework is using the framework. The semantics of FSMLs can be precisely defined based on framework-completion knowledge: the prescribed steps and rules of writing the framework-completion code for the given framework. The mapping between the abstract syntax of an FSML and its base framework's API enables automatic forward-, reverse-, and round-trip engineering of thecompletion code.
