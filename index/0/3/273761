In recent years, there has been a prevalence of search engines being employed to find useful information in the Web as they efficiently explore hyperlinks between web pages which define a natural graph structure that yields a good ranking. Unfortunately, current search engines cannot effectively rank those relational data, which exists on dynamic websites supported by online databases. In this study, to rank such structured data (i.e., find the "best" items), we propose an integrated online system consisting of compressed data structure to encode the dominant relationship of the relational data. Efficient querying strategies and updating scheme are devised to facilitate the ranking process. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods. As such, we believe the work in this poster can be complementary to traditional search engines.
