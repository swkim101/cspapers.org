We have developed a robot with a new control mechanism in order to collect information on flying robots in multiple fields. We aimed for a function that could rotate the tilt angle continuously and without limit and a function for flying maintaining any desired tilt angle with a structure that could efficiently use the thrust generated by the propellers. We devised a mechanism that connected two bicopter modules, each of which combines two of the four propellers into one set and named this mechanism the “Bi2 Copter”. This mechanism provided movements including landing, take-off, and flying with any desired tilt angle. This ability of this mechanism to fly walls with continuously changing surface angles and full 360° spherical coverage makes possible applications in investigation, measurement, etc. This report covers the design concepts of this flying robot, the structure design, basic control and operations verification.
