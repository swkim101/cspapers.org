Video widgets are user-interface components rendered with video information. The implementation and several usage examples of a family of video widgets, called video actors, are presented.

Non-linear access allows video frames to be displayed in arbitrary order without loss of continuity, layering allows two or more video streams to be spatially composed. Both capabilities are now becoming available to user-interface designers
