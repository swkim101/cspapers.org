The widespread use of large scale and medium scale integrated circuits, coupled with the trend towards larger boards, made manual generation of test patterns very expensive, somewhat ineffective, and rather difficult to update for design changes. The advent of MOS LSI's with extremely large gate density made manual test-verification, the process of finding failures detected by a given test pattern, an impossibility. Therefore, a series of programs was developed, over the years, to completely automate the test cycleâ€”using logic description files as input, the final output for test generation is a test deck compiled in the language of card test equipment and, in the case of test-verification, lists of detected and undetected failures. All this is accomplished within the global constraint of complete (nearly 100%) coverage and prevailing test floor practices.
