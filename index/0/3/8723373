The paper presents a novel approach to finding regional scopes (geotagging) of websites. It relies on a single binary classification model per region type to perform the multi-class classification and uses a variety of features of different nature that have not been yet used together for machine-learning based regional classification of websites. The evaluation demonstrates the advantage of our "one model per region type" method versus the traditional "one model per region" approach.
