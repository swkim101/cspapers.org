The automation of numerous industrial processes using an electronic computer has been a reality for several years. In addition, numerous stages of electronic design are capable of being automated with considerable advantages. If the results are to be satisfactory, however, it is essential that various fundamental points are taken into account when a Computer Aided Engineering system is being designed. In our work and our experience we have found that the following points are significant:
 Clarity in defining objectives
 Modular strategy
 Standardization in the method of design; this is not so true for the conception as for the documentation
 Flexibility and adaptability of the system to the existing organisational structure
 Existance of an efficient infrastructure and hardware support. This facility speeds up the collection, memorization and transformation of a considerable amount of data, which constitutes an essential, perhaps the most important, operation in the whole procedure.
 Starting with these basic principles, the various modular components for the automatic design of printed circuit boards was initiated. The objectives are being reached gradually and without traumatic experiences in productivity.
