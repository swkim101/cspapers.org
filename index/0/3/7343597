Partial (or default) plans are plans that are constructed or applied without insuring that all support for the operators used in the plan is present in the planner's world model. Despite the apparent carelessness in their construction and application, partial plans are responsible for much of the efficiency of human problem solving. The ability to use partial plans relaxes some of the stringent requirements for thoroughness in planning and allows the application of very general, existing plans to typical, but specific situations. A plan's initial degree of partialness (and ultimate success) depends upon the Planner's estimate of the hospitality of the execution environment and its depth of knowledge. Consequently, a quickly produced partial plan may succeed quietly or may fail to achieve the expected results.
