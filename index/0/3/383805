In cognitive spectrum sharing systems, interference probability (IP) is one of the most important performance metrics illustrating the interference level at the primary network. In this paper, the interference probability of the primary network due to secondary underlay partial relay selection networks is investigated under the assumption of imperfect channel state information (CSI) of interference links. Numerical results show that it depends not only on the correlation efficient of interference links but also on the transmit power of secondary transmitters. It is also shown that the back-off technique is an efficient approach to guarantee the given quality of service (QoS) of the primary network. For secondary networks, we derive the outage probability over Rayleigh fading channels. Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to verify the correctness of the analysis.
