When a mobile robot does not have perfect knowledge of its position, conventional controllers can experience failures such as collisions because the uncertainty of the position is not considered in choosing control actions. In this paper, we show how global planning and local feedback control can be combined to generate control laws in the space of distributions over position, that is, in information space. We give a novel algorithm for computing “information-constrained” linear quadratic Gaussian (icLQG) policies for controlling a robot with imperfect state information. The icLQG algorithm uses the belief roadmap algorithm to efficiently search for a trajectory that approximates the globally-optimal motion plan in information space, and then iteratively computes a feedback control law to locally optimize the global approximation. The icLQG algorithm is not only robust to imperfect state information but also scalable to high-dimensional systems and environments. In addition, icLQG is capable of answering multiple queries efficiently. We demonstrate performance results for controlling a vehicle on the plane and a helicopter in three dimensions.
