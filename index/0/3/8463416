We develop the theory of holographic algorithms. We definea basis manifold and give characterizations of algebraic varieties of realizable symmetric generators and recognizers on this manifold. We present a polynomial time decision algorithm for the simultaneous realizability problem. Using the general machinery we are able to giveunexpected holographic algorithms for some counting problems, modulo certain Mersenne type integers. These counting problems are P-complete without the moduli. Going beyond symmetric signatures, we define d-admissibility and d-realizability for general signatures, and give a characterizationof 2-admissibility.
