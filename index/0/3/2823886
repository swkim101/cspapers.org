As online fraudsters invest more resources, including purchasing large pools of fake user accounts and dedicated IPs, fraudulent attacks become less obvious and their detection becomes increasingly challenging. Existing approaches such as average degree maximization suffer from the bias of including more nodes than necessary, resulting in lower accuracy and increased need for manual verification. Hence, we propose HoloScope, which introduces a novel metric "contrast suspiciousness" integrating information from graph topology and spikes to more accurately detect fraudulent users and objects. Contrast suspiciousness dynamically emphasizes the contrast patterns between fraudsters and normal users, making HoloScope capable of distinguishing the synchronized and anomalous behaviors of fraudsters on topology, bursts and drops, and rating scores. In addition, we provide theoretical bounds for how much this increases the time cost needed for fraudsters to conduct adversarial attacks. Moreover, HoloScope has a concise framework and sub-quadratic time complexity, making the algorithm reproducible and scalable. Extensive experiments showed that HoloScope achieved significant accuracy improvements on synthetic and real data, compared with state-of-the-art fraud detection methods.
