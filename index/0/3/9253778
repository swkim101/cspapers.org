We have implemented a peer-grading system for review of student assignments over the World-Wide Web and used it in approximately eight computer-science courses. Students prepare their assignments and submit them to our Peer Grader (PG) system. Other students are then assigned to review and grade the assignments. The system allows authors and reviewers to communicate with authors being able to update their submissions. Unique features of our approach include the ability to submit arbitrary sets of Web pages for review, and mechanisms for encouraging careful review of submissions. We have used the system to produce high-quality compilations of student work. Our assignment cycle consists of six phases, from signing up for an assignment to Web publishing of the final result. Based upon our experience with PG, we offer suggestions for improving the system to make it more easily usable by students at all levels.
