Full-drive encryption (FDE) is especially important for mobile devices because they contain large quantities of sensitive data yet are easily lost or stolen. Unfortunately, the standard approach to FDE-the AES block cipher in XTS mode-is 3--5× slower than unencrypted storage. Authenticated encryption based on stream ciphers is already used as a faster alternative to AES in other contexts, such as HTTPS, but the conventional wisdom is that stream ciphers are unsuitable for FDE. Used naively in drive encryption, stream ciphers are vulnerable to attacks, and mitigating these attacks with on-drive metadata is generally believed to ruin performance. In this paper, we argue that recent developments in mobile hardware invalidate this assumption, making it possible to use fast stream ciphers for FDE. Modern mobile devices employ solid-state storage with Flash Translation Layers (FTL), which operate similarly to Log-structured File Systems (LFS). They also include trusted hardware such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and secure storage areas. Leveraging these two trends, we propose StrongBox, a stream cipher-based FDE layer that is a drop-in replacement for dm-crypt, the standard Linux FDE module based on AES-XTS. StrongBox introduces a system design and on-drive data structures that exploit LFS»s lack of overwrites to avoid costly rekeying and a counter stored in trusted hardware to protect against attacks. We implement StrongBox on an ARM big.LITTLE mobile processor and test its performance under multiple popular production LFSes. We find that StrongBox improves read performance by as much as 2.36× (1.72× on average) while offering stronger integrity guarantees.
