In this paper, a homography-based approach for determining the ground plane using image pairs is presented. Our approach is unique in that it uses a Modified Expectation Maximization algorithm to cluster pixels on images as belonging to one of two possible classes: ground and non-ground pixels. This classification is very useful in mobile robot navigation because, by segmenting out the ground plane, we are left with all possible objects in the scene, which can then be used to implement many mobile robot navigation algorithms such as obstacle avoidance, path planning, target following, landmark detection, etc. Specifically, we demonstrate the usefulness and robustness of our approach by applying it to a target following algorithm. As the results section shows, the proposed algorithm for ground plane detection achieves an almost perfect detection rate (over 99%) despite the relatively higher number of errors in pixel correspondence from the feature matching algorithm used: SIFT.
