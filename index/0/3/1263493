United Aircraft Research Laboratories recently completed a two-year joint study with International Business Machines Corporation for investigating the application of Graphic Data Processing to 3-dimensional geometric manipulation. The joint study developed a prototype experimental system making it possible to investigate several problem areas. For example, techniques were investigated for storing within the computer 3-dimensional descriptions of objects. Crucial to such techniques is a data structure, in which is embedded information which can be quickly retrieved, thus avoiding time-consuming serial searches.
