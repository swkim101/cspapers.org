A system to retrieve images using a syntactic description of appearance is presented. A multi-scale invariant wxtor representation is obtained by first filtering images in the database with Gaussian derivative filters at several acalea and then computing low order differential invariants. The multi-scale representation is indexed for rapid retrieval. Queries are designed by the users horn an example image by eelecting appropriate regions. The invariant xnxtors corrmponding to these regions are matched with those in the database both in feature space as well M in coordinate space and a match score is obtained for each image. The results are then displayed to the user sorted by the match score. I?kom experiments conducted with ovsr 1500 images it is shown that imagee similar in appearance and whose viewpoint is within 25 degrees of the query image can be retrieved with an average precision of 57%
