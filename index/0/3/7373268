Recently deployed Wireless Sensor Network systems (WSNs) are increasingly following <i>heterogeneous</i> designs, incorporating a mixture of elements with widely varying capabilities. The development and deployment of WSNs rides heavily on the availability of simulation, emulation, visualization and analysis support. In this work, we develop tools specifically to support <i>heterogeneous</i> systems, as well as to support the measurement and visualization of <i>operational</i> systems that is critical to addressing the inevitable problems that crop up in deployment. Our system differs from related systems in three key ways: in its ability to simulate and emulate <i>heterogeneous</i> systems in their entirety, in its extensive support for integration and interoperability between motes and microservers, and in its unified set of tools that capture, view, and analyze real time debugging information from simulations, emulations, and deployments.
