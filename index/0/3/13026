We present a new delay model for use in logic synthesis. A traditional model treats the area of a library cell as constant and makes the cell's delay a linear function of load. Out model is based on a different, but equally fundamental linearity in the equation relating area, delay, and load: namely, we may keep a cell's delay constantly making its area a linear function of load. This allows us to technology map using a library with continuous device sizing, satisfies certain electrical noise and power constraints, and in certain cases is computationally simpler than a traditional model. We give results to support these claims. A companion paper uses the computational simplicity to explore a wide search space of algebraic factorings in a mapped network.
