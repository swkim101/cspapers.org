As a potential alternative for radio frequency (RF) technology, visible light communication (VLC) has received significant attention recently. In contrast to RF technologies, VLC can enable secure and interference-free wireless links due to the directional and short-range natures of visible light. We demonstrate COBRA [1], a special form of VLC for off-the-shelf smartphone systems, which can be potentially used in scenarios like contactless mobile advertisement/payment (e.g., in retail stores and museums) and data exchange between smartphones. COBRA is designed to offer a secure, intuitive, and easyto-use communication interface without the reliance on additional wireless interfaces or the Internet infrastructure. We develop a new 2D color barcode (as shown in Fig. 1) for COBRA that is optimized for streaming between small-size screen and low-speed camera of smartphones. As shown in Fig. 2, COBRA adapts the size and layout of code blocks in streamed barcodes to deal with the significant image blur in mobile environments, and adopts new image processing techniques such as fast corner detection to achieve real-time barcode stream decoding.
