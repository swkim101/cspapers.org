Industry today has a severe problem in the automatic testing of analog cards. At the Air Force Institute of Technology, we are developing an Expert System based on the structure and function of an analog circuit card to drive automatic test equipment. This system uses the information contained in the schematic diagram of the circuit as well as fundamental knowledge of electronics and past experience in maintaining the card. One of the most important aspects of this system is its ability to reason about possible faults based upon the function of the sub-sections of the circuit. This task is accomplished using the type of "second principles" which an electronic engineer would use.
