Since larger n-gram Language Model (LM) usually performs better in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), how to construct efficient large LM is an important topic in SMT. However, most of the existing LM growing methods need an extra monolingual corpus, where additional LM adaption technology is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network based bilingual LM growing method, only using the bilingual parallel corpus in SMT. The results show that our method can improve both the perplexity score for LM evaluation and BLEU score for SMT, and significantly outperforms the existing LM growing methods without extra corpus.
