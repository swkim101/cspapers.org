In this paper we study how verbs are visually conveyed in daily communication contexts for both young and old adults. Four visual modes are compared: a single static image, a panel of four static images, an animation, and a video clip. The results reveal age effects, as well as performance differences introduced by lexical verb properties and visual cues. We also suggest guidelines for visual verb creation.
