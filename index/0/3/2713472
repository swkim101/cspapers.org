The proliferation of information networks, as a means of sharing information, has raised privacy concerns for enterprises who manage such networks and for individual users that participate in such networks. For enterprises, the main challenge is to satisfy two competing goals: releasing network data for useful data analysis and also preserving the identities or sensitive relationships of the individuals participating in the network. Individual users, on the other hand, require personalized methods that increase their awareness of the visibility of their private information.
 This tutorial provides a systematic survey of the problems and state-of-the-art methods related to both enterprise and personalized privacy in information networks. The tutorial discusses privacy threats, privacy attacks, and privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored specifically to network data.
