The paper presents a survey of the six-legged walking robot designed and constructed at the Institute of Mechanics at the Technical University in Munich. This robot was designed in 1993 with special regard for principles found in natural walking of hexapods, which walk and climb very efficiently over arbitrary irregular surfaces. The investigated insect and its main features are presented. A description of the mechanical hardware and electronics used in the robot is included.<<ETX>>
