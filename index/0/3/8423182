Delivery is an essential task for a mobile robot. Automatically guided vehicles play a crucial role in many factories by performing delivery tasks. The next step involves having mobile robots work in populated environments, such as offices, hospitals, and health care facilities. This paper proposes a service robot that can deliver parcels, letters or documents in such an environment. The design policy, architecture, methodology and implementation of this system are presented.
