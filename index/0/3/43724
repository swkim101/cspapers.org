We present a novel, efficient and flexible scheme to generate a high quality mesh that approximates the outer boundary of a swept volume. Our approach comes with two guarantees. First, the approximation is conservative, i.e., the swept volume is enclosed by the generated mesh. Second, the one-sided Hausdorff distance of the generated mesh to the swept volume is upper bounded by a user defined tolerance. Exploiting this tolerance the algorithm generates a mesh that is adapted to the local complexity of the swept volume boundary, keeping the overall output complexity remarkably low. The algorithm is two-phased: the actual sweep and the mesh generation. In the sweeping phase we introduce a general framework to compute a compressed voxelization. The phase is tailored for an easy application of parallelization techniques. We show this for our exemplary implementation and provide a multi-core solution as well as a GPU based solution using CUDA. The meshing phase utilizes Delaunay refinement which we carefully modified such that required guarantees are met. The approach is able to handle inputs of very high complexity at desired precision, which we demonstrate on real industrial data sets.
