This paper describes a constrained bin-packing problem (CBPP) and an approximate, anytime algorithm for solutions. A CBPP is a constrained version of the bin-packing problem, in which a set of items allocated to a bin are ordered in a way to satisfy constraints defined on them and achieve near-optimality. The algorithm for CBPP uses a heuristic search for labeling edges with a binary value, together with a beam search and constraint propagation. Some experimental results are provided. This algorithm has been successfully applied to industrial-scale scheduling problems.
