Embedded systems are increasingly becoming connected through wireless networking. These devices now form the basis of many of today's consumer products including cell phones and video game controllers. In the "Software for Embedded Systems" class in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, we used the design of a multi-player video game as motivation for the principal concepts in wireless embedded systems. Each student in the class designed an accelerometer-based game controller and then, the class as a whole, developed a multi-player video game that allowed 28 players (the number of students in the course) to play simultaneously. In this paper, we first describe the context of the course and its goals followed by the hardware/software platform we used to realize the game controller. We then detail the pedagogical approach we used to collectively design the video game (loosely based on soccer) and conclude with the lessons learned from this group design experience and how we would enhance the project and course in the future.
