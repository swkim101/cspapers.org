A two-step optimization strategy for relational schemas that contains a class of inclusion dependencies is described. Both steps take into account additional information that indicates how to preserve each inclusion dependency in the presence of insertions anâ€˜d deletioy. The first step eliminates inclusion dependencies which are redundant with respect to both the semantics of the data and the behavior of the transactions. The second step discards dependencies through a structural transformation that again preserves the semantics of the data and of the transactions and that applies both to ihrF and to iV# relational schemas.
