The semantic Web is a promising future Web environment. In order to realize the semantic Web, the semantic annotation should be widely available. The studies for generating the semantic annotation do not provide a solution to the 'document evolution' requirement which is to maintain the consistency between semantic annotations and Web pages. In this paper, we propose an efficient solution to the requirement, that is to separately generate the long-term annotation and the short-term annotation. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms an existing approach which is the most efficient among the automatic approaches based on static Web pages.
