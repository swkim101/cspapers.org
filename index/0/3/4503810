In a mobile computing environment, a user carrying a portable computer can execute a mobile t11m,,Â· action by submitting the ope.rations of the transaction to distributed data servers from different locations. M a result of this mobility, the operations of the transaction may be executed at different servers. The distribution oC operations implies that the transmission of messages (such as those involved in a two phase commit protocol) may be required among these data servers in order to coordinate the execution ofthese operations. In this paper, we will address the distribution oC operations that update partitioned data in mobile environments. We show that, for operations pertaining to resource allocation, the message overhead (e.g., for a 2PC protocol) introduced by the distribution of operations is undesirable and unnecessary. We introduce a new algorithm, the RenlnJation Algorithm (RA), that does not necessitate the incurring of message overheads Cor the commitment of mobile transactions. We address two issues related to the RA algorithm: a termination protocol and a protocol for non_partition.commutotive operation". We perform a comparison between the proposed RA algorithm and existing solutions that use a 2PC protocol.
