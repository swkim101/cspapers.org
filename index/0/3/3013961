An approach to the use of machine generated contextual knowledge for the analysis of diagnostic behavior in medicine has been developed. The approach is illustrated by reference to EXAMINER, a system whose contextual knowledge is derived through use of the INTERNIST data base and diagnostic system[I]. EXAMINER acquires a user's characterization of a medical case in light of this contextual knowledge and analyzes it to generate commentary regarding notable aspects of the user's characterization.
