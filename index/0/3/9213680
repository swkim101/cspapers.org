An important goal of modern linguistic theory is to characterize as narrowly as possible the class of natural languages. One classical approach to this characterization has been to investigate the generative capacity of grammatical systems specifiable within particular linguistic theories. Formal results along these lines have already been obtained for certain kinds of Transformational Generat ive Grammars: for example, Peters and Ritchie 1973a showed that the theory of Transformational Grammar presented in Chomsky's Aspects of the Theory of Syntax 1965 is powerful enough to allow the specification of grammars for generating any recursively enumerable language, while Rounds 1973,1975 extended this work by demonstrating that moderate ly restricted Transformat ional Grammars (TGs) can generate languages whose recognition time is provably exponential. 1
