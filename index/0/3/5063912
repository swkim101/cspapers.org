This technical report describes how to download, compile and use the C++ source code of the dependency-tree estimation of distribution algorithm, which uses dependency trees to model promising solutions and sample the new ones. Candidate solutions are represented by fixed-length strings with a finite number of values in each string position (the code is not restricted to binary strings). The report also describes how to modify the code to solve new optimization problems. Additional documentation can be found in the provided software package, which includes a detailed documentation in PDF, HTML, and LTEX formats.
