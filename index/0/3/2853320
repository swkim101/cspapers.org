With the tremendous increase in multimedia content on the Web and in corporate intranets, discovering hidden meaning in raw multimedia is becoming one of the biggest challenges. Analysing multimedia content is still in its infancy, requires expert knowledge, and the few available products are associated with excessive price tags, while still not delivering sufficient quality for many tasks. This makes it hard, especially for small and medium-size enterprises, to make use of this technology. In addition analysis components typically operate in isolation and do not consider the context (e.g. embedding text) of a media resource. This paper presents how MICO tries to address these problems by providing an open source service platform, that allows to analyse media in context and includes various analysis engines for video, images, audio, text, link structure and metadata.
