We present a fast, space efficient and non-heuristic method for calculating the decision function of polynomial kernel classifiers for NLP applications. We apply the method to the MaltParser system, resulting in a Java parser that parses over 50 sentences per second on modest hardware without loss of accuracy (a 30 time speedup over existing methods). The method implementation is available as the open-source splitSVM Java library.
