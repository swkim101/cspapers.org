We introduce two mechanisms for scaling computations in the framework of temporal reasoning. The first one addresses abstraction at the methodological level. Operators are defined that engender flexible switching between different granularities of temporal representation structures. The second one accounts for abstractions at the interface level of a temporal reasoning engine. Various generalizations of temporal relations are introduced that approximate more fine-grained representations by abstracting away irrelevant details.
