This paper presents a novel optimal control strategy combining control Lyapunov function (CLF) based quadratic programs with impedance control, with the goal of improving both tracking performance and the stability of controllers implemented on transfemoral prosthesis. CLF based quadratic programs have the inherent capacity to optimally track a desired trajectory. This property is used in congruence with impedance control - implemented as a feedforward term - to realize significantly small tracking errors, while simultaneously yielding bipedal walking that is both stable and robust to disturbances. Moreover, instead of experimentally validating this on human subjects, a virtual prosthesis is attached to a robotic testbed, AMBER. The authors claim that the walking of AMBER is human like and therefore form a suitable substitute to human subjects on which a prosthetic control can be tested. Based on this idea, the proposed controller was first verified in simulation, then tested on the physical robot AMBER. The results indicate improved tracking performance, stability, and robustness to unknown disturbances.
