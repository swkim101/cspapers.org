The detection of spatially-varying blur without having any information about the blur type is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel effective approach to address this blur detection problem from a single image without requiring any knowledge about the blur type, level, or camera settings. Our approach computes blur detection maps based on a novel High-frequency multiscale Fusion and Sort Transform (HiFST) of gradient magnitudes. The evaluations of the proposed approach on a diverse set of blurry images with different blur types, levels, and contents demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.
