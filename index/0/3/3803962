A new method for keyword extraction from conversations is introduced, which preserves the diversity of topics that are mentioned. Inspired from summarization, the method maximizes the coverage of topics that are recognized automatically in transcripts of conversation fragments. The method is evaluated on excerpts of the Fisher and AMI corpora, using a crowdsourcing platform to elicit comparative relevance judgments. The results demonstrate that the method outperforms two competitive baselines.
