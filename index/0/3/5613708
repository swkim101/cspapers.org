The theme of this year of the International Conference on Software Engineering is about "Developing Dependable Software", acknowledging the fact that our lives depend directly on several complex software-based systems. The Internet connects and enables a growing list of critical activities from which people expect services and revenues. They should be able to trust these systems to provide data and elaborations with a degree of confidentiality, integrity, and availability compatible with their needs. The pervasiveness of software products in the creation of critical infrastructures has raised the value of trustworthiness and new efforts should be dedicated to achieve it. Yet, nowadays almost every application has some kind of security requirement even if its use is not to be considered critical.
