Degraded text recognition is a difficult task. Given a noisy text image, a word recognizer can be applied to generate several candidates for each word image. High-level knowledge sources can then be used to select a decision from the candidate set for each word image. In this paper, we propose that visual inter-word constraints can be used to facilitate candidate selection. Visual inter-word constraints provide a way to link word images inside the text page, and to interpret them systematically.
