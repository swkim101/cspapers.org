We study the problem of finding small trees. Classical network design problems are considered with the additional constraint that only a specified number k of nodes are required to be connected in the solution. A prototypical example is the kMST problem in which we require a tree of minimum weight spanning at least k nodes in an edge-weighted graph. We show that the kMST problem is NP-hard even for points in the Euclidean plane. We provide approximation algorithms with performance ratio 2v/ for the general edge-weighted case and O(k1/4) for the case of points in the plane. Polynomial-time exact solutions are also presented for the class of treewidth-bounded graphs, which includes trees, series-parallel graphs, and bounded bandwidth graphs, and for points on the boundary of a convex region in the Euclidean plane. We also investigate the problem of finding short trees and, more generally, that of finding networks with minimum diameter. A simple technique is used to provide a polynomiM-time solution for finding k-trees of minimum diameter. We identify easy and hard problems arising in finding short networks using a framework due to T. C. Hu.
