OpenFlow is the first standardization of Software Defined Networks. OpenFlow approach, however, has number of limitations: it restricts its use within a single-domain, it is not scalable, and it does not adapt well to changes in local environments. We evaluate the number of approaches to solve these limitations, and propose DAIM model (Distributed Active information Model) which can be integrated into the OpenFlow structure at the level of the switches to provide a reactive interpreter that will manage the flow tables autonomically.
