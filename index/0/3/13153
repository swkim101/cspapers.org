We consider the problem of depth estimation from a single monocular image in this work. It is a challenging task as no reliable depth cues are available, e.g., stereo correspondences, motions etc. Previous efforts have been focusing on exploiting geometric priors or additional sources of information, with all using hand-crafted features. Recently, there is mounting evidence that features from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are setting new records for various vision applications. On the other hand, considering the continuous characteristic of the depth values, depth estimations can be naturally formulated into a continuous conditional random field (CRF) learning problem. Therefore, we in this paper present a deep convolutional neural field model for estimating depths from a single image, aiming to jointly explore the capacity of deep CNN and continuous CRF. Specifically, we propose a deep structured learning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise potentials of continuous CRF in a unified deep CNN framework. The proposed method can be used for depth estimations of general scenes with no geometric priors nor any extra information injected. In our case, the integral of the partition function can be analytically calculated, thus we can exactly solve the log-likelihood optimization. Moreover, solving the MAP problem for predicting depths of a new image is highly efficient as closed-form solutions exist. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art depth estimation methods on both indoor and outdoor scene datasets.
