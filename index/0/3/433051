This paper introduces a methodology for avoiding obstacles by controlling the robot's velocity. Contemporary approaches to obstacle avoidance usually dictate a detour from the originally planned trajectory to its goal position. In our previous work, we presented a method for predicting the motion of obstacles, and how to make use of this prediction when planning the robot trajectory to its goal position. This is extended in the current paper by also using this prediction to decide if the robot should change its speed to avoid an obstacle more effectively. The robot can choose to move at three different speeds: slow, normal and fast. A hierarchical partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) controls the robot movement. The POMDP formulation is not altered to accommodate for the three different speeds, to avoid the increase of the size of the state space. Instead, a modified solution of POMDPs is used.
