In this paper we describe a rule-based approach to semantic specification that can be used to establish semantic agreement between a source and receiver. Query processing techniques use these specifications along with conversion routines and query modification to guarantee correct data semantics. This work also examines the effect of changing data semantics. These changes may occur at the source of the data or they may be changes in the specifications of the dat,a semantics for the application, Methods are described for detecting these changes and for determining if the database can continue to supply meaningful data to the application. These methods for semanlic reconcilia2ion are necessary for determining logical connectivity between a data source (database) and a data receiver (application). Though described in terms of the source-receiver model, these techniques can also be used for semantic reconciliation and schema integration for multidatabase systems.
