In this paper, we present a generalized transition-based parsing framework where parsers are instantiated in terms of a set of control parameters that constrain transitions between parser states. This generalization provides a uniÔ¨Åed framework to describe and compare various transition-based parsing approaches from both a theoretical and empirical perspective. This includes well-known transition systems, but also previously unstudied systems.
