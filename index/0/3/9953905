A new approach to nanoscale MOSFETs electrical characteristics calculating, the essence of which is the use of adjustment factors, as well as parameter values of classic driftdiffusion models, which would effectively take into account the quantum-mechanical transport mechanisms is proposed. A modified direct search method of drift-diffusion model optimization for MOSFET with a 90 nm channel length is developed and used.
