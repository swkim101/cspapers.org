We present a global joint model for lemmatization and part-of-speech prediction. Using only morphological lexicons and unlabeled data, we learn a partially-supervised part-of-speech tagger and a lemmatizer which are combined using features on a dynamically linked dependency structure of words. We evaluate our model on English, Bulgarian, Czech, and Slovene, and demonstrate substantial improvements over both a direct transduction approach to lemmatization and a pipelined approach, which predicts part-of-speech tags before lemmatization.
