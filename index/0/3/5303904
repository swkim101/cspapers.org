The vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an emerging type of network which enables vehicles on roads to inter-communicate for driving safety. The basic idea is to allow arbitrary vehicles to broadcast ad hoc messages (e.g. traffic accidents) to other vehicles. However, this raises the concern of security and privacy. Messages should be signed and verified before they are trusted while the real identity of vehicles should not be revealed, but traceable by authorized party. Existing solutions either rely too heavily on a tamper-proof hardware device, or do not have an effective message verification scheme. In this paper, we propose a multiple level authentication scheme which still makes use of tamper-proof devices but the strong assumption that a long-term system master secret is preloaded into all tamper-proof devices is removed. Instead the master secret can be updated if needed to increase the security level. On the other hand, messages sent by vehicles are classified into two types - regular messages and urgent messages. Regular messages can be verified by neighboring vehicles by means of Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) while urgent messages can only be verified with the aid of RSUs nearby by means of a conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme.
