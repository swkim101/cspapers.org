The semantics of rich multimedia presentations in the web such as SMIL, SVG, and Flash cannot or only to a very limited extend be understood by search engines today. This hampers the retrieval of such presentations and makes their archival and management a difficult task. Existing metadata models and metadata standards are either conceptually too narrow, focus on a specific media type only, cannot be used and combined together, or are not practically applicable for the semantic description of rich multimedia presentations.
 In this paper, we propose the Multimedia Metadata Ontology (M3O) for annotating rich, structured multimedia presentations. The M3O provides a generic modeling framework for representing sophisticated multimedia metadata. It allows for integrating the features provided by the existing metadata models and metadata standards. Our approach bases on Semantic Web technologies and can be easily integrated with multimedia formats such as the W3C standards SMIL and SVG. With the M3O, we unlock the semantics of rich multimedia presentations in the web by making the semantics machine-readable and machine-understandable. The M3O is used with our SemanticMM4U framework for the multi-channel generation of semantically-rich multimedia presentations.
