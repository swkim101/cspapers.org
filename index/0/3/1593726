As the volume of legacy software grows, how have we grown in our ability to leverage this legacy -- or, for that matter, is it worth the effort? Is legacy software a hoard of useful information and behavior -- or is it a ball and chain, something you should cut loose if you want to make progress? Legacy constraints often seem immense and burdensome -- but, do they always need to be? Is object-oriented legacy software spaghetti code -- or is it more like ravioli? Do agile methods embrace or reject the use of the legacy.
