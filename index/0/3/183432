Database systems for electrical engineering design should provide engineers with a mechanism for sharing the design data stored by the system and with consistent and sometimes restricted views of the data stored by the system. The goals of data sharing and data consistency are often in direct opposition. We propose a context mechanism that supports sharing of design data, in a manner controlled by the engineers themselves, while automatically maintaining individual, locally consistent views of the design data.
