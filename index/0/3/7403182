In this paper, a modified entropy-based algorithm is proposed for identification and reconstruction of a complex weld geometry. The edge of the weld geometry is identified based on minimizing a modified entropy-type cost function, and the weld geometry is reconstructed based on the detected edge. In addition, the volume of the weld geometry is computed using the point cloud samples of the identified weld geometry, and the effects of Gaussian noise are also considered. Our simulation results using the proposed reconstruction algorithm demonstrate efficient identification and reconstruction of a complex weld geometry in the presence of Gaussian noise.
