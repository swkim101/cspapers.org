The parameterized computational complexity of a collection of well-known problems including: BANDWIDTH, PRECEDENCE CONSTRAINED MULTIPROCESSOR SCHEDULING, LONGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE, DNA PHYSICAL MAPPING (or INTERNALIZING COLORED GRAPHS), PERFECT PHYLOGENY (or TRIANGULATING COLORED GRAPHS), COLORED CUTWIDTH, and FEASIBLE REGISTER ASSIGNMENT is explored. It is shown that these problems are hard for various levels of the W hierarchy. In the case of PRECEDENCE CONSTRAINED MULTIPROCESSOR SCHEDULING the results can be interpreted as providing substantial new complexity lower bounds on the outcome of [OPEN 8] of the Garey and Johnson list.
