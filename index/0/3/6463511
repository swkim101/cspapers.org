We explore the nature of traffic in data centers, designed to support the mining of massive data sets. We instrument the servers to collect socket-level logs, with negligible performance impact. In a 1500 server operational cluster, we thus amass roughly a petabyte of measurements over two months, from which we obtain and report detailed views of traffic and congestion conditions and patterns. We further consider whether traffic matrices in the cluster might be obtained instead via tomographic inference from coarser-grained counter data.
