An algorithm is presented for designing relational views over network schemas to: (1) support general query and update capability, (2) preserve the information content of the data base and (3) provide independence from its physical organization. The proposed solution is applicable to many existing CODASYL databases without data or schema conversion. The particular declarations of a CODASYL schema which supply sources of logical data definition are first identified. Then the view design algorithm is derived on the basis of a formal analysis of the semantic constraints established by these declarations. A new form of data structure diagram is also introduced to visualize these constraints.
