DNA electronics circuits require an efficient way to accurately position and individually manipulate DNA molecules. The recent development of atomic force microscopy (AFM) seems to be a promising solution. We have recently developed an AFM based augmented reality system. This new system can provide both real-time force feedback and real-time visual feedback during nanomanipulation. We have shown that nano-imprinting and manipulation of nano-particles and nano-rods can be easily performed under assistance of the augmented reality system. In this research, the system's ability is extended to manipulation of DNA molecules. Using a polynomial fitting method, the deformation of DNA molecules is displayed in real time in the augmented reality system during manipulation. Indeed, DNA molecules adopt many different structures including kinks, bends, bulges and distortions. These different structures and inappropriate physical contacts may result in the controversy of DNA conductivity reported over the last decade. The AFM based nanomanipulation system can be used either as a nanolithography tool to make small gap electrodes or a nanomanipulation tool to elongate, deform and cut DNA molecules. The measurement of the conductivity of DNA molecules in their different shapes and structures is a promising method to find conclusive evidences, which verify the electrical conductivity of DNA molecules.
