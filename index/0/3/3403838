Many software engineering students make the transition from an academic setting to professional software development careers. Due to its popularity in the software industry, it is important for students to learn software testing skills and adhere to professional practices to prepare them for their transition and be successful. Software testing is an important skill for students but there are many different approaches that enables students to gain this skill. We created a unique approach that enables students to learn software testing with a unique mentality and developed a tool to make educational assessments and feedback quick and scalable. Our approach is implemented within an undergraduate classroom where students are separated into two groups. Each group develops software tests through Test-Driven Development (TDD) with a different mentality. With this approach, we hope to see an improvement in the quality of software that students produce.
