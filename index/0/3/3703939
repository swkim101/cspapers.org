In order to help students learning to develop computer programs, several computing education researchers have analyzed the compiler error messages generated by novices' attempts to compile their programs. The goal is to help students diagnose the errors they make through the messages generated by the compiler. This paper builds on that previous work by applying a technique based on a heuristic well-known to programmers - fix the first error and ignore the rest - to the analysis of over 21 million compiler error messages from the Blackbox dataset. We find that the ranks and frequencies obtained by considering all error messages are generally consistent with previously published lists, but when we consider first messages only, these ranks and frequencies are different. These differences could have important implications for teaching, and can inform tool design and future research efforts.
