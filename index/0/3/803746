IntoNow is a mobile application that provides a second-screen experience to television viewers. IntoNow uses the microphone of the companion device to sample the audio coming from the TV set, and compares it against a database of TV shows in order to identify the program being watched. The system we demonstrate is activated by IntoNow for specific types of shows. It retrieves information related to the program the user is watching by using closed captions, which are provided by each broadcasting network along the TV signal. It then matches the stream of closed captions in real-time against multiple sources of content. More specifically, during news programs it displays links to online news articles and the profiles of people and organizations in the news, and during music shows it displays links to songs. The matching models are machine-learned from editorial judgments, and tuned to achieve approximately 90% precision.
