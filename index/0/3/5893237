Exploring Computer Science (ECS) is a high school introductory computer science class designed to increase student interest in CS. Utah is the first state to offer ECS statewide and use it to meet a high school graduation requirement. Over the past four years, 150 teachers have been trained as Utah ECS teachers and over 10,000 Utah students have taken the class. The Utah initiative is unique because it is the first to deploy ECS in a non-urban environment and with a modified half-year curriculum that includes no additional equipment costs. This paper discusses how the Utah deployment was organized, reports its results and unique difficulties, and offers lessons for deployments with similar characteristics: statewide, rural, and limited resources.
