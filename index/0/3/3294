This paper proposes the use of optical flow from 
a moving robot to provide force feedback to 
an operatorâ€™s joystick to facilitate collision free 
teleoperation. Optical flow is measured by a 
pair of wide angle cameras on board the vehicle 
and used to generate a virtual environmental 
force that is reflected to the user through 
the joystick, as well as feeding back into the 
control of the vehicle. We show that the proposed 
control is dissipative and prevents the 
vehicle colliding with the environment as well 
as providing the operator with a natural feel 
for the remote environment. Experimental results 
are provided on the InsectBot holonomic 
vehicle platform.
