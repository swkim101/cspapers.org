We present an approach for building multidocument event threads from a large corpus of newswire articles. An event thread is basically a succession of events belonging to the same story. It helps the reader to contextualize the information contained in a single article, by navigating backward or forward in the thread from this article. A specific effort is also made on the detection of reactions to a particular event. In order to build these event threads, we use a cascade of classifiers and other modules, taking advantage of the redundancy of information in the newswire corpus. We also share interesting comments concerning our manual annotation procedure for building a training and testing set 1 .
