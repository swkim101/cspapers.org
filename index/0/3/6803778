This paper presents the notion of problem-oriented object memory, and its realization in a distributed object-based programming system, Penumbra. This system allows location transparent object invocation, object migration and caching. Its distinguishing feature, however, is its support for problem-oriented object sharing.Problem-oriented object memory is an object model that allows exploitation of application specific semantics by relaxing strict consistency in favour of performance.Our work addresses the problem of achieving scalability of shared write-intensive data in an environment of networked workstations. We have successfully applied the presented ideas to the management of a highly demanding telecoms application.
