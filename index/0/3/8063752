We propose a framework which can perform Web page segmentation with a structured prediction approach. It formulates the segmentation task as a structured labeling problem on a transformed Web page segmentation graph (WPS-graph). WPS-graph models the candidate segmentation boundaries of a page and the dependency relation among the adjacent segmentation boundaries. Each labeling scheme on the WPS-graph corresponds to a possible segmentation of the page. The task of finding the optimal labeling of the WPS-graph is transformed into a binary Integer Linear Programming problem, which considers the entire WPS-graph as a whole to conduct structured prediction. A learning algorithm based on the structured output Support Vector Machine framework is developed to determine the feature weights, which is capable to consider the inter-dependency among candidate segmentation boundaries. Furthermore, we investigate its efficacy in supporting the development of automatic Web page classification.
