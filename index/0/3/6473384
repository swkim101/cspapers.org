A simulation model of concurrent updates in a database system is presented. This model is used, to answer the following questions: How frequent are deadlocks in certain environments? What about concurrency and wait-time of user processes as a function of the synchronization method used? In case of a deadlock what are useful criteria to select the process to be rolled back? How many checkpoints make sense?
