There are about 8% of men and 0.8% of women suffering from colorblindness. Due to certain loss of color information, the existing image search techniques may not provide satisfactory results for these users. In this demonstration, we show an image search system that can accommodate colorblind users. It can help these special users find and enjoy what they want by providing multiple services for them, including search results reranking, image recoloring and color indication.
