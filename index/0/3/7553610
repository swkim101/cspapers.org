Integer division remains expensive on today's processors as thecost of integer multiplication declines. We present code sequences fordivision by arbitrary nonzero integer constants and run-time invariantsusing integer multiplication. The algorithms assume a two's complementarchitecture. Most also require that the upper half of an integerproduct be quickly accessible. We treat unsigned division, signeddivision where the quotient rounds towards zero, signed division wherethe quotient rounds towards <inline-equation><f>-âˆž</f><?Pub Caret></inline-equation>, and division where the result is known<?Pub Fmt italic>a priori<?Pub Fmt /italic> to be exact. We give someimplementation results using the C compiler GCC.
