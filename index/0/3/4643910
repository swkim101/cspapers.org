We present a novel approach to the problem of autonomously recognizing and unfolding articles of clothing using a dual manipulator. The problem consists of grasping an article from a random point, recognizing it and then bringing it into an unfolded state. We propose a data-driven method for clothes recognition from depth images using Random Decision Forests. We also propose a method for unfolding an article of clothing after estimating and grasping two key-points, using Hough forests. Both methods are implemented into a POMDP framework allowing the robot to interact optimally with the garments, taking into account uncertainty in the recognition and point estimation process. This active recognition and unfolding makes our system very robust to noisy observations. Our methods were tested on regular-sized clothes using a dual-arm manipulator and an Xtion depth sensor. We achieved 100% accuracy in active recognition and 93.3% unfolding success rate, while our system operates faster compared to the state of the art.
