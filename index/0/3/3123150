Hume is a programming language targeted at safety-critical, resource-bounded systems. Bounded time and space usage is achieved by a clear separation of coordination and computation in the design of the language. However, there is no correctness verification. Such verification is imperative in safety-critical environments. It is our contention that the language design makes a combination of deductive and algorithmic reasoning tractable.
