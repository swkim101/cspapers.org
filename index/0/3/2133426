Information retrieval @R) is the task of detecting information relevant to a user query in a large collection of documents. When the documents are of essentially unrestricted text (e.g. newspaper articles, technical reports, patent applications, etc.), full text retrieval techniques are used. Nearly all commercial and most research full-text IR systems rely on identifying key terms within documents which can then be matched with similar terms in the user query. The accuracy of the system is therefore related to the accuracy with which a set of terms represents the content of a document. The accuracy of this representation depends critically upon the foilowing three factors: (1) extracting/selecting appropriate terms from the documents; [2) balancing term contributions to the representation by assigning ‘correct’ significance weights; and (3) exploiting any inter-term dependencies, both within a document and across the cdlection. In this paper we concentrate’on (I) and (2): we use natural language processing techniques to identify classes of terms for which differential weighting schemes may be used. At the same time, our focus here is on exploring the usefulness of ‘shallow’ NLP methods, as opposed to more
