The recommendations of the Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula 2001 encompass suggestions for an object-first introductory programming course. We have identified conceptual modeling as a lacking perspective in the suggestions for CS1. Conceptual modeling is the defining characteristic of object-orientation and provides a unifying perspective and a pedagogical approach focusing upon the modelling aspects of object-orientation. Reinforcing conceptual modelling as a basis for CS1 provides an appealing course structure based on core elements from a conceptual framework for object-orientation as well as a systematic approach to programming; both of these are a big help to newcomers. The approach has a very positive impact on the number of students passing the course.
