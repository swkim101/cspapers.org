This paper proposes an intelligent robotic wheelchair with user-friendly human-computer interface (HCI) based on electromyogram (EMG) signal, face directional gesture, and voice. The user's intention is transfered to the wheelchair via the HCI, and then the wheelchair is controlled to the intended direction. Additionally, the wheelchair can detect and avoid obstacles autonomously using sonar sensors. By combining HCI into the autonomous functions, it performs safe and reliable motions while considering the user's intention. The experimental results in the crowded environment show that the proposed robotic wheelchair is feasible for the disabled and the elderly with severe motor disabilities.
