Akinetic data structure(KDS) maintains an attribute of interest in a system of geometric objects undergoing continuous motion. In this paper we develop a concentual framework for kinetic data structures, we propose a number of criteria for the quality of such structures, and we describe a number of fundamental techniques for their design. We illustrate these general concepts by presenting kinetic data structures for maintaining the convex hull and the closest pair of moving points in the plane; these structures behave well according to the proposed quality criteria for KDSs.
