Methods for modeling, simulating and optimizing the dynamics, stability and performance of legged robot locomotion are discussed in this paper. It is demonstrated how these tools are used in the design, implementation and operation of a humanoid robot. The selection and integration of fundamental hard- and software needed for autonomous operation and high agility is presented for a recently developed fully-actuated 17 DoF humanoid. The results are additionally reported form simulations and gait optimizations completed during its development using a 3D dynamic biped model coupled with multiple physical and stability constraints.
