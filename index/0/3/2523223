Loged virtural memory (LVM) provides a log of writes to one or more specified regions of the virtual address space. Logging is useful for applications that require rollback and/or persistence such as parallel simulations and memory-mapped object-oriented databases. It can also be used for output, debugging and distributed consistency maintenance. This paper describes logged virtual memory as an extension of the standard virtual memory system software and hardware, our prototype implementation, and some performance measurements from this prototype. Based on these measurements and the experience with our prototype, we argue that logged virtual memorey can be supported with modest extensions to standard virtual memory systems, provides significant benefit to applications and servers, and is faster than other log-generation techniques.
