While text based languages have been (relatively) straightforward to grade automatically, visual programming languages have been largely left out of the equation. However, as the demand for introductory CS courses has recently grown, so too has the interest in CS courses that use visual programming languages, and thus the need for a scalable solution to providing student feedback. In this poster we present a system design for an autograder for Snap!, a visual programming language inspired by Scratch. We demonstrate how we integrated our autograder into UC Berkeley's CS10 and compare student success of autograded lab assessments to oral lab check offs. We demonstrate how we offered real-time feedback to a course of 300 students, and how we integrated our tools into an edX MOOC with 15,000 students. Our autograder is a hosted solution which would allow other courses to use our tools with little effort.
