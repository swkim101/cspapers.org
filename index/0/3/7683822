Delay-based Internet geolocation techniques are repeatedly positioned as well suited for security-sensitive applications, e.g., location-based access control, and credit-card verification. We present new strategies enabling adversaries to accurately control the forged location. Evaluation showed that using the new strategies, adversaries could misrepresent their true locations by over 15000km, and in some cases within 100km of an intended geographic location. This work significantly improves the adversary's control in misrepresenting its location, directly refuting the appropriateness of current techniques for security-sensitive applications. We finally discuss countermeasures to mitigate such strategies.
