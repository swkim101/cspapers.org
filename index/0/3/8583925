We formulate and give partial answers to several combinatorial problems on four-tuples of <i>n</i> points in three-space. (i) The number of minimum (nonzero) volume tetrahedra spanned by <i>n</i> points in R<sup>3</sup> is Θ(n<sup>3</sup>). (ii) The number of unit-volume tetrahedra determined by <i>n</i> points in R<sup>3</sup> is O(n<sup>7/2</sup>), and there are point sets for which this number is ω(n<sup>3</sup> log log n). (iii) The tetrahedra determined by <i>n</i> points in R<sup>3</sup>, not all on a plane, have at least ω(n) distinct volumes, and there are point sets for which this number is O(n); this gives a first partial answer for the three-dimensional case to an old question of Erdős, Purdy, and Straus. We also give an O(n<sup>3</sup>) time algorithm for reporting all tetrahedra of minimum nonzero volume, and thereby extend an early algorithm of Edelsbrunner, O'Rourke, and Seidel.
