We present an empirical evaluation and comparison of two content extraction methods in HTML: absolute XPath expressions and relative XPath expressions. We argue that the relative XPath expressions, although not widely used, should be used in preference to absolute XPath expressions in extracting content from human-created Web documents. Evaluation of robustness covers four thousand queries executed on several hundred webpages. We show that in referencing parts of real world dynamic HTML documents, relative XPath expressions are on average significantly more robust than absolute XPath ones.
