The method of <i>stable random projections</i> is popular in data stream computations, data mining, information retrieval, and machine learning, for efficiently computing the <i>l</i>α (0 < α ≤ 2) distances using a small (memory) space, in one pass of the data.
 We propose algorithms based on (1) the <i>geometric mean</i> estimator, for all 0 <α ≤ 2, and (2) the <i>harmonic mean</i> estimator, only for small α (e.g., α < 0.344). Compared with the previous classical work [27], our main contributions include:
 • <b>The general sample complexity bound for α ≠ 1,2.</b>
 For α = 1, [27] provided a nice argument based on the inverse of Cauchy density about the median, leading to a sample complexity bound, although they did not provide the constants and their proof restricted ε to be "small enough."
 For general α ≠ 1, 2, however, the task becomes much more difficult. [27] provided the "conceptual promise" that the sample complexity bound similar to that for α = 1 should exist for general α, if a "non-uniform algorithm based on <i>t</i>-quantile" could be implemented. Such a conceptual algorithm was only for supporting the arguments in [27], not a real implementation. We consider this is one of the main problems left open in [27]. In this study, we propose a practical algorithm based on the <i>geometric mean</i> estimator and derive the sample complexity bound for all 0 < α ≤ 2.
 • <b>The practical and optimal algorithm for α = 0+</b>
 The <i>l</i><sub>0</sub> norm is an important case. <i>Stable random projections</i> can provide an approximation to the <i>l</i><sub>0</sub> norm using α → 0+. We provide an algorithm based on the <i>harmonic mean</i> estimator, which is simple and statistically optimal. Its tail bounds are sharper than the bounds derived based on the <i>geometric mean.</i> We also discover a (possibly surprising) fact: in <i>boolean</i> data, <i>stable random projections</i> using α = 0+ with the <i>harmonic mean</i> estimator will be about <i>twice</i> as accurate as <i>(l</i><sub>2</sub><i>) normal random projections.</i> Because high-dimensional boolean data are common, we expect this fact will be practically quite useful.
 • <b>The precise theoretical analysis and practical implications</b> We provide the precise constants in the tail bounds for both the <i>geometric mean</i> and <i>harmonic mean</i> estimators. We also provide the variances (either exact or asymptotic) for the proposed estimators. These results can assist practitioners to choose sample sizes accurately.
