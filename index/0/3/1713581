In this paper, we propose and analyze the design of MANIP, a parallel machine for processing nondeterministic polynomial complete problems. The most general technique that can be used to solve a wide variety of NP-complete problems on a uniprocessor system, optimally or suboptimally, is the branch and bound algorithm. We have adapted and extended the branch and bound algorithm for parallel processing. The parallel branch and bound algorithm requires a combination of sorting and merging. A common memory to sort for a large number of processors can become a bottleneck in the system. We have proposed a system with distributed intelligence so that sorting can be carried out in a distributed fashion. A unidirectional ring network is proved to be the optimal and most cost-effective interprocessor communication network when sorting is done by a hardware priority queue in each processor. Lastly, the performance on the proposed system is evaluated using the vertex covering problem.
