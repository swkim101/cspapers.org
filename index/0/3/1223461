A main obstacle for building large diagnosis systems is the problem of decidingwhen to usewhich inference pattern or representation. If diagnostic actions such as changing representations or applying specific inference patterns are understood in terms of change of working hypotheses, the control problem becomes a belief revision problem: when to adopt or drop beliefs. Our approach proceeds in two steps. First, we adopt the principle of informational economy as kind of a law of inertia for diagnostic processes. It proposes candidates for revised belief states. In a second step we employ specific diagnostic knowledge to actually choose the next belief state.
