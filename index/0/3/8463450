When reading on a new topic researchers need to get a quick overview about a research area. Especially when reading a publication in an unfamiliar area, the reader is interested in how this publication is embedded in the web of science. The goal is to give the reader an overview of the evolution of ideas leading to the examined publication. We want to analyze this evolution by inferring and visualizing the strength of topical similarity between linked publications in the neighborhood of the initially examined work.
