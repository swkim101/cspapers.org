This session is for anyone currently using Alice 2 and/or Alice 3, or those exploring the possibility of using Alice in their curriculum. The discussion leaders and attendees will share teaching strategies, tips, and techniques with each other and those new to Alice. This is an opportunity to share assignments and pointers to web sites to access instructional materials, such as syllabi, student projects, exams, and other resources. There will be a special emphasis on mapping Alice curriculum and instructional materials to CSTA, CSP, code.org and ACM curriculum standards and guidelines for a wide range of age/grade levels. The team will also share feedback from the Beta users of the new textbook and CS Principles Course.
