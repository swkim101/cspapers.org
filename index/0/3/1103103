Wikipediaâ€™s link structure is a valuable resource for natural language processing tasks, but only a fraction of the concepts mentioned in each article are annotated with hyperlinks. In this paper, we study how to augment Wikipedia with additional high-precision links. We present 3W, a system that identifies concept mentions in Wikipedia text, and links each mention to its referent page. 3W leverages rich semantic information present in Wikipedia to achieve high precision. Our experiments demonstrate that 3W can add an average of seven new links to each Wikipedia article, at a precision of 0.98.
