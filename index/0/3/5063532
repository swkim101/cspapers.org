This work can be seen as a first approach to a new planning model that takes into account the possibility to express actions and fluents with nonboolean values. According to this model, a planning problem is defned using both graded (multi-valued) and classical (boolean) fluents. Moreover, actions that can have different application degrees can be defined. In this work a PDDL extension allowing to describe such new problems is proposed and a planning algorithm for such problems is presented.
