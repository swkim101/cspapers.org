This paper introduces an approach to knowledge representation and processing based on representing information that changes during program execution using metamodel instances. In this way both runtime data and program code can be dynamically adapted to the problem at hand (in traditional software only data is designed to change at runtime). The details of the proposed approach and some prototype systems are presented and discussed.
