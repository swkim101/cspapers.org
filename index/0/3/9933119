A new approach to test pattern generation which is particularly suitable for self-test is described. Required computation time is much less than for present-day automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) programs. Fault simulation is not required. More patterns may be obtained than from standard ATPG programs. However, fault coverage is much higher - all irredundant multiple as well as single stuck faults are detected. Test length is easily controlled. The test patterns are easily generated algorithmically either by program or hardware.
