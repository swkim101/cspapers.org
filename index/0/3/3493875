As CS + X courses become more common, it is important for us to investigate ways to leverage interdisciplinary learning tools to expand the types of experiences available to students. This paper discusses our experiences introducing CS undergraduates to basic Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) concepts using NeuroBlock. Neuroblock is a visual programming environment that allows users to build applications driven by near-real-time neurophysiological (i.e., brainwaves) data. Brainwave data is captured using a commercial-grade BCI device. Students use brainwave data from the BCI device to create interactive hybrid-BCI applications (e.g., games) featuring objects that respond to students' affective states (e.g. engagement, relaxation, and attention) and keyboard events. In this paper, we describe NeuroBlock, three example activities, and results from an exploratory empirical study that suggests exposure to NeuroBlock increased students' confidence in their ability to develop applications that leverage neurophysiological signals. NeuroBlock and the discussed activities have the potential to supplement future CS + X courses by providing students hands-on experiences with emerging physiological devices.
