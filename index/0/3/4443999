This paper presents two approaches for the problem of multiple target tracking (MTT) and specifically people tracking. Both filters are based on sequential Monte Carlo methods (SMCM) and joint probability data association (JPDA). The filters have been implemented and tested on real data from a laser measurement system. Experiments show that both approaches are able to track multiple moving persons. A comparison of both filters is given and the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches are presented.
