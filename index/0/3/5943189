Today, several data-storage systems allow applications to create and manage custom metadata to improve data search and navigability in large scale storage systems.
 Our thesis is that, besides improving search and navigability, custom metadata can also serve as a two way communication mechanism between applications and the storage layer to enable cross-layer optimizations in a uniform, application-independent and incremental fashion.
