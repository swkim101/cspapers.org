We present a new client cache consistency algorithm for client caching database management systems. The algorithm, called Asynchronous Avoidance-based Cache Consistency (AACC), provides both good performance as well as a low abort rate. We present simulation results that compare AACC with two leading cache consistency algorithms: Adaptive Callback Locking (ACBL) and Adaptive Optimistic Concurrency Control (AOCC). Callback cache consistency (e.g. ACBL) is the most widely implemented algorithm due to its low abort rate and good performance. AOCC is an optimistic algorithm that has been shown to outperform ACBL under certain workload and system configurations. Until now one could either have high performance and high abort rate as in AOCC, or relatively lower performance but the low abort rate of ACBL. Our performance study shows that AACC outperforms both ACBL and AOCC for important workloads and system configurations. AACC has the high performance of AOCC, as well as the robustness and low abort rate of ACBL.
