In this work, we address coreference retrieval, which involves identifying aliases that are distinct references to an entity. We begin with a known alias and discover unknown aliases that refer to the same entity. We use Entity Language Models to capture the contextual language around the known alias, which aids in finding new aliases. We also show that modeling the significant dates of the known aliases improves alias discovery performance.
