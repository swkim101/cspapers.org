With Community Question Answering (CQA) evolving into a quite popular method for information seeking and providing, it also becomes a target for spammers to disseminate promotion campaigns. Although there are a number of quality estimation efforts on the CQA platform, most of these works focus on identifying and reducing low-quality answers, which are mostly generated by impatient or inexperienced answerers. However, a large number of promotion answers appear to provide high-quality information to cheat CQA users in future interactions. Therefore, most existing quality estimation works in CQA may fail to detect these specially designed answers or question-answer pairs. In contrast to these works, we focus on the promotion channels of spammers, which include (shortened) URLs, telephone numbers and social media accounts. Spammers rely on these channels to connect to users to achieve promotion goals so they are irreplaceable for spamming activities. We propose a propagation algorithm to diffuse promotion intents on an "answerer-channel" bipartite graph and detect possible spamming activities. A supervised learning framework is also proposed to identify whether a QA pair is spam based on propagated promotion intents. Experimental results based on more than 6 million entries from a popular Chinese CQA portal show that our approach outperforms a number of existing quality estimation methods for detecting promotion campaigns on both the answer level and QA pair level.
