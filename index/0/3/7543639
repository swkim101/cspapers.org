This paper describes a music browsing assistance service, Songrium (http://songrium.jp), which increases user enjoyment when listening to songs and allows visualization and exploration of a ``Web of Music''. We define a Web of Music in this paper to be a network of ``web-native music'', which we define in turn to be music that is published, shared, and remixed (has derivative works created) entirely on the web. Songrium was developed as an attempt to realize a Web of Music, by showing relations between both original songs and derivative works and offering an enriched listening experience. Songrium has analyzed over 600,000 music video clips on the most popular Japanese video-sharing service, Niconico, which contains original songs of web-native music and their derivative works such as covers and dance arrangements. Analysis of over 100,000 original songs reveals that over 500,000 derivative works were generated and have contributed to enrich the Web of Music.
