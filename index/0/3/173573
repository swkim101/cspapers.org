We show a technique for amplifying commitment schemes that are non-malleable with respect to identities of length t, into ones that are non-malleable with respect to identities of length Î©(2t), while only incurring a constant overhead in round-complexity. As a result we obtain a construction of O(1)log* n-round (i.e., "essentially" constant-round) non-malleable commitments from any one-way function, and using a black-box proof of security.
