We succeeded in getting 14.9 TFLOPS performance when running a plasma simulation code IMPACT-3D parallelized with High Performance Fortran on 512 nodes of the Earth Simulator. The theoretical peak performance of the 512 nodes is 32 TFLOPS, which means 45% of the peak performance was obtained with HPF.IMPACT-3D is an implosion analysis code using TVD scheme, which performs three-dimensional compressible and inviscid Eulerian fluid computation with the explicit 5-point stencil scheme for spatial differentiation and the fractional time step for time integration. The mesh size is 2048x2048x4096, and the third dimension was distributed for the parallelization. The HPF system used in the evaluation is HPF/ES, developed for the Earth Simulator by enhancing NEC HPF/SX V2 mainly in communication scalability. Shift communications were manually tuned to get best performance by using HPF/JA extensions, which was designed to give the users more control over sophisticated parallelization and communication optimizations.
