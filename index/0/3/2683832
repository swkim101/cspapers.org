Given a  matrix <italic>A</italic> it is often desirable to find an approximation to <italic>A</italic> that has low rank. We introduce a simple technique for accelerating the computation of such approximations when <italic>A</italic> has strong spectral structure, i.e., when the singular values of interest are significantly greater than those of a random matrix with size and entries similar to <italic>A</italic>. Our technique amounts to independently sampling and/or quantizing the entries of <italic>A</italic>, thus speeding up computation by reducing the number of non-zero entries and/or the length of their representation. Our analysis is based on observing that the acts of sampling and quantization can be viewed as adding a random matrix <italic>E</italic> to <italic>A</italic>, whose entries are independent random variables with zero-mean  and bounded variance. Since, with high probability, <italic>E</italic> has very weak spectral structure, we can prove that the effect of sampling and quantization nearly vanishes when a low rank approximation to <italic>A+E</italic> is computed. In fact, the stronger the spectral structure of <italic>A</italic>, the more of its entries we can afford to discard and, ultimately, the faster we can discover that structure. We give bounds on the quality of our approximation both in the L2 and in the Frobenius norm.
