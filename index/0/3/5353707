We consider the problem of computing the <i>q</i> ↦ <i>p</i> norm of a matrix <i>A</i>, which is defined for <i>p, q</i> ≥ 1, as
 [EQUATION]
 This is in general a non-convex optimization problem, and is a natural generalization of the well-studied question of computing singular values (this corresponds to <i>p</i> = <i>q</i> = 2). Different settings of parameters give rise to a variety of known interesting problems (such as the Grothendieck problem when <i>p</i> = 1 and <i>q</i> = ∞). However, very little is understood about the approximability of the problem for different values of <i>p, q</i>.
 Our first result is an efficient algorithm for computing the <i>q</i> ↦ <i>p</i> norm of matrices with non-negative entries, when <i>q</i> ≥ <i>p</i> ≥ 1. The algorithm we analyze is based on a natural fixed point iteration, which can be seen as an analog of power iteration for computing eigenvalues.
 We then present an application of our techniques to the problem of constructing a scheme for oblivious routing in the <i>l</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> norm. This makes constructive a recent existential result of Englert and Räcke [ER09] on <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) competitive oblivious routing schemes (which they make constructive only for <i>p</i> = 2).
 On the other hand, when we do not have any restrictions on the entries (such as non-negativity), we prove that the problem is NP-hard to approximate to any constant factor, for 2 < <i>p</i> ≤ <i>q</i> and <i>p</i> ≤ <i>q</i> < 2 (these are precisely the ranges of <i>p, q</i> with <i>p</i> ≤ <i>q</i> where constant factor approximations are not known). In this range, our techniques also show that if NP ∉ DTIME(<i>n</i><sup>polylog(<i>n</i>)</sup>), the problem cannot be approximated to a factor 2<sup>(log n)<sup>1-ε</sup></sup>, for any constant ε > 0.
