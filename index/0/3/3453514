With the launch of the new AP Computer Science Principles course many high school and higher education institutions are curious how these two courses will work together and what credit each course should be awarded. In this session, participants will be presented with a comparison of these two courses, an overview of existing credit and placement policies, and hear from two high school teachers who have successfully implemented both of these courses at their schools. Higher Ed faculty will have an opportunity to share how their individual schools are awarding credit or placement for these courses.
