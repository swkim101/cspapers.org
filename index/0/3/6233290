It is well said that two minds are better than one. When it comes to accessing or processing some information, it seems natural to expect that when people work together in collaboration they (1) can accomplish more, (2) benefit from other peopleâ€™s experience and expertise on the given topic, and (3) influence each other and develop a more profound understanding of the subject than when they are isolated. While it seems that doing collaboration with others will make sense in many situations, the value of collaboration is often overlooked. Based on their extensive study with patent office workers, Hansen and Jarvelin [2] concluded that the assumption that information retrieval performance is purely individual needs to be reconsidered. Twidale and Nichols [4] argued that a truly user-centered system must acknowledge and support collaborative interactions between users and showed that users often desire to collaborate on search tasks. As the need to collaborate continues, the behavior of users in a collaborative environments remains under-studied, and the tools to facilitate collaborative information seeking have left much to be desired, my proposed research for studying Collaborative Information Seeking (CIS) is not only timely, but also very important. So far my research has primarily been focused on the system side. For instance, my work with others has shown the effectiveness of combing queries from different users for the same topic [1], as well as of algorithmically mediating the results for a collaborative search environment [3]. I would now like to focus my attention on more user-centric IR systems that facilitate intentional, interactive, and immediate collaboration among users. As a first step in this direction, I have developed a system called Coagmento, which allows a pair of users to search TREC collections and col-
