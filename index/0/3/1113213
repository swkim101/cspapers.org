Recent work has shown that traffic analysis of data carried on encrypted tunnels can be used to recover important semantic information. As one example, attackers can find out which website, or which page on a website, a user is accessing simply by monitoring the traffic patterns. We show that traffic analysis is a much greater threat to privacy than previously thought, as such attacks can be carried out remotely. In particular, we show that, to perform traffic analysis, adversaries do not need to directly observe the traffic patterns. Instead, they can send probes from a far-off vantage point that exploit a queuing side channel in routers.
 We demonstrate the threat of such remote traffic analysis by developing a remote website fingerprinting attack that works against home broadband users. Because the observations obtained by probes are more noisy than direct observations, we had to take a new approach to detection that uses the full time series data contained in the observation, rather than summary statistics used in previous work. We perform k-nearest neighbor classification using dynamic time warping (DTW) distance metric. We find that in our experiments, we are able to fingerprint a website with 80% accuracy in both testbed and target system. This shows that remote traffic analysis represents a real threat to privacy on the Internet.
