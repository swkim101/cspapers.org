eXpressive Internet Architecture (XIA) [1] is an architecture that natively supports multiple communication types and allows networks to evolve their abstractions and functionality to accommodate new styles of communication over time. XIA embeds an elegant mechanism for handling unforeseen communication types for legacy routers.
 In this demonstration, we show that XIA overcomes three key barriers in network evolution (outlined below) by (1) allowing end-hosts and applications to start using new communication types (e.g., service and content) before the network supports them, (2) ensuring that upgrading a subset of routers to support new functionalities immediately benefits applications, and (3) using the same mechanisms we employ for 1 and 2 to incrementally deploy XIA in IP networks.
