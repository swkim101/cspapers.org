The tasks of disambiguating words and determining case are similar and can usefully be combined. We present two cooperating mechanisms that each work on both tasks: MARKER PASSING finds connections between concepts in a system of frames, and POLAROID WORDS provide a protocol for negotiation between ambiguous words and cases. Examples of each in action are given. The cooperating mechanisms allow linguistic and world knowledge to be unified, frequently eliminate the need to use inference in disambiguation, and provide a usefully constrained model of disambiguation.
