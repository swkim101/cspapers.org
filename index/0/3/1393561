In this paper we introduce the task of "tweet recommendation", the problem of suggesting tweets that match a user's interests and likes. We propose an Information-Retrieval-like model that leverages the content of the user's tweets and those of her friends, and that effectively retrieves a set of tweets that is personalized and varied in nature. Our approach could be easily leveraged to build, for example, a Twitter or Facebook timeline that collects messages that are of interest for the user, but that are not posted by her friends. We compare to typical approaches used in similar tasks, reporting significant gains in terms of overall precision, up to about +20%, on both a corpus-based evaluation and real world user study.
