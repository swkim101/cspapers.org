Database outsourcing is an important trend which involves data owners farming out their data management needs to an external service provider. One important requirement is to maintain the integrity and authenticity of outsourced data. Whenever an outsourced database is queried, the corresponding query reply must be demonstrably authentic. Furthermore, a reply must include a proof of completeness to convince the querier that no data matching the query predicate(s) has been omitted. In this paper, we suggest new techniques in support of efficient authenticity and completeness guarantees of such query replies.
