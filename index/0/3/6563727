Currently, many Computer Science Departments have introduced or are considering the introduction of courses in software Engineering. At the same time many departments are considering the use of a language other than Pascal either for an entire Computer Science curriculum, or at least for some advanced courses, such as Data Structures or Software Engineering. At Georgia State University, where our program is primarily based on IBM PC compatible microcomputers, both our Data Structures and Software Engineering courses are based on Ada. In this paper we will discuss the rationale behind our choice of Ada and our experience with using Ada in the Software Engineering course.
