: We present a change-centric method to manage versions in a Web WareHouse of XML data. The starting points is a sequence of snapshots of XML documents we obtain from the web. By running a di(cid:11) algorithm, we compute the changes between two consecutive versions. We then represent the sequence using a novel representation of changes based on completed deltas and persistent identi(cid:12)ers. We present the foundations of the logical representation and some aspects of the physical storage policy. The work presented here was developed in the context of the Xyleme project of massive XML warehouse for XML data from the Web. It has been implemented and tested. We brie(cid:13)y discuss the implementation.
