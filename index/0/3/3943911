We present a new screen space widget, the IBar, for effective camera control in 3D graphics environments. The IBar provides a compelling interface for controlling scene perspective based on the artistic concept of vanishing points. Various handles on the widget manipulate multiple camera parameters simultaneously to create a single perceived projection change. For example, changing just the perspective distortion is accomplished by simultaneously decreasing the camera's distance to the scene while increasing focal length. We demonstrate that the IBar is easier to learn for novice users and improves their understanding of camera perspective.
