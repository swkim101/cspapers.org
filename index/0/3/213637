The Mask Shop Information System (MSIS) is a computer system which provides real-time control as well as information retrieval functions for a shop where integrated circuit masks are made. This system is now in use at two Bell Laboratories locations, one at Murray Hill, New Jersey, and the other at Allentown, Pennsylvania.
 Each mask shop contains its own complex of Bell Laboratories designed, photolithographic devices. The original artwork for each mask level is produced on a Primary Pattern Generator, a device which uses a laser beam to accurately expose a pattern on a photographic plate. Specially designed Reduction and Step-and-Repeat Cameras are used to arrive at the final mask. Developing, inspection, and copying facilities are also part of the shop.
