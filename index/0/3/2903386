It is well known from the work of Motzkin [55], Belaga [58] and Pan [66], that “most” nth degree polynomials p ε R[x] require about n/2 ×, ÷ ops and n ± ops and that these bounds can always be achieved within the framework of preconditioned evaluation (1). More precisely, if p can be computed using less than [equation] ×, ÷ or less than n ± ops, then the coefficients of p are algebraically dependent.
 The situation when counting ± ops with the potential of unlimited * ops, is not as clear.
 While the arguments based on algebraic dependence provide us with our best lower bounds thus far, a different approach of independent interest is taken in section IV. Namely, we are able to show that the number of ± ops required to compute any p ε R[x] is bounded below by a function of the number of distinct real zeros of p. The potential (e.g., for producing non linear lower bounds) and limitations of this approach will be discussed.
