We address the challenge of automatically abstracting conversations such as face-to-face meetings and emails. We focus here on the stages of interpretation, where sentences are mapped to a conversation ontology, and transformation, where the summary content is selected. Our approach is fully developed and tested on meeting speech, and we subsequently explore its application to email conversations.
