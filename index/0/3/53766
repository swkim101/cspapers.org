Digital images nowadays show large appearance variabilities on picture styles, in terms of color tone, contrast, vignetting, and etc. These `picture styles' are directly related to the scene radiance, image pipeline of the camera, and post processing functions (e.g., photography effect filters). Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of these factors, popular gradient-based image descriptors generally are not invariant to different picture styles, which could degrade the performance for object recognition. Given that images shared online or created by individual users are taken with a wide range of devices and may be processed by various post processing functions, to find a robust object recognition system is useful and challenging. In this paper, we investigate the influence of picture styles on object recognition by making a connection between image descriptors and a pixel mapping function g, and accordingly propose an adaptive approach based on a g-incorporated kernel descriptor and multiple kernel learning, without estimating or specifying the image styles used in training and testing. We conduct experiments on the Domain Adaptation data set, the Oxford Flower data set, and several variants of the Flower data set by introducing popular photography effects through post-processing. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently yields recognition improvements over standard descriptors in all studied cases.
