This paper describes the NLMenu System, a menu-based natural language understanding system. Rather than requiring the user to type his input to the system, input to NLMenu is made by selecting items from a set of dynamically changing menus. Active menus and items are determined by a predictive left-corner parser that accesses a semantic grammar and lexicon. The advantage of this approach is that all inputs to the NLMenu System can be understood thus giving a 0% failure rate. A companion system that can automatically generate interfaces to relational databases is also discussed.
