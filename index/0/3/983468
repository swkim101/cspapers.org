Social Network (SN) environments are the ideal future service marketplaces. It is well known and documented that SN users are increasing at a tremendous pace. Taking advantage of these social dynamics as well as the vast volumes, of amateur content generated every second, is a major step towards creating a potentially huge market of services. In this paper, we describe the external web services that SocIoS project is researching and developing, and will support with the Social Media community. Aiming to support the end users of SNs, to enhance their transactions with more automated ways, and with the advantage for better production and performance in their workflows over SNs inputs and content, this work presents the main architecture, functionality, and benefits per external service. Finally, introduces the end user, into the new era of SNs with business applicability and better social transactions over SNs content.
