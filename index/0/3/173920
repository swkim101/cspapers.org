We are interested in the automatic interpretation of how-to instructions, such as cooking recipes, into semantic representations that can facilitate sophisticated question answering. Recent work has shown impressive results on semantic parsing of instructions with minimal supervision, but such techniques cannot handle much of the situated and ambiguous language used in instructions found on the web. In this paper, we suggest how to extend such methods using a model of pragmatics, based on a rich representation of world state.
