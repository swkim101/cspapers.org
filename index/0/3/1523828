It costs about 300M dollars to just build a search system that scales to the web. Web services which open up web search results to the public allow academics, developers, and entrepreneurs to achieve instant web search parity for free and enable them to focus on building their additional secret sauce on top to create even grander relevant services. For example, a social network could leverage open search and their data about users to personalize web search. Additionally, one of the best ways to gather data about web search behavior is to build your own search system. Proto-type IR and web search systems based on open search can be used to gather user interaction data and test the applicability of research ideas. Open Source tools like Lucene and Nutch and open search services like from major search engines can greatly help developers implement these types of systems quickly, allowing for fast production and evaluation. We will give detailed overviews of the popular open search tools, showcasing examples of search and IR algorithms and systems implemented using them, as well as discussing how evaluation can be performed.
