This paper describes a study of the performance of centralized concurrency control algorithms. An algorithm-independent simulation framework was developed in order to support comparative studies of various concurrency control algorithms. We describe this framework in detail and present performance results which were obtained for what we believe to be a representative cross-section of the many proposed algorithms. The basic algorithms studied include four locking algorithms. two timestamp algorithms. and one optimistic algorithm. Also. we briefly summarize studies of several multiple version algorithms and several hierarchical algorithms. We show that. in general, locking algorithms provide the best performance.
