There has been an explosion of smart mobile devices over the last few years. These smart devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have changed many aspects of modern life. They have also enabled whole new industries to grow up that develop and manufacture "companion products" of the smart devices. These companion products, however, are mostly built around the smart devices, instead of being tightly integrated into them, and fail to utilize the full capabilities of the smart devices. The main cause for their failure is that the software platforms these smart devices are built on are not fully open. This hinders efforts by device manufacturers or software developers to create innovative new products or product categories based on those software platforms.
 In this talk, we present Tizen (www.tizen.org), which is a "fully open" software platform for embedded systems. Tizen allows for everyone involved in building and using devices built on it to freely define, invent, add new features or business models, or create new device categories. Tizen offers an industry leading HTML5-based application APIs, the preferred development environment for apps and services for the future. The HTML5-based APIs make it easy for developers to create applications that run across various categories of devices such as mobile, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI), Digital TV, netbooks, health and medical devices, etc. In this talk we also present Tizen's optimization technologies that enable HTML5-based applications to enjoy performance comparable to that of native applications. We also describe how Tizen balances the trade-offs between performance and power consumption, which is of extreme importance for mobile devices.
