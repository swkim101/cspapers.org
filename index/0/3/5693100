Experimental validation of absolute orientation estimation solutions is displayed for the dynamical stable five-link biped robot Rabbit during a walking gait. The objective is to prove the technical feasibility of posture online software estimation in order to remove sensors. Finally, this paper presents the first experimental results of walking biped robot posture estimation.
