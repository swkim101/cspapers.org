This work presents a parameterized framework for static and dynamic analysis of call chains in Java components. Such analyses have a wide range of uses in tools for software understanding and testing. We also describe a test coverage tool built with these analyses and the use of the tool on a real-world test suite. Our experiments evaluate the exact precision of several instances of the framework and provide a novel approach for estimating the limits of class analysis technology for computing precise call chains.
