Color raster graphics is being incorporated into CAD systems for printed circuit board (PCB) design. An interactive prototype CAD system developed as an experimental base is described, along with color graphics research using this prototype. Areas investigated included the generation and display of complex PCB's, the display of depth information using "2 1/2 dimensional" techniques, performance measurements on color raster systems, possibilities for new on-line design audit techniques, color graphics primitives, hardware and software architectures, and human factors considerations.
