This paper describes the use of Smalltalk in the design and implementation of OFMspert. OFMspert is an architecture for an intelligent operator's associate. In order to verify the architecture, an OFMspert was implemented to act as an assistant to an operator of a NASA satellite ground control system. OFMspert is a large system that utilizes a Smalltalk implementation of a knowledge-based problem solving method known as the blackboard architecture. The entire system was designed and implemented in Smalltalk/V#8482; and later ported to the Smalltalk-80#8482; system. The object-oriented paradigm in general, and Smalltalkâ€¡ in particular, greatly facilitated the rapid design and implementation of this system. This paper summarizes the OFMspert architecture, emphasizing its implementation in an object-oriented paradigm.
