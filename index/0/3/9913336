Text summarization is the process of taking a text document and creating a compressed version that consists of the most useful information for the user. One distinguishes between single-document summarizers (SDS) and multi-document summarizers (MDS). Multi-document summarization is much more complicated than single-document summarization. Factors that make multi-document summarization more difficult include: Multiple articles can be written by different authors, having different writing styles and document structure. Multiple articles might have contradictory views of the same event. A useful summarizer should be able to detect and handle this situation. Facts and views can change over time, documents written at different times may have conflicting information.
