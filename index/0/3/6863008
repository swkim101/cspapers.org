We have developed Gigascope, a stream database for network applications including traffic analysis, intrusion detection, router configuration analysis, network research, network monitoring, and performance monitoring and debugging. Gigascope is undergoing installation at many sites within the AT&T network, including at OC48 routers, for detailed monitoring. In this paper we describe our motivation for and constraints in developing Gigascope, the Gigascope architecture and query language, and performance issues. We conclude with a discussion of stream database research problems we have found in our application.
