We present a novel method for three-finger precision grasp and its implementation in a complete grasping tool-chain. We start from binocular vision to recover the partial 3D structure of unknown objects. We then process the incomplete 3D point clouds searching for good triplets according to a function that accounts for both the feasibility and the stability of the solution. In particular, while stability is determined using the classical force-closure approach, feasibility is evaluated according to a new measure that includes information about the possible configuration shapes of the hand as well as the hand's inverse kinematics. We finally extensively assess the proposed method using the stereo vision and the kinematics of the iCub robot.
