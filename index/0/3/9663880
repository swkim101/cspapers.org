We propose a system which allows users to select how and with whom they are available for contact by managing a set of personal "identities" and budding relationships. The most important of these media are public displays, which allow a low-cost barrier for finding potential friends through interaction via the display and through the attendance of displayed social events. In helping two people to both become aware of each other's existence and to pick media which suit their preferences, we believe such a system can increase the odds of two strangers forming a strong social bond.
