We present AutoEmbed, a fully-automated framework for VN embedding across multiple substrate networks. To automate VN embedding, AutoEmbed deploys functions over three layers: (i) Service Providers, (ii) VN Providers, and (iii) Infrastructure Providers (InPs). AutoEmbed enables VN Providers to partition VN requests among multiple substrate networks based on resource and network topology information that is not treated as confidential by InPs. Subsequently, each VN segment is mapped by the corresponding InP onto its substrate network. AutoEmbed enables the evaluation of various aspects of multi-provider VN embedding, such as the efficiency and scalability of embedding algorithms, the impact of different levels of information disclosure on VN embedding efficiency, and the suitability of VN request specifications.
