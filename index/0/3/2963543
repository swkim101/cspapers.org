Aspects of semantic interpretation, such as quantifier scoping and reference resolution, are often realised computationally by non-monotonic operations involving loss of information and destructive manipulation of semantic representations. The paper describes how monotonic reference resolution and scoping can be carried out using a revised Quasi Logical Form (QLF) representation. Semantics for QLF are presented in which the denotations of formulas are extended monotonically as QLF expressions are resolved.
