We present CSniper (Corpus Sniper), a tool that implements (i) a web-based multi-user scenario for identifying and annotating non-canonical grammatical constructions in large corpora based on linguistic queries and (ii) evaluation of annotation quality by measuring inter-rater agreement. This annotation-by-query approach efficiently harnesses expert knowledge to identify instances of linguistic phenomena that are hard to identify by means of existing automatic annotation tools.
