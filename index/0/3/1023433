We are given a transition system implicitly through a compact representation and wish to perform simultaneously reachability analysis and minimization without constructing first the whole system graph. We present an algorithm for this problem that applies to general systems, provided we have appropriate primitive operations for manipulating blocks of states and we can determine termination; the number of operations needed to construct the minimal reachable graph is quadratic in the size of this graph. We specialize the method to obtain efficient algorithms for extended finite state machines that apply separable affine transformations on the variables.
