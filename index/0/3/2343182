The ease of deploying wireless camera sensor nodes has grown with the reduction of manufacturing costs of low power, high resolution cameras. Although current wireless sensor network platforms have limited on-board resources for solving highly complex computer vision problems, we show that by splitting the processing costs between the sensor node and a powerful backend, we can achieve better classification results. Using such a distributed processing approach, we balance the computational and communication costs for achieving better detection performance while improving the system lifetime.
