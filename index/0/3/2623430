We present an algorithm to "reconstruct" a smooth <i>k</i>-dimensional manifold <i>M</i> embedded in an Euclidean space R<sup>d</sup> from a "sufficiently dense" point sample from the manifold. The algorithm outputs a simplicial manifold that is homeomorphic and geometrically close to <i>M.</i> The running time is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) where <i>n</i> is the number of points in the sample (the multiplicative constant depends exponentially on the dimension though).
