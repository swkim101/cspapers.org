I describe the IMA CS interface, which supports a type of interactive data exploration task called data archaeology. The interface facilitates users in performing this task using three key design principles: (1) combine power and ease of use, (2) provide direct support for integrated, itemtive data exploration, and (3) assist users in managing their work over time. I show how these principles are relevant in the data archaeology task, describe how knowledge representation technologyprovides a foundation for an adequate support system, and illustmte in detail how the interface offers powerful support for data archaeology.
