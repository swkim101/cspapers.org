Locating features in software is an important activity for program comprehension and to support software reengineering. We present a novel automated approach to locate features in source code based on static analysis and model checking. The technique is aimed at dynamically configured software, which is software in which the activation of specific features is controlled by configuration variables. The approach is evaluated on an industrial avionics system.
