Modeling abstractions in physical systems re sult in hybrid models which encompass contin uous behaviors with discrete changes causing discontinuities in system behavior generation which violate the physical laws of conservation of energy and continuity of power This pa per develops a formal speci cation for handling discrete model con guration changes at well de ned points in time and a consistent transfer of the continuous system state from a previous model con guration to a new one based on the principle of invariance of state Simulation al gorithms designed to operate on hybrid models de ne behavior generation schemes that oper ate on the interval continuous to point dis crete to interval continuous switches on the time line
