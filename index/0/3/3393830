We introduce a benchmark called TEXTURE (TEXT Under RElations) to measure the relative strengths and weaknesses of combining text processing with a relational workload in an RDBMS. While the well-known TREC benchmarks focus on quality, we focus on efficiency. TEXTURE is a micro-benchmark for query workloads, and considers two central text support issues that previous benchmarks did not: (1) queries with relevance ranking, rather than those that just compute all answers, and (2) a richer mix of text and relational processing, reflecting the trend toward seamless integration. In developing this benchmark, we had to address the problem of generating large text collections that reflected the (performance) characteristics of a given "seed" collection; this is essential for a controlled study of specific data characteristics and their effects on performance. In addition to presenting the benchmark, with performance numbers for three commercial DBMSs, we present and validate a synthetic generator for populating text fields.
