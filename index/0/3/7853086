This paper presents experiments which combine a grammar-driven and a data-driven parser. We show how the conversion of LFG output to dependency representation allows for a technique of parser stacking, whereby the output of the grammar-driven parser supplies features for a data-driven dependency parser. We evaluate on English and German and show significant improvements stemming from the proposed dependency structure as well as various other, deep linguistic features derived from the respective grammars.
