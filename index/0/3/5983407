Asynchronous methodologies are gaining their presence in modern integrated circuit design. Cycle-time analysis of asynchronous design is nontrivial and crucial to circuit optimization. Among prior methods, linear programming-based analysis (LPA) and static performance analysis (SPA) are two representatives with high accuracy (but inefficient) and high efficiency (but inaccurate), respectively. However, the exactness of LPA remains unknown and the accuracy of SPA remains room for improvement. In this work, we demonstrate the inexactness of LPA and enhance the accuracy of SPA. Experimental results suggest our enhanced SPA almost always returns exact cycle-times while achieving up to 4000Ã— speedup over LPA.
