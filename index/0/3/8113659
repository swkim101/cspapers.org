The geometric model is an essential element of the design description. It is an abstract representation of the form and size of the object that serves as a medium of communication. The geometric model must hold sufficient information to answer all questions about form and size. The traditional engineering drawing was developed for and has served this function. Though highly developed, over a long period, the technique suffers from the fact that much of the information is implied and many times is ambiguous. It takes a trained human to interpret a drawing, a computer can't. Various approaches have been taken in design modeling and the capabilities and limitation should be understood before approaches are selected or rejected. The wire frame, surface and volumes approaches can form a complimentary system of modeling capabilities rather than replace each other. The need for multiple representation appears when deeper consideration is given to specific applications.
