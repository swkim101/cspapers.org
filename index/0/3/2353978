Acceleration in the form of customized datapaths offer large performance and energy improvements over general purpose processors. Reconfigurable fabrics such as FPGAs are gaining popularity for use in implementing application-specific accelerators, thereby increasing the importance of having good high-level FPGA design tools. However, current tools for targeting FPGAs offer inadequate support for high-level programming, resource estimation, and rapid and automatic design space exploration. We describe a design framework that addresses these challenges. We introduce a new representation of hardware using parameterized templates that captures locality and parallelism information at multiple levels of nesting. This representation is designed to be automatically generated from high-level languages based on parallel patterns. We describe a hybrid area estimation technique which uses template-level models and design-level artificial neural networks to account for effects from hardware place-and-route tools, including routing overheads, register and block RAM duplication, and LUT packing. Our runtime estimation accounts for off-chip memory accesses. We use our estimation capabilities to rapidly explore a large space of designs across tile sizes, parallelization factors, and optional coarse-grained pipelining, all at multiple loop levels. We show that estimates average 4.8% error for logic resources, 6.1% error for runtimes, and are 279 to 6533 times faster than a commercial high-level synthesis tool. We compare the best-performing designs to optimized CPU code running on a server-grade 6 core processor and show speedups of up to 16.7Ã—.
