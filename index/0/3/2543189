Prominent semantic annotations take an inclusive approach to argument span annotation, marking arguments as full constituency subtrees. Some works, however, showed that identifying a reduced argument span can be beneficial for various semantic tasks. While certain practical methods do extract reduced argument spans, such as in Open-IE , these solutions are often ad-hoc and system-dependent, with no commonly accepted standards. In this paper we propose a generic argument reduction criterion, along with an annotation procedure, and show that it can be consistently and intuitively annotated using the recent QA-SRL paradigm.
