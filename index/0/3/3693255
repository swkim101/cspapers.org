This paper proposes a new inspection planning algorithm, called Random Inspection Tree Algorithm (RITA). Given a perfect model of a structure, sensor specifications, robot's dynamics, and an initial configuration of a robot, RITA computes the optimal inspection trajectory that observes all points on the structure. Many inspection planning algorithms have been proposed, most of them consist of two sequential steps. In the first step, they compute a small set of observation points such that each point on the structure is visible. In the second step, they compute the shortest trajectory to visit all observation points at least once. The robot's kinematic and dynamic constraints are taken into account only in the second step. Thus, when the robot has differential constraints and operates in cluttered environments, the observation points may be difficult or even infeasible to reach. To alleviate this difficulty, RITA computes both observation points and the trajectory to visit the observation points simultaneously. RITA uses sampling-based techniques to find admissible trajectories with decreasing cost. Simulation results for 2-D environments are promising. Furthermore, we present analysis on the probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality of our algorithm.
