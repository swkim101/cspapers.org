We propose a learning-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) model for tracking multiple targets by progressively associating detection responses into long tracks. Tracking task is transformed into a data association problem, and most previous approaches developed heuristical parametric models or learning approaches for evaluating independent affinities between track fragments (tracklets). We argue that the independent assumption is not valid in many cases, and adopt a CRF model to consider both tracklet affinities and dependencies among them, which are represented by unary term costs and pairwise term costs respectively. Unlike previous methods, we learn the best global associations instead of the best local affinities between tracklets, and transform the task of finding the best association into an energy minimization problem. A RankBoost algorithm is proposed to select effective features for estimation of term costs in the CRF model, so that better associations have lower costs. Our approach is evaluated on challenging pedestrian data sets, and are compared with state-of-art methods. Experiments show effectiveness of our algorithm as well as improvement in tracking performance.
