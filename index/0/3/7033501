The AUTOSPEC system is an automatic motor specification software system that primarily serves to non-interactively produce bill of materials from sales orders. At the core, the system applies Expert System and coordinated Relational Database technology to effect an object-oriented implementation. Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools supporting object-oriented analysis (OOA) and an object-oriented design (OOD) approach were used to provide a smooth transition of the software design effort into production at motor manufacturing plants. The powerful mechanisms of class inheritance, and forward chaining, as well as graphical program construction provided by the ProKappa Knowledge Base System are employed. Motif Graphical User Interface (GUI) development was carried out using UIM/X, a WYSIWYG screen development tool. The ORACLE Database Management System was used to provide data independence necessary for engineering system interfacing.
