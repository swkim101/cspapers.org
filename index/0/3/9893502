The Model Driven Architecture (MDA) can have a greater impact by expanding its scope to Domain Specific MDA (DSMDA). DSMDA is the use of MDA for a particular domain. This helps developers to represent their systems using familiar domain concepts. For each DSMDA, a transformer is needed to convert Domain Specific Platform Independent Models (DSPIM -s) to Domain Specific Platform Specific Models (DSPDM-s). Such model transformers are time consuming and error prone to develop and maintain. Hence, a high-level specification language to formally specify the behavior of model transformers is required. The language must also have an execution framework, which can be used to execute the specifications in the language. This research proposes to develop such a language and execution framework that will help to considerably speed-up the development time for model transformers.
