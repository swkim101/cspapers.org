Query retrieval based on secondary keys is an important operation in retrieval systems. Such a query generally retrieves more than one data record which satisfies the query criterion. This paper studies the problem of record address allocation in disk-like devices so as to facilitate the fast retrieval of a set of records which are jointly accessed by a query. A heuristic scheme, using the proposed minimal access retrieval property, is designed to assign records to blocks. Some experimental results are also presented.
