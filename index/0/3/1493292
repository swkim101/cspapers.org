Kinesthetic feedback requires linkage-based high-powered multi-dimensional manipulators, which are currently not possible to integrate with mobile devices. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel system that can utilize a wide range of actuation components and apply various techniques to optimize stick-slip motion of a tangible object on a display surface. The current setup demonstrates how it may be possible to generate directional forces on an interactive display in order to move a linkage-free stylus over a touchscreen in a fully controlled and efficient manner. The technology described in this research opens up new possibilities for interacting with displays and tangible surfaces such as continuously supervised learning; active feed-forward systems as well as dynamic gaming environments that predict user behavior and are able modify and physically react to human input at real-time.
