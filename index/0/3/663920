Timing resilient design has shown significant promise in mitigating the excess margins associated with rare worst-case data and increased process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. However, resilient circuits need error detecting sequential logic (EDL) to detect timing errors which represents area and power overhead. This article proposes a new network-simplex-based retiming method for two-phase latch-based resilient circuits to reduce the overhead of the combination of normal and error detecting latches. Our experimental results show that our method is computationally efficient and reduces the cost of the sequential elements by an average of up to 20% when compared to traditional methods.
