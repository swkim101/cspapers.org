In most of the existing video surveillance systems, captured video streams by CCTV or video cameras are aggregated through cables to a central station and monitored by associated human operators. However, the high deployment cost, low scalability and reuseability still remain to be the main roadblock for their wider application. Using human to monitor events can also be unreliable. Accordingly, we designed a ubiquitous wireless video surveillance system. This system uses wireless sensor nodes to detect pre-defined events and utilizes wireless mesh network to transmit high-quality video streams. Without cables, the deployment cost is significantly decreased. Different application users can also define various events and automatically receive notification and corresponding video streams when the events occur. In addition, mobile users, even when roaming, can access this system. In this demo, we introduce the hardware and software of this system and its implementation in our intelligent transportation system testbed.
