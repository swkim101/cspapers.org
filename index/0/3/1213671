Point set registration (PSR) is a fundamental problem in computer vision and pattern recognition, and it has been successfully applied to many applications. Although widely used, existing PSR methods cannot align point sets robustly under degradations, such as deformation, noise, occlusion, outlier, rotation, and multi-view changes. This paper proposes context-aware Gaussian fields (CA-LapGF) for nonrigid PSR subject to global rigid and local non-rigid geometric constraints, where a laplacian regularized term is added to preserve the intrinsic geometry of the transformed set. CA-LapGF uses a robust objective function and the quasi-Newton algorithm to estimate the likely correspondences, and the non-rigid transformation parameters between two point sets iteratively. The CA-LapGF can estimate non-rigid transformations, which are mapped to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, accurately and robustly in the presence of degradations. Experimental results on synthetic and real images reveal that how CA-LapGF outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for non-rigid PSR.
