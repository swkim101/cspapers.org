We introduce HEX programs, which are nonmonotonic logic programs admitting higher-order atoms as well as external atoms, and we extend the well-known answer-set semantics to this class of programs. Higher-order features are widely acknowledged as useful for performing meta-reasoning, among other tasks. Furthermore, the possibility to exchange knowledge with external sources in a fully declarative framework such as Answer-Set Programming (ASP) is nowadays important, in particular in view of applications in the Semantic Web area. Through external atoms, HEX programs can model some important extensions to ASP, and are a useful KR tool for expressing various applications. Finally, complexity and implementation issues for a preliminary prototype are discussed.
