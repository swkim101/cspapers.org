A system is developed that can reconstruct the pose of flexible endoscopic instruments that are used in advanced flexible endoscopes using solely the endoscopic images. Four markers are placed on the instrument, whose positions are measured in the image. These measurements are compared to a three-dimensional rendered model of the instrument. The pseudo-inverse of the interaction matrix between the state of the model and the marker positions in the image is used to update the state such that the model will track the real instrument. An experiment was performed in which the instrument was moved inside a colon model, while the tip position was simultaneously measured with an electromagnetic tracking system. The root mean square errors of the position estimation were 2.3 mm, 2.2 mm and 1.7 mm in the horizontal (x), vertical (y) and away-from-camera (z) directions, respectively.
