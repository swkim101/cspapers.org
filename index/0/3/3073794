In an increasingly multilingual digital world, it is critical that information management tools, such as web search engines, e-Commerce portals and e-Governance applications, support the simultaneous use of multiple natural languages. An essential pre-requisite is that the underlying database engines (typically relational), provide the functionality for processing multilingual data seamlessly across languages. As a part of our Mira [1] research initiative focusing on functionality and performance aspects of supporting multilingualism in relational database systems, we propose SemEQUAL, a semantic operator for matching text attribute data across languages based on meaning.
