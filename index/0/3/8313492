This paper presents a RTL-HDL code generation from synchronous data-flow graphs which supports the building block based design of data-flow oriented ASIC systems. Here, additional interfacing and controlling hardware is generated to adapt non-matching interfacing properties. In order to reduce interface register cost, a retiming approach is taken to schedule optimum building block activation times. The code generation methodology is compared to an existing approach using different case studies.
