Distance-bounding protocols serve to thwart various types of proximity-based attacks, such as relay attacks. A particular class of distance-bounding protocols measures round trip times of a series of one-bit challenge-response cycles, during which the proving party must have minimal computational overhead. This can be achieved by precomputing the responses to the various possible challenges. In this paper we study this class of precomputation-based distance-bounding protocols. By designing an abstract model for these protocols, we can study their generic properties, such as security lower bounds in relation to space complexity. Further, we develop a novel family of protocols in this class that resists well to mafia fraud attacks.
