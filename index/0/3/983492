When building a database, it is mandatory to design a friendly interface, which allo ws the nal user to easily access the data of interest. V ery often,such an interface exploits the pow er of visualization and direct manipulation mechanisms. How ever, it is not su√Ücient to associate \any" visual represen tation to a database, but the visual representation should be carefully chosen to e ectively con vey all and only the database information content. We are curren tly w orkingon a general theory (see ) for establishing the adequacy of a visual representation, once speci ed the database characteristics, and we are developing a system, called D ARE: Drawing Adequate REpresentations, which implements such a theory. The DARE system is based on a knowledge base containing di erent kinds of rules, namely: Visual rules, that c haracterize the di erent kinds of visual symbols; Data rules, that specify the characteristics of the data model, the database schema, and the database instances; Mapping rules, that specify the link betw een data and visual elements; Per ceptual rules, that tell us how the user perceives a visual symbol (e.g., a line), relationships betw een symbols (e.g., the mutual placements of tw o gures), and which is the perceptual e ect of relevant visual attributes such as color, texture, etc.
