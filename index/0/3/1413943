In this paper we describe an algorithm for efficient circuit-level simulation of transmission lines which can be specified by tables of frequency-dependent scattering parameters. The approach uses a forced stable section-by-section l2 minimization approach to construct a high order rational function approximation to the frequency domain data, and then applies guaranteed stable balanced realization techniques to reduce the order of the rational function. The rational function is then incorporated in a circuit simulator using fast recursive convolution. An example of a transmission line with skin-effect is examined to both demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and to show its generality.
