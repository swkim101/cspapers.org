This paper describes a new highly accurate fast self-contained sonar sensor. Transmission and echo analyses are performed at repetition rates exceeding 27 Hz for ranges up to 5.4 metres. The sensor contains low noise variable gain preamplifiers, two 1 MHz 12 bit ADC receivers and a DSP echo processor. Optimal arrival time estimation is performed by the DSP using matched filtering of echoes with short duration and wide bandwidth. With the sensor mounted on a mobile robot, map results are derived from scanning with the sensor as the robot moves continuously.
