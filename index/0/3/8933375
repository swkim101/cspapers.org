Program analysis tools are available to make programmers' jobs easier by automating tasks that would otherwise be performed manually or not at all. To communicate with the programmer, these tools use notifications, which may be textual, visual, or a combination of both. Research has shown that these notifications need improvement in two areas: expressiveness and scalability. In the research described here, I begin an investigation into the expressiveness and scalability of existing program analysis tools and potential improvements in expressiveness and scalability in and across these tools.
