Border surveillance requires regular patrolling to prevent intruders from crossing across, emphasizing the need for an automated network of sensing devices that is capable of detecting and estimating multiple moving targets. This paper proposes a fusion-driven decentralized sensor scheduling scheme that enables dynamic space-time clustering around multiple moving targets for energy-efficient track estimation. Each sensor node runs a Probabilistic Finite State Automata (PFSA) that controls the sensing and communication devices in an energy-efficient manner. This decentralized scheduling scheme is validated and compared with traditional scheduling schemes. The results show that the proposed scheme conserves energy while maintaining accurate track estimation.
