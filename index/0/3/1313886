This paper advocates the use of games in teaching NLP/CL in cases where computational experiments are impossible because the students lack the necessary skills. To show the viability of this approach, three games are described which together teach students about the parsing process. The paper also shows how the specific game formats and rules can be tuned to the teaching goals and situations, thus opening the way to the creation of further teaching games.
