Several data base machine architectures have been proposed in the past few years. The next generation of these machines must simultaneously support different data models on the same physical data. One approach to this problem, GDBMS, has recently been described in the literature. This paper presents the architecture of another approach: the well-connected relation computer (WCRC). The architectures of these two computers are compared, and a preliminary performance evaluation showing that WCRC requires less storage and has faster query response time is presented.
