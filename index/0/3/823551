News articles often contain information about the future. Given the huge volume of information available nowadays, an automatic way for extracting and summarizing future-related information is desirable. Such information will allow people to obtain a collective image of the future, to recognize possible future scenarios and be prepared for the future events. We propose a model-based clustering algorithm for detecting future events based on information extracted from a text corpus. The algorithm takes into account both textual and temporal similarity of sentences. We demonstrate that our algorithm can be used to discover future events and estimate their probabilities over time.
