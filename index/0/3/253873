A design for a highly parallel data structure store for the prototype Manchester Dataflow Computer is presented. The main design objective is to allow all storage functions to be performed concurrently. The functions include space allocation and garbage collection, as well as operations for reading and writing the store. The resulting design is scalable in that an incremental increase in performance for any function can be achieved by adding appropriate hardware modules into the system. A relative balance in performance between the different functions can therefore be achieved. In the hardware structure store, the logical and the physical function units are designed separately. This increases flexibility for configuring multiprocessor dataflow systems. A single hardware module performing all the functions has been constructed and attached to the prototype Manchester Dataflow Machine. The performance of this configuration is discussed.
