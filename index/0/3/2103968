We investigate the problem of non-covariant behavior of policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithms. The policy gradient approach is amenable to analysis by information geometric methods. This leads us to propose a natural metric on controller parameterization that results from considering the manifold of probability distributions over paths induced by a stochastic controller. Investigation of this approach leads to a covariant gradient ascent rule. Interesting properties of this rule are discussed, including its relation with actor-critic style reinforcement learning algorithms. The algorithms discussed here are computationally quite efficient and on some interesting problems lead to dramatic performance improvement over noncovariant rules.
