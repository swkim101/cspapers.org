Wikipedia has become one of the most important sources of information available all over the world. However, the categorization of Wikipedia articles is not standardized and the searches are mainly performed on keywords rather than concepts. In this paper we present an application that builds a hierarchical structure to organize all Wikipedia entries, so that medical articles can be reached from general to particular, using the well known Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus. Moreover, the language links between articles will allow using the directory created in different languages. The final system can be packed and ported to mobile devices as a standalone offline application.
