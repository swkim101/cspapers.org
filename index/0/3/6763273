We developed a system that enables on-body touch interaction using capacitive sensing with printed epidermal electrodes. Custom-made with commonly available ink and lm, the electrodes can be easily tailored to support specic interactions on certain parts of the body. The lm being placed onto the skin, somatosensory stimuli of both active touch (touching) and passive touch (being touched) can be perceived by the user, which is expected to enhance on-body touch interactions in dierent situations.
