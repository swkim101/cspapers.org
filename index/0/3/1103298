This paper describes a Japanese language semantic analyzer based on an extended case frame model, which consists of a relatively large collection of case relations, modalities and conjunctive relations. The analyzer performs four stage analysis using a frame type knowledge base. It also utilizes plausibility scores for dealing with ambiguities and local scene frames for the prediction of omitted case elements.
