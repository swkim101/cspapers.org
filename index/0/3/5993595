Surprisingly simple corollaries from the Courant-Fischer minimax characterization theorem enable us to devise a very effective algorithm for the evaluation of a set S interleaving the set E of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix Tn (as well a.s a point that splits E into two subsets of comparable cardinalities). As a result, we dramatically decrease the previous record upper estimates for the parallel complexity of the eigenvalue computation for a symmetric tridiagonal matrix (which is a major computational problem in linear algebra); our new upper bounds are within polylogarithmic factors from the information lower bounds. The algorithm can be extended to approximating to the zeros of a polynomial that ha-s only real zeros (aa an alternative to the algorithm of [BOT]).
