Despite novel interaction techniques proposed for virtual desktops, common yet challenging tasks remain to be investigated. Dragging and dropping between overlapping windows is one of them. The fold-and-drop technique presented here offers a natural and efficient way of performing those tasks. We show how this technique successfully builds upon several interaction paradigms previously described, while shedding new light on them.
