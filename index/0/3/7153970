 
 Motivated by the problem of building a basic reasoner for general game playing with imperfect information, we address the problem of filtering with logic programs, whereby an agent updates its incomplete knowledge of a program by observations. We develop a filtering method by adapting an existing backward-chaining and abduction method for so-called open logic programs. Experimental results show that this provides a basic effective and efficient "legal" player for general imperfect-information games.
