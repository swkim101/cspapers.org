This paper gives the first optimal bounds for classical closed hashing schemes in the case of limited randomness. We thereby establish the first proof of optimality for hashing arbitrarily selected data, by virtually any classical closed scheme, with hash functions that are programmable and initialized by a small number of random bits. Let D = (xl , x 2 , . . . , x ~ ) be a sequence of a n distinct search keys, for a < 1, belonging to the universe U = {0, 1 , . . . , m } . The objective is to hash D into a search table without the use of pointers and without relocating placed items. We show that for any fixed load a < 1, universal classes of c log n-wise independent hash functions yield the same expected performance as fully random hash functions for u n i f o r m hashing, l i n ea r probing, and d o u b l e hashing. Tha t is, the expected number of probes to insert the an th item is asymptotically the same for clog n-wise independent functions as for idealized fully random hash functions. It follows that O(loglog m + log s n) random bits suffice for these hash schemes. In addition, this relationship holds for the expected rth moment of the probe count, for any
