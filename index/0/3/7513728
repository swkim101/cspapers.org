A dramatic trend in computing is the adoption of multi-core technology by the vendors from which our current and future HPC systems are being derived. Multi-core is offered as a path to continued reliance and benefits of Moore's Law while reining in the previously unfettered growth of power consumption and design complexity. Are we saved? or is it but a fools mission, trapping us in a technical cul de sac with no long term direction and no way to reinvent an alternative future. The panel will consider the following questions:* Can multi-core span the next decade of Moore's Law progression?* Are the pins and caches a strangle hold on the future effectiveness of multi-core?* Can innovative algorithmic techniques exploit the opportunities and address the challenges of multi-core?* How will programming models and supporting system software change to accommodate the unique properties and peculiarities of multi-core structures?
