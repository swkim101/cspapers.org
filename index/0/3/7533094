The introduction of consumer RGB-D scanners set off a major boost in 3D computer vision research. Yet, the precision of existing depth scanners is not accurate enough to recover fine details of a scanned object. While modern shading based depth refinement methods have been proven to work well with Lambertian objects, they break down in the presence of specularities. We present a novel shape from shading framework that addresses this issue and enhances both diffuse and specular objects' depth profiles. We take advantage of the built-in monochromatic IR projector and IR images of the RGB-D scanners and present a lighting model that accounts for the specular regions in the input image. Using this model, we reconstruct the depth map in real-time. Both quantitative tests and visual evaluations prove that the proposed method produces state of the art depth reconstruction results.
