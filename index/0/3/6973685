This tutorial addresses the problem of the migration of legacy assets to Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) environments. It addresses how to develop a realistic strategy for performing such a migration, taking into account both the business needs of the organization and the technical content of the organizationÂ¿s existing systems portfolio. The tutorial outlines an approach for performing an overall analysis and making decisions on the legacy assets that are candidates for migration. It highlights the challenges of building an SOA-based system and presents development issues from three perspectives: the application developer, the infrastructure developer, and the service provider. The needs and concerns of each of these participants are considered in order to develop successful SOA-based systems.
