We present an innovative architecture that enables the digital 
representation of original works and derivatives while 
implementing Digital Rights Management (DRM) features. The 
architectureâ€™s main focus is on promoting trust within the 
multimedia content value networks rather than solely on content 
access and protection control. The system combines different 
features common in DRM systems such as licensing, content 
protection, authorization and reporting together with innovative 
concepts, such as the linkage of original and derived content and 
the definition of potential rights. The transmission of reporting 
requests across the content value network combined with the 
possibility for authors to preserve rights over derivative works 
enables the system to distribute income amongst all the actors 
involved in different steps of the creation and distribution chain. 
The implementation consists of a web application which 
interacts with different external services plus a desktop user 
application used to render protected content. It is currently 
publicly accessible for evaluation.
