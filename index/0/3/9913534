This paper deals with easy programming methods of dual-arm manipulation tasks for humanoid robots. Hereby a programming by demonstration system is used in order to observe, learn and generalize tasks performed by humans. A classification for dual-arm manipulations is introduced, enabling a segmentation of tasks into adequate subtasks. Further it is shown how the generated programs are mapped on and executed by a humanoid robot.
