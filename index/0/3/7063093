The structure and capability of Computing Systems and resources are constantly changing. Often overlooked is the importance of this input in the derivation of requirements for directions in Software Engineering. Many of our initial Software tools were developed with a single sequential machine in mind. The concepts of parallelism and concurrency have also had a great deal of influence in directing research in Software Engineering. We are now well into the age of micro-processors and Distributed Systems. This talk explores the question, “Are we addressing Software Engineering for such systems with the fervor we expended on the super-systems?” “Are tools and techniques adaptable to the system of the 80's, and if so, to what degree?” Finally, “What are the requirements that will be imposed on Software Engineering research for computing structures of the 80's?”
