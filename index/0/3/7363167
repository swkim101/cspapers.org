To address the problem of accurate timing characterization, this paper proposes a method that fully exploits mode dependency. It is based on the premise that circuit delays are determined largely by a set of control inputs for which the number of useful combinations, i.e., modes, is small for most practical circuits. We take the mode-dependent characterization approach further and enhance it so that the delays of the I/O paths between the control inputs and outputs are calculated more accurately. We prove that, with a careful choice of propagation conditions, our method can generate timing models with very tight path delays that are guaranteed to give correct results. Experimental results using real-life circuits show that cir-cuit delays can vary significantly among different modes for both control and data input delays, and capturing this variation can have a significant impact on the overall system timing.
