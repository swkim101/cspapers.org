This paper presents the problem of using the controlled substitution-permutation networks (CSPNs) based on controlled elements (CEs) for designing fast block ciphers suitable to cheap hardware implementation. By studying the properties of the CSPNs of different types CEs, we select a suitable CE and CSPN for propose algorithm and design of a new fast block cipher XO-64. Security estimations of XO-64 cipher with NEISSE criteria and differential cryptanalysis show that proposed cipher is high-level security. The synthesis results for hardware implementation (FPGA) prove that XO-64 is very efficient new cipher, especially for wireless devices.
