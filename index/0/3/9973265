This paper presents the machine description language LISA for the generation of bit- and cycle-accurate models of DSP processors. Based on a behavioral operation description, the architectural details and pipeline operations of modern DSP processors can be covered. Beyond the behavioral model, LISA descriptions include other architecture-related information like the instruction set. The information provided by LISA models enables automatic generation of simulators and assemblers which are essential elements of DSP software development environments. In order to proof the applicability of our approach, a realized model of the Texas Instruments TMS320C6201 DSP is presented and derived LISA code examples are given.
