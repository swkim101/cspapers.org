The Speech Transcription Analysis Tool (STAT) is an open source tool for aligning and comparing two phonetically transcribed texts of human speech. The output analysis is a parameterized set of phonological differences. These differences are based upon a selectable set of binary phonetic features such as [voice], [continuant], [high], etc. STAT was initially designed to provide sets of phonological speech patterns in the comparisons of various English accents found in the Speech Accent Archive http://accent.gmu.edu, but its scope and utility expand to matters of language assessment, phonetic training, forensic linguistics, and speech recognition.
