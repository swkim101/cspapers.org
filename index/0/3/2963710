It is all too often the case that CS students learn concepts of mathematical reasoning in a required discrete math course, but fail to apply what they have learned to their CS courses. This may occur because the courses are taught in different departments with little communication between faculty members, so that different terminology may be used in the math course from what is used in the CS curriculum, making it seem as though these two areas are not connected. Even when discrete math faculty collaborate with CS course instructors, students may not carry over what they learned into their CS curriculum.
