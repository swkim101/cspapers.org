A classic result in the analysis of data structures is that path compression with linking by rank solves the disjoint set union problem in almost-constant amortized time per operation. Recent experiments suggest that in practice, a naive linking method works just as well if not better than linking by rank, in spite of being theoretically inferior. How can this be? We prove that randomized linking is asymptotically as efficient as linking by rank. This result provides theory that matches the experiments, which implicitly do randomized linking as a result of the way the input instances are generated.
