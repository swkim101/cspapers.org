National and international standards committees are now discussing a two-byte code for multilingual information processing. This provides for 65,536 separate character and control codes, enough to make permanent code assignments for all the characters of all national alphabets of the world, and also to include Chinese/Japanese characters.This paper discusses the kinds of flexibility required to handle both Roman and non-Roman alphabets. It is crucial to separate information units (codes) from graphic forms, to maximize processing power.Comparing alphabets around the world, we find that the graphic devices (letters, digraphs, accent marks, punctuation, spacing, etc.) represent a very limited number of information units. It is possible to arrange alphabet codes to provide transliteration equivalence, the best of three solutions compared as a framework for code assignments.
