DOCIL is a system that have been designed in order to produce the layout of a two side PCB from the data the human designer usually deals with. Two conditions that have been set for the system. First it is portability and second a small system feasibility. We will speak of this later. This work is composed by two parts: First of them a board description language, and second a routing algorithm.
 The language is used to specify the characteristics of the problem such as board size, scales of the drawing, composing elements and its position, connections to be done, etc.
 ording to some specific criteria. Its originality consists on the stating of the problem. It attempts to connect a point to a cluster of points already connected by generating horizontal and vertical segments each on a different side of the board as usual. Once a chain of segments connecting the point to the partial connection has been found this chain is added to the partial connection. The procedure goes on until all the points are connected. Initially the partial connection may be reduced to a point.
 The generation of new segment is regulated by evaluation function. A value of this function is associated with each possible segment.
 As it has been indicated, horizontal segments go on one side and verticals on the other. Once routing complete a procedure is performed in order to remove unnecessary changes of sides.
