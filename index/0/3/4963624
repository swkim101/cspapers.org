We present a new point set registration method with global-local correspondence and transformation estimation (GL-CATE). The geometric structures of point sets are exploited by combining the global feature, the point-to-point Euclidean distance, with the local feature, the shape distance (SD) which is based on the histograms generated by an elliptical Gaussian soft count strategy. By using a bidirectional deterministic annealing scheme to directly control the searching ranges of the two features, the mixture-feature Gaussian mixture model (MGMM) is constructed to recover the correspondences of point sets. A new vector based structure constraint term is formulated to regularize the transformation. The accuracy of transformation updating is improved by constraining spatial structure at both global and local scales. An annealing scheme is applied to progressively decrease the strength of the regularization and to achieve the maximum overlap. Both of the aforementioned processes are incorporated in the EM algorithm, a unified optimization framework. We test the performances of our GL-CATE in contour registration, sequence images, real images, medical images, fingerprint images and remote sensing images, and compare with eight state-of-the-art methods where our GL-CATE shows favorable performances in most scenarios.
