Autonomous mobile robots are employed to perform increasingly complex tasks which require appropriate task descriptions, accurate object recognition, and dexterous object manipulation. In this paper we will address three key questions: How to obtain appropriate task descriptions from natural language (NL) instructions, how to choose the control program to perform a task description, and how to recognize and manipulate the objects referred by a task description? We describe an evaluated robotic agent which takes a natural language instruction stating a step of DNA extraction procedure as a starting point. The system is able to transform the textual instruction into an abstract symbolic plan representation. It can reason about the representation and answer queries about what, how, and why it is done. The robot selects the most appropriate control programs and robustly coordinates all manipulations required by the task description. The execution is based on a perception sub-system which is able to locate and recognize the objects and instruments needed in the DNA extraction procedure.
