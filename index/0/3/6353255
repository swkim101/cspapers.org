Use of minimal windows enhances the aB algorithm in practical applications as well as in the search of artificially constructed game trees. Nevertheless, there exists no theoretical model to measure the strengths and weaknesses of minimal window search. In particular, it is not known which tree ordering properties are favorable for minimal window search. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of minimal window search based on recursive equations which assess the influence of static node values on the dynamic search process. The analytical model is computationally simple, easily extendible and gives a realistic estimate of the expected search time for averagely ordered game trees. 1 In t roduc t ion
