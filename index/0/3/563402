An algorithm for unifying the techniques of gate sizing and clock skew optimization for acyclic pipelines is presented. In the design of circuits under very tight timing specifications, the area overhead of gate sizing can be considerable. The procedure utilizes the idea of cycle-borrowing using clock skew optimization to relax the stringency of the timing specification on the critical stages of the pipeline. Experimental results verify that cycle-borrowing using sizing+skew results in a better overall area-delay tradeoff than with sizing alone.
