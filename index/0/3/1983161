A feature extraction method for speech waves and an algorithm for sentence recognition are studied. The feature extraction is based on an articulatory model constructed from the statistical analysis of X-ray data. The model holds implicitly the physiological constraints and made possible to estimate the state of the articulatory mechanism. The estimated articulatory parameters provide a set of good features for the speech recognition. The sentence recognition problem is mathematically formulated as an optimization problem with constraints by introducing sentence structures from the syntactic and semantic considerations. The algorithm presents an optimal solution in the Bayesian sense.
