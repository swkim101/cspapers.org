New Dimensions in Testimony is a prototype dialogue system that allows users to conduct a conversation with a real person who is not available for conversation in real time. Users talk to a persistent representation of Holocaust survivor Pinchas Gutter on a screen, while a dialogue agent selects appropriate responses to user utterances from a set of pre-recorded video statements, simulating a live conversation. The technology is similar to existing conversational agents, but to our knowledge this is the first system to portray a real person. The demonstration will show the system on a range of screens (from mobile phones to large TVs), and allow users to have individual conversations with Mr. Gutter.
