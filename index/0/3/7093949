In this paper, we present a new bicriteria approximation algorithm for the degree- bounded minimum spanning tree problem. In this problem, we are given an undirected graph, a nonnegative cost function on the edges, and a positive integer B ∗ , and the goal is to find a minimum- cost spanning tree T with maximum degree at most B ∗ .I n ann-node graph, our algorithm finds a spanning tree with maximum degree O(B∗ + log n) and cost O( opt B∗ ), where opt B∗ is the minimum cost of any spanning tree whose maximum degree is at most B ∗ . Our algorithm uses ideas from Lagrangean duality. We show how a set of optimum Lagrangean multipliers yields bounds on both the degree and the cost of the computed solution.
