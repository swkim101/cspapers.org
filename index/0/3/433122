Recent work has shown marry advantages to randomly wired expander-based networks. Unfortunately, the win”ng complexity of such networks becomesphysically problematic as they become large. This paper introduces a technique for sca3ing expanders that avoids this wirr”ng complexity. Specifically, we make the following contributions: 1. We introduce hierarchical expanders, which use a method of scaling small expanders to larger ones while ma”nta”m”ng practical physical construction. We present an example of such a scalable network, called the metabutterjly, which is scaled from the randomJy wired multibutterfly. 2. We present a proof that we can scale any (cY,/?, M, N)exprmder with dbf > 1 into an (a’,,@, kM, kN) -expander with probability at least 1 – 2e–a M, where a’ = ~2e~~4=
