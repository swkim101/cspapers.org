The midbrain of the barn owl contains a map-like representation of sound source direction which is used to precisely orient the head toward targets of interest. Elevation is computed from the interaural difference in sound level. We present models and computer simulations of two stages of level difference processing which qualitatively agree with known anatomy and physiology, and make several striking predictions.
