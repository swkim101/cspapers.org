We consider the users who share a specific online news article on a social media platform. This group is the news crowd of the article, an analogy with the crowd of passersby that gathers around any incident on a busy street. First, we look at the volume and the diversity of the social media conversations of the crowd around the given news item. We observe that there are strikingly different patterns that separate “hard” news from editorial/opinion articles. The statistics we extract from social media can help produce improved predictions of the effective life of a news article on the web, and of the total number of visits it will receive in the future [1]. The improvement is more pronounced in the case of opinion/editorial pieces which are less predictable and longer-lived.
