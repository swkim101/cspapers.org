Micro- and nanosized objects aligned in specific spatial order are of great interest for applications in photonics and nanoelectronics. In particular, piezo-actuated robotic setups are promising tools to arrange and manipulate these objects individually. However, automated robotic processing on the sub-micron scale remains challenging due to the force scaling laws and the limited possibilities in terms of control. This paper presents the current progress on fully-automated pick-and-place routines of individual colloidal particles using a dedicated dual-probe setup inside a scanning electron microscope. Applying tailored probes in combination with image processing of the visual feedback provided by the microscope allow for complex automation sequences. The limits of the current technique are highlighted and the challenges for automated processing of progressively smaller particles are discussed.
