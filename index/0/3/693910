We present a machine learning framework for resolving other-anaphora. Besides morpho-syntactic, recency, and semantic features based on existing lexical knowledge resources, our algorithm obtains additional semantic knowledge from the Web. We search the Web via lexico-syntactic patterns that are specific to other-anaphors. Incorporating this innovative feature leads to an 11.4 percentage point improvement in the classifier's F-measure (25% improvement relative to results without this feature).
