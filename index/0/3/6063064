In the paper new functionalities for design databases are proposed which are necessary to improve a cooperative work of design team members. These functionalities mainly concern versioning aspects of design environments. First, new versioning technique, called delayed versionning, is proposed. This technique supports designers working in shared environments. It substantially increases a concurrency degree of designers transactions. Next, a new versioning concept, called temporary database version, is introduced. Its purpose is to isolate long-duration read-only transactions from other transactions, in order to maximize the system efficiency. Afterwards, a new technique for transactions savepoints management is proposed. It supports long-duration transactions which are often rolled back to particular points of corresponding design activities, due to unsatisfactory directions of the design evolution. Finally, a solution for useless design environments removaf is proposed. All the functionalities mentioned above are currently implemented in the multiversion database prototype.
