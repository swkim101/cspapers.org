It is often difficult to teach dynamic data structures such as linked lists by modeling them on a static medium such as a white board or slides. This lightning talk introduces Dynamic Data Structures-Linked List (DDS-LL), an HTML5 browser application that allows the user to build and manipulate graphical models of linked lists. DDS-LL is not an algorithm visualization tool. Instead the user models their data using only actions that are consistent with a language such as Java. Nodes must be instantiated and linked together. Lists must be traversed to access a node. Reference assignment is modeled by dragging links. DDS-LL removes the old links, keeping the model accurate. With the wrong reference assignment, garbage can be created. Though still under development, DDS-LL has been used in an introductory data structures course to motivate linked lists, trace algorithms, and model scenarios. Its use provided several benefits. Scenarios can be prepared ahead of time. Models can be manipulated without drawing/erasing the white board. Scenarios can be quickly reloaded in response to student questions. Since the original intent of this tool was to assist the instructor with modeling linked lists, no attempt was made at this time to measure the impact on student engagement or learning. After a quick introduction to DDS-LL, this talk discusses the instructor's experience using it in the classroom, and presents some possible enhancements, including features to allow the tool to be used for student assignments. Handouts and links to online resources will be provided at the talk.
