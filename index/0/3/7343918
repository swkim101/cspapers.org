We prove lower bounds on the redundancy necessary to represent a set S of objects using a number of bits close to the information-theoretic minimum log<sub>2</sub> |S|, while answering various queries by probing few bits. Our main results are: To represent n ternary values t ∈ {0,1,2}<sup>n</sup> in terms of u bits b ∈ {0,1}<sup>u</sup> while accessing a single value t<sub>i</sub> ∈ {0,1,2} by probing q bits of b, one needs u ≥ (log<sub>2</sub> 3)n + n/2<sup>O(q)</sup>. This matches an exciting representation by Patrascu (FOCS 2008), later refined with Thorup, where u ≤ (log_2 3)n + n/2<sup>Ω(q)</sup>. We also note that results on logarithmic forms imply the lower bound u ≥ (log<sub>2</sub> 3)n + n/log<sup>O(1)</sup> n if we access t<sub>i</sub> by probing one cell of log n bits. To represent sets of size n/3 from a universe of n elements in terms of u bits b ∈ {0,1}<sup>u</sup> while answering membership queries by probing q bits of b, one needs u ≥ log<sub>2</sub> n/(n/3) + n/2<sup>O(q)</sup> - log n. Both results above hold even if the probe locations are determined adaptively. Ours are the first lower bounds for these fundamental problems; we obtain them drawing on ideas used in lower bounds for locally decodable codes.
