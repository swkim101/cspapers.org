The prevalence of temporal references across all types of natural language utterances makes temporal analysis a key issue in Natural Language Processing. This work adresses three research questions: 1/is temporal expression recognition specific to a particular domain? 2/if so, can we characterize domain specificity? and 3/how can subdomain specificity be integrated in a single tool for unified temporal expression extraction? Herein, we assess temporal expression recognition from documents written in French covering three domains. We present a new corpus of clinical narratives annotated for temporal expressions , and also use existing corpora in the newswire and historical domains. We show that temporal expressions can be extracted with high performance across domains (best F-measure 0.96 obtained with a CRF model on clinical narratives). We argue that domain adaptation for the extraction of temporal expressions can be done with limited efforts and should cover pre-processing as well as temporal specific tasks.
