In this demo we present AMETHYST, a system for exploring and analyzing a topical hierarchy constructed from a heterogeneous information network (HIN). HINs, composed of multiple types of entities and links are very common in the real world. Many have a text component, and thus can benefit from a high quality hierarchical organization of the topics in the network dataset. By organizing the topics into a hierarchy, AMETHYST helps understand search results in the context of an ontology, and explain entity relatedness at different granularities. The automatically constructed topical hierarchy reflects a domain-specific ontology, interacts with multiple types of linked entities, and can be tailored for both free text and OLAP queries.
