This paper describes a new memory estimation technique for DSP applications written in an applicative language. Since no concept of storage is present in an applicative language, the compiler has to derive the memory needs. For each array, the number of storage locations is estimated by modelling both, the dependencies and the sequence of execution. For this, an arrayspecific production time axis is created and the current production date is compared with the production date of the consumed signal. It is formulated as an integer linear problem.
