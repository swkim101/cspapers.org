There are low bit and high bit hiding algorithms in the spatial domain. The paper proposes a new algorithm. First, divide the cover image into three-pixel blocks. Then, use Arnold transformation to scramble the secret image. Eventually, modify the pixel values to hiding information according to the corresponding mode of size relations and numbers. The experimental results show that the algorithm realizes easily and has big hiding capacity, good security and invisibility. When the embedding rate is up to 98.8%, the peak signal to noise ratio PSNR is Â¿38dB.
