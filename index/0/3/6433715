DNSSEC is designed to prevent network attackers from tampering with domain name system (DNS) messages. The cryptographic machinery used in DNSSEC, however, also creates a new vulnerability|zone enumeration, where an adversary launches a small number of online DNSSEC queries and then uses oine dictionary attacks to learn which domain names are present or absent in a DNS zone. We propose a new cryptographic construction that solves the problem of DNSSEC zone enumeration while remaining faithful to the operational realities of DNSSEC. NSEC5 can be thought of as a variant of NSEC3, where deterministic RSA-based keyed hashing scheme is used instead of an unkeyed hash function. With NSEC5, nameservers hold an RSA hashing key and perform an online public-key signature for each query. However, unlike existing DNSSEC online signing solutions (RFC 4470), leaking this RSA hashing key can only compromise protection against zone enumeration, but does not harm the integrity of the zone in any way. Put another way, leaking the RSA hashing key only downgrades the security of NSEC5 back to that of NSEC3. Moreover, we prove that online public-key operations are necessary to prevent zone enumeration. Specically, we prove that security against network attackers and privacy against zone enumeration cannot be satised simultaneously unless the DNSSEC server performs online public-key cryptographic operations.
