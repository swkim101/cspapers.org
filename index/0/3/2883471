To understand a speaker's turn of a conversation, one needs to segment it into intonational phrases, clean up any speech repairs that might have occurred, and identify discourse markers. In this paper, we argue that these problems must be resolved together, and that they must be resolved early in the processing stream. We put forward a statistical language model that resolves these problem, does POS tagging, and can be used as the language model of a speech recognizer. We find that by accounting for the interactions between these tasks that the performance on each task improves, as does POS tagging and perplexity.
