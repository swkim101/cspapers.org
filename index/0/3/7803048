This is the first successful trial in the world to remotely control a humanoid robot so as to drive an industrial vehicle (backhoe) outdoors in lieu of human operator. Furthermore, the robot's operation was controlled while having it wear protective clothing to protect it against the rain and dust outside. This is too marks a world-first success demonstrating the humanoid robot's capability of performing outdoor work even in the rain. These results were achieved thanks to the development of the following three technologies: (1) the "remote control technology" for instructing the humanoid robot to perform total body movements under remote control and the "remote control system" for executing the remote control tasks; (2) the "protection technology" for protecting the humanoid robot against shock and vibrations of its operating sets and against the influences of the natural environment such as rain and dust; and (3) "full-body operation control technology" for controlling the humanoid robot's total capability to prevent the robot from falling over. The humanoid robot has a promising application potential for restoration work in environments struck by catastrophes and in civil engineering and construction project sites where it can "work" safely and smoothly.
