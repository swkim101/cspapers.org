Nowadays children as young as two years old can easily interact with mobile touch screen devices and personal computers to watch online videos through services such as YouTube. However, such services present a number of challenges for young children (e.g. fine grain gestures/interactions and good typing/literacy skills). In addition, when children use such services there is a risk that they may stumble upon content that is inappropriate. YooSee is a web-based application developed using the PuppyIR framework and designed for children aged between two and six years old. YooSee enables children to: (1) search and browse through video content using an engaging, novel interaction paradigm, and (2) be able to safely enjoy moderated video content.
