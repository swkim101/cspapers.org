Because it is difficult to engineer a complex ontology with time, we here consider a method that allows for factorizing the complexity of the engineering process, FONTE (Factorizing ONTology Engineering complexity). FONTE divides the engineering task into building a time-less domain ontology and a temporal theory independently from each other. FONTE provides an operator that assembles the two independently developed ontologies into the targeted ontology. We investigate the quality of the proposed operator by applying it to a practical case study, viz. the engineering of an ontology about researchers including temporal interactions.
