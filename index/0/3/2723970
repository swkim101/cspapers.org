Symbolic execution can help clarify the behavior implied by a program specification without implementing that specification, and can thereby assist the difficult process of developing a correct specification. However, symbolic execution of specifications poses problems that do not arise in symbolic execution of ordinary programming languages. We describe a symbolic evaluator, named KOKO, for the Gist specification language, and show how it copes with such high-level constructs as nondeterminism, constraints, and reference by description.
