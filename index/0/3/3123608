This paper explores the use of a model neural network for motor learning. Steinbuch and Taylor presented neural network designs to do nearest neighbor lookup in the early 1960s. In this paper their nearest neighbor network is augmented with a local model network, which fits a local model to a set of nearest neighbors. The network design is equivalent to local regression. This network architecture can represent smooth nonlinear functions, yet has simple training rules with a single global optimum. The network has been used for motor learning of a simulated arm and a simulated running machine.
