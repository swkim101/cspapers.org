There are a variety of main-memory access structures, such as segment trees, and quad trees, whose properties, such as good worstcase behaviour, make them attractive for database applicdions. Unfortunately, the structures are typically ‘long and skinny’, whereas disk data structuies must be ‘shortand-fat (that is, have a high fanout and low height) in order to minimize I/O. We consider how to cluster the nodes (that is, map the nodes to disk pages) of mainmemory access structures such that although a path may traverse many nodes, it only traverses a few disk pages. The number of disk pages traversed in a path is called the external path length. We address several versions of the clustering problem. We present a clustering algorithm for tree structures that generates optimal worst-case external path length mappings; we also show how to make it dynamic, to support updates. We extend the algorithm to generate mappings that minimize the average weighted external path lengths. We also show that some other clustering problems, such as finding optimal external path lengths for DAG structures and minimizing Permission to copy without fee all or part of this material ia granted provided that the copies are not made or distributed foT direct commercial advantage, the VLDB copyright notice and the title of the publication and its date appear, and notice is given that copying ia by permission of the Very Lal-ge Data Base Endowment.

We present a performance stuay (using quadtrees on actual image data as an example) which shows that our algorithms perform well. Our algorithms can also be applied for clustering complex objects in object-oriented databases.
