As a step toward automatic circuit understanding, we have developed a method for parsing circuit topology in a deductive system called Duck. A circuit is viewed as a sentence and its elements as words. Generating circuits with specific functions is represented by deductive rules analogous to definite clause grammars. Using those rules, an object circuit is decomposed into a parse tree of functional blocks in terms of logic programming.
