It is well known that clickthrough data can be used to improve the effectiveness of search results: broadly speaking, a query's past clicks are a predictor of future clicks on documents. However, when a new or unusual query appears, or when a system is not as widely used as a mainstream web search system, there may be little to no click data available to improve the results. Existing methods to boost query performance for sparse queries extend the query-document click relationship to more documents or queries, but require substantial clickthrough data from other queries. In this work we describe a way to boost rarely-clicked queries in a system where limited clickthrough data is available for all queries. We describe a probabilistic approach for carrying out that estimation and use it to rerank retrieved documents. We utilize information from co-click queries, subset queries, and synonym queries to estimate the clickthrough for a sparse query. Our experiments on a query log from a medical informatics company demonstrate that when overall clickthrough data is sparse, reranking search results using clickthrough information from related queries significantly outperforms reranking that employs clickthrough information from the query alone.
