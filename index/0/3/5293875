In the last decade, many researchers have studied the use of game elements in education. The term "gamification" refers to the application of elements used in the development of video games, such as mechanics and dynamics in other contexts unrelated to games, in order to generate more enjoyable and positive attitudes from the students. The gamication process involves using several elements present in video games, like: points, levels, rankings, rewards (badges/achievements) and missions. In this study, we assess whether or not, gamification elements can help and motivate students enrolled in a gamified ontology-based adaptive online learning environment called MeuTutor. In this context, we followed the Pedagogical Recommendation Process to discover which gamification elements were relevant to promote learning, in order to recommend improvements to the environment. To do that, this study shows a quantitative analysis(correlation analysis) of the gamification elements from MeuTutor.
