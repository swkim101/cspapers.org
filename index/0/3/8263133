In this paper we present a new monochromatic pattern for a robust structured light coding based on the spatial neighborhood scheme using the M-array approach. The proposed pattern is robust as it allows a high error rate characterized by an average Hamming distance higher than 6. We tackle the design problem with the definition of a small set of symbols associated to simple geometrical primitives. One of these primitives embeds the local orientation of the pattern. This is helpful while performing the search for the relevant neighborhood during the decoding process. The aim of this work is to use this pattern for the real-time 3-D reconstruction of dynamic scenes, particularly in endoscopic surgery, with fast and reliable detection and decoding stages. Ongoing results are presented to assess both the capabilities of the proposed pattern and the reliable decoding algorithm with projections onto simple 3-D scenes and onto internal structures of a pig abdomen.
