We consider the paging problem where the pages have varying size This problem has applications to page replacement policies for caches containing World Wide Web documents We consider two models for the cost of an algorithm on a request sequence In the rst the Fault model the goal is to minimize the number of page faults In the second the Bit model the goal is to minimize the total number of bits that have to be read into the cache We show o ine algorithms for both cost models that obtain approximation factors of O log k where k is the ratio of the size of the cache to the size of the smallest page We show randomized online algorithms for both cost models that are O log k competitive In addition if the input sequence is generated by a known distribution we show an algorithm for the Fault model whose expected cost is within a factor of O log k of any other online algorithm
