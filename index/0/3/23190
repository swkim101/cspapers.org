Most of them focus on the matrix completion problem in real number domain, and produce continuous prediction values. However, these methods are not appropriate in some occasions where the entries of matrix are discrete values, such as movie ratings prediction, social network relation and interaction prediction, because their continuous outputs are not probabilities and uninterpretable. In this case, an additional step to process the continuous results with either heuristic threshold parameters or complicated mapping is necessary, while it is inefficient and may diverge from the optimal solution. There are a few matrix completion methods working on discrete number domain, however, they are not applicable to sparse and large-scale data set. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal discrete matrix completion model, which is able to learn optimal thresholds automatically and also guarantees an exact low-rank structure of the target matrix. We use stochastic gradient descent algorithm with momentum method to optimize the new objective function and speed up optimization. In the experiments, it is proved that our method can predict discrete values with high accuracy, very close to or even better than these values obtained by carefully tuned thresholds on Movielens and YouTube data sets. Meanwhile, our model is able to handle online data and easy to parallelize.
