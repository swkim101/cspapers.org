A computer oriented algorithm for symbolically expanding Boolean expressions containing “and”, “or”, and “complement” operators into their disjuntive normal form is presented. The algorithm consists of two parts in sequence. The first part applies the DeMorgan's laws, and the second part applies the distributive laws. Each part scans the expression only once, and performs the expansion directly while analysing the syntax. The one-pass feature is achieved through a syntax-oriented recursive approach. The most commonly used symbolic convention is assumed for the input and output expressions. The algorithm is believed to be machine-independent and efficient, and it can be easily implemented even on a small computer. The algorithm is found particulary useful in automation of switching circuit simplification and diagnostic test generation.
