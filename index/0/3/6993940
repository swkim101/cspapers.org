Mobile computing is considered of major importance to the computing industry for the forthcoming years due to the progress in the wireless communications area. A proxy-based architecture for accelerating Web browsing in cellular customer premises networks (CPN) is presented. Proxy caches, maintained in base stations, are constantly relocated to accompany the roaming user. A cache management scheme is proposed, which involves the relocation of full caches to the most probable cells but also percentages of the caches to less likely neighbors. Relocation is performed according to a movement prediction algorithm based on a learning automaton. The simulation of the scheme demonstrates substantial benefits for the end user.
