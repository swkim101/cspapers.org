Text produced by processing signals intended for human use is often noisy for automated computer processing. Digital text produced in informal settings such as online chat, SMS, emails, tweets, message boards, newsgroups, blogs, wikis and web pages contain considerable noise. Also processing techniques like Automatic Speech Recognition, Optical Character Recognition and Machine Translation introduce processing noise. People are adept when it comes to pattern recognition tasks involving typeset or handwritten documents or recorded speech, machines less-so.
