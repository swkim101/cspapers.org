This paper reports a cross-benchmark evaluation of regularized logistic regression (LR) and incremental Rocchio for adaptive filtering. Using four corpora from the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) forum and the Text Retrieval Conferences (TREC) we evaluated these methods with non-stationary topics at various granularity levels, and measured performance with different utility settings. We found that LR performs strongly and robustly in optimizing T11SU (a TREC utility function) while Rocchio is better for optimizing Ctrk (the TDT tracking cost), a high-recall oriented objective function. Using systematic cross-corpus parameter optimization with both methods, we obtained the best results ever reported on TDT5, TREC10 and TREC11. Relevance feedback on a small portion (0.05~0.2%) of the TDT5 test documents yielded significant performance improvements, measuring up to a 54% reduction in Ctrk and a 20.9% increase in T11SU (with b=0.1), compared to the results of the top-performing system in TDT2004 without relevance feedback information.
