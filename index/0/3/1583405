We present a new deformable model technique following a snake-like approach and using a complex Fourier shape descriptors parameterization to efficiently formulate the forces that constrain contour deformation. The method was successfully applied to track the left ventricle’s (LV) endocardial and epicardial boundaries in sequences of shortaxis magnetic resonance images depicting complete cardiac cycles. The extracted shapes show the method’s robustness to weak contrast, noisy edge maps and to papillary muscle anatomy. Our second contribution is a statistical pattern recognition approach for the detection of asynchronous activation of the LV walls. We applied our deformable model method to provide spatio-temporal characterizations of complete cardiac cycles and then designed a linear classifier using the popular combination of Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis. From a database comprising 33 patients, our approach provided a correct classification performance of 90.9% showing its potential in providing improved dyssynchrony characterization as an adjunct to current criteria for selecting patients for therapy, which provided a classification accuracy of just 62.5% on the same database.
