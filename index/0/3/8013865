This paper presents some experimental results on the performance of distributed join algorithms in a local network. Eight different join methods have been implemented in an experimental distributed system, the Crystal multicomputer, and tested for join queries with a variety of relation sizes, join selectivities, and join column value distributions. The results obtained indicate that pipelined join methods outperform sequential methods over a wide range of join queries. It was also found that the communications costs in a local network environment are not a dominant factor with respect to performance, and that shipping a whole relation from one site to another is not an unreasonahle decison as long as it is done in the framework of pipelined algorithms. Two pipelined variants of a centralized nested loops join algorithm (with an index) were found to perform well for many of the queries tested.
