With the coming era of Big Data, hardware implementation of machine learning has become attractive for many applications, such as real-time object recognition and face recognition. The implementation of machine learning algorithms needs intensive memory access, and SRAM is critical for the overall performance. This paper proposes a new design of high speed SRAM for machine learning purposes. With fast access time (cycle time: 650 ps, access time: 350 ps), low sensitivity to temperature variation and high configurability (less than 10% performance difference between 125_rcw_tt vs 0_rcw_tt), the proposed SRAM is a better candidate for hardware machine learning system than the conventional SRAM. Compared with Samsung HL 152, our design has smaller size (121×43 um2 vs 127×44 um2) with half the number of pins ports (12 vs 25) and higher speed (2.2GHz vs 0.8GHz).
