Experimental wireless network research is often very time consuming and requires knowledge of multiple experimentation platforms (JFED, OMF, etc.), thereby hindering innovation specially from non-testbed experts. To foster innovation, this paper presents an intuitive wireless experimentation using the Node-RED framework. Within the framework, drag and drop components are combined to set-up wireless experiments in simulation and testbed environments, configure network stack and execute series of experiments. Furthermore, the intuitiveness of the Node-RED framework is demonstrated by using drag and drop components to optimize multiple conflicting objectives in simulation and in a real-testbed, without requiring advanced testbed knowledge.
