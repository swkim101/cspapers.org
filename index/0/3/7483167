A synthetic neural network simulation of cerebral neocortex was developed based on detailed anatomy and physiology. Processing elements possess temporal nonlinearities and connection patterns similar to those of cortical neurons. The network was able to replicate spatial and temporal integration properties found experimentally in neocortex. A certain level of randomness was found to be crucial for the robustness of at least some of the network's computational capabilities. Emphasis was placed on how synthetic simulations can be of use to the study of both artificial and biological neural networks.
