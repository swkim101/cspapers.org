Large unsupervised latent variable models (LVMs) of text, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation models or Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), are constructed using parallel training algorithms on computational clusters. The memory required to hold LVM parameters forms a bottleneck in training more powerful models. In this paper, we show how the memory required for parallel LVM training can be reduced by partitioning the training corpus to minimize the number of unique words on any computational node. We present a greedy document partitioning technique for the task. For large corpora, our approach reduces memory consumption by over 50%, and trains the same models up to three times faster, when compared with existing approaches for parallel LVM training.
