Optical interconnects are considered to be one of the key solutions for future generation on-chip interconnects. However, energy efficiency is mainly limited by the losses incurred by the optical signals, which considerably reduces the optical power received by the photodetectors. In this paper we propose a differential transmission of the modulated signals, which contributes to improve the transmission of the optical signal power on the receiver side. With this approach, it is possible to reduce the input laser power and increase the energy efficiency of the optical communication. The approach is generic and can be applied to SWSR-, MWSR-, SWMR- and MWMR-like architectures.
