In this paper, we outline a privacy-preserving matching protocol for OSN (online social network) users to find their potential friends. With the proposed protocol, a logged-in user can match her profile with that of an off-line stranger, while both profiles are maximally protected. Our solution successfully eliminates the requirement of "out-of-band" communication channels, which is one of the biggest obstacles facing cryptographic solutions for OSNs.
