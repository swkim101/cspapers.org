A key challenge in multi-source transfer learning is to capture the diverse inter-domain similarities. In this paper, we study different approaches based on Gaussian process models to solve the multi-source transfer regression problem. Precisely, we ﬁrst investigate the feasibility and performance of a family of transfer covariance functions that represent the pairwise similarity of each source and the target domain. We theoretically show that using such a transfer co-variance function for general Gaussian process modelling can only capture the same similarity coefﬁcient for all the sources, and thus may result in unsatisfactory transfer performance. This leads us to propose TC MS Stack , an integrated strategy incorporating the beneﬁts of the transfer covariance function and stacking. Extensive experiments on one synthetic and two real-world datasets, with learning settings of up to 11 sources for the latter, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TC MS Stack .
