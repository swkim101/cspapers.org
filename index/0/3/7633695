An important aspect for the task of grammatical error correction (GEC) that has not yet been adequately explored is adaptation based on the native language (L1) of writers, despite the marked inﬂuences of L1 on second language (L2) writing. In this paper, we adapt a neural network joint model (NNJM) using L1-speciﬁc learner text and integrate it into a statistical machine translation (SMT) based GEC system. Speciﬁcally, we train an NNJM on general learner text (not L1-speciﬁc) and subsequently train on L1-speciﬁc data using a Kullback-Leibler divergence regularized ob-jective function in order to preserve generalization of the model. We incorporate this adapted NNJM as a feature in an SMT-based English GEC system and show that adaptation achieves signiﬁcant F 0 . 5 score gains on English texts written by L1 Chinese, Russian, and Spanish writers.
