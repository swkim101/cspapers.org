In this paper, we propose a new path and viewpoint planning method for a mobile robot with multiple observation strategies. When a mobile robot works in the constructed environments such as indoor, it is very effective and reasonable to attach landmarks on the environment for the vision-based navigation. In that case, it is important for the robot to decide its motion automatically. Therefore, we propose a motion planning method that optimizes the efficiency of the task, the danger of colliding with obstacles, and the accuracy and the ease of the observation according to the situation and the performance of the robots. We also introduce multiple landmark-observation strategies to optimize the motion depending on the number and the configuration of visible landmarks in each place.
