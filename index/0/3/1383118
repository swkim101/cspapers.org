Extensive lexical knowledge is necessary for temporal analysis and planning tasks. We address in this paper a lexical setting that allows for the straightforward incorporation of rich features and structural constraints. We explore a lexical event ordering task, namely determining the likely temporal order of events based solely on the identity of their predicates and arguments. We propose an “edgefactored” model for the task that decomposes over the edges of the event graph. We learn it using the structured perceptron. As lexical tasks require large amounts of text, we do not attempt manual annotation and instead use the textual order of events in a domain where this order is aligned with their temporal order, namely cooking recipes.
