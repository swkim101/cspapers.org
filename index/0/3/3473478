Pedagogical agents have received a large amount of interest in the recent years. Equipped with the ability to express emotions, these agents can influence the user attitudes, perceptions and behaviour. In our study, we are leveraging these emotionally-intelligent pedagogical agents to deliver effective and efficient feedback to students about their programming assignments and also act as a teaching assistant for any general programming related queries. We have integrated the pedagogical agent as part of Web-CAT - an automated online grading tool for students' programs. One of our main objectives is to communicate clearly the feedback about student programs while motivating them to perform better. Displaying the feedback and motivational messages to students all the time can quickly become noise and students tend to ignore them. Our study is to strategically have the pedagogical agent communicate with the student to provide them growth mindset feedback and also provide motivation to improve upon their work. The feedback would be based upon few indicators which would be triggered based on the student's program and the agent would guide the students to the correct solution by providing appropriate suggestions. The students can also voluntarily ask the agent for feedback and areas of improvement in their work. In addition, the agent can also help the students with any programming related queries or ways to fix a specific error encountered in the student's program. We will conduct a user study to gather feedback from students about the influence of the agent in helping them achieve their goal
