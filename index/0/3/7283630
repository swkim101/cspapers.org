To thoroughly comprehend application behavior, programmers need to understand the interactions of objects at runtime. Today, these interactions are often poorly visualized in common IDEs except during debugging. Stacksplorer allows visualizing and traversing potential call stacks in an application even when it is not running by showing callers and called methods in two columns next to the code editor. The relevant information is gathered from the source code automatically.
