We present novel algorithms for the problem of using materialized views to compute answers to SQL queries with grouping and aggregation, in the presence of multiset tables. ln addition to its obvious potential in query optimization, this problem is important in many applications, such as data warehousing, very large transaction recording systems, global information systems and mobile computing, where access to local or cached materialized views may be cheaper than access to the underlying database. Our contributions are the following: First, we show that in the case where the query has grouping and aggregation but the views do not, a view is usable in answering a query only if there is an isomorphism between the view and a portion of the query. Second, when the views also have grouping and aggregation we identify conditions under which the aggregation information present in a view is sufficient to perform the aggregation computations requited in the query. The algorithms we describe for rewriting a query also consider the case in which the rewritten query may be a union of single-block queries. Our approach is a semantic one, in that it detects when the information existing in a view is sufficient to answer a query. In contrast, previous work performed syntactic transformations on the query such that the definition of the view would be a sub-part of the definition of the query. Consequently, these methods can only detect usages of views in limited cases.
