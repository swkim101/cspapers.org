The paper presents a set of tools that work in conjunction to support concept location in software. One of the tools, IRiSS (Information Retrieval based Software Search), is a search engine, designed and implemented to allow searching the source code of a software system. The other tool, sv3D (source viewer 3D), is a visualization front end, designed to represent software data with 3D renderings.The two tools are integrated with MS Visual Studio, with IRiSS providing the infrastructure for indexing the source code and querying, while sv3D helps the user in visually navigating the results of the queries and keeps track of the navigation path.
