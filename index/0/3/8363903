The modified READ code is a two-dimensional coding scheme standardized by CCITT to compress black and white pictures. Existing decompression algorithms process the compressed data bit-by-bit. In this paper, we propose a hybrid decompressing algorithm which pr~ cesses most of the compressed data byte-by-byte. The remaining data is processed bit-by-bit. It is known statistically that the former situation, where byte-by-byte processing occurs, happens much more often than the latter situation, where bit-by-bit processing takes place. Thus, decompression will be speeded up by the proposed algorithm.
