The term online reputation addresses trust relationships amongst agents in dynamic open systems. These can appear as ratings, recommendations, referrals and feedback. Several reputation models and rating aggregation algorithms have been proposed. However, finding a trusted entity on the web is still an issue as all reputation systems work individually. The aim of this project is to introduce a global reputation system that aggregates people's opinions from different resources (e.g. e-commerce websites, and review) with the help federated search techniques. A sentiment analysis approach is subsequently used to extract high quality opinions and inform how to increase trust in the search result.
