Deals with the problem of the control of grasping procedures of virtual objects in virtual environments according to realistic behavior. The authors present a complete theoretical solution to the problem with particular attention to the constraints imposed by real time application in virtual reality. The authors describe the system architecture utilized for carrying out preliminary tests of the grasping procedure. First experimental results are presented.<<ETX>>
