Facilitating efficient programming-by-demonstration methods for advanced robot systems is an ongoing research challenge. This paper addresses one important challenge in this area, which is the programming of kinematically redundant robots. We argue that standard programming-by-demonstration methods for teaching task-space trajectories on a redundant robot using physical human-robot interaction are too complex for non-expert human tutors. We therefore introduce a new interaction and control concept for redundant robot systems, Assisted Gravity Compensation, based on a hierarchical control scheme, separating task-space programming from the redundancy resolution. The user is actively assisted by a given redundancy resolution while kinesthetically teaching task-space trajectories. This control scheme is implemented on our experimental robot system called FlexIRob and we briefly present results of a kinesthetic teaching experiment obtained in a larger field study on physical Human-Robot Interaction with 48 industrial workers. These results show, that the Assisted Gravity Compensation reduces the complexity of a kinesthetic teaching task, which is revealed by an improved task performance, making kinesthetic teaching an efficient programming-by-demonstration method for redundant robots.
