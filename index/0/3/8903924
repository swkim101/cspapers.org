I . INTRODUCTION For years researchers have been conducting experiments on how students best learn algorithms. Typically, these researchers have compared flowcharts to programming language code, pseudocode, and prose. The combined results of these experiments have been inconclusive [ I , 3, 7, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19, 25, 26]. Consequently, this investigator decided that i t was time to ask the students for their preferred method for learning data structures algorithms.
