A routing procedure is given which is different from Lee type algorithms in that it considers a large group of interconnections simultaneously. A finite number of path classes are established and an algorithm is given for finding the maximum number of non-intersecting interconnections which can be routed if the paths are restricted to these classes. Procedures are given for drawing all interconnections which have been assigned to some path class.
