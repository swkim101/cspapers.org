We wish to determine the effectiveness of some simple hardware for debugging and profiling compiled programs on a conventional processor. The hardware cost is small -- a counter decremented on each instruction that raises an exception when its value becomes zero. With the counter a debugger can provide data watchpoints and reverse execution: a profiler can measure the total instruction cost of a code segment and sample the program counter accurately. Such a counter has been included on a single-board MC68020 workstation, for which system software is currently being written. We will report our progress at the symposium.
