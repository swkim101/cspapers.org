Most data mining research has focused on generating rules within databases containing structured values while essentially ignoring tlte potentially valuable information that exists in t!le tmstructured blocks of text. This paper suggests an approach for generatirrg association rules that relates structured data values fo concepts extracted from unstructured data. Our approach involves the use of an extended concept hierarchy (ECH) to maintain parent, child, and sibling relaGonships between concepts. This structure allows us to generate rules that relate a given concept in the ECH and a given structured attribute value to the neighbors of the given concept in the ECH. We also describe an ejicient implementation of the ECH that keeps track of concepts and pointers to documents associated with them Experimental results on documents from the ABUInfonn In/ormation Retrieval System are presented
