We describe experiments carried out with adaptive language and translation models in the context of an interactive computer-assisted translation program. We developed cache-based language models which were then extended to the bilingual case for a cachebased translation model. We present the improvements we obtained in two contexts: in a theoretical setting, we achieved a drop in perplexity for the new models and, in a more practical situation simulating a user working with the system, we showed that fewer keystrokes would be needed to enter a translation.
