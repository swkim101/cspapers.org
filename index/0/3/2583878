Statistical information about the flow sizes in the traffic passing through a network link helps a network operator to characterize network resource usage, infer traffic demands, detect traffic anomalies, and improve network performance through traffic engineering. Previous work on estimating the flow size distribution for the complete population of flows has produced techniques that either make inferences from sampled network traffic, or use data streaming approaches. In this work, we identify and solve a more challenging problem of estimating the size distribution and other statistical information about arbitrary subpopulations of flows. Inferring subpopulation flow statistics is more challenging than the complete population counterpart, since subpopulations of interest are often specified a posteriori (i.e., after the data collection is done), making it impossible for the data collection module to "plan in advance".Our solution consists of a novel mechanism that combines data streaming with traditional packet sampling to provide highly accurate estimates of subpopulation flow statistics. The algorithm employs two data collection modules operating in parallel --- a NetFlow-like packet sampler and a streaming data structure made up of an array of counters. Combining the data collected by these two modules, our estimation algorithm uses a statistical estimation procedure that correlates and decodes the outputs (observations) from both data collection modules to obtain flow statistics for any arbitrary subpopulation. Evaluations of this algorithm on real-world Internet traffic traces demonstrate its high measurement accuracy.
