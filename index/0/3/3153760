In the <i>multicommodity rent-or-buy</i> (MROB) network design problem we are given a network together with a set of <i>k</i> terminal pairs (<i>s</i><inf>1</inf>, <i>t</i><inf>1</inf>),.....,(<i>s<inf>k</inf></i>, <i>t<inf>k</inf></i>). The goal is to provision the network so that a given amount of low can be shipped between <i>s<inf>i</inf></i> and <i>t<inf>i</inf></i> for all 1 ≤ <i>i</i> ≤ <i>k</i> simultaneously. In order to provision the network one can either <i>rent</i> capacity on edges at some cost per unit of ow, or <i>buy</i> them at some larger fixed cost. Bought edges have no incremental, ow-dependent cost. The overall objective is to minimize the total provisioning cost.Recently, Gupta et al. [8] presented a 12 approximation for the MROB problem. Their algorithm chooses a subset of the terminal pairs in the graph at random and then buys the edges of an approximate Steiner forest for these pairs. This technique has previously been introduced [9] for the single sink rent-or-buy network design problem.In this paper we give a 6.828-approximation for the MROB problem by refining the algorithm of Gupta et al. and simplifying their analysis. The improvement in our paper is based on a more careful adaptation and simplified analysis of the primal-dual algorithm for the Steiner forest problem due to Agrawal, Klein and Ravi [1]. Our result significantly reduces the gap between the single-sink [9] and multi-sink case.
