One of the most compelling long term problems facing the IP and emerging 0S1 Internet is growth, At the same time, policy routing-the ability of a packet source to determine the type of path its packets will take, or the ability of a transit network to restrict usageâ€”is increasingly required. A hierarchical addressing format reflecting the hierarchical backbone structure reduces routing overhead, but restricts paths to the backbones implied by the address, thus limiting policy and reducing robustness. To overcome this restriction, yet keep the efficiency of hierarchical addressing, this paper proposes the use of multiple addresses. In this scheme, directory service would return multiple addresses, and the host would choose the ones appropriate for its policies, any of which could be used during a connection, as network conditions deem appropriate. This paper establishes a framework for the new technique by exploring the fundamentals of routing and addressing, describes the new technique, and discusses its role as a policy mechanism.
