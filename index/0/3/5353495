Commercial relational database systems today provide only limited temporal support. To address the needs of applications requiring rich temporal data and queries, we have built TIP (Temporal Information Processor), a temporal extension to the Informix database system based on its DataBlade technology. Our TIP DataBlade extends Informix with a rich set of datatypes and routines that facilitate temporal modeling and querying. TIP provides both C and Java libraries for client applications to access a TIP-enabled database, and provides end-users with a GUI interface for querying and browsing temporal data.
