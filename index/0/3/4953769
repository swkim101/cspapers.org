Despite its success, MNB-EM is not stable, and may succeed or fail to improve MNB. We believe that this is because MNB-EM lacks the ability to preserve the class distribution on words. In this paper, we propose a novel method to augment MNB-EM by leveraging the word-level statistical constraint to preserve the class distribution on words. The word-level statistical constraints are further converted to constraints on document posteriors generated by MNB-EM. Experiments demonstrate that our method can consistently improve MNB-EM, and outperforms state-of-art baselines remarkably.
