With the advent of commodity autonomous mobiles, it is becoming increasingly prevalent to recognize under extreme conditions such as night, erratic illumination conditions. This need has caused the approaches using multi-modal sensors, which could be complementary to each other. The choice for the thermal camera provides a rich source of temperature information, less affected by changing illumination or background clutters. However, existing thermal cameras have a relatively smaller resolution than RGB cameras that has trouble for fully utilizing the information in recognition tasks. To mitigate this, we aim to enhance the low-resolution thermal image according to the extensive analysis of existing approaches. To this end, we introduce Thermal Image Enhancement using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), called in TEN, which directly learns an end-to-end mapping a single low resolution image to the desired high resolution image. In addition, we examine various image domains to find the best representative of the thermal enhancement. Overall, we propose the first thermal image enhancement method based on CNN guided on RGB data. We provide extensive experiments designed to evaluate the quality of image and the performance of several object recognition tasks such as pedestrian detection, visual odometry, and image registration.
