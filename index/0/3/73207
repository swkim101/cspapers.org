We introduce the concept of an elastic block cipher, which refers to stretching the supported block size of a block cipher to any length up to twice the original block size while incurring a computational workload that is proportional to the block size. We define a method for converting any existing block cipher into an elastic block cipher and mention our analysis of the construction.
