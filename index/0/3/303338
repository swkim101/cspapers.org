The 3rd International Workshop on Patent Information Retrieval builds on the experiences of the first two workshops, to provide its participants an exciting, scientifically challenging and interactive event, where the specific issues of patent retrieval may be put into the general context of Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management, in order to explore innovative solutions to new and old problems, but also to evaluate and adapt traditional or classic approaches to new problems. Between the scientific presentations and posters, distinguished keynote speakers and a panel discussion, PaIR 2010 shapes itself into a significant landmark in the field of domain specific information retrieval.
