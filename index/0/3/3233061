Over the past three years Pinterest has experimented with several visual search and recommendation systems, from enhancing existing products such as Related Pins (2014), to powering new products such as Similar Looks (2015), Flashlight (2016), and Lens (2017). This paper presents an overview of our visual discovery engine powering these services, and shares the rationales behind our technical and product decisions such as the use of object detection and interactive user interfaces. We conclude that this visual discovery engine significantly improves engagement in both search and recommendation tasks.
