In this demonstration we present the Brown Dwarf, a distributed system designed to efficiently store, query and update multidimensional data. Deployed on any number of commodity nodes, our system manages to distribute large volumes of data over network peers on-the-fly and process queries and updates on-line through cooperating nodes that hold parts of a materialized cube. Moreover, it adapts its resources according to demand and hardware failures and is cost-effective both over the required hardware and software components. All the aforementioned functionality will be tested using various datasets and query loads.
