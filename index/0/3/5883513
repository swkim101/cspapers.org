We present an embedding of stochastic optimal control problems, of the so called path integral form, into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Using consistent, sample based estimates of the embedding leads to a model-free, non-parametric approach for calculation of an approximate solution to the control problem. This formulation admits a decomposition of the problem into an invariant and task dependent component. Consequently, we make much more efficient use of the sample data compared to previous sample based approaches in this domain, e.g., by allowing sample re-use across tasks. Numerical examples on test problems, which illustrate the sample efficiency, are provided.
