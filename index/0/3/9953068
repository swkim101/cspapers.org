Multiprocessors with non-uniform memory access times introduce the problem of placing data near the processes that use them, in order to improve performance. We have implemented an automatic page placement strategy in the Mach operating system on the IBM ACE multiprocessor workstation. Our experience indicates that even very simple automatic strategies can produce nearly optimal page placement. It also suggests that the greatest leverage for further performance improvement lies in reducing false sharing, which occurs when the same page contains objects that would best be placed in different memories.
