We present Pro3Gres, a deep-syntactic, fast dependency parser that combines a handwritten competence grammar with probabilistic performance disambiguation and that has been used in the biomedical domain. We discuss its performance in the domain adaptation open submission. We achieve average results, which is partly due to difficulties in mapping to the dependency representation used for the shared task.
