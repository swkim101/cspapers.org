Due to the high relevance gained by mobile software applications, software developers require a way to measure and track the quality of their mobile products from a domain-specific, quantitative point of view. Currently, there is no a link between the general quality goals set by the mobile ecosystem and the practices that have to be exercised to develop a compliant application. In this work, we pursue the implementation of a strategy to extend software quality standards to supply mechanisms to measure the quality of mobile software products from the point of view of developers and users, in the context of mobile execution environments and mobile application markets.
