This paper describes a vision system which recognizes 3D objects in real-time by modeling the shapes of objects and matching the generated models. We develop the following methods for practically solving important problems of integration such as the estimation of sensor accuracy as well as real-time processing: 1) we reduce the computation of signed-distance, which is necessary to apply the marching cubes algorithm, and select the optimal resolution of models to be generated using an octree, thereby enabling us to generate hierarchical mesh models in real-time; 2) we apply spin-image matching by selecting the resolution of generated models and the coarse to-fine algorithm, consequently, we are able to efficiently match multiple objects of different sizes.
