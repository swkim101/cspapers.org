Our partial parser for Chinese uses a learned classifier to guide a bottom-up parsing process. We describe improvements in performance obtained by expanding the information available to the classifier, from POS sequences only, to include measures of word association derived from co-occurrence statistics. We compare performance using different measures of association, and find that Yule's coefficient of colligation Y gives somewhat better results over other measures.
