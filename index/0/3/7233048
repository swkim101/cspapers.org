We extend live sequence charts (LSCs), a highly expressive variant of sequence diagrams, and provide the extension with an executable semantics. The extension involves support for instances that can bind to multiple objects and symbolic variables that can bind to arbitrary values. The result is a powerful executable language for expressing behavioral requirements on the level of inter-object interaction. The extension is implemented in full in our play-engine tool, with which one can execute the requirements directly without the need to build or synthesize an intra-object system model. It seems that in addition to many advantages in testing and requirements engineering, for some kinds of systems this could lead to the requirements actually serving as the final implementation.
