Students with visual disabilities face unique challenges in learning to be computer scientists. These challenges can be overcome, however, with the use of specialized software tools and hardware equipment, collectively called assistive technology. In this paper, we discuss the environment we are using for three students with visual disabilities who are starting in our programs this year. This environment includes a collection of commercial assistive technology and a programming tool that we have developed in-house.
