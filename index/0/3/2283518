Over the past year two distinct answers have emerged regarding SoC design methodologies. On the one hand, it is posited in the Reuse Methodology Manual, that a logic synthesis-based design methodology can be used effectively to develop system chips. An alternative methodology focuses on integration (or “reference”) platforms and the customization of the basic application-specific platform through the addition of selected SW and/or HW IP blocks. This panel session will debate the merits of these seemingly incompatible proposed SoC methodologies.
