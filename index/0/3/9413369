This paper proposes a method that estimates customer interests by identifying a set of areas at which a customer has stopped in our experimental shop environment and recommends items through robots located on the shop's shelves. We experimentally verified that our method changed customer behaviors. The results show that the method successfully encouraged customers to visit the shelves of recommended items.
