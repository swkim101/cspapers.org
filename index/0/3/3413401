In this paper, a resolution method for propositional temporal logic is presented. Temporal formulae, incorporating both past-time and future-time temporal operators, are converted to Separated Normal Form (SNF), then both non-temporal and temporal resolution rules are applied. The resolution method is based on classical resolution, but incorporates a temporal resolution rule that can be implemented efficiently using a graph-theoretic approach.
