We propose a method of automatically constructing an English-Chinese bilingual FrameNet where the English FrameNet lexical entries are linked to the appropriate Chinese word senses. This resource can be used in machine translation and cross-lingual IR systems. We coerce the English FrameNet into Chinese using a bilingual lexicon, frame context in FrameNet and taxonomy structure in HowNet. Our approach does not require any manual mapping between FrameNet and HowNet semantic roles. Evaluation results show that we achieve a promising 82% average F-measure for the most ambiguous lexical entries.
