Algorithms for pruning game trees generally rely on a game being zero-sum, in the case of alpha-beta pruning, or constant-sum, in the case of multi-player pruning algorithms such as speculative pruning. While existing algorithms can prune non-zero-sum games, pruning is much less effective than in constant-sum games. We introduce the idea of leaf-value tables, which store an enumeration of the possible leaf values in a game tree. Using these tables we are can make perfect decisions about whether or not it is possible to prune a given node in a tree. Leaf-value tables also make it easier to incorporate monotonic heuristics for increased pruning. In the 3-player perfect-information variant of Spades we are able to reduce node expansions by two orders of magnitude over the previous best zero-sum and non-zero-sum pruning techniques.
