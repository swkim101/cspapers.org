Knowledge of noun phrase anaphoricity might be profitably exploited in coreference resolution to bypass the resolution of non-anaphoric noun phrases. However, it is surprising to notice that recent attempts to incorporate automatically acquired anaphoricity information into coreference resolution have been somewhat disappointing. This paper employs a global learning method in determining the anaphoricity of noun phrases via a label propagation algorithm to improve learning-based coreference resolution. In particular, two kinds of kernels, i.e. the feature-based RBF kernel and the convolution tree kernel, are employed to compute the anaphoricity similarity between two noun phrases. Experiments on the ACE 2003 corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in anaphoricity determination of noun phrases and its application in learning-based coreference resolution.
