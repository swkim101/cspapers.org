Increasing design cost and risk is causing more and more designers to build configurable platforms that will amortize design and manufacturing costs across many generations. Several reconfiguration schemes exist and none of them seems to be a clear winner. Most notably there are three forms of technology: structured ASIC, configurable software programmable, reconfigurable FPGA-like platform. New solutions are emerging and may induce drastic changes in the current industry organization. The panel will examine factors in the success of the various options, and look to what the future might bring.
