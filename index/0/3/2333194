A critical problem in pre-Silicon and post-Silicon validation of analog/mixed-signal circuits is to estimate the distribution of circuit performances, from which the probability of failure and parametric yield can be estimated at all circuit configurations and corners. With extremely small sample size, traditional estimators are only capable of achieving a very low confidence level, leading to either over-validation or under-validation. In this paper, we propose a multi-population moment estimation method that significantly improves estimation accuracy under small sample size. In fact, the proposed estimator is theoretically guaranteed to outperform usual moment estimators. The key idea is to exploit the fact that simulation and measurement data collected under different circuit configurations and corners can be correlated, and are conditionally independent. We exploit such correlation among different populations by employing a Bayesian framework, i.e., by learning a prior distribution and applying maximum a posteriori estimation using the prior. We apply the proposed method to several datasets including post-silicon measurements of a commercial highspeed I/O link, and demonstrate an average error reduction of up to 2Ã—, which can be equivalently translated to significant reduction of validation time and cost.
