In this work we revisit and formally study the notion of proxy cryptography. Intuitively, various proxy functions allow two cooperating parties F (the “FBI”) and P (the “proxy”) to duplicate the functionality available to the third party U (the “user”), without being able to perform this functionality on their own (without cooperation). The concept is closely related to the notion of threshold cryptography, except we deal with only two parties P and F , and place very strict restrictions on the way the operations are performed (which is done for the sake of efﬁciency, usability and scalability). For example, for decryption (resp. signature) P ( F ) sends a single message to F ( P ), after which the latter can decrypt (sign) the message. Our formal modeling of proxy cryptography signiﬁcantly generalizes, simpliﬁes and simultaneously clariﬁes the model of “atomic proxy” suggested by Blaze and Strauss [4]. In particular, we deﬁne bidirectional and unidirectional variants of our model 1 , and show extremely simple generic solutions for proxy signature and encryption in these models. We also give more efﬁcient solutions for several speciﬁc schemes. We conclude that proxy cryptography is a relatively simple concept to satisfy when looked from the correct and formal standpoint.
