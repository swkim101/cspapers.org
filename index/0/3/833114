In this paper, we first introduce the database aspects of the groupware product Lotus Domino/Notes and then describe, in some more detail, many of the logging and recovery enhancements that were introduced in R5. We discuss briefly some of the changes that had to be made to the ARIES recovery method to accommodate the unique storage management characteristics of Notes. We also outline some of the on-going logging and locking work in the Dominotes project at the IBM Almaden Research Center.
