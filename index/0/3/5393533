The security of home, laboratory, office and factory is essential to human daily life. A danger event is often caused by the negligence of humans. Potential hazards may injure our life. Therefore, it motivates us to develop an intelligent multi-sensor based Security Robot system. It is expected to be widely employed in our daily life. Security robot can detect dangerous situation and provide timely alert us. The structure of the security robot contains eight parts. Including remote surveillance and control system, image system, obstacle avoidance system, software system, auto-dialing, driver system, sensor system and motion planning system. In this paper, we discuss the opportunity to use multi-agent technology in the sensory system and the expected improvements. The sensory system has seven-variety detection and diagnosis agent (local agent) and one sensor agent (auxiliary agent). Finally, we use multi-processor architecture to implement the multi-agent based sensory system for the security robot application.
