This paper presents a spike feature extraction algorithm that targets real-time spike sorting and facilitates miniaturized microchip implementation. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on synthesized waveforms and experimentally recorded sequences. When compared with many spike sorting approaches our algorithm demonstrates improved speed, accuracy and allows unsupervised execution. A preliminary hardware implementation has been realized using an integrated microchip interfaced with a personal computer.
