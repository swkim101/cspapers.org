Latest quantum technologies promise realization of extremely large circuits, whereas, reversible logic synthesis, the key automation step for quantum computing, suffers from scalability bottleneck. Scalability can be achieved with Decision Diagram (DD)-based synthesis at the cost of significant ancilla/garbage lines overhead. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical reversible logic synthesis, where DD-based synthesis is invoked within an And-Inverter Graph (AIG)-based synthesis wrapper, balancing scalability and performance. The resulting tool can synthesize much larger functions (512-inputs), provides excellent flexibility, and restricts ancilla overhead. On average, line-count and gate-count reductions of 94% and 35% respectively, are achieved, compared to state-of-the-art.
