A new interaction technique called Dual Touch has been developed for pen-based PDAs. It enables a user to operate a PDA by tapping and stroking on the screen with a pen and a thumb. The PDA can detect the combined movements of two points on its pressure-based touch-screen without additional hardware. The user can use the thumb to support the task of the pen.
