Placement and routing heuristics for a Field Programmable Multi-Chip Module (FPMCM) are presented. The placement is done in three phases; partitioning, chip assignment and iterative improvement. The routing is done in two phases; global routing followed by detailed routing. Detailed routing involves new channel routing problems denoted by Exact Segmented Channel Routing (ESCR) and K-ESCR. A very fast K-ESCR heuristic is described. Experimental results show that the placement heuristic achieves high gate utilization, and that the K-ESCR heuristic performs surprisingly well over wide range of channel sizes.
