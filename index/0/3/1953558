Statistical Analysis has been used to provide solutions to complex problems in such diverse areas as communications, stability and control, and turbulent flow. Although these problems previously lacked adequate mathematical treatment, the results of statistical analyses have been significant both for explanation and prediction. Statistical analysis is a general scientific tool; it has application in many areas of scientific research. For the moment the investigation has been restricted to subsonic turbulent flow.
