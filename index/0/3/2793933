We prove f2(n2) complexity lower bound for the general model of randomized computation trees solving the Knapsack Problem, and more generally Restricted Integer Programming. This is the first nontrivial lower bound proven for this model of computation. The method of the proof depends crucially on the new technique for proving lower bounds on the border complexity of a polynomial which could be of independent interest. O Introduction We prove for the first time nonlinear lower bounds on the depth of randomized computation trees (RCTS) (see e.g. [MT82], [S83], [M85a], [GKMS96]) recognizing sets like unions of hyperpianes (i.e. linear arrangements) or intersections of halfspaces (polyhedra). As an application we prove a quadratic lower bound on RCTS solving the knapsack problem, or more generally, the restricted integer programming. Obtaining general lower bounds for randomized computation was an open question for a long time (see Only recently, a nonlinear lower bound was proven in [GKMS96] for a weaker model of randomized d-decision trees (d-RDTs), in which testing polynomials have degrees at most d (for 2-dimensional case the lower bound was proven in [GK93], and for the generic arrangements a lower bound was proved in [GK94]). In particular, for d-RDTs the lower bound Q(n log n) was proven for the Element Distinctness Problem, and also the lower bound fl(nz) was proved for the Knapsack Problem ([GKMS96]). The main difficulty whith proving lower bounds on RCTS is that the degree of testing polyno-mials could be possibly exponential in n. Therefore, we develop in the present paper a new method for obtaining complexity lower bounds for RCTS. The method developed in the present paper cannot be directly applied for the Element Distinctness Problem. In [BKL93] (cf. also [GKMS96]), a linear depth RCT was constructed for a similar problem (permutation problem) {(z, y) E lR2n : y is a permutation of x} beating therefore its deterministic Q(n log n) lower bound (cf. [B83]). This example shows that the (still open problem) of complexity of an RCT for the Element Distinctness is quite delicate. We also mention that a linear ~ lower bound for an RCT recognizing the arrangement UI <i<n {xi = O} or the " orthant " nl <i<n{Xi ~ O} W*-~roved in [GKMS96]. For a stron~er-model of randomized analytic decision trees (RADT) a complexity upper bound 0(log2 n) for testing nl<i<n{Xi ~ O} was proven .-in [GKS96] (for deterministic analytic decision trees the exact complexity â€¦
