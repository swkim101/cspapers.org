INTRODUCTION Information Visualization uses computer graphics and interactive animation to stimulate recognition of patterns and structure in information. It does so by exploiting the human perceptual system in ways similar to Scientific Visualization, which allows scientists to perceive patterns in large data collections. While Scientific Visualization typically works on data from simulations of physical processes, Information Visualization works on the structure of information inherent in large information spaces. This video shows a prototype system, called the Information Visualizer, and two information visualization techniques used to access information both by structure and by content. Cone Trees are used for visualizing hierarchical information structures. The Perspective Wall is used for visualizing linear information structures. Both techniques use 3D to maximize effective use of available screen space and enable visualization of the whole structure. Interactive animation is used to shift some of the userâ€™s cognitive load to the human perceptual system. The video concludes with a series of examples from an application scenario, based on managing an organization.
