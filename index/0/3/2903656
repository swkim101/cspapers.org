We present a solution to the rolling shutter (RS) absolute camera pose problem with known vertical direction. Our new solver, R5Pup, is an extension of the general minimal solution R6P, which uses a double linearized RS camera model initialized by the standard perspective P3P. Here, thanks to using known vertical directions, we avoid double linearization and can get the camera absolute pose directly from the RS model without the initialization by a standard P3P. Moreover, we need only five 2D-to-3D matches while R6P needed six such matches. We demonstrate in simulated and real experiments that our new R5Pup is robust, fast and a very practical method for absolute camera pose computation for modern cameras on mobile devices. We compare our R5Pup to the state of the art RS and perspective methods and demonstrate that it outperforms them when vertical direction is known in the range of accuracy available on modern mobile devices. We also demonstrate that when using R5Pup solver in structure from motion (SfM) pipelines, it is better to transform already reconstructed scenes into the standard position, rather than using hard constraints on the verticality of up vectors.
