This paper proposes the security infrastructure for user-controlled Virtual Workspace Service (VWSS-UC) that comprises of three layers: trusted computing platform, secure virtualised workspace, and user aplication. The suggestions on the technology selection are provided for the first two layers: industry adopted Trusted Computing (TCG) platform, and Virtual Workspace Service (VWSS) developed in the framework of the Globus Toolkit. Solutions and implementation are proposed and discussed for the application authorisation session security context management. The paper is based on experiences gained from major Grid based projects such as EGEE, Globus Toolkit, and Phosphorus.
