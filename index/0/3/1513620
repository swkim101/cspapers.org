The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard modeling language in which some of the best object-oriented (OO) modeling experiences are embedded. In this paper we illustrate the role formal specification techniques can play in developing a precise semantics for the UML. We present a precise characterization of requirements-level (problem-oriented) Class Diagrams and outline how the characterization can be used to semantically analyze requirements Class Diagrams.
