We present the system ABTWEAK, which extends the precondition-elimination abstraction of AB-STRIPS to hierarchical planners using the nonlinear plan representation as defined in TWEAK. We show that ABTWEAK satisfies the monotonic property, whereby the existence of a lowest level solution II implies the existence of a highest level solution that is structurally similar to II. This property enables one to prune a considerable amount of the search space without loss of completeness.
