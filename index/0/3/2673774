Augmented Reality (AR) applications have been widely spread on phone terminals. However, many of them are not deployed well in the phones obviously.We proposed a novel terminal--ARHCI, which can supply AR service and allow users to carry on hand-free operations on the information on the glasses. This design is not only an eye-glasses, but also the tracker of movements of head and eyes, as well as the screen presenting the added information. This paper will show the architecture of ARHCI and a related project aiming to help physically challenged people while they go outside.
