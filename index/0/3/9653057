It is applicable in any domain where point sets are a natural representation for data. Specifically, we show examples of its use in natural language processing, object recognition in images and point set classification. We provide a geometric interpretation of this measure and show that it is well-motivated, intuitive, parameter-free, and straightforward to use. We further demonstrate that it is computationally tractable and applicable to both supervised and unsupervised learning problems.
