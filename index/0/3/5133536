This paper is concerned with the concurrently building of a large knowledge base by a team of collaborating Knowledge Engineers (KEs). This goal places the onus on sharing the knowledge base. We thus suggest a communication protocol to control the transfer of knowledge between knowledge engineers and the shared base. The paper also advocates that a knowledge base be divided into layers. This division seems very appropriate to first support concurrent access to the shared base, and then to enable the large-scale reuse of the base by its original developers and by other developers who may use and update it. Under these working conditions, we propose our new design model of layers. Finally, we discuss implementation issues inherent in the design model. We show that a knowledge base is treated as an abstract data type, characterized by a set of operations, which are used to interact with it.
