Routing protocols are challenges in designing Mobile Ad-hoc networks with low energy consuming. This paper extends the expanding ring search (ERS) algorithm proposed in [3] to optimize the energy consuming caused by broadcasting redundance messages. Simulation results show that the required message packages for routing by using our algorithm is significantly reduced in comparison with that required by using the ERS method.
