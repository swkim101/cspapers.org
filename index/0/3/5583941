Smart spaces need driver services to connect accessed hardware and orchestration services to realize scenarios. There is a problem of scale in software development for smart spaces because it is done by few. It is also problematic that those few decide about what is supported and developed. We propose to provide users with tools for community based development of driver and orchestration services. We analyze the requirements for a middleware framework to allow distributed development. We present necessary extensions that promote community based development: (1) a repository for interface definitions, (2) App Store and App Manager, and (3) multi-dimensional ratings. Finally we present how smart space software development can be facilitated using our Distributed Smart Space Orchestration System (DS2OS).
