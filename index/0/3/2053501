This paper extends research on the use of the cloze test in the domain of computer software. In this study the cloze blanks were divided for the purposes of analysis into five structural subcategories. The relationships of the total cloze score and the subcategory scores to two criterion test measures were found to be positive, with the strongest and most consistent relationships being found for the variable subcategory. Use of the cloze test for both instructional and assessment purposes was discussed.
