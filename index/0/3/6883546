Motion planning is an important problem with many applications in robotics. In this paper, we focus on motion planning with rectangular obstacles parallel to the X, Y or Z axis. We formulate motion planning using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and use SMT solvers to find a feasible path from the source to the goal. Our formulation decompose the robotic path into N path segments where the two ends of each path segment can be constrained using difference logic. Our SMT approach will find a solution if and only if a feasible path exists for the given constraints. We present extensive experimental results to demonstrate the scalability of our approach.
