The need of scaleable key management support for Mobile IP, especially the route‐optimized Mobile IP, is well known. In this paper, we present the design and the implementation of a public key management system that can be used with IETF basic and route optimized Mobile IP. The system, known as the Mobile IP Security (MoIPS) system, was built upon a DNS based X.509 Public Key Infrastructure and the innovation in cross certification and zero‐message key generation. The system can supply cryptographic keys for authenticating Mobile IPv.4 location management messages and establishing IPSec tunnels for Mobile IP redirected packets. It can also be used to augment firewall traversal of Mobile IP datagrams. A FreeBSD UNIX implementation of the MoIPS prototype is available for non‐commercial uses.
