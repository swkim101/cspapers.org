We describe a system for learning J. S. Bach's rules of musical harmony. These rules are learned from examples and are expressed as rule-based neural networks. The rules are then applied in real-time to generate new accompanying harmony for a live performer. Real-time functionality imposes constraints on the learning and harmonizing processes, including limitations on the types of information the system can use as input and the amount of processing the system can perform. We demonstrate algorithms for generating and refining musical rules from examples which meet these constraints. We describe a method for including a priori knowledge into the rules which yields significant performance gains. We then describe techniques for applying these rules to generate new music in real-time. We conclude the paper with an analysis of experimental results.
