Because it is NP hard to directly compute the best binary codes for a given data set, mainstream hashing methods typically adopt a two-stage strategy. In the first stage, several projected dimensions of real values are generated. Then in the second stage, the real values will be quantized into binary codes by thresholding. Currently, most existing methods use one single bit to quantize each projected dimension. One problem with this single-bit quantization (SBQ) is that the threshold typically lies in the region of the highest point density and consequently a lot of neighboring points close to the threshold will be hashed to totally different bits, which is unexpected according to the principle of hashing. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization strategy, called double-bit quantization (DBQ), to solve the problem of SBQ. The basic idea of DBQ is to quantize each projected dimension into double bits with adaptively learned thresholds. Extensive experiments on two real data sets show that our DBQ strategy can significantly outperform traditional SBQ strategy for hashing.
