This paper proposes the concept of the center of gravity (COG) viscoelasticity to associate joint viscoelasticity with the COG-zero moment point (ZMP) model of humanoid dynamics. Although COG viscoelasticity is based on the well-known kinematic relationship between joint stiffness and end-effector stiffness, it provides practical advantages for humanoid motion control. Once the feedback gain in the COG-ZMP model is designed using the control theory, COG viscoelasticity can be applied to directly transform it to joint viscoelasticity. The author names this method as resolved COG viscoelasticity control (RCVC). In particular, this paper proposes RCVC in which the null-space of the COG Jacobian is employed. The validity of the RCVC is verified by simulating whole-body dynamics.
