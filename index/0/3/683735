Despite the availability of increasingly more robust machine perception and control algorithms, human operators are still needed to directly control robotic systems in extreme environments where there is a high cost of failure. This paper reports a novel architecture for semi-autonomous teleoperation over high-latency telemetry and the results of a 15-subject user study used to evaluate that architecture. The intent-recognition-based traded control (IRTC) architecture recognizes operator intent based on remote scene and task modeling, and automatically trades control to an autonomous reactive subsystem. Each subject participated in one two-hour session during which they controlled a single simulated redundant robotic manipulator with 4000ms of closed-loop latency. Subjects continuously assemble and disassemble a 3D lattice structure with or without IRTC-based assistance. The user study showed that the IRTC system improved operator performance in the simulated multi-object assembly task. All source code for conducting the experiment including the simulation and data processing is available online under a permissive open-source license.
