This paper describes SPAN, a system designed to integrate a variety of problem solving tactics in a coherent package. The paper discusses some of the tactics that had been used in previous systems to overcome the combinatorial explosion that is inherent in any planning problem. It then continues with a description of SPAN architecture. Two case studies are presented. The first, from the blocks world, is already implemented, and the second, from the domain of bridge playing, is in the coding stage. SPANS limitations are discussed and directions for further research are considered.
