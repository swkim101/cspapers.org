Welcome to New York City and the 2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). This year’s conference is the twenty-fourth. Besides the main conference, CVPR includes a series of workshops and tutorials, demonstrations and exhibits, and a video proceedings. Conforming with recent CVPR’s, registrants for the main conference have a passport to attend any of the other events, and all of the proceedings are presented on a single DVD. We hope that you’ll explore all that CVPR has to offer.
