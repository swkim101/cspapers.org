The skyline operator is important for multi-criteria decision making applications. Although many recent studies developed efficient methods to compute skyline objects in a specific space, the fundamental problem on the semantics of skylines remains open: Why and in which subspaces is (or is not) an object in the skyline? Practically, users may also be interested in the skylines in any subspaces. Then, what is the relationship between the skylines in the subspaces and those in the super-spaces? How can we effectively analyze the subspace skylines? Can we efficiently compute skylines in various subspaces?In this paper, we investigate the semantics of skylines, propose the subspace skyline analysis, and extend the full-space skyline computation to subspace skyline computation. We introduce a novel notion of skyline group which essentially is a group of objects that are coincidentally in the skylines of some subspaces. We identify the decisive subspaces that qualify skyline groups in the subspace skylines. The new notions concisely capture the semantics and the structures of skylines in various subspaces. Multidimensional roll-up and drilldown analysis is introduced. We also develop an efficient algorithm, Skyey, to compute the set of skyline groups and, for each subspace, the set of objects that are in the subspace skyline. A performance study is reported to evaluate our approach.
