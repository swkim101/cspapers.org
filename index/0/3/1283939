We investigate the problem of how to evaluate, fast and efficiently, classes of optimal route queries on a massive graph in a unified framework. To evaluate a route query effectively, a large network is partitioned into a collection of fragments, and distances of some optimal routes in the network are pre-computed. Under such a setting, we find a unified algorithm that can evaluate classes of optimal route queries. The classes that can be processed efficiently are called constraint preserving (CP) which include, among others, shortest path, forbidden edges, forbidden nodes and Î±-autonomy optimal route query classes. We prove the correctness of the unified algorithm. We then turn our attention to the optimization of the proposed algorithm. Several pruning and optimization techniques are derived that minimize the search time and I/O accesses. We show empirically that these techniques are effective. The proposed optimal route query evaluation algorithm, with all these techniques incorporated, is compared with a main-memory and a disk-based brute-force CP algorithms. We show experimentally that the proposed unified algorithm outperforms the brute-force algorithms, both in term of CPU time and I/O cost, by a wide margin.
