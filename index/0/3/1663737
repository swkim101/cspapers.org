This paper makes the case for the use of XOR-based placement functions for cache memories. It shows that these XOR-mapping schemes can eliminate many conflict misses for direct-mapped and victim caches and practically all of them for (pseudo) two-way associative organizations. The paper evaluates the performance of XOR-mapping schemes for a number of different cache organizations: direct-mapped, set-associative, victim, hash-rehash, column-associative and skewed-associative. It also proposes novel replacement policies for some of these cache organizations. In particular, it presents a low-cost implementation of a pure LRU replacement policy which demonstrates a significant improvement over the pseudo-LRU replacement previously proposed. The paper shows that for a 8 Kbyte data cache, XOR-mapping schemes approximately halve the miss ratio for two-way associative and column-associative organizations. Skewed-associative caches, which already make use of XOR-mapping functions, can benefit from the LRU replacement and also from the use of more sophisticated mapping functions. For two-way associative, columnassociative and two-way skewed-associative organizations, XORmapping schemes achieve a miss ratio that is not higher than 1.10 times that of a fully-associative cache. XOR mapping schemes also provide a very significant reduction in the miss ratio for the other cache organizations, including the direct-mapped cache. Ultimately, the conclusion of this study is that XOR-based placement functions unequivocally provide highly significant performance benefits to most cache organizations.
