HCI research at Georgia Tech is found in three cooperating groups: the Engineering Psychology and Experimental Psychology Programs in the School of Psychology, the Center for Human-Machine Systems Research in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, and the interdisciplinary Graphics, Visualization and Usability (GVU) Center. We cooperate via cross-listed courses, having students in one area take a minor in another area, collaborative research projects, serving on Ph. D. committees, joint colloquia and brown bag lunches, and joint appointments. The GVU Center (housed in the College of Computing) and Cognitive Science Program (sponsored by Psychology, Industrial and Systems Engineering, and the College of Computing) involves a number of the same faculty, further enhancing our collaborations.
