An increasingly large amount of Web applications employ serviceobjects such as Servlets to generate dynamic and personalizedcontent. Existing caching infrastructures are not well suited forcaching such content in mobile environments because ofdisconnection and weak connection. One possible approach to thisproblem is to replicate Web-related application logic to clientdevices. The challenges to this approach are to deal with clientdevices that exhibit huge divergence in resource availabilities, tosupport applications that have different data sharing and coherencyrequirements, and to accommodate the same application underdifferent deployment environments.
The Replet system targets these challenges. It uses client,server and application capability and preference information (CPI)to direct the replication of service objects to client devices:from the selection of a device for replication and populating thedevice with client-specific data, to choosing an appropriatereplica to serve a given request and maintaining the desired stateconsistency among replicas. The Replet system exploits on-devicereplication to enable client-, server- and application-specificcost metrics for replica invocation and synchronization. We haveimplemented a prototype in the context of Servlet-based Webapplications. Our experiment and simulation results demonstrate theviability and significant benefits of CPI-driven on-device serviceobject replication.
