This paper is concerned with the problem of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for continuous state space and time stochastic control problems. We state the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation satisfied by the value function and use a Finite-Difference method for designing a convergent approximation scheme. Then we propose a RL algorithm based on this scheme and prove its convergence to the optimal solution.
