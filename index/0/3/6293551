This paper studies the problem of recommending collaborators in a social network, given a set of keywords. Formally, given a query q, consisting of a researcher s (who is a member of a social network) and a set of keywords k (e.g., an article name or topic of future work), the collaborator recommendation problem is to return a high-quality ranked list of possible collaborators for s on the topic k. Extensive effort was expended to define ranking functions that take into consideration a variety of properties, including structural proximity to s, textual relevance to k, and importance. The effectiveness of our methods have been experimentally proven over two large subsets of the social network determined by DBLP co-authorship data. The results show that the ranking methods developed in this paper work well in practice.
