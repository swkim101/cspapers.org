Mobile platforms equipped with several steering wheels are known to be omnidirectional, i.e., able to independently translate and rotate on the plane. As an improvement to this design, the Justin mobile platform also possesses the ability to vary its footprint over time by extending/retracting the wheel legs during motion. In this paper, we discuss the kinematic modeling and control issues for such a platform. The goal is to obtain a tracking controller which is able to realize an arbitrary linear/angular platform motion while, at the same time, independently expanding/retracting each leg. Experimental results support the proposed approach.
