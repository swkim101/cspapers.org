This paper introduces an unsupervised morphological segmentation algorithm that shows robust performance for four languages with different levels of morphological complexity. In particular, our algorithm outperforms Goldsmithis Linguistica and Creutz and Lagusis Morphessor for English and Bengali, and achieves performance that is comparable to the best results for all three PASCAL evaluation datasets. Improvements arise from (1) the use of relative corpus frequency and suffix level similarity for detecting incorrect morpheme attachments and (2) the induction of orthographic rules and allomorphs for segmenting words where roots exhibit spelling changes during morpheme attachments.
