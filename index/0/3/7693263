This paper reviews computer architecture as it has progressed from the stand-alone computer to the computer system to computer networks. The degree of success of an architecture can be measured by the number of different implementations made of it. An architecture is ultimately limiting in some way, thereby spawning specialized units, called algorithm boxes, or special-purpose computers. The author takes the view that this is a beneficial trend, but one that needs architectural guidance. An architecture is valuable if designers can build, and programmers can use, the resulting system. The paper reviews current trends that might be described as the development of computer architecture by “default”. The particular case of local computer networks is discussed.
