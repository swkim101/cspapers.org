As researchers share computational resources, such as objects in large distributed environments, it becomes difficult to achieve scalability of synchronization. Concurrency protocols currently lack scalability. Our protocol enhances middleware concurrency services to provide scalability of synchronization enabling resource sharing and computing with distributed objects in systems with a large number of nodes.
