Scalable generative graph models focus on modeling distributions of graphs that match real world network properties and scale to large datasets. Much work has focused on modeling networks with a power law degree distribution, clustering, and small diameter. In network analysis, the assortativity statistic is defined as the correlation between the degrees of linked nodes in the network. The assortativity measure can distinguish between types of networks---social networks commonly exhibit positive assortativity, in contrast to biological or technological networks that are typically disassortative. Despite this, little work has focused on scalable graph models that capture assortativity in networks. The contributions of our work are twofold. First, we prove that an unbounded number of pairs of networks exist with the same degree distribution and assortativity, yet different joint degree distributions. Thus, assortativity as a network measure cannot distinguish between graphs with complex (non-linear) dependence in their joint degree distributions. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a generative graph model that explicitly estimates and models the joint degree distribution. Our Binned Chung Lu method accurately captures both the joint degree distribution and assortativity, while still matching characteristics such as the degree distribution and clustering coefficients. Further, our method has subquadratic learning and sampling methods that enable scaling to large, real world networks. We evaluate performance compared to other scalable graph models on six real world networks, including a citation network with over 14 million edges.
