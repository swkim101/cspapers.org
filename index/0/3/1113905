There are some researches which perform complex manipulation tasks to control dynamic characteristic of an object (sliding, rolling, hitting, etc). They are called dynamic manipulation. We introduced tossing manipulation as one of it. In this paper, tossing manipulation is expanded to catch the tossed object without impact. We call it passing manipulation. A pair of 1 D.O.F manipulators is used as a tossing manipulator and a catching manipulator. First, the tossing manipulator swings its arm to roll/slide an object on it, and passes the object. Second, the object is thrown to the catching manipulator. Third, the catching manipulator swings its arm to contact the object without impact, and manipulates it on the arm. Finally the object stands still on the catching arm. This paper shows a kinematic model of passing manipulation. The kinematic model is analyzed, a method to search the optimal passing is described, and the optimal solutions are simulated. Finally the experiment is materialized, and perform the passing manipulation with iterative learning control.
