We present a reactive method for online robot motion replanning in dynamically changing environments by combining path replanning and deformation. Path deformation is newly integrated in our replanning method featured by efficient roadmap reuse and parallel planning and execution. This enhancement allows the planner to deal with more dynamic environments including continuously moving obstacles, by smoothly deforming the path during execution. Simulation results are shown to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
