Information retrieval techniques treat questions democratically: all questions, regardless of their grammar or orientation, are processed by the same rules and manipulated in similar ways. In about 12% of the questions in our data users ask about a process. Treating a request for how to do something as a request for information about a topic disregards an important subtlety in the question. We use the knowledge that a question asks about a process, rather than a fact, to develop categories of information need implied by the questions to aid in retrieval. We focus on questions because by their nature questions carry more information. A well-known technique for improving retrieval is query expansion. A variety of query expansion and disambiguation techniques have been studied [1] [2] [3] [5], and although none distinguish between fact-orientation and taskorientation, several do distinguish categories of information need not explicit in the queries. Understanding that the user has already made their information need clear by using a question rather than a keyword query, we utilized information encoded in the factor taskorientation to infer the type of information need. We found a measurable difference between taskand fact-oriented questions, and preliminary results indicate that treating factand task-oriented questions differently improves retrieval.
