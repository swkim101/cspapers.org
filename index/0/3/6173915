A methodology for demonstrating the security of trusted applications on a security kernel base is presented. The methodology consists of selecting and authenticating security criteria, and demonstrating through verification techniques that the implementation obeys the selected criteria. Difficulties encountered in the placement of a trusted application on top of a security kernel base motivated the development of the methodology.
