Instead, apart from learning from a batch of labelled training data, robots should continuously update and learn new object categories while working in the environment. This paper proposes a cognitive architecture designed to create a concurrent 3D object category learning and recognition in an interactive and open-ended manner. In particular, this cognitive architecture provides automatic perception capabilities that will allow robots to detect objects in highly crowded scenes and learn new object categories from the set of accumulated experiences in an incremental and open-ended way. Moreover, it supports constructing the full model of an unknown object in an on-line manner and predicting next best view for improving object detection and manipulation performance. We provide extensive experimental results demonstrating system performance in terms of recognition, scalability, next-best-view prediction and real-world robotic applications.
