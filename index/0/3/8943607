Recent debate has centered on the relative promise of focusinguser-interface research on developing new metaphors and tools thatenhance users abilities to directly manipulate objects versusdirecting effort toward developing interface agents that provideautomation. In this paper, we review principles that show promisefor allowing engineers to enhance human-computer interactionthrough an elegant coupling of automated services with directmanipulation. Key ideas will be highlighted in terms of the Lookoutsystem for scheduling and meeting management.
