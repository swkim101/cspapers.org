Effective access to and navigation in information stored in deep Web ontological repositories or relational databases has yet to be realized due to issues with usability of user interfaces and the overall scope and complexity of information as well as the nature of exploratory user tasks. We propose the integration and adaptation of novel navigation and visualization approaches to faceted browsing such as visual depiction of facets and restrictions, visual navigation in (clusters of) search results and graph like exploration of individual search results' properties.
