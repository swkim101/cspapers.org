We present several general, broadly applicable mechanisms that enable computations to execute with reduced resources, typically at the cost of some loss in the accuracy of the result they produce.We identify several general computational patterns that interact well with these resource reduction mechanisms, present a concrete manifestation of these patterns in the form of simple model programs, perform simulationbased explorations of the quantitative consequences of applying these mechanisms to our model programs, and relate the model computations (and their interaction with the resource reduction mechanisms) to more complex benchmark applications drawn from a variety of fields.
