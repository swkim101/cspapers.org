This paper provides an extensive analysis of pre-stored streaming media workloads, focusing on the client interactive behavior. We analyze four workloads that fall into three different domains, namely, education, entertainment video and entertainment audio. Our main goals are: (a) to identify qualitative similarities and differences in the typical client behavior for the three workload classes and (b) to provide data for generating realistic synthetic workloads.
