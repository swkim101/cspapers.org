The model-checking problem for Resource Agent Logic is known to be undecidable. We review existing (un)decidability results and identify a significant fragment of the logic for which model checking is decidable. We discuss aspects which makes model checking decidable and prove undecidability of two open fragments over a class of models in which agents always have a choice of doing nothing.
