This paper provides a systematic study of the impact of sparsity on the computation of many different dynamic programming recurrences whose applications include sequence analysis. These recurrences are defined over a number of points that is quadratic in the input size. However, due to natural constraints of the problems, only a sparse set matters for the result. Based on new algorithmic techniques, we obtain algorithms that improve the best known time bounds by a factor almost linear in the density of the problems. All our algorithms are based upon a common unifying methodology.
