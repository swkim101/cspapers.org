This paper presents the discourse annotation followed in Cast3LB, a Spanish corpus annotated with several information sources (morphological, syntactic, semantic and coreferential) at syntactic, semantic and discourse level. 3LB annotation scheme has been developed for three languages (Spanish, Catalan and Basque). Human annotators have used a set of tagging techniques and protocols. Several tools have provided them with a friendly annotation scheme. At discourse level, anaphoric and coreference expressions are annotated. One of the most interesting contributions to this annotation scenario is the enriched anaphora resolution module that is based on the previously defined semantic annotation phase to expand the discourse information and use it to suggest the correct antecedent of an anaphora to the annotator. This paper describes the relevance of the semantic tags in the discourse annotation in Spanish corpus Cast3LB and shows both levels and tools in the mentioned discourse annotation scheme.
