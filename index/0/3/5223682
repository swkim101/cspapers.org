This paper provides a practical framework for planning and control of formations of multiple unmanned ground vehicles to traverse between goal points in a dynamic environment. This framework allows online planning of the formation paths using a Dijkstra's search algorithm based on the current sensor data. The formation is allowed to dynamically change in order to avoid obstacles in the environment while minimizing a cost function aimed at obtaining collision-free and deadlock-free paths. Based on the feasible path for a virtual leader of the group, the trajectory planner satisfies the kinematic constraints of the individual vehicles while accounting for inter-vehicle collision and path constraints. A Lyapunov based controller is designed to keep the vehicles on their planned trajectories. Illustrative simulations of groups of unmanned ground vehicles and their laboratory implementation with three unmanned ground vehicles are presented.
