In many applications, a vision sensor often needs to move from one place to another and change its configuration for perception of different object features. A dynamic reconfigurable vision sensor is useful in such a case to gaze at the features. This paper introduces this concept and investigates the issues in self-recalibrating a 6-DOF structured light system under changing sensing configuration. The relative pose between the projector and camera of the system is calibrated by taking a single view of the scene, so that the 3D measurements and reconstruction can be performed immediately when and if the configuration of the system is changed. Experiments were carried out to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed method.
