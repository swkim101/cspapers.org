Most of the existing compiler optimizations are developed for dense matrix programs. Irregular problems, on the other hand, have to rely on runtime optimizations, since the data access patterns are unknown at the compile-time. However, many scientific computing problems result in solving linear systems where the matrix of coefficients is banded, a structure known at the compile-time, but more complicated than the dense matrices. Banded matrix problems are interesting since substantial savings can be made by exploiting the mathematical properties of the bandedness. The complicated memory accesspatterns in the banded matrix programs make the existing compile-time optimizations impossible to use.
