Streaming applications have become more and more dynamic and heterogeneous thanks to new technologies which enable platforms like microcontrollers and Web browsers to be able to host part of a streaming topology. A dynamic heterogeneous streaming application should support load balancing and fault tolerance while being capable of adapting and rearranging topologies to user needs at runtime. In this paper we present a REST API to control dynamic heterogeneous streaming applications. By means of resources, their uniform interface and hypermedia we show how it is possible to monitor, change and adapt the deployment configuration of a streaming topology at runtime.
