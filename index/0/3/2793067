This paper outlines a methodology to improve the performance of the weakest students through networked hypermedia and in-class exercises. These efforts are an outgrowth of experiments using networked hypermedia in the form of the World Wide Web (WWW) as the basis for networked courseware [1-4]. While initial approaches significantly enhanced the performance of the average and best students, there was no noticeable gain in the performance of the weakest students [4]. They continued to come into class without preparing and expected to somehow condense the learning process into five 55-minute sections every two weeks. In order to enhance the performance of these students, a series of procedures were developed that should increase their performance while minimizing any negative impact on the rest of class. The first procedure uses a networked, Common Gateway Interface (CGI), form-based Student Response System to enhanced communications and expectations between the student and professor. The Student Response System automates the grading of homework assignments, and as a result, facilitates nightly homework assignments without increasing the grading load on the professor. The second component of this methodology involves developing a series of graded, in-class, group exercises that can be easily graded in-class, represents a substantial portion of the final grade, and requires a public presentation of the group's results. Together, these tools and practices form a methodology for reaching the weakest students and enhancing their performance.
