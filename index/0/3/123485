The University of New Brunswick offers a wide selection of upper year Computer Science electives. Systems analysis and design, consisting of the study and use of the system life cycle for developing business information systems together with associated techniques and issues, has been offered for about 14 years. Considered to be a “soft” subject in a sea of hard-core technical courses, for many years this course was elected by a manageable maximum of 15-25 students per year. In recent years, particularly due to reinforcement by an active group of employers in our expanding co-op program, the value of such a course has been more widely recognized by our students. This paper examines methods used to handle substantial enrollment increases (40-60 students) in a subject which is especially sensitive to class size. Efforts made to improve the effectiveness of teaching this non-technical but vital material to technically oriented students are discussed. As well, the differences between software engineering and systems analysis and design are outlined. A case is made for a change in the ACM Curriculum '78 Software Design course CS14 to relect the very important role of the analysis phase in software development.
