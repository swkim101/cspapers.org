If a binary search tree is created by inserting <italic>N</italic> keys in random order using the usual insertion algorithm, then it is well known that the average search path is about 1.4<italic>lgN</italic>. However, if deletions, using the frequently recommended Hibbard's algorithm, are interspersed with the insertions, then virtually nothing has been proven except for Knuth and Jonassen's very difficult, but complete, analysis of the case <italic>N</italic> = 3. In this paper it is shown that after a sufficient number of updates the average search path is <italic>&thgr;</italic>(<italic>N</italic><supscrpt>1/2</supscrpt>). An improved algorithm given by Knuth is shown to have the same asymptotic behavior.
