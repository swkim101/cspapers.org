This paper proposes techniques to fabricate synthetic gecko foot-hairs for future wall-climbing robots, and models for understanding the synthetic hair design issues. Two nanomolding fabrication techniques are proposed: the first method uses nanoprobe indented flat wax surface and the second one uses a nano-pore membrane as a template. These templates are molded with silicone rubber, polyimide, etc. type of polymer under vacuum. Next, design parameters such as length, diameter, stiffness, density, and orientation of hairs are determined for non matting and rough surface adaptability. Preliminary nano-hair prototypes showed adhesion close to the predicted values for natural specimens.
