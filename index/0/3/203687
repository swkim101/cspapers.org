"Tree SRL system" is a Semantic Role Labelling supervised system based on a tree-distance algorithm and a simple k-NN implementation. The novelty of the system lies in comparing the sentences as tree structures with multiple relations instead of extracting vectors of features for each relation and classifying them. The system was tested with the English CoNLL-2009 shared task data set where 79% accuracy was obtained.
