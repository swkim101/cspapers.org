In order to develop a high performance working robot, we design and develop a new robot based on the concept of "limb mechanism " for integration of legged locomotion and arm manipulation. The robot developed has six limbs which can be used for both locomotion and manipulation. The six limbs are set on vertices of regular hexagonal body so that this robot can have omnidirectional manipulability and mobility. We evaluate the stroke and the stability margin in all walking directions on six-legged and four-legged locomotion. As a result, this robot has higher omnidirectional mobility than conventional mechanisms.
