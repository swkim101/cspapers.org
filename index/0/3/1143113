Given the raising interest in light-field technology and the increasing availability of professional devices, a feasible and accurate calibration method is paramount to unleash practical applications. In this paper we propose to embrace a fully non-parametric model for the imaging and we show that it can be properly calibrated with little effort using a dense active target. This process produces a dense set of independent rays that cannot be directly used to produce a conventional image. However, they are an ideal tool for 3D reconstruction tasks, since they are highly redundant, very accurate and they cover a wide range of different baselines. The feasibility and convenience of the process and the accuracy of the obtained calibration are comprehensively evaluated through several experiments.
