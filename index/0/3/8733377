In this paper, a new method with impulse spectrum is presented as a more general way for vibration control of the robotic arm of flexible multiple links. An impulse spectrum is directly responsible for basic processions. The multiple ODE of the arm is analyzed as an LTI system fit for superposition due to its dynamically relative constant. The study shows that the impulse spectrum proposed to suppress vibration of the multiple links driven by a joint is dependent on the spectral functions of individual subsystem modes. An oscillatory matrix built with spectral functions of higher orders is derived for multi-degree optional design of the multilink, multi-mode spectrum robust against multiple parameters perturbation. Nonlinear programming is discussed to shorten a band spectrum. The band spectra are proposed, presented for wider robustness against variation of frequencies in the vicinity of a centered frequency, and for band robustness over grouped frequencies. Finally simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical work, and the satisfactory results are achieved.
