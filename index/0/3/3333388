This paper describes a general framework for representing iteration-reordering transformations. These transformations can be both matrix-based and non-matrix-based. Transformations are defined by rules for mapping dependence vectors, rules for mapping loop bound expressions, and rules for creating new initialization statements. The framework is extensible, and can be used to represent any iteration-reordering transformation. Mapping rules for several common transformations are included in the paper.
