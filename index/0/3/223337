In this paper, we propose a text representation model, Tensor Space Model (TSM), which models the text by multilinear algebraic high-order tensor instead of the traditional vector. Supported by techniques of multilinear algebra, TSM offers a potent mathematical framework for analyzing the multifactor structures. TSM is further supported by certain introduced particular operations and presented tools, such as the High-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) for dimension reduction and other applications. Experimental results on the 20 Newsgroups dataset show that TSM is constantly better than VSM for text classification.
