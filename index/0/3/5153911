We present an emerging indoor assisted navigation system for the visually impaired. The core of the system is a mobile robotic base with a sensor suite mounted on it. The sensor suite consists of an RFID reader and a laser range finder. Small passive RFID sensors are manually inserted in the environment. We describe how the system was deployed in two indoor environments and evaluated by visually impaired participants in a series of pilot experiments.
