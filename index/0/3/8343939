We propose three heuristics to determine the country of origin of a person or institution via text-based IE from the Web. We evaluate all methods on a collection of music artists and bands, and show that some heuristics outperform earlier work on the topic by terms of coverage, while retaining similar precision levels. We further investigate an extension using country-specific synonym lists.
