This paper addresses the problem of coverage control of a network of mobile sensors. In the current literature, this is commonly formulated as a locational optimization problem under the assumption that sensing performance is independent of the locations of sensors. We extend this work to a more general framework where the sensor model is location-dependent. We propose a distributed control law and coordination algorithm. If the global sensing performance function is known a priori, we prove that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge. To validate this algorithm, we conduct experiments with indoor and outdoor deployments of Cyclops cameras and model its sensing performance. This model is used to simulate deployments on 1D pathways and study the coverage obtained. We also examine the coverage in the case when the global sensing function is not known and is estimated in an online fashion.
