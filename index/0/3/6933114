In this paper, we investigate how to identify domain-sensitive opinion leaders in online review communities, and present a model to rank domain-sensitive opinion leaders. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct preliminary experiments on a real-world dataset from Amazon.com. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model is effective in identifying domain-sensitive opinion leaders.
