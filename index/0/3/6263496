We describe a (1 + e)-approximation algorithm for finding the minimum distortion embedding of an n-point metric space X into the shortest path metric space of a weighted graph G with m vertices. The running time of our algorithm is mO(1) · nO(ω) · (Δopt Δ)ω · (1/e)λ + 2 · λ · (O (Δopt))2λ parametrized by the values of the minimum distortion, Δopt, the spread, Δ, of the points of X, the treewidth, ω, of G, and the doubling dimension, λ, of G. In particular, our result implies a PTAS provided an X with polynomial spread, and the doubling dimension of G, the treewidth of G, and Δopt, are all constant. For example, if X has a polynomial spread and Δopt is a constant, we obtain PTAS's for embedding X into the following spaces: the line, a cycle, a tree of bounded doubling dimension, and a k-outer planar graph of bounded doubling dimension (for a constant k).
