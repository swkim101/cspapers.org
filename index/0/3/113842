The Deviation-value (D-value) is a new measure for software data involved during software development. The D-value provides an alternative to software metrics based upon “per number of lines of code” such as error rate (number of errors per thousand lines of code) and documentation rate (number of pages of module design documentation per thousand lines of code). Using D-value, the data of software modules are much more fairly evaluated than these conventional metrics.
This paper presents the derivation of the D-value using the theoretical background of a control chart called u chart and weighted regression analysis. The advantage of using the D-value rather than metrics based upon “per number of lines of code” is demonstrated through an analysis of the data of four projects. The D-value is used to find the data items which actually relate to software quality, and we find that the quality of each module measured by D-value becomes better as the documentation rate D-value increases. Finally, using the theory behind the D-value, a new software acceptance guideline is discussed.
