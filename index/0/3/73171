Oracle Symmetric Replication extends the asynchronous snapshot replication capabilities of 0racle7 to eliminate primary site or mw ownership restrictions imposed by the replication systam. Any row of any replicated table can be updated at any time by any database storing the row, Data replication configurations can be based on read-only or updatable snapshots of subsets of master tables, peer to peer replication of complete master tables, or a combination of these two configurations. Symmetic Replication is implemented as a Iayemd architecture that includes data trrmspo~ replication program generation, and distributed database administration components. The issues that Symmetric Replication raises for application design are being studied in the context of Oracle Applications products.
