The IMSL Fortran library has long supported parallel computing with MPI. As IMSL has progressed to more platforms like C, Java and .NET, our support for MPI has not, but there are tools available to parallelize IMSL solutions on these platforms. These options include ASPEED's ACCELLERANT, Interactive Supercomputing's Star-P, Brain Murmur's JIVA and the Digipede Network. This presentation will present these various options for parallelization of your IMSL-based solutions that aren't written in Fortran.
