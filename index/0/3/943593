This paper performs a comprehensive investigation of dynamic selection for long atomic traces. It introduces a classification of trace selection methods and discusses existing and novel dynamic selection approaches - including loop unrolling, procedure in-lining and incremental merging of traces based on dynamic bias. The paper empirically analyzes a number of selection schemes in an idealized framework.Observations based on the SPEC-CPU2000 benchmarks show that: (a) selection based on dynamic bias is necessary to achieve the best performance across all benchmarks, (b) the best selection scheme is benchmark and maximum trace-length specific, (c) simple selection, based on program structure information only, is sufficient to achieve the best performance for several benchmarks.Consequently, two alternatives for the trace selection mechanism are established: (a) a "best performance" approach relying on complex dynamic criteria; (b) a "value" approach that provides the best performance (and potentially the best power consumption) based on simpler static criteria. Another emerging alternative advocates adaptive based mechanisms to adjust selection criteria.
