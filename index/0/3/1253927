Database buffering normally assumes that a proper measure of performance is the number of pages transferred. This paper justifies that the number of I/Oâ€™s is the proper unit of measure. From this we derive a buffering policy that improves over known buffering policies for nested loop joins, we derive some buffering policies for hashing joins, and we make an observation about selections and query optimization.
