AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) provides an open and standardized E/E architecture for automobiles. AUTOSAR systems exhibit real-time requirements, i.e., an AUTOSAR application must always be schedulable. In this paper, we propose an overhead-aware method to find schedulable design configurations for an AUTOSAR application. We show how to construct a timing model for the application, discuss how to quantify the overheads of an AUTOSAR stack implementation, and assess their impact on timing and schedulability. We demonstrate the proposed method on an automotive case study and evaluate the effects of different types of overheads using synthetic applications.
