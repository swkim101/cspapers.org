In the last few years, the increasing interest in location-based services (LBS) has favored the introduction of geo-referenced information in various Web 2.0 applications, as well as the rise of location-based social networks (LBSN). Foursquare, one of the most popular LBSNs, gives incentives to users who visit (check in) specific places (venues) by means of, for instance, mayorships to frequent visitors. Moreover, users may leave tips at specific venues as well as mark previous tips as done in sign of agreement. Unlike check ins, which are shared only with friends, the lists of mayorships, tips and dones of a user are publicly available to everyone, thus raising concerns about disclosure of the user's movement patterns and interests. We analyze how users explore these publicly available features, and their potential as sources of information leakage. Specifically, we characterize the use of mayorships, tips and dones in Foursquare based on a dataset with around 13 million users. We also analyze whether it is possible to easily infer the home city (state and country) of a user from these publicly available information. Our results indicate that one can easily infer the home city of around 78% of the analyzed users within 50 kilometers.
