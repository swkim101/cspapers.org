We propose a reactive locomotion strategy, called height reflex, that is useful to address big elevation changes in the terrain (e.g. when a quadruped robot has to step down from a high platform). In these cases the swing leg can lose mobility creating issues in the subsequent steps. The height reflex is a foot trajectory replanning strategy that redistributes the swing motion (in a smart way) to the stance legs to “lower” the whole trunk and to aid the foothold searching motion. To spread the motion we exploit a massless link model of the robot with virtual dampers at the joints, which is used to replan the feet trajectories. The proposed approach is able to incorporate kinematic limits, it is easy-to-tune, computationally efficient and suitable for real-time implementations. The reflex is implemented and experimentally evaluated on the 80 kg hydraulic quadruped HyQ. With our approach we were able to address high steps, up to 24 cm which is 30% of HyQ leg length and 53% of its retractable leg range.
