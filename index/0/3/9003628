The notion of Cartesian closure on a set of unifiers has been used to define approximations of the least models of logic programs. Such approximations, often called types, are not known to be recursive. In this paper, we use Cartesian closure to define a similar, but more accurate, approximation. The main result proves that our approximation is not only recursive, but that it can be finitely represented in the form of a cyclic term graph. This explicit representation can be used as a starting point for logic program analyzers.
