Ocean wave simulation is a popular topic in computer graphics. We often use Fast Fourier Transforms to simulate ocean wave in a statistical model. In order to make ocean wave more realistic we use choppy wave to generate sharp wave, a particle system to simulate wave breaking, and a cube map to shade the ocean wave. We have implemented our simulation program on a GPU, and the implementation can simulate ocean wave in real time.
