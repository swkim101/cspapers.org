This talk is in response to two Awards: the Association for Computing Machinery’s Athena Award, given by the ACM’s Committee on Women, on the nomination of the ACM Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval; and the British Computer Society’s Lovelace Medal. It is a very great honour to have been given these awards. I would like to say how much I appreciate this recognition. Thank you, ACM and BCS. I would particularly like to say, and I hope the ACM will not take this amiss, how I appreciate being the first woman to be awarded the BCS Lovelace Medal. The awards carry the opportunity to give a lecture with them. I deeply regret not being able to do this live and in a way to suit each specifically. But I hope the single video based on this talk will go a little way as a substitute for two proper lectures.
