This paper proposes language concepts that facilitate the separation of an application into independent reusable building blocks and the integration of pre-build generic software components into applications that have been developed by third party vendors. A key element of our approach are on-demand remodularizations, meaning that the abstractions and vocabulary of an existing code base are translated into the vocabulary understood by a set of components that are connected by a common collaboration interface. This general concept allows us to mix-and-match remodularizations and components on demand.
