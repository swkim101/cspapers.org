We show that the automatically induced latent variable grammars of Petrov et al. (2006) vary widely in their underlying representations, depending on their EM initialization point. We use this to our advantage, combining multiple automatically learned grammars into an unweighted product model, which gives significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art individual grammars. In our model, the probability of a constituent is estimated as a product of posteriors obtained from multiple grammars that differ only in the random seed used for initialization, without any learning or tuning of combination weights. Despite its simplicity, a product of eight automatically learned grammars improves parsing accuracy from 90.2% to 91.8% on English, and from 80.3% to 84.5% on German.
