In this paper, we present examples from the literature of successful problem solving systems that have been heavily influenced directly from biological studies of insect societies. Included among these systems are a few of our own. These examples are presented in light of manufacturing applications and only the tip of the iceberg is touched upon. It is our hope that the reader will find a new source of inspiration in problem solving tool design; and realize the potential of coordination mechanisms for multi-agent manufacturing systems inspired by social insects.
