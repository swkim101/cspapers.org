This paper deals with the problem of assessing the reliability of programs written using structured programming techniques and having undergone a certain amount of testing. A program is said to be verified if, for a given set of tests it can be shown that every case of interest has been tested. As this end is, however, unattainable, we will consider, in the following, that a program is verified if one can prove that all the logic paths in the program flow graph have been traversed. Therefore, we will consider that a certain degree of verification is attained with a given set of tests, according to the number of paths actually traversed. This degree of verification, which is a non-decreasing function of the number of tests can be considered as an assessment of program reliability. The degree of verification attained through experiments can then be deduced from the images of experiments in the program flow graph. This paper defines a practical procedure to perform such an evaluation.
