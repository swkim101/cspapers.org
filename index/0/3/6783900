In recent years, there has been a rapid and wide spread of non-traditional computing platforms, especially mobile and portable computing devices. As applications become increasingly sophisticated and processing power increases, the most serious limitation on these devices is the available battery life. Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) has been a key technique in exploiting the hardware characteristics of processors to reduce energy dissipation by lowering the supply voltage and operating frequency. The DVS algorithms are shown to be able to make dramatic energy savings while providing the necessary peak computation power in general-purpose systems. However, for a large class of applications in embedded real-time systems like cellular phones and camcorders, the variable operating frequency interferes with their deadline guarantee mechanisms, and DVS in this context, despite its growing importance, is largely overlooked/under-developed. To provide real-time guarantees, DVS must consider deadlines and periodicity of real-time tasks, requiring integration with the real-time scheduler. In this paper, we present a class of novel algorithms called real-time DVS (RT-DVS) that modify the OS's real-time scheduler and task management service to provide significant energy savings while maintaining real-time deadline guarantees. We show through simulations and a working prototype implementation that these RT-DVS algorithms closely approach the theoretical lower bound on energy consumption, and can easily reduce energy consumption 20% to 40% in an embedded real-time system.
