7â€™1~is paper presents a study oj the impact of reducing the vector register length in an out-o,f-order vector architecture. In hditional in-ol,der vector architectures, long vector registers hove tyljically been the norm. We start presentinq dnta thcct shows that, even for highly vectorizable codes, only a .smnll ,fraction Of all elements o,f u long vector register are rrctually used. We also show that reducing the register size in a traditional vector architecture in an attempt to reduce hardware cost and maximize register utilization results in a severe performance degradation. However, when we combine out-oj-order execution and short registers, our simulations show that the performance p:nnlty CUT& be made query small. Moreover, this new archi/tcturc tolerutes memory latency much better than a traditzonrcl machine and uses the storage space in each register more ejJiczently. We prese:tt results for a selection of the Spccji~S2 and Perfect Club codes that show speedups of the out-o,f-order machine over the traditional machine anywhere in Ihr range 1.1 to 1.6. Halving the register size (from 16Kb it1 the out-o,f-order machine down to 8Kb) yields speedups nroulld 1.3 and as high as 1.6. Even when reducing the register length to 1/d the original size, speedups are still around 1.2 olld when going to a register length of 16 elements (l/8 the or,iginal) most programs perform very close to the traditiorhnl an-older vector machine.
