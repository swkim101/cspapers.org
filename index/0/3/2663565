Placing elements into locations to minimize some function is a problem that appears in several areas. In the business world it is often called “the assignment of facilities to locations” [1] where the prime concern is problems such as assigning offices within a department, departments within a plant or placing warehouses for maximum distribution efficiency. Design Automation literature addresses the problem as the “backboard wiring problem” [2] This paper describes an interactive system, called IPLACE, that was designed to solve component placement on an interconnect plane but can be applied to other placement problem formulations. Problems can be solved with this system if (1) the problem has a set of elements, (2) a set of locations where elements are to be placed and (3) a list of interconnections describing how the elements communicate. Also the function being minimized must be related to element communication.
 Besides explaining the system this paper gives a detailed discussion and comparison of four algorithms (1) Steinberg's method of unconnected sets (2) steepest descent 2-way interchange, called gradient (3) 2-way interchange based on the first improvement in an interchange cycle (4) random search. These algorithms are applied to six sample problems and based on these results conclusions are drawn concerning the applicability, cost, and local minimum quality of each algorithm.
