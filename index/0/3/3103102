The poster describes our project of integrating mobile computing and security into the Computer Science program at North Carolina A&T State University. Twelve (12) course modules in mobile computing and security are being developed and integrated into existing Computer Science courses such as computer programming, software development, operating systems, and information assurance courses. Each course module includes learning objectives, a tutorial, presentation slides, hands-on labs and/or case studies, test questions, etc. The course module material we develop and our teaching experiences will be beneficial to computer science educators who are considering including mobile computing and mobile security into their curricula.
