This paper presents a PCB layout system developed within Bell-Northern Research. The system is implemented on a PDP-11/70 minicomputer and it has been in production use since July 1976. The system consists of several modules for carrying out various steps involved in the PCB layout process such as, data input, assigning the gates to packs, placement of components on the PCB and routing the interconnections. The system also consists of a set of post-processors which modify the PCB data suitable for manufacturing.
