Augmented Reality (AR) is a successful application area of Wearable Computing, especially for professional, industrial settings, in which mobility is an important factor. With the proliferation of mobile technology in the workplace, wearable computing research can offer a valuable contribution to the usability of mobile solutions, such as the use of context information to inform devices and services of the current task and user situation, relieve professionals of tedious and repetitive information entry tasks and increase worker safety in complex and hazardous environments. Wearable AR systems in general are widely utilized in various domains, including architecture, military, tourism, navigation, and entertainment. Such diverse usages impose several challenges on researchers from both areas of Augmented Reality and Wearable Computing, such as interaction, activity and context recognition, wearability, design, and modeling. For the second Workshop on Wearable Systems for Industrial Augmented Reality Applications, we have chosen the motto "How to industrialize wearable AR?" We have invited researchers from the relevant disciplines to present novel works and discuss the applications of state-of-the-art Wearable Computing research to Augmented Reality systems. The workshop will provide an opportunity for directed discussion sessions to identify current issues, research topics, and solution approaches, which lead to the proposal of future research directions.
