Recent work on spoken document retrieval has suggested that it is adequate to take the singlebest output of ASR, and perform text retrieval on this output. This is reasonable enough for the task of retrieving broadcast news stories, where word error rates are relatively low, and the stories are long enough to contain much redundancy. But it is patently not reasonable if one’s task is to retrieve a short snippet of speech in a domain where WER’s can be as high as 50%; such would be the situation with teleconference speech, where one’s task is to find if and when a participant uttered a certain phrase. In this paper we propose an indexing procedure for spoken utterance retrieval that works on lattices rather than just single-best text. We demonstrate that this procedure can improve F scores by over five points compared to singlebest retrieval on tasks with poor WER and low redundancy. The representation is flexible so that we can represent both word lattices, as well as phone lattices, the latter being important for improving performance when searching for phrases containing OOV words.
