As the preceding fault analysis on RSA Square-and-Multiple implementation which is based on modifying the public modulus N, is difficult to be executed in practice. This paper proposes a new method to execute fault analysis by regulating the voltage supply of the system to inject transient faults into multiplication operation instead of modifying the modulus N. In order to improve the feasibility of attack, we suggest an extension of fault analysis with recovering the key segment by segment instead of bit by bit. In the end, the complexity of the algorithm is analyzed. The expansibility and feasibility of algorithm are proved by demonstrating in theory and simulation experiments. The results of experiment show that the new fault analysis algorithm is more effective in practice.
