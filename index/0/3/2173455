This paper presents a near-future perception system named “Previewed Reality”. The system consists of an informationally structured environment (ISE), an immersive VR display, a stereo camera, an optical tracking system, and a dynamic simulator. In an ISE, a number of sensors are embedded, and information such as the position of furniture, objects, humans, and robots, is sensed and stored in a database. The position and orientation of the immersive VR display are also tracked by an optical tracking system. Therefore, we can forecast the next possible events using a dynamic simulator and synthesize virtual images of what users will see in the near future from their own viewpoint. The synthesized images, overlaid on a real scene by using augmented reality technology, are presented to the user. The proposed system can allow a human and a robot to coexist more safely by showing possible hazardous situations to the human intuitively in advance.
