We have reviewed the growth and propagation of a variety of software technologies in an attempt to discover natural characteristics of the process as well as principles and techniques useful in transitioning modern software technology into widespread use. What we have looked at is the technology maturation process, the process by which a piece of technology is first conceived, then shaped into something usable, and finally “marketed” to the point that it is found in the repertoire of a majority of professionals.
A major interest is the time required for technology maturation — and our conclusion is that technology maturation generally takes much longer than popularly thought, especially for major technology areas. But our prime interest is in determining what actions, if any, can accelerate the maturation of technology, in particular that part of maturation that has to do with transitioning the technology into widespread use. Our observations concerning maturation facilitators and inhibitors are the major subject of this paper.
