We introduce Grid-based SensorDCSP, a geometrically structured benchmark problem for the study of distributed CSP algorithms. This domain provides realistic structure of the communication and tracking constraints. We formally define this problem, and perform its worst-case complexity analysis. Likewise, we provide an average case empirical analysis of the AWC algorithm, studying its behavior on tractable and intractable sub-classes of our problem.
