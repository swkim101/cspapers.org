Chinese sentences are written with no special delimiters such as space to indicate word boundaries. Existing Chinese NLP systems therefore employ preprocessors to segment sentences into words. Contrary to the conventional wisdom of separating this issue from the task of sentence understanding, we propose an integrated model that performs word boundary identification in lockstep with sentence understanding. In this approach, there is no distinction between rules for word boundary identification and rules for sentence understanding. These two functions are combined. Word boundary ambiguities are detected, especially the fallacious ones, when they block the primary task of discovering the inter-relationships among the various constituents of a sentence, which essentially is the essence of the understanding process. In this approach, statistical information is also incorporated, providing the system a quick and fairly reliable starting ground to carry out the primary task of relationship-building.
