Graph clustering, often addressed as community detection, is a prominent task in the domain of graph data mining with dozens of algorithms proposed in recent years. In this paper, we focus on several popular community detection algorithms with low computational complexity and with decent performance on the artificial benchmarks, and we study their behaviour on real-world networks. Motivated by the observation that there is a class of networks for which the community detection methods fail to deliver good community structure, we examine the assortativity coefficient of ground-truth communities and show that assortativity of a community structure can be very different from the assortativity of the original network. We then examine the possibility of exploiting the latter by weighting edges of a network with the aim to improve the community detection outputs for networks with assortative community structure. The evaluation shows that the proposed weighting can significantly improve the results of community detection methods on networks with assortative community structure.
