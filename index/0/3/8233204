How do we know a program does what it claims to do? After clustering Android apps by their description topics, we identify outliers in each cluster with respect to their API usage. A "weather" app that sends messages thus becomes an anomaly; likewise, a "messaging" app would typically not be expected to access the current location. Applied on a set of 22,500+ Android applications, our CHABADA prototype identified several anomalies; additionally, it flagged 56% of novel malware as such, without requiring any known malware patterns.
