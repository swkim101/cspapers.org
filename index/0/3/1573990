This paper presents blackboard-based computational modal for parting an Inflectional free word order language, like Finnish. The structure of sentences is described as partial dependency trees of depth one. Parsing becomes a nondeterministic search problem in the forest of partial parse trees. The search process is able to solve ambiguities and long-distance dependencies as well. Parsing is controlled by a blackboard system. A working parser for Finnish has been implemented based on the model.
