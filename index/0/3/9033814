Classical Automata Theory (AT) is mainly about devices that operate in discrete time. Recent research stimulated the interest to, and the development of, paradigms in which continuous time is involved whether in a pure way or in cooperation with discrete time. This development is in particular evident in the area that covers the following three interrelated trends: automata, logic (arguing about automata) and interaction (composition of automata).
