In this paper, we propose a sentence ordering algorithm using a semi-supervised sentence classification and historical ordering strategy. The classification is based on the manifold structure underlying sentences, addressing the problem of limited labeled data. The historical ordering helps to ensure topic continuity and avoid topic bias. Experiments demonstrate that the method is effective.
