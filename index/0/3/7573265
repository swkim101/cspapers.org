Component-Based Development (CBD) is established in many application domains. There is a strong trend in applying the same approach in different domains of dependable systems. However, a precondition of a successful use of CBD in these domains is the utilization of theories, methods and technologies to predict and evaluate dependability attributes. This tutorial gives an analysis of current methodologies of attribute-specific evaluation methods for dependable component-based systems. We identify limitations of the current technologies, discusses existing and possible new solutions to overcome these limitations both from a research-oriented and practical perspective.
