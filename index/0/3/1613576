Purpose of this study Recently, several technologies for future smartphones based on virtualization have been emerging. One open source approach supported by the EU, called eMuCo, combines embedded virtualization and multicore architectures. The eMuCo embedded virtualization software platform is based on a microkernel which is accompanied by a flexible system software layer running on top to provide runtime and virtualization services. When introducing virtualization services, the already existing software has to be significantly enhanced to run as a process, which can cause serious difficulties. By porting a 3GPPcompliant protocol stack to the eMuCo system, we show that the offered virtualization services require new design and development paradigms, especially when considering that the protocol stack runs natively on the microkernel. Using the concepts presented, the risks for failures in software architecture designs and project management while porting large legacy software on embedded virtualized environments can be significantly reduced.
