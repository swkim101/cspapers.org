Most existing algorithms for learning latent-variable models---such as EM and existing Gibbs samplers---are token-based, meaning that they update the variables associated with one sentence at a time. The incremental nature of these methods makes them susceptible to local optima/slow mixing. In this paper, we introduce a type-based sampler, which updates a block of variables, identified by a type, which spans multiple sentences. We show improvements on part-of-speech induction, word segmentation, and learning tree-substitution grammars.
