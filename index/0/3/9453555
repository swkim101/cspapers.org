This paper presents a real-time image restoration method for aerial inspection images that are degraded by the appearance of a passive rotating shell of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Only images are required as the input. The method mainly consists of feature-based object detection for joints of the UAV shell, outlier rejection based on a sample consensus (SAC) approach and the geometrical model of the shell, reconstruction of the entire region that the shell appears in, and inpainting of the shell. Not only a pure algorithm for general UAVs with passive rotating shells but also an implementation specialized for a UAV that we have been developing are presented. The successfully implemented algorithm was evaluated for actual inspection flights under different conditions. The average rate of successful image restoration was 81.1% at 4.3 fps.
