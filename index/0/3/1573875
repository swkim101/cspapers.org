Most prior techniques for proximity computations are designed for synthetic models and assume exact geometric representations. However, real robots construct representations of the environment using their sensors, and the generated representations are more cluttered and less precise than synthetic models. Furthermore, this sensor data is updated at high frequency. In this paper, we present new collision- and distance-query algorithms, which can efficiently handle large amounts of point cloud sensor data received at real-time rates. We present two novel techniques to accelerate the computation of broad-phase data structures: 1) we present a progressive technique that incrementally computes a high-quality dynamic AABB tree for fast culling, and 2) we directly use an octree representation of the point cloud data as a proximity data structure. We assign a probability value to each leaf node of the tree, and the algorithm computes the nodes corresponding to high collision probability. In practice, our new approaches can be an order of magnitude faster than previous methods. We demonstrate the performance of the new methods on both synthetic data and on sensor data collected using a Kinectâ„¢ for motion planning for a mobile manipulator robot.
