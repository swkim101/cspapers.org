A single model for access control across the database and application server tiers is crucial to ensure consistent secure access to data in all the tiers. In this paper, we present the common model for access control within Oracle database and application tiers which is based on the standard WebDAV ACLs (Access Control Lists). Further, we discuss the flexible mechanisms for defining ACLs and associating them with data and various optimization techniques for efficiently evaluating ACLs in large scale enterprise applications.
