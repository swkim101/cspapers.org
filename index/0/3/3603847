It is a common case in our writing when we would like to cite someone’s statement, like a proverb or a statement by some famous people, to make our composition more elegant or convincing. However, sometimes we are so eager to make a citation of quote somewhere, but have no idea about the relevant quote to express our idea. Because knowing or remembering so many quotes is not easy, it is exciting to have a system to recommend relevant quotes for us while writing. In this paper we tackle this appealing AI task, and build up a learning framework for quote recommendation. We collect abundant quotes from the Internet, and mine real contexts containing these quotes from large amount of electronic books, to build up a dataset for experiments. We explore the particular features of this task, and propose a few useful features to model the characteristics of quotes and the relevance of quotes to contexts. We apply a supervised learning to rank model to integrate multiple features. Experiment results show that, our proposed approach is appropriate for this task and it outperforms other recommendation methods.
