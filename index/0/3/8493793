Question Classification plays an important role in most Question Answering systems. In this paper, we exploit semantic features in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for Question Classification. We propose a semantic tree kernel to incorporate semantic similarity information. A diverse set of semantic features is evaluated. Experimental results show that SVMs with semantic features, especially semantic classes, can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art systems.
