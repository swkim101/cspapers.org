Universities have always claimed that as well as educating students in particular content, they have “developed the students' minds”. A current trend is asking instructors to justify this claim, by ensuring that students have “generic skills” that are useful in all fields. Examples include communication skills, flexibility to apply their understanding to new situations as they arise, problem-solving skills, ability to transfer concepts between domains, and capacity to evaluate alternatives and provide reasoned explanations for their choices. This paper describes a course which covers most of the material from a typical computer organization or systems programming course, but uses closed laboratories in ways that enhance the students' generic skills as well as their expertise in the technical material.
