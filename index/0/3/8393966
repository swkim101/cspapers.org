This paper introduces a novel evaluation framework for question series and employs it to explore the effectiveness of QA and IR systems at addressing usersâ€™ information needs. The framework is based on the notion of recall curves, which characterize the amount of relevant information contained within a fixed-length text segment. Although it is widely assumed that QA technology provides more efficient access to information than IR systems, our experiments show that a simple IR baseline is quite competitive. These results help us better understand the role of NLP technology in QA systems and suggest directions for future research.
