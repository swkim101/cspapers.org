The vision of Large Scale Network Analysis (LSNA) states on large amounts of network data, which are produced by social media applications like Facebook, Twitter, and the competitive domain of biological networks as well as their needs for network data extraction and analysis. That raises data management challenges which are addressed by biological, data mining and linked (web) data management communities. So far, mainly these domains were considered when identifying research topics and measuring approaches and progress. We argue that an important domain, the Business Network Management (BNM), representing business and (technical) integration data, implicitely linked and available in enterprises, has been neglected. Not only do enterprises need visibilities into their business networks, they need ad-hoc analysis capabilities on them. In this paper, we introduce BNM as domain, which comes with large scale network data. We discuss how linked business data can be made explicit by what we called Network Mining (NM) from dynamic, heterogeneous enterprise environments to combine it to a (cross-) enterprise linked business data network and state on its different facets w.r.t large network analysis and highlight challenges and opportunities.
