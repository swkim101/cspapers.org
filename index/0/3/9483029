The setup of tilting a 2D laser range finder up and down is a widespread strategy to acquire 3D point clouds. This setup requires that the scene is static while the robot takes a 3D scan. If an object moves through the scene during the measurement process and one does not take into account these movements, the resulting model will get distorted. This paper presents an approach to reconstruct the 3D model of a moving rigid object from the inconsistent set of 2D measurements by the help of a camera. Our approach utilizes optical flow in the camera images to estimate the motion in the image plane and point-line constraints to compensate the missing information about the motion in depth. We combine multiple sweeps and/or views into to a single consistent model using a point-to-plane ICP approach and optimize single sweeps by smoothing the resulting trajectory. Experiments obtained in real outdoor scenarios with moving cars demonstrate that our approach yields accurate models.
