This paper presents an algorithm for unsupervised noun sense induction, based on clustering of Web search results. The algorithm does not utilize labeled training instances or any other external knowledge source. Preliminary results on a small dataset show that this technique provides two advantages over other techniques in the literature: it detects real-world senses not found in dictionaries or other lexical resources, and it does not require that the number of word senses be specified in advance.
