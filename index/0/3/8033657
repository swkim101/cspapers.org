Technology design rules are one cornerstone to the production of quality products. Rules are required to execute a design and to check a design for accuracy. Design tools and checking programs, driven by rules, are utilized to assist in the design process.
 How can we build design tools and checking programs which will survive in this environment? How can we give these CAD program some measure of technology independence?
 Can the rule-generation process be simplified and automated? Can the rule-generation process be formalized to bridge different and changing technologies? Can design integrity be improved through computer-aided design rule generation? Can the tedious job of manual rule generation be eliminated? Can design rules automation improve product quality?
 These are some of the problems the workshop participants will be addressing. The participants have been asked to submit a brief position paper along with a 10-minute explanation of their views.
