This paper examines the problem of white-balance correction when a scene contains two illuminations. This is a two step process: 1) estimate the two illuminants, and 2) correct the image. Existing methods attempt to estimate a spatially varying illumination map, however, results are error prone and the resulting illumination maps are too lowresolution to be used for proper spatially varying whitebalance correction. In addition, the spatially varying nature of these methods make them computationally intensive. We show that this problem can be effectively addressed by not attempting to obtain a spatially varying illumination map, but instead by performing illumination estimation on large sub-regions of the image. Our approach is able to detect when distinct illuminations are present in the image and accurately measure these illuminants. Since our proposed strategy is not suitable for spatially varying image correction, a user study is performed to see if there is a preference for how the image should be corrected when two illuminants are present, but only a global correction can be applied. The user study shows that when the illuminations are distinct, there is a preference for the outdoor illumination to be corrected resulting in warmer final result. We use these collective findings to demonstrate an effective two illuminant estimation scheme that produces corrected images that users prefer.
