In a knowledge-based system, the extent to which a knowledge base has been “normalised” will effect the cost of maintaining the integrity of the system. A fundamental step in our approach to the design of knowledge-based systems is the construction of a conceptual model. This conceptual model represents things in the application as formal “objects”. An important feature of this approach is that a single form of “object” is used to model data, information and knowledge. Another step in our approach is the “normalisation” of the conceptual model. We state a single principle of normalisation that applies to objects irrespective of whether they represent data, information or knowledge things. In particular, the conventional normal forms for relational database are all special cases of this single principle.
