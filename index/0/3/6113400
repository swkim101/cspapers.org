This paper describes a simple microcomputer network system and its architectural support for four categories of database operations. The design and implementation of hardware and software and the parallel algorithms for the database operations are described and illustrated. Three new algorithms, one for finding maximum/minimum, and two for sorting distributed files, are presented together with their implementations in MICRONET. The results of the analyses of the new sorting algorithms and a comparison with other sorting algorithms are also given. The system is characterized by its simplicity in network connection and communication, flexibility in expanding or contracting the size of the network, reliability achieved by interchangeable hardware and software, and high performance achieved by one-to-all broadcasting, hardware scheduling, and special control lines for inter-processor communication and synchronization.
