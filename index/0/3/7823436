Safe and robust grasping of unknown objects is a major challenge in robotics, which has no general solution yet. A promising approach relies on haptic exploration, where active optimization strategies can be employed to reduce the number of exploration trials. One critical problem is that certain optimal grasps discoverd by the optimization procedure may be very sensitive to small deviations of the parameters from their nominal values: we call these unsafe grasps because small errors during motor execution may turn optimal grasps into bad grasps. To reduce the risk of grasp failure, safe grasps should be favoured. Therefore, we propose a new algorithm, unscented Bayesian optimization, that performs efficient optimization while considering uncertainty in the input space, leading to the discovery of safe optima. The results highlight how our method outperforms the classical Bayesian optimization both in synthetic problems and in realistic robot grasp simulations, finding robust and safe grasps after a few exploration trials.
