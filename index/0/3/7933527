Modern distributed version control systems offer compelling advantages for teaching students professional software development practices and skills. In this paper, we explore the potential for incorporating Mercurial into introductory, intermediate, and advanced computing courses. By incorporating version control into the entire CS curriculum, instructors create unique opportunities to engage students in collaborative, real-world projects and activities, giving them critical early exposure to the expectations and assumptions prevalent in the software development community. Early introduction to version control provides students with an important foundation in both personal and collaborative development excellence, offering them a competitive edge in the marketplace and a superior understanding of software development best practice.
