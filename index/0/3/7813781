The local choice of individual actions in the collective with antagonistic interaction may in principle lead to unstable, burst-like regimes in this collective. In the mathematical model of such a collective considered below (which is convenient to treat in terms of a collective of radiostations interfering with each other during their is determined with all the coefficients characterizing the interaction in the collective. For this reason the coherently local approach to the control of that system necessarily forces one to look for local criteria of control which could always provide the stable choice of actions (powers) by the radio-stations under consideration. It is a matter of control elasticity that leads him further to the elastic local criterion of power control. This criterion seems to be the most "reasonable" for such a collective, but it is rather complicated in realization. From the formal point of view the analysis of the local criteria is reduced to studying properties of Nash parties in corresponding automata games.
