This paper presents a cooperative random search algorithm for distributed independent autonomous robots. Our focus is to develop a distributed algorithm for a team of simple robots searching for targets in an unknown environment The search algorithm consists of five simple behavioral rules for each robot. It is implemented in both simulation and physical robots. The results we obtained demonstrated that the rule set is effective and robust to dynamic changes in the environment layout.
