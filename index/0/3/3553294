Internet of Things (IoT) is a research field that develops communications and possesses many challenges although it is the development of communications. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many techniques such as Multi-agent system (MAS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Fuzzy Systems (FS), Genetic Algorithms (GA) these techniques should be considered in the future of IoT as they have high processing computing.
