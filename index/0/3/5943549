Association rule mining plays an important job in knowledge and information discovery. However, there are still shortcomings with the quality of the discovered rules and often the number of discovered rules is huge and contain redundancies, especially in the case of multi-level datasets. Previous work has shown that the mining of non-redundant rules is a promising approach to solving this problem, with work by [6,8,9,10] focusing on single level datasets. Recent work by Shaw et. al. [7] has extended the non-redundant approaches presented in [6,8,9] to include the elimination of redundant exact basis rules from multi-level datasets. Here we propose a continuation of the work in [7] that allows for the removal of hierarchically redundant approximate basis rules from multi-level datasets by using a dataset's hierarchy or taxonomy.
