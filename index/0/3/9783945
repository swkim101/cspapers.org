Active learning is a machine learning approach to achieving high-accuracy with a small amount of labels by letting the learning algorithm choose instances to be labeled. Most of previous approaches based on discriminative learning use the margin for choosing instances. We present a method for incorporating confidence into the margin by using a newly introduced online learning algorithm and show empirically that confidence improves active learning.
