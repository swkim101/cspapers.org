Upper bounds on worst-case execution times, which are commonly called WCET, are a prerequisite for validating the temporal correctness of tasks in a real-time system. Due to the execution history sensitive behavior of components like caches, pipelines, buffers and periphery, the static determi-nation of safe upper execution-time bounds is a challenging task.A successful timing analysis approach developed at Saarland University/AbsInt GmbH uses abstract interpretation to derive safe WCET bounds based on timing models of the processor and periphery in a system. So far, WCET research has focused on processor timing behavior. System performance depends heavily on the performance of the periphery, namely the system controller, which includes the memory access logic. This paper is the first to describe experience in deriving a timing model for such a system con-troller. The starting point is the VHDL description from which the controllers FPGA implementation is synthesized. By a sequence of simplifications and abstractions we obtain an abstract VHDL model which can be translated easily into a timing model.The evaluation of the derived WCET tool shows that the approach leads to a precise and efficient analysis. This opens up the perspective of automatically deriving timing models from VHDL descriptions also for processors.
