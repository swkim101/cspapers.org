For many users with a disability it can be difficult or impossible to use a computer mouse to navigate the web. An alternative way to select elements on a web page is the label typing approach, in which users select elements by typing part of the label. In most cases, these labels are specified by the page authors, but some selectable elements do not have an obvious textual description, thus requiring that a label be generated. The set of element labels on a web page must be both efficient to select by text input and meaningful to the user. This paper discusses our approach to this problem, using page structural analysis and user history to determine important elements of a page, and then matching this information with the efficiency model of the input device.
