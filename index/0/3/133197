This paper presents the experimental evaluation results of antenna arrangement method for 2Ã—2 MIMO sensor. In the proposed arrangement, all of the transmitting and receiving antennas are located closely. The measurement campaign of MIMO channel in the indoor environment is carried out. The intrusion detection performance with the various antenna arrangements are evaluated for the human positions all over the room. It is found that the proposed antenna arrangement achieves the compact configuration of the sensor antenna system as well as high detection performance.
