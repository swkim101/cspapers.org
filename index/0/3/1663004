Named entity disambiguation is the task of linking an entity mention in a text to the correct real-world referent predefined in a knowledge base, and is a crucial subtask in many areas like information retrieval or topic detection and tracking. Named entity disambiguation is challenging because entity mentions can be ambiguous and an entity can be referenced by different surface forms. We present an approach that exploits Wikipedia relations between entities co-occurring with the ambiguous form to derive a range of novel features for classifying candidate referents. We find that our features improve disambiguation results significantly over a strong popularity baseline, and are especially suitable for recognizing entities not contained in the knowledge base. Our system achieves state-of-the-art results on the TAC-KBP 2009 dataset.
