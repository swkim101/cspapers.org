This paper reports on methods for incorporating camera calibration uncertainty into a two-view sparse bundle adjustment (SBA) framework. The co-registration of two images is useful in mobile robotics for determining motion over time. These camera measurements can constrain a robot's relative poses so that the trajectory and map can be estimated in a technique known as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Here, we comment on the importance of propagating uncertainty in both feature extraction and camera calibration in visual pose-graph SLAM. We derive an improved pose covariance estimate that leverages the Unscented Transform, and compare its performance to previous methods in both simulated and experimental trials. The two experiments reported here involve data from a camera mounted on a KUKA robotic arm (where a precise ground-truth trajectory is available) and a Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (HAUV) for large-scale autonomous ship hull inspection.
