We prove a structural result for degree-d polynomials. In particular, we show that any degree-d polynomial, p can be approximated by another polynomial, p<sub>0</sub>, which can be decomposed as some function of polynomials q1,· · ·, q<sub>m</sub> with q<sub>i</sub> normalized and m=O<sub>d</sub>(1), so that if X is a Gaussian random variable, the probability distribution on (q<sub>1</sub>(X), · · · , q<sub>m</sub>(X)) does not have too much mass in any small box. Using this result, we prove improved versions of a number of results about polynomial threshold functions, including producing better pseudorandom generators, obtaining a better invariance principle, and proving improved bounds on noise sensitivity.
