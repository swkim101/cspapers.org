This paper presents our work on accumulation of lexical sets which includes acquisition of dictionary resources and production of new lexical sets from this. The method for the acquisition, using a context-free syntax-directed translator and text modification techniques, proves easy-to-use, flexible, and efficient. Categories of production are analyzed, and basic operations are proposed which make up a formalism for specifying and doing production. About 1.7 million lexical units were acquired and produced from dictionaries of various types and complexities. The paper also proposes a combinatorial and dynamic organization for lexical systems, which is based on the notion of virtual accumulation and the abstraction levels of lexical sets.
