There is good evidence that students learn better when given more opportunity to practice skills using related problems. However, this requires a sufficient supply of automatically graded problems to enable instant feedback. This can be achieved through automating the process of problem generation. While a few dynamic problem generation systems exist, they are either very specific to a single topic (such as tools for automatic generation of parameterized questions for Java or C programming or they are intended for other disciplines and not easily adapted to the needs of Computer Science. We have developed a prototype system for authoring, administering, and grading dynamic problems. This system is specifically designed for computer science. To this end, it supports complex logic, calling external programs such as compilers or databases, and the creation and manipulation of figures and diagrams. Problems and useful code libraries can be created and shared between instructors. It is a web-based system where instructors can specify problems by combining static text or images with bits of Lua code which add dynamism. When students use the system, their answers will be graded automatically, and they will be able to see the results, thus giving them quicker feedback. This is an integrated portion of a larger gamified learning platform called OneUp which is under development and aims to combine hands-on practicing with additional game-like motivational mechanisms. The goal of both the larger platform and the dynamic problems in specific is to increase student engagement in the learning process.
