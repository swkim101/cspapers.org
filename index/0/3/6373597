We are designing a number of programming projects which utilize input/output devices, such as joysticks or a homebrewed board we call a MIPPET (Module for Input/Output Programming Projects Enhancing Teaching). These projects have been used or will be used in the closed labs of our CS1 course (taught in C++). The goal of these projects is to enhance student comprehension (by teaching objects with "real" objects) and student motivation (by providing "fun" projects). This paper focuses on an early project, where the student's program provides support for a human solving a maze.
