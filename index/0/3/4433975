This paper describes a tool, called Nodose, we have developed to expedite the creation of robust wrappers. Nodose allows non-programmers to build components that can convert data from the source format to XML or another generic format. Further, the generated code performs a set of statistical checks at runtime that attempt to find extraction errors before they are propogated back to users.
