The GIVE Challenge is a recent shared task in which NLG systems are evaluated over the Internet. In this paper, we validate this novel NLG evaluation methodology by comparing the Internet-based results with results we collected in a lab experiment. We find that the results delivered by both methods are consistent, but the Internet-based approach offers the statistical power necessary for more fine-grained evaluations and is cheaper to carry out.
