Modern phrase-based machine translation systems make extensive use of wordbased translation models for inducing alignments from parallel corpora. This is problematic, as the systems are incapable of accurately modelling many translation phenomena that do not decompose into word-for-word translation. This paper presents a novel method for inducing phrase-based translation units directly from parallel data, which we frame as learning an inverse transduction grammar (ITG) using a recursive Bayesian prior. Overall this leads to a model which learns translations of entire sentences, while also learning their decomposition into smaller units (phrase-pairs) recursively, terminating at word translations. Our experiments on Arabic, Urdu and Farsi to English demonstrate improvements over competitive baseline systems.
