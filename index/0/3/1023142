Electromigration-based deposition (EMBD) is an additive nanolithography technology for the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures. Key techniques for extending the capability of EMBD have been tackled experimentally including the deposition against a non-conductive surface, shape control of the as-deposited nanostructure, and continuous mass feeding. The process is based on nanofluidic mass delivery at the attogram scale from metal-filled carbon nanotubes (m@CNTs) using nanorobotic manipulation inside a transmission electron microscope. By attaching a conductive probe to the sidewall of the CNT, it has been shown that mass flow can be achieved regardless of the conductivity of the object surface. Experiments have shown the influence of heat sinks on the geometries of the deposits from EMBD. By modulating the relative position between the deposit and the heat sinks using dual probes, it has been possible to reshape the deposits. The limited mass encapsulated inside a CNT requires a frequent change of them for depositing large structures. To realize continuous feeding, a reservoir will be an excellent solution. We have observed that the copper inside the neighbor CNTs to the CNT injector can be sucked into the injector. Although the mechanism is not well understood yet, electromigration and atom-by-atom wall-passing-through may be responsible to this phenomenon. This observation enabled a new path for the design of an EMBD system. As a general-purposed nanofabrication process, EMBD will enable a variety of applications such as nanorobotic arc welding and assembly, nanoelectrodes direct writing, and nanoscale metallurgy.
