We present WhammyPhone, a novel audio interface that supports physical manipulation of digital audio through bend gestures. WhammyPhone combines a high-resolution flexible display, bend sensors, and a set of intuitive interaction techniques that enable novice users to manipulate sound in a tangible fashion. With WhammyPhone, bend gestures can control both discrete (e.g. triggering a note) and continuous parameters (e.g. pitch bend). We showcase application scenarios that leverage the unique input modalities of WhammyPhone and discuss its potential for digital audio manipulation.
