In this paper we present the networked robotics approach to dynamic architecture creation. Building on our prior work we highlight the ease at which system and architecture creation can be moved from the single robot domain to the cooperative/multiple robotic domain; indeed under the networked robotic framework there are no differences between the two, as a multiple, cooperative, robotic architecture simply emerges from a richer network environment (the module pool). Essentially task-driven architectures are instantiated on an as needed basis, allowing conceptualised designs to be run wherever a suitable framework (i.e. a module pool) exists. In this paper we demonstrate this framework applied in the creation of a multi robot system, highlighting the flexibility and robustness of the approach, and the experimental freedom inherent within it. The approach has been tested experimentally.
