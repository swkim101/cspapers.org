We propose a new unified framework for monolingual (MoIR) and cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) which relies on the induction of dense real-valued word vectors known as word embeddings (WE) from comparable data. To this end, we make several important contributions: (1) We present a novel word representation learning model called Bilingual Word Embeddings Skip-Gram (BWESG) which is the first model able to learn bilingual word embeddings solely on the basis of document-aligned comparable data; (2) We demonstrate a simple yet effective approach to building document embeddings from single word embeddings by utilizing models from compositional distributional semantics. BWESG induces a shared cross-lingual embedding vector space in which both words, queries, and documents may be presented as dense real-valued vectors; (3) We build novel ad-hoc MoIR and CLIR models which rely on the induced word and document embeddings and the shared cross-lingual embedding space; (4) Experiments for English and Dutch MoIR, as well as for English-to-Dutch and Dutch-to-English CLIR using benchmarking CLEF 2001-2003 collections and queries demonstrate the utility of our WE-based MoIR and CLIR models. The best results on the CLEF collections are obtained by the combination of the WE-based approach and a unigram language model. We also report on significant improvements in ad-hoc IR tasks of our WE-based framework over the state-of-the-art framework for learning text representations from comparable data based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
