Currently, many Computer Science Departments are considering the use of a language other than Pascal either for an entire Computer Science curriculum, or at least for some courses, such as data structures. At Georgia State University, where our program is primarily based on IBM PC compatible microcomputers, we have converted our data structures course from Pascal to Ada, and use Ada in several other courses. In this paper I will discuss the rationale behind our choice and our experience with using Ada on microcomputers.
