Probabilistic hash functions that hide all partial information on their input were recently introduced. This new cryptographic primitive can be regarded as a function that offers Upcrfcct one-wayneas”, in the following sense: Having access to the function value on Borne input is equivalent to having access only to an oracle that answers “yes” if the correct input lo queried, and answers “no” otherwise. Constructions of this primitive (originally called oracle ha&ing and here re-named perfectly one-way functions) were given based on certain strong variants of the Diflie-Hellman anaumption, In this work we present several constructions of perfectly one-way functions; some constructions are based on claw-free permutation, and others are based on any onewny permutation, One of our constructions is simple and efllcient to the point of being attractive from a practical point of view.
