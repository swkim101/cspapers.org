This paper is to investigate the group behavior patterns of search activities based on Web search history data, i.e., clickthrough data, to boost search performance. We propose a Collaborative Web Search (CWS) framework based on the probabilistic modeling of the co-occurrence relationship among the heterogeneous web objects: users, queries, and Web pages. The CWS framework consists of two steps: (1) a cube-clustering approach is put forward to estimate the semantic cluster structures of the Web objects; (2) Web search activities are conducted by leveraging the probabilistic relations among the estimated cluster structures. Experiments on a real-world clickthrough data set validate the effectiveness of our CWS approach.
