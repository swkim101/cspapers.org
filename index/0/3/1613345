This paper compares the consistency-based account of agreement phenomena in 'unification-based' grammars with an implication-based account based on a simple feature extension to Lambek Categorial Grammar (LCG). We show that the LCG treatment accounts for constructions that have been recognized as problematic for 'unification-based' treatments.
