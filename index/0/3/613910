Scholarly documents contain multiple figures representing experimental findings. These figures are generated from data which is not reported anywhere else in the paper. We propose a modular architecture for analyzing such figures. Our architecture consists of the following modules: 1. An extractor for figures and associated metadata (figure captions and mentions) from PDF documents; 2. A Search engine on the extracted figures and metadata; 3. An image processing module for automated data extraction from the figures and 4. A natural language processing module to understand the semantics of the figure. We discuss the challenges in each step, report an extractor algorithm to extract vector graphics from scholarly documents and a classification algorithm for figures. Our extractor algorithm improves the state of the art by more than 10% and the classification process is very scalable, yet achieves 85\% accuracy. We also describe a semi-automatic system for data extraction from figures which is integrated with our search engine to improve user experience.
