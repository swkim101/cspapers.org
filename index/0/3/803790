Three findpath problems are considered. First, the problem of finding a collision-free trajectory for a tentacle manipulator is examined. Second, a new findpath algorithm for a mobile robot rover is presented. This algorithm differs from earlier ones in its use of quantitative information about the uncertainty in the position of the robot to keep the robot away from obstacles without going too near them and without going too far out of its way to avoid them. Third, a method for coordinating two moving arms so that they avoid collisions with each other is presented. The two-arm findpath algorithm here is restricted to cases where coordinated collision-free trajectories can be found by controlling the velocities of the arms. Each of these findpath problems suggests a heuristic to find its solution and these are discussed at the end of the paper.
