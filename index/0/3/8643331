This paper presents a topic model that detects topic distributions over time. Our proposed model, Trend Detection Model (TDM) introduces a latent trend class variable into each document. The trend class has a probability distribution over topics and a continuous distribution over time. Experiments using our data set show that TDM is useful as a generative model in the analysis of the evolution of trends.
