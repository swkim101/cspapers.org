Multi-tree ensemble models have been proven to be effective for document ranking. Using a large number of trees can improve accuracy, but it takes time to calculate ranking scores of matched documents. This paper investigates data traversal methods for fast score calculation with a large ensemble. We propose a 2D blocking scheme for better cache utilization with simpler code structure compared to previous work. The experiments with several benchmarks show significant acceleration in score calculation without loss of ranking accuracy.
