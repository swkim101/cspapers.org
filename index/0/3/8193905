Grids are likely to be the mainstay of distributed computing . Efficient Resource discovery mechanism is one of the fundamental requirement for Grid computing systems.Peer-to-peer organization of Grid resource discovery services would have several desirable features, including high scalability, high reliability, self-organization and self-healing ,we propose a multi-agent based peer-to-peer approach for resource discovery in grids which allows for an efficient search of resources by maximizing the benefit of the replication mechanism and facilitate the discovery operations. A simulation analysis has been performed to evaluate the performance of the approach.
