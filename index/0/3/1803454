This paper presents a non-invasive human activity monitoring system with a low-cost Doppler sensor and a pair of radio frequency (RF) sensors. This radio-based system combines the strengths of two sensing modalities: fine granularity from a Doppler sensor and large sensing coverage from an RF link. The system is capable of detecting subtle human motion such as breathing, as well as walking in a large area. We deploy the system and perform experiments in a 5.5 m by 7.5 m room to classify four activities. Experimental results show that the average classification rate is 90%, 31% more accurate than a single Doppler system.
