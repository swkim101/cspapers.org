A novel, nonlinear algorithm is introduced for the estimation of rigid camera motion from instantaneous velocity measurements in the calibrated case. It is shown that by minimizing an approximation to the image-reprojection error rather than the actual error, as done by the optimal algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves largely increased robustness to local minima at the cost of a slightly decreased accuracy.
