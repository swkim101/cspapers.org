VLSI has become a glamorous buzz-word, and much talk has centered on evolutionary and revolutionary solutions to the Computer Aided Design of VLSI circuits. Not being altogether cynical, one may venture to say that CAD for LSI enjoyed a priviledged position in the last decade, and perhaps still does. While CAD for LSI was still being discussed and written about, and while CAD experts attempted to solve the much talked about layout problem by offering, to an interconnect-capacitance limited technology, solutions such as standard cells and automated routing, the industry went ahead and solved the same problem by giving computer aids to manual layout techniques, through the introduction of turnkey graphic systems. In proposing new solutions, it is important to understand the role played by turnkey graphics in LSI production.
 The following essential ingredients need to be thought about and developed to design VLSI systems.
 • A new look at chip architecture, with functional partitioning and allowing redundant logic to perform testing and self-correcting. Main frame architecture is already doing this.
 • Logic design data-base in the form of functional descriptions, as well as Boolean equations approximating transistor level representation that can be compared to logic representation extracted from chip topology.
 • An encoded method of representing layout, such as symbolic or stick methods, combined with optimized manual layout methods.
 • Presently available tools such as logic, fault, functional and circuit simulators updated to handle VLSI complexities.
 • An engineering oriented and owned Distributed Data Processing system with free access via terminals so that engineers, and not necessarily CAD programmers, can come up with innovative solutions to CAD problems.
