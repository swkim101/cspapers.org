Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are being used for a large number of location-dependent applications, where the measurement data is meaningless without accurate location of its origin. In many of these applications, where coarse accuracy is sufficient, range free localization techniques are being pursued as low cost alternative to the range based localization techniques. Localization in WSNs is to determine the physical position of a sensor node based on the known positions of other sensor nodes having a priori knowledge of their position. In this paper, we present range free Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) trained Sugeno weighted centroid localization and combined Mamdani-Sugeno fuzzy localization methods. In the proposed techniques the weights of anchor nodes are obtained either through ANFIS trained Sugeno fuzzy inference system or by combined Mamdani-Sugeno fuzzy inference approach. We compared the proposed techniques, through extensive simulation with simple centroid, Mamdani and Sugeno fuzzy methods. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed schemes
