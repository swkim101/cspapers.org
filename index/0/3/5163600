Device fingerprinting is commonly used for tracking users. We explore device fingerprinting but in the specific context of use for augmenting authentication, providing a state-of-the-art view and analysis. We summarize and classify 29 available methods and their properties; define attack models relevant to augmenting passwords for user authentication; and qualitatively compare them based on stability, repeatability, resource use, client passiveness, difficulty of spoofing, and distinguishability offered.
