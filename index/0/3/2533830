We define a set of deterministic bottom-up left to right parsers which analyze a subset of Tree Adjoining Languages. The LR parsing strategy for Context Free Grammars is extended to Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs). We use a machine, called Bottom-up Embedded Push Down Automation (BEPDA), that recognizes in a bottom-up fashion the set of Tree Adjoining Languages (and exactly this set). Each parser consists of a finite state control that drives the moves of a Bottom-up Embedded Pushdown Automaton. The parsers handle deterministically some context-sensitive Tree Adjoining Languages. In this paper, we informally describe the BEPDA then given a parsing table, we explain the LR parsing algorithm. We then show how to construct an LR(0) parsing table (no lookahead). An example of a context-sensitive language recognized deterministically is given. Then, we explain informally the construction of SLR(1) parsing tables for BEPDA. We conclude with a discussion of our parsing method and current work.
