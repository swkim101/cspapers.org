A method is proposed for partitioning input scenes into regions in which selected picture properties are regarded as uniform. In this procedure, usual statistical methods of inspecting average gray levels are not used, but the uniformity of complex picture properties such as shapes, sizes or arrangements of subpatterns in the pictures is examined by a structural analysis. The analyzing process is controlled by a supervisor which gives the order of changing the depth of interest in each picture property, and successive partitioning of the pictures is made toward an interpretable goal partition.
