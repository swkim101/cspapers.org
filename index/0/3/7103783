We present a study on the tradeoffs between three design parameters for robotic task systems that function in partially unknown and unstructured environments, and under timing constraints. The design space of these robotic tasks must incorporate at least three dimensions: (1) the amount of training effort to teach the robot to perform the task, (2) the time available to complete the task from the point when the command is given to perform the task, and (3) the quality of the result from performing the task. This paper presents a tradeoff study in this design space for a common robotic task, specifically, grasping of unknown objects in unstructured environments. The imprecise computation model is used to provide a framework for this study. The results were validated with a real robot and contribute to the development of a systematic approach for designing robotic task systems that must function in environments like flexible manufacturing systems of the future.
