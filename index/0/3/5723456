We describe JFK, a new key exchange protocol, primarily designed for use in the IP Security Architecture. It is simple, efficient, and secure; we sketch a proof of the latter property. JFK also has a number of novel engineering parameters that permit a variety of trade-offs, most notably the ability to balance the need for perfect forward secrecy against susceptibility to denial-of-service attacks.
