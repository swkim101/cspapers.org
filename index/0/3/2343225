With the increasing numbers of documents available from the Internet and other sources, finding anything is becoming increasingly difficult. This paper presents a new approach to finding documents that relies on compelling graphic presentations to the user. By creating compact representations of documents that can be easily transferred between computers, the approach allows the search process to occur on the userâ€™s desktop, distant from where the original documents are stored or where the indexes are created. Besides allowing searching to scale better to large numbers of information consumers, this allows the full graphical capabilities of tbe desktop computer to be applied to the problem. The ability to search for specific user keywords is replaced by user selection of topics from a list created by expert topic designers. The approach complements keyword searching as a way of finding information.
