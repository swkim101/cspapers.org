Self-assembled structures and machines can be made using origami-inspired manufacturing methods. In particular, self-folding of two-dimensional materials using shape memory polymers and embedded electrical circuits has been utilized to build robots and structures in an inexpensive and rapid manner. In order to build increasingly complex and functional self-folding machines, however, methods for interaction with the environment are necessary. This paper presents and characterizes three types of self-folding sensors: a mechanical switch, a capacitive contact sensor, and a velocity sensor. We utilize specialized fold patterns to create cyclic mechanical linkages as well as additional composite layers such as magnetic sheets to build these sensors. We demonstrate the integration of two of these sensors, the switch and the contact sensor, into a lamp that can self-fold and immediately begin responding to its surroundings.
