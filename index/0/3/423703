Presents a quality-of-security-service (QoSS) costing framework and a demonstration of it. A method for quantifying costs related to the security service and for storing and retrieving security information is illustrated. We describe a security model for tasks, which incorporates the ideas of variant security services invoked by the task, dynamic network modes, abstract security level choices and resource utilization costs. The estimated costs can be fed into a resource management system to facilitate the process of estimating efficient task schedules. Integration and scalability issues have been taken into account during the design of the QoSS costing demonstration, which we believe is suitable for incorporation into a resource management system research prototype.
