This paper presents an overview of a framework for the synthesis of high-level program descriptions from traces and example pairs in an automatic programming system. The framework is described in terms of a methodology and a rule base for generating control and data structure specifications for the program to be synthesized, in a format suitable for transformation into program code in a given target language.
