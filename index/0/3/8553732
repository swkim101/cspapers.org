Human Computer Systems (HCS) consist of machinery, software and people. However, all too many introductory software development courses concentrate unduly on the nature of programming and ignore the needs of the user. In this paper we will implicitly critique most existing introductory software development units, from an analysis of their supporting texts. We will suggest a checklist that could be applied to a unit or to a text to ensure that they include usability considerations. We will also critique many existing HCI units and courses that do not pay adequate attention to integrative exercises. We will conclude by suggesting ways in which these problems can start to be solved.
