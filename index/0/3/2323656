The small screen size of a smartwatch limits user experience when watching or interacting with media. We propose a supplementary tactile feedback system to enhance the user experience with a method unique to the smartwatch form factor. Our system has a deformable surface on the back of the watch face, allowing the visual scene on screen to extend into 2.5D physical space. This allows the user to watch and feel virtual objects, such as experiencing a ball bouncing against the wrist. We devised two controlled experiments to analyze the influence of tactile display resolution on the illusion of virtual object presence. Our first study revealed that on average, a taxel can render virtual objects between 70% and 138% of its own size without shattering the illusion. From the second study, we found visual and haptic feedback can be separated by 4.5mm to 16.2mm for the tested taxels. Based on the results, we developed a prototype (called RetroShape) with 4Ã—4 10mm taxels using micro servo motors, and demonstrated its unique capability through a set of tactile-enhanced games and videos. A preliminary user evaluation showed that participants welcome RetroShape as a useful addition to existing smartwatch output.
