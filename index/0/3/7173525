VibKeyboard could accurately determine the location of a keystroke on extended surface areas leveraging a single vibration sensor. Unlike capacitive sensing, it does not require conductive materials and compared to audio sensing it is more robust to acoustic noise. In VibKeyboard, the received vibration signals are determined by the location of the touch impact. This allows location discrimination of touches precise enough to enable emerging applications such as virtual keyboards on ubiquitous surfaces for mobile devices. VibKeyboard seeks to extract unique features in frequency domain embedded in the vibration signal attenuation and interference and perform fine grained localization. Our experimental results demonstrate that VibKeyboard could accurately recognize keystrokes from close-by keys on a nearby virtual keyboard.
