This paper presents a new architecture for image processing. It consists of a pipeline of identical programmable serial processing stages, referred to as a cytocomputer. Comparisons are made between cytocomputer and parallel array systems. Cytocomputer systems are shown generally to possess the advantages of lower complexity, high bandwidth and greater architectural flexibility. A first generation system is described and examples of processing are illustrated. Finally, current development efforts are described.
