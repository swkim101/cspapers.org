In this work we describe how a message board can be used to teach a number of important concepts in cyber security in a novel and hands-on manner. The message board is used daily in class and serves the routine functions of disseminating information to students, offering a forum for interactive discussions, allowing a convenient method to copy and paste complex expressions, providing a venue for class interaction, permitting archiving of information, and serving as a general blackboard. We use the message board to illustrate and teach important cyber-security concepts and common attacks such as the following: authentication and cookies, cross-site scripting and injection attacks, man-in-the-middle attack on public-key cryptography, password selection, and password-file management. From the student-learning perspective the tool appears to work very well. We hope that others can make use of the message board in their lessons or incorporate parts of it to improve the educational experience of their students. The message board can be integrated seamlessly into a class to enhance hands-on learning.
