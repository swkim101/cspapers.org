An <i>L</i>(2, 1)-labelling of a graph is a function <i>f</i> from the vertex set to the positive integers such that |<i>f(x) - f(y)</i>| ≥ 2 if dist<i>(x, y)</i> = 1 and |<i>f(x) - f(y)</i>| ≥ 1 if dist<i>(x, y)</i> = 2, where dist<i>(x, y)</i> is the distance between the two vertices <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> in the graph <i>G</i>. The <i>span</i> of an <i>L</i>(2, 1)-labelling <i>f</i> is the difference between the largest and the smallest labels used by <i>f</i> plus 1. In 1992, Griggs and Yeh conjectured that every graph with maximum degree Δ ≥ 2 has an <i>L</i>(2, 1)-labelling with span at most Δ<sup>2</sup> + 1. By settling this conjecture for Δ sufficiently large, we prove the existence of a constant <i>C</i> such that the span of any graph of maximum degree Δ is at most Δ <sup>2</sup> + <i>C</i>.
