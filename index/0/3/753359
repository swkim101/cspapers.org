We present a revenue optimization algorithm for posted-price auctions when facing a buyer with random valuations who seeks to optimize his γ-discounted surplus. In order to analyze this problem we introduce the notion of e-strategic buyer, a more natural notion of strategic behavior than what has been considered in the past. We improve upon the previous state-of-the-art and achieve an optimal regret bound in O(log T + 1/log(1/γ)) when the seller selects prices from a finite set and provide a regret bound in O(√T + T1/4/ log(1/γ)) when the prices offered are selected out of the interval [0,1].
