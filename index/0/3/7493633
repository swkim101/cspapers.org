We present a rule-based architecture (CIDA) for the provision of relevant information tailored to the user's current context, which consists of an ontology-based context model (ConAD) and a rule engine (RARE). ConAD is extensible to characterize the contextual situations in urban environments, and RARE supports the reconfiguration of the behavior of systems in different situations. Our preliminary evaluation results based on emergency scenarios show that CIDA is feasible for providing context-aware urban information services.
