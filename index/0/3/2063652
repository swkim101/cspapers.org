The aim of this paper is to develop animated agents that can control multimodal instruction dialogues by monitoring user's behaviors. First, this paper reports on our Wizard-of-Oz experiments, and then, using the collected corpus, proposes a probabilistic model of fine-grained timing dependencies among multimodal communication behaviors: speech, gestures, and mouse manipulations. A preliminary evaluation revealed that our model can predict a instructor's grounding judgment and a listener's successful mouse manipulation quite accurately, suggesting that the model is useful in estimating the user's understanding, and can be applied to determining the agent's next action.
