In this paper, we propose to treat different text segments differently and design a novel attentive interactive neural network (AI-NN) to focus on those text segments useful to answer selection. The representations of question and answer are first learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other neural network architectures. Then AI-NN learns interactions of each paired segments of two texts. Row-wise and column-wise pooling are used afterwards to collect the interactions. We adopt attention mechanism to measure the importance of each segment and combine the interactions to obtain fixed-length representations for question and answer. Experimental results on CQA dataset in SemEval-2016 demonstrate that AI-NN outperforms state-of-the-art method.
