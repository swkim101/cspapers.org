Estimating the approximate result size of a query before its execution based on small summary statistics is important for query optimization in database systems and for other facets of query processing. This also holds for queries over text databases. Research on selectivity estimation for such queries has focused on Boolean retrieval, i.e., a document may be relevant for the query or not. But with the coalescence of database and information retrieval (IR) technology, selectivity estimation for other, more sophisticated relevance functions is gaining importance as well. These models generate a query-specific distribution of the documents over the [0, 1]-interval. With document distributions, selectivity estimation means estimating how many documents are how similar to a given query. The problem is much more complex than selectivity estimation in the Boolean context: Beside document frequency, query results also depend on other characteristics such as term frequencies and document lengths. Selectivity estimation must take them into account as well. This paper proposes and evaluates a technique for estimating the result of retrieval queries with non-Boolean relevance functions. It estimates discretized document distributions over the range of the relevance function. Despite the complexity, compared to Boolean selectivity estimation, it requires little additional data, and the additional data can be stored in existing data structures with little extensions. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our technique.
