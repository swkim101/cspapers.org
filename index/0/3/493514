Mobile robotic teams require robust communication in order to coordinate effectively, which is a challenge given the dynamic, unpredictable nature of mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). These networks are subject to rapidly varying link qualities as robots move through their environment. Improving the robustness of these point-to-point links leads to greater overall network performance, which in turn allows the robots to perform their mission more effectively. In this work, we present a forward error correction (FEC) technique that exploits latency tolerance in network traffic to provide consistent packet delivery performance even on low-quality links. Our proposed system estimates link quality based on recent packet reception history and uses that estimate to determine FEC encoding strength. Furthermore, this system provides a novel Quality of Service (QoS) mechanism that trades latency tolerance for more reliable, lower overhead transmission. We evaluate the effectiveness of this technique in a real-world robotic testbed.
