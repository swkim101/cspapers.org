Comparing experimental results obtained on different wireless sensor network deployments is typically very cumbersome and in most cases unfeasible. This is due to the lack of a methodology to describe the properties of network deployments and the experimental conditions under which experiments have been run. Our work focuses on the design and development of a site properties assessment framework, called SiteWork, that aims at providing the means to quickly, automatically and accurately quantify their properties. This poster abstract describes the preliminary design and evaluation of the basic site properties assessment mechanisms provided by SiteWork.
