The size, heterogeneity and dynamicity of data within an enterprise makes indexing, integration and analysis of the data increasingly difficult tasks. On the other hand, there has been a massive increase in the amount of high-quality open data available on the Web that could provide invaluable insights to data analysts and business intelligence specialists within the enterprise. The goal of Helix project is to provide users within the enterprise with a platform that allows them to perform online analysis of almost any type and amount of internal data using the power of external knowledge bases available on the Web. Such a platform requires a novel, data-format agnostic indexing mechanism, and light-weight data linking techniques that could link semantically related records across internal and external data sources of various characteristics. We present the initial architecture of our system and discuss several research challenges involved in building such a system.
