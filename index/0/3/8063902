Triple stores implementing the RL profile of OWL 2 are becoming increasingly popular. In contrast to unrestricted OWL 2, the RL profile is known to enjoy favourable computational properties for query answering, and state-of-the-art RL reasoners such as OWLim and Oracle's native inference engine of Oracle Spatial and Graph have proved extremely successful in industry-scale applications. The expressive restrictions imposed by OWL 2 RL may, however, be problematical for some applications. In this paper, we propose novel techniques that allow us (in many cases) to compute exact query answers using an off-the-shelf RL reasoner, even when the ontology is outside the RL profile. Furthermore, in the cases where exact query answers cannot be computed, we can still compute both lower and upper bounds on the exact answers. These bounds allow us to estimate the degree of incompleteness of the RL reasoner on the given query, and to optimise the computation of exact answers using a fully-fledged OWL 2 reasoner. A preliminary evaluation using the RDF Semantic Graph feature in Oracle Database has shown very promising results with respect to both scalability and tightness of the bounds.
