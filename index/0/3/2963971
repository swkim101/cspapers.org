In automatic retargetable compilation low cost analytic cost estimation techniques are crucial in order to e ciently steer the optimization process Programming models aimed at optimum expressiveness of parallelism however are not amenable to static cost estimation We present a new co ordination model called SPC that imposes speci c restric tions in the synchronization structures that can be pro grammed Imposing these restrictions enables the e cient computation of reliable cost estimations paving the way for automatic optimization Regarding SPC s limited express iveness we present a conjecture stating that the loss of par allelism when programming in SPC is typically limited to a constant factor of compared to the unrestricted case This limited loss is outweighed by the unlocked potential of auto matic performance optimization as well as the portability that is achieved We demonstrate how SPC enables auto matic program optimizations through a compilation case study involving a line relaxation kernel on a distributed memory machine
