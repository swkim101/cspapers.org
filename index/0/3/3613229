Hypernymy identification aims at detecting if is A relationship holds between two words or phrases. Most previous methods are based on lexical patterns or the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis, and the accuracy of such methods is not ideal. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective supervision framework to identify hypernymy relations using distributed term representations (a.k.a term embeddings). First, we design a distance-margin neural network to learn term embeddings based on some pre-extracted hypernymy data. Then, we apply such embeddings as term features to identify positive hypernymy pairs through a supervision method. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other supervised methods on two popular datasets and the learned term embeddings has better quality than existing term distributed representations with respect to hypernymy identification.
