Data-driven refinement of non-terminal categories has been demonstrated to be a reliable technique for improving monolingual parsing with PCFGs. In this paper, we extend these techniques to learn latent refinements of single-category synchronous grammars, so as to improve translation performance. We compare two estimators for this latent-variable model: one based on EM and the other is a spectral algorithm based on the method of moments. We evaluate their performance on a Chineseâ€“English translation task. The results indicate that we can achieve significant gains over the baseline with both approaches, but in particular the momentsbased estimator is both faster and performs better than EM.
