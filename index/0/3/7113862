We construct the first general secure computation protocols that require no trusted infrastructure other than authenticated communication, and that satisfy a meaningful notion of security that is preserved under universal compositionâ€”{\em assuming only the existence of enhanced trapdoor permutations.} The notion of security fits within a generalization of the ``angel-based'' framework of Prabhakaran and Sahai (STOC'04) and implies super-polynomial time simulation security. Security notions of this kind are currently known to be realizable only under strong and specific hardness assumptions. A key element in our construction is a commitment scheme that satisfies a new and strong notion of security. The notion, security against chosen-commitment-attacks (CCA security), means that security holds even if the attacker has access to a {\em extraction oracle} that gives the adversary decommitment information to commitments of the adversary's choice. This notion is stronger than concurrent non-malleability and is of independent interest. We construct CCA-secure commitments based on standard one-way functions, and with no trusted set-up. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first construction of a natural cryptographic primitive requiring \emph{adaptive hardness} from standard hardness assumptions, using no trusted set-up or public keys.
