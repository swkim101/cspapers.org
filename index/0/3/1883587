s ince the publication of the initial FLASH paper in the proceedings of ISCA 1994, the underlying architecture and goals of the FLASH system and of the MAGIC chip have remained essentially as described: to design a multiprocessor node controller (MAGIC) based on a flexible, programmable protocol processor core while minimizing the protocol processing overhead caused by using a flexible, rather than a hardwired, protocol engine. Although this basic architectural goal remains, our perspective on the utility of flexibility has changed over the course of the design. In addition, as MAGIC and the other parts of the FLASH machine have moved from paper proposals to microarchitectural specifications to actual hardware as of this writing a FLASH system is operational we have developed some perspective on the trials and tribulations of building hardware in a university environment. The sections that follow describe the current project status, our new insights on the benefits of flexibility, and offer some comments on how to best approach hardware construction in a university.
