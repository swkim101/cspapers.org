The purpose of this panel is to discuss the possibility of integration of the appropriate mathematical topics in the CS1 and CS2 courses. Practically, every university/institute offering an undergraduate program in computer science offers one or two courses in discrete mathematics for CS majors. It seems desirable to introduce some of these topics (discrete mathematics) in the beginning courses along with the programming concepts - so that, a student can appreciate (and use) the theoretical concepts as meaningful to the field of programming.At many places, a course on discrete mathematics is taught in an isolated manner with little emphasis of its topics in the earlier courses in computer science. In fact, this course is viewed as a mathematics requirement along with the other mathematics courses, such as calculus, linear algebra, and statistics etc. Many topics introduced in a discrete mathematics can be best utilized with CS1 and CS2 courses. Some instructors may teach CS1 and CS2 courses without any regard to the topics of discrete mathematics as applicable to CS1 and CS2. A course on discrete mathematics designed with a specific relevance to CS majors, should be integrated from the very beginning at freshman level. Furthermore, a course on discrete mathematics is offered at sophomore/junior level when a student has already completed many CS courses including CS1 and CS2. The most realistic prerequisite to CS1 is college algebra and it is unlikely that a incoming freshman is ready to handle traditional topics of discrete mathematics without some mathematical maturity (may be after calculus?). The session will begin with a brief presentation from each of the panelists, and then we will open the floor for general discussion and dabate. A survey about such an integration will be conducted from the audience in this session.
