This paper presents a distributed world model that is able to adapt to changes in the Quality of Service (QoS) of the communication layer by online reconfiguration of perception algorithms. The approach consists of (a) a mechanism for storage, exchange and processing of world model data and (b) a feedback loop that incorporates reasoning techniques to adapt to QoS changes immediately. The latter introduces a Level of Detail (LoD) metric based on a spatial resolution in order to infer an upper bound for the amount of data that can be transmitted without violating an application specific transmission delay. Experiments have been performed with Octree-based subsampling techniques applied to data originating from a RGB-D camera using simulated and real-world data sets for timevarying bandwidth values as employed QoS measure.
