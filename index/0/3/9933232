This paper describes a tool for constructing the connectivity between hardware components given a stategraph that the components are to be mapped into. Examples taken from previous papers in the field are used to demonstrate this connectivity binder. The important results of this paper point to heuristics that are used to generate solutions to the problem. Questions addressed include: how much of the state-graph must be considered at one time to give reasonable results and how the search space can be pruned to achieve good solutions quicker. The code for this project is written in C and runs under 4.2 BSD UNIX.
