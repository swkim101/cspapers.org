We propose a novel representation of local image structure and a matching scheme that are insensitive to a wide range of appearance changes. The representation is a collection of local affine frames that are constructed on outer boundaries of maximally stable extremal regions (MSERS) in an affine-covariant way. Each local affine frame is described by a relative location of other local affine frames in its neighborhood. The image is thus represented by quantities that depend only on the location of the boundaries of MSERs. Inter-image correspondences between local affine frames are formed in constant time by geometric hashing. Direct detection of local afine frames removes the requirement of a point-based hashing to establish reference frames in a combinatorial way, which has in the case of affine transform complexily that is cubic in the number of points. Local affine frames, which are also the quantities represented in the hash table, occupy a 6 0 space and hence data collisions are less likely compared with 2 0 point hashing. Experimentally, the robustness of the method and its insensitiviq to photometric changes is demonstrated on images from different spectral bands of satellite sensor; on images of a transparent object and on images of an object taken during day and night.
