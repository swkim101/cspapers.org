An essential prerequisite to achieving interoperability in multidatabase systems is to be able to identify semantically equivalent or related data items in component databases. Another problem in multidatabase systems is allowing users to handle information from different databases that refer to the same realworld entity. In this paper, we provide semantic networks so that multidatabase systems can detect and resolve semantic heterogeneities among component databases. And we provide a semantic query language, SemQL, to capture the concepts about what users want. It enables users to issue queries to a large number of autonomous databases without prior knowledge of their schemas.
