In contrast to the failure of constraints, direct manipulation systems have been successful for geometric modeling tasks. Users control the geometry of objects by interactively grabbing and pulling them, with continuous update providing feedback. Such systems employ snapping techniques, such as grids, to aid in establishing relationships, but these relationships are immediately forgotten. They are neither explicitly represented nor automatically preserved. It is the userâ€™s job to maintain them during subsequent editing.
