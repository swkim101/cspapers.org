In this paper, we first define the characteristics of a heterogeneous DDBMS (section 1). Then we present the heterogeneous DDBMS we are implementing. This prototype relies on the SIRIUS-DELTA homogeneous DDBMS and two local DBMSs : MRDS (running on a very large computer) and PHLOX (a DBMS for micro-computers). The basis of the system is a pivot system concept (section 2). The description of the distributed database schema refers to a pivot model which is the relational model. A pivot language, called PETAL, has been designed for the transfer of queries. On each
