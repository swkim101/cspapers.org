Current web infrastructure is oriented on human-machine interactions. Developments for next generation systems (such as Web Services and ebXML) however aim to allow for automated interactions between arbitrary systems / services. This is achieved by supplying high-level descriptions of service capabilities and enabling information systems to dynamically discover and access each other. This paper takes into account 5 well-known behavioral description languages (PDDL, DAML-S, WSFL, ebXML and ConGolog), tries to propose an abstract representation behavior representation and gives a mapping between it and the existing formalisms.
