The clustering of topic-related web pages has been recognized as a foundational work in exploiting large sets of web pages such as the cases in search engines and web archive systems, which collect and preserve billions of web pages. However, this task faces great challenges both in efficiency and accuracy. In this paper we present a novel clustering algorithm for large scale topical web pages which achieves high efficiency together with considerately high accuracy. In our algorithm, a two-phase divide and conquer framework is developed to solve the efficiency problem, in which both link analysis and content analysis are utilized in mining the topical similarity between pages to achieve a high accuracy. A comprehensive experiment was conducted to evaluate our method in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of result.
