Principal components analysis~(PCA) is the optimal linear encoder of data. Sparse linear encoders (e.g., sparse PCA) produce more interpretable features that can promote better generalization. (\rn{1}) Given a level of sparsity, what is the best approximation to PCA? (\rn{2}) Are there efficient algorithms which can achieve this optimal combinatorial tradeoff? We answer both questions by providing the first polynomial-time algorithms to construct \emph{optimal} sparse linear auto-encoders; additionally, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on real data.
