The ARCOMEM project is about memory institutions like archives, museums and libraries in the age of the Social Web. Social media are becoming more and more pervasive in all areas of life. ARCOMEM's aim is to help to transform archives into collective memories that are more tightly integrated with their community of users and to exploit Web 2.0 and the wisdom of crowds to make Web archiving a more selective and meaning-based process. ARCOMEM (FP7-IST-270239) is an Integrating Project in the FP7 program of the European Commission, which involves twelve partners from academia, industry and public sector. The project will run from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013.
