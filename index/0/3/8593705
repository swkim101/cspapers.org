Five experiments were performed using several neural network architectures to identify the location of a wave in the time ordered graphical results from a medical test. Baseline results from the first experiment found correct identification of the target wave in 85% of cases (n=20). Other experiments investigated the effect of different architectures and preprocessing the raw data on the results. The methods used seem most appropriate for time oriented graphical data which has a clear starting point such as electrophoresis Or spectrometry rather than continuous tests such as ECGs and EEGs.
