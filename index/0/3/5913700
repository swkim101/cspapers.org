We found that fifth grade students' scores on Scratch programming quizzes in a summer enrichment course were highly correlated with their scores on a standardized test for mathematics. We identify ways in which the programming curriculum builds upon target skills from the Mathematics Content Standards for California Public Schools. We hypothesize that the programming curriculum leveraged and enriched students' mathematics content knowledge.
