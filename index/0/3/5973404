This paper presents a new updating algorithm to reduce the complexity of computing an observability index for kinematic calibration of robots. An active calibration algorithm is developed to include an updating algorithm in the pose selection process. Simulations on a 6-DOF PUMA robot with 27 unknown parameters shows that the proposed algorithm performs more than 50,000 times better than exhaustive search based on randomly generated designs.
