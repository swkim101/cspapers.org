Recent work on computation of functions defined by sets of recursive equations by Cadiou [Ca72], Vuillemin [Vu74] and Downey and Sethi [DS76] depends on semantic interpretations of such equations. A purely syntactic, combinatory approach yields similar results for a much wider class of sets of equations, including sets of defining equations for LISP, Lucid and the combinator calculus. The application to LISP proves several conjectures of Henderson and Morris [HM76].
