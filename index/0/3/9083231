In advanced IC manufacturing, as the gap between lithography optical wavelength and feature size increases, it becomes challenging to detect problematic layout patterns called lithography hotspot. In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy matching model which can dynamically tune appropriate fuzzy regions around known hotspots. Based on this model, we develop a fast algorithm for lithography hotspot detection with very low chances of false-alarm. Our results are very encouraging with under 0.56 CPU-hrs/mm2 runtime.
