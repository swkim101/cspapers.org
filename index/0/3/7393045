Student interest in computer-related careers has declined dramatically in recent years. One possible explanation for this decline is incorrect perceptions of the workstyle associated with the positions held by CIS graduates. A study of freshman business majors was conducted which: (1) examined whether an introductory computing course changed those perceptions, and (2) compared those perceptions to their own expected starting positions. The study showed that: (1) the introductory computing course had a negligible effect on changing student perceptions of the nature of the CIS graduate's initial job, and (2) compared to their perceptions of CIS jobs, they expected their own jobs to involve substantially more human interaction and less direct involvement in the implementation of computer technology. The results suggest a need for: (1) a more proactive strategy to market the MIS career both inside and outside the classroom, and (2) some creative approaches for the placement and content of programming activities in both the major and the career.
