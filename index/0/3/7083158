Ad exchange platforms connect online publishers and advertisers and facilitate the sale of billions of impressions every day. We study these environments from the perspective of a publisher who wants to find the profit-maximizing exchange in which to sell his inventory. Ideally, the publisher would run an auction among exchanges. However, this is not usually possible due to practical business considerations. Instead, the publisher must send each impression to only one of the exchanges, along with an asking price. We model the problem as a variation of the multi-armed bandits problem in which exchanges (arms) can behave strategically in order to maximizes their own profit. We propose e mechanisms that find the best exchange with sub-linear regret and have desirable incentive properties.
