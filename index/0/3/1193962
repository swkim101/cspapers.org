In this paper visual homing is combined with an appearance model to obtain a navigation method that does not require estimates of the pose. The robot's current view is used to select a target from a collection of panoramic images that forms the map. This requires selecting features to find correspondences and in this paper some feature selection methods are evaluated to see which one is best suited for navigation.
