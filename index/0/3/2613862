At the challenge of some good students, the Information Sciences Department at Taylor University decided to offer an overview course on computers and their legal implications for computer science majors and others interested in such a perspective. A two hour selected topic course was offered in the spring of 1980 to computer science majors, but open to any students who have taken at least one computer science course and had performed well in it.
 This paper reviews the content, successes and failures of this experimental course, with a view to assisting others who may wish to consider such an offering in the future.
