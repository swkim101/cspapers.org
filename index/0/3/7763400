We demonstrate a method for reconstructing the shape of a deformed surface from a single view. After decomposing an image into irradiance and albedo components, we combine normal cues from shading and texture to produce a field of unambiguous normals. Using these normals, we reconstruct the 3D geometry. Our method works in two regimes: either requiring the frontal appearance of the texture or building it automatically from a series of images of the deforming texture. We can recover geometry with errors below four percent of object size on arbitrary textures, and estimate specific geometric parameters using a custom texture even more accurately.
