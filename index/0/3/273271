The trend towards increasing the number of processor cores and cache capacity in future Chip-Multiprocessors (CMPs), will require scalable packet-switched interconnection networks adapted to the restrictions imposed by the CMP environment. This paper presents an innovative router design, which successfully addresses CMP cost/performance constraints. The router structure is based on two independent rings, which force packets to circulate either clockwise or anti-clockwise, traveling through every port of the router. It uses a completely decentralized scheduling scheme, which allows the design to: (1) take advantage of wide links, (2) reduce Head of Line blocking, (3) use adaptive routing, (4) be topology agnostic, (5) scale with network degree, and (6) have reasonable power consumption and implementation cost. A thorough comparative performance analysis against competitive conventional routers shows an advantage for our proposal of up to 50 % in terms of raw performance and nearly 60 % in terms of energy-delay product.
