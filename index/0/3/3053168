Abstract : The authors present a new distance-vector routing protocol for a packet radio network. The new distributed routing protocol, Wireless Routing Protocol (WRP), works on the notion of second-to-last hop node to a destination. WRP reduces the number of cases in which a temporary routing loop can occur and also provides a mechanism for the reliable transmission of update messages. The performance of WRP has been compared quantitatively by simulations with that of distributed Bellman-Ford (DBF), DUAL (a loop-free, distance-vector algorithm), and an ideal link-state algorithm (ILS) that represents the state of the art of Internet routing in a highly dynamic environment. The simulation results indicate that WRP is the most efficient of the algorithms simulated in a wireless environment.
