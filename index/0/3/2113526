We present an automatic method for analyzing sentiment dynamics between characters in plays. This literary format’s structured dialogue allows us to make assumptions about who is participating in a conversation. Once we have an idea of who a character is speaking to, the sentiment in his or her speech can be attributed accordingly, allowing us to generate lists of a character’s enemies and allies as well as pinpoint scenes critical to a character’s emotional development. Results of experiments on Shakespeare’s plays are presented along with discussion of how this work can be extended to unstructured texts (i.e. novels).
