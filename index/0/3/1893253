In semistructured databases there is no schema fixed in advance. To provide the benefits of a schema in such environments, we introduce DataGuides: concise and accurate structural summaries of semistructured databases. DataGuides serve as dynamic schemas, generated from the database; they are useful for browsing database structure, formulating queries, storing information such as statistics and sample values, and enabling query optimization. This paper presents the theoretical foundations of DataGuides along with an algorithm for their creation and an overview of incremental maintenance. We provide performance results based on our implementation of DataGuides in the Lore DBMS for semistructured data. We also describe the use of DataGuides in Lore, both in the user interface to enable structure browsing and query formulation, and as a means of guiding the query processor and optimizing query execution.
