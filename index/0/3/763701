A cooling system for an electron microscope specimen comprises a refrigerant container, a passage for introducing the refrigerant into a heat-exchanging position, a flow rate-adjusting valve mounted in an exhaust passage and a control unit. The flow rate of gas produced by evaporation is adjusted by a rate-adjusting valve. The control unit establishes either a maximum flow rate mode for rapid cooling or a minimum flow rate mode for observation of an image.
