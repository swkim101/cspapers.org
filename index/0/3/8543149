We introduce Hierarchical Procrustes Matching (HPM), a segment-based shape matching algorithm which avoids problems associated with purely global or local methods and performs well on benchmark shape retrieval tests. The simplicity of the shape representation leads to a powerful matching algorithm which incorporates intuitive ideas about the perceptual nature of shape while being computationally efficient. This includes the ability to match similar parts even when they occur at different scales or positions. While comparison of multiscale shape representations is typically based on specific features, HPM avoids the need to extract such features. The hierarchical structure of the algorithm captures the appealing notion that matching should proceed in a global to local direction.
