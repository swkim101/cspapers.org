The all-important goal of delivering better software at lower cost has led to a vital, enduring quest for ways to find and remove defects efficiently and accurately. To this end, two parallel lines of research have emerged over the last years. Static analysis seeks to find defects using algorithms that process well-defined semantic abstractions of code. Statistical defect prediction uses historical data to estimate parameters of statistical formulae modeling the phenomena thought to govern defect occurrence and predict where defects are likely to occur. These two approaches have emerged from distinct intellectual traditions and have largely evolved independently, in “splendid isolation”. In this paper, we evaluate these two (largely) disparate approaches on a similar footing. We use historical defect data to apprise the two approaches, compare them, and seek synergies. We find that under some accounting principles, they provide comparable benefits; we also find that in some settings, the performance of certain static bug-finders can be enhanced using information provided by statistical defect prediction.
