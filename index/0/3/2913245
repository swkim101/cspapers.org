fast computers with large memories have lessened the demand for program efficiency, but applications such as browsing and searching very large databases often have rate- limiting constraints and therefore benefit greatly from improvements in efficiency. This paper empirically evaluates several variants of a common k-dimensional tree technique to demonstrate how different algorithm options influence search cost for nearest neighbors.
