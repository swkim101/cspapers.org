Diagnosing faults in the Internet is arduous and time-consuming, in part because the network is composed of diverse components spread across many administrative domains. We consider an extreme form of this problem: can end users, with no special privileges, identify and pinpoint faults inside the network that degrade the performance of their applications? To answer this question, we present both an architecture for user-level Internet path diagnosis and a practical tool to diagnose paths in the current Internet. Our architecture requires only a small amount of network support, yet it is nearly as complete as analyzing a packet trace collected at all routers along the path. Our tool, tulip, diagnoses reordering, loss and significant queuing events by leveraging well deployed but little exploited router features that approximate our architecture. Tulip can locate points of reordering and loss to within three hops and queuing to within four hops on most paths that we measured. This granularity is comparable to that of a hypothetical network tomography tool that uses 65 diverse hosts to localize faults on a given path. We conclude by proposing several simple changes to the Internet to further improve its diagnostic capabilities.
