Using partial interfaces, i.e. interfaces that cover only a subset of the total set of published methods of a class, has several advantages, among them being an increase in understandability of the code and extended substitutability of classes in frameworks. However, analysis of large frameworks such as the Java API suggests that partial interfaces are only sparsely used. We believe that this is partly due to the fact that introducing and maintaining partial interfaces is perceived as tedious by programmers [5]. Therefore, we have created a metrics suite and tool support to assist the developer in using partial interfaces.
