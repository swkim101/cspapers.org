A real-time scheduling algorithm for Asynchronous Time Sharing based switching nodes is presented. Three classes of traffic sources are considered to load the swit thing nodes: real-time video sources with guaranteed maximum end-to-end delay S1 for all cells; realtime voice sources with guaranteed end-to-end delay SII, c% cell loss rate and average gap length q; and data traffic with guaranteed minimum average throughput and maximum average time delay. The proposed algorithm is compared with other known algorithms in terms of complexity in implementation, knowledge structures and performance. Our investigations are supported throughout by simulation results.
