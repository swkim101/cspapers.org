Given a set of surface normals, we pose a Manhattan Frame (MF) estimation problem as a consensus set maximization that maximizes the number of inliers over the rotation search space. We solve this problem through a branchand-bound framework, which mathematically guarantees a globally optimal solution. However, the computational time of conventional branch-and-bound algorithms are intractable for real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a novel bound computation method within an efficient measurement domain for MF estimation, i.e., the extended Gaussian image (EGI). By relaxing the original problem, we can compute the bounds in real-time, while preserving global optimality. Furthermore, we quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the performance of the proposed method for synthetic and real-world data. We also show the versatility of our approach through two applications: extension to multiple MF estimation and video stabilization.
