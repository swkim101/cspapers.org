The paper deals with the determination of optimal force-closure grasps for 2D polygonal objects. The problem is analyzed and some intrinsic properties of grasps are determined. The approach is applied to the determination of the position of a fourth finger given the positions of three other fingers. Moreover, the range of solutions that allow the force-closure property as well as the optimal value are analytically determined, checking only four points in the worst case. The algorithm has been implemented and numerical examples are included in the paper.
