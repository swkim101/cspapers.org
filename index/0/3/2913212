The master and slave surgical assistant systems have been studied actively. However, regarding the master system, the manipulator should be designed for each surgical field because the target workspace and precision are different. Furthermore, operability is important for safety reasons. Therefore, the authors analyzed the motion of surgeon first and then developed a master manipulator suitable for the operation of micro neuro surgery. Some experiments were conducted to evaluate the control method and show the effectiveness of the proposed manipulator control method.
