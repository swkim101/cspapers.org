Designated confirmer signature is an important cryptographic primitive, it is widely used in E-commerce. In this paper, we propose a new designated confirmer signature scheme which is transformed from a new signature scheme. The proposed scheme has very simple construction and is much more efficient than the previous ones and does not need any commitment scheme or strong witness hiding proofs.
