We describe a new self-learning framework for parser lexicalisation that requires only a plain-text corpus of in-domain text. The method first creates augmented versions of dependency graphs by applying a series of modifications designed to directly capture higherorder lexical path dependencies. Scores are assigned to each edge in the graph using statistics from an automatically parsed background corpus. As bilexical dependencies are sparse, a novel directed distributional word similarity measure is used to smooth edge score estimates. Edge scores are then combined into graph scores and used for reranking the topn analyses found by the unlexicalised parser. The approach achieves significant improvements on WSJ and biomedical text over the unlexicalised baseline parser, which is originally trained on a subset of the Brown corpus.
