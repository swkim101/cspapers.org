The success of science and technical education in our nation is of paramount importance. Colleges and universities have a responsibility to develop and maintain quality undergraduate programs that attract, retain and provide job placement for students in the areas of science and technology. However, in these lean budget years, support and retention of associate degree programs in the computing sciences is diminishing. This panel will present/discuss successful associate degree programs in the computing sciences. These programs have high, success rates in attracting and retaining students, in entry-level job placement for graduates and in articulating smoothly into four year degree programs in computer science, engineering, telecommunications and/or information systems.
