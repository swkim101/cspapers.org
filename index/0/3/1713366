The accident probability of beginner drivers is significantly higher than that of experienced drivers. It can be assumed that this is due to lack of driving skills which lead to making wrong decisions according to cognition and operating in correct way. In this paper, we propose a novel assisted driving system intended to help drivers to improve their skills for the reverse parking. The system is able to assist the driver by haptic instruction on the steering wheel in order to induce the driver to make the adequate operation. For the validation, we developed a 1/10 scale car simulator as a simulation environment on which we installed the proposed assistance method and conducted reverse parking experiment by using the simulator. According to the experiment, we validated that the parking accuracy and the trajectory similarity of subjects assisted by proposed system significantly increased compare to subjects unassisted. Consequently, the proposed assisted driving system could accelerate the learning of humans' driving skills.
