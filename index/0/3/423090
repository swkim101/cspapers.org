Consider a game where a refereed chooses (x,y) according to a publiclyknown distribution PXY, sends x to Alice, and y to Bob. Withoutcommunicating with each other, Alice responds with a value "a" and Bobresponds with a value "b". Alice and Bob jointly win if a publiclyknown predicate Q(x,y,a,b) holds. Let such a game be given and assume that the maximum probabilitythat Alice and Bob can win is v<1. Raz (SIAM J. Comput. 27, 1998)shows that if the game is repeated n times in parallel, then the probability that Alice and Bob win all games simultaneously is at most v'(n/log(s)), where s is the maximal number of possible responses from Alice and Bob in the initial game, and v' is a constant depending only on v. In this work, we simplify Raz's proof in various ways and thus shorten it significantly. Further we study the case where Alice and Bob are not restricted to local computations and can use any strategy which does not imply communication among them.
