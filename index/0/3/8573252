The use of aggressive resolution enhancement techniques like multiple patterning and inverse lithography (ILT) has led to expensive photomasks. Growing mask write time has been a key reason for the cost increase. Moreover, due to scaling, e-beam proximity effects can no longer be ignored. Model-based mask fracturing has emerged as a useful technique to address these critical challenges by allowing overlapping shots and compensating for proximity effects during fracturing itself. However, it has been shown recently that heuristics for model-based mask fracturing can be suboptimal by more than 1.6Ã— on average for ten real ILT shapes, highlighting the need for better heuristics. In this work, we propose a new model-based mask fracturing method that significantly outperforms all the previously reported heuristics. The number of e-beam shots of our method is 23% less than a state-of-the-art prototype version of capability within a commercial EDA tool for e-beam mask shot decomposition (PROTO-EDA) for ten ILT mask shapes. Moreover, our method has an average runtime of less than 1.4s per shape.
