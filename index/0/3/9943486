We present a boolean technique to reduce power consumption of combinational circuits that have already been optimized for area and delay and then mapped onto a library of gates. In order to achieve a better optimization, we cluster gates by collapsing two or more levels of gates into a single node. When optimizing each cluster, our method extends the algorithms used in ESPRESSO, by adding heuristics that bias the minimization toward lowering the power dissipation in the circuit. The results of our method, on a number of benchmark circuits, show an average of 11% improvement in power savings compared to existing boolean techniques.
