The main goal of this panel is to share survey data being collected on booming enrollments in computer science. Survey data are being collected from two source types: institutions and students. The institution data are being collected through both the CRA Taulbee Survey, which represents computer science departments in North America with doctoral degrees, and the ACM NDC Survey, which represents computer science departments at U.S. 4-year and master's universities and colleges. The student data are being collected via the Data Buddies Project, run by the CRA's Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline. The institution data will allow us to answer questions such as "what 'boom' are institutions seeing and how are different types of institutions responding to this boom?" The student data will allow us to answer questions such as "why are students suddenly eager for our classes?". The survey data will help us understand (1) the intensity of the "boom" at different types of institutions, (2) how institutions are responding to the increasing demand for computing education, and (3) whether the current enrollment "boom" represents the "third bubble" or whether it is here to stay. The data will also allow us to ask questions that attempt to understand the impact of the boom on underrepresented students. Data collection is ongoing; we will present results "hot off the presses".
