As part of an on-going project to understand the foundations of Knowledge Representation, we are attempting to characterize a kind of belief that forms a more appropriate basis for Knowledge Representation systems than that captured by the usual possible-world formalizations begun by Hintikka. In this paper, we point out deficiencies in current semantic treatments of knowledge and belief (including recent syntactic approaches) and suggest a new analysis in the form of a logic that avoids these shortcomings and is also more viable computationally.
