Although it has been evidenced that DNA computing is able to solve the graph coloring problem in a polynomial time complexity, but the exponential solution space is still a restrictive factor in applying this technique for solving really large problems. In this paper a modified DNA computing approach based on Adleman-Lipton model is proposed which tackles the mentioned restriction by coloring the vertices one by one. In each step, it expands the DNA strands encoding promising solutions and discards those which encode infeasible ones. A sample graph is colored by simulating the proposed approach and shows a notable reduction in the number of DNA strands used.
