The constraints of sensor networks, an emerging area of network research, require new approaches in system design. We study the evolution of abstractions and techniques in TinyOS, a popular sensor network operating system. Examining CVS repositories of several research institutions that use TinyOS, we trace three areas of development: single-hop networking, multi-hop networking, and network services. We note common techniques and draw conclusions on the emerging abstractions as well as the novel constraints that have shaped them.
