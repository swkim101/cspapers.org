We propose more scalable encodings of temporal planning in SMT. The first contribution is practical clock-based encodings of resources and effect delays. Existing encodings of effect delays (Shin and Davis, 2015) have a quadratic size, due to the necessity to determine the time differences between steps for a linear number of steps. Clocks improve this to linear. The second contribution is a new relaxed scheme for steps. Existing schemes require a step for every time point with discontinuous change. This is relaxed, improving scalability.
