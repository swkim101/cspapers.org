The interconnect or network on chip (NoC) is an increasingly important component in processors. As systems scale up in size and functionality, the ability to efficiently model larger and more complex NoCs becomes increasingly important to the design and evaluation of such systems. Recent work proposed the "SynFull" methodology that performs statistical analysis of a workload's NoC traffic to create compact traffic generators based on Markov models. While the models generate synthetic traffic, the traffic is statistically similar to the original trace and can be used for fast NoC simulation. However, the original SynFull work only evaluated multi-core CPU scenarios with a very simple cache coherence protocol (MESI). We find the original SynFull methodology to be insufficient when modeling the NoC of a more complex system on a chip (SoC). We identify and analyze the shortcomings of SynFull in the context of a SoC consisting of a heterogeneous architecture (CPU and GPU), a more complex cache hierarchy including support for full coherence between CPU, GPU, and shared caches, and heterogeneous workloads. We introduce new techniques to address these shortcomings. Furthermore, the original SynFull methodology can only model a NoC with N nodes when the original application analysis is performed on an identically-sized N-node system, but one typically wants to model larger future systems. Therefore, we introduce new techniques to enable SynFull-like analysis to be extrapolated to model such larger systems. Finally, we present a novel synthetic memory reference model to replace SynFull's fixed latency model; this allows more realistic evaluation of the memory subsystem and its interaction with the NoC. The result is a robust NoC simulation methodology that works for large, heterogeneous SoC architectures.
