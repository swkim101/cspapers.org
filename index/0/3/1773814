The use of real world problems as the basis for assignments in Computer Science courses is attractive for many reasons. At the same time it is difficult to find such a problem that offers the same richness that is found, for example, in sorting or searching. In this paper a problem is presented that has many real-world instances and which is pedagogically attractive at all levels of Computer Science from the level of a non-major's course to that of an advanced algorithms course.
