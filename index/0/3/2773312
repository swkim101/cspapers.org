A general game player is a system that understands the rules of an unknown game and learns to play this game well without human intervention. To succeed in this endeavor, systems need to be able to extract and prove game-specific knowledge from the mere game rules. We present a practical approach to this challenge with the help of Answer Set Programming. The key idea is to reduce the automated theorem proving task to a simple proof of an induction step and its base case. We prove correctness of this method and report on experiments with an off-the-shelf Answer Set Programming system in combination with a successful general game player.
