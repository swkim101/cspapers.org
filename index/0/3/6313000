We propose the direct production of 3D CSG models from sketches as a way of relieving the user from having to input detailed 3D CAD models. This shortens the CAD/CAM process and simplifies it, allowing non-expert end-users to produce their own designs. Early detection of features in the 2D sketch is a critical step. This paper discusses a general strategy for solving this problem, and then describes our approach for detecting steps and pockets in a 2D line-drawing obtained after vectorising the sketch captured by an input device
