With respect to classical visual servoing (VS) technics based on geometrical features, the main drawback of direct visual servoing is its limited convergence area. In this paper we propose a new direct visual servoing control law that relies on a particle filter to achieve non-local and non-linear optimization in order to increase this convergence area. Thanks to multi-view geometry and image transfer techniques, a set of particles (which correspond to potential camera velocities) are drawn and evaluated in order to evaluate the best camera trajectory. This new control law is validated on a 6 DOF positioning task performed on a real gantry robot and statistical comparisons are also provided from simulation results.
