In this poster we present a graph-based hierarchical subchannel allocation scheme for V2V sidelink communications in Mode-3. Under this scheme, the eNodeB allocates subchannels for in-coverage vehicles. Then, vehicles will broadcast directly without the eNodeB intervening in the process. Therefore, in each communications cluster, it will become crucial to prevent allocation conflicts in time domain since vehicles will not be able to transmit and receive simultaneously. We present a solution where the time-domain requirement can be enforced through vertex aggregation. Additionally, allocation of subchannels is performed sequentially from the most to the least allocation-constrained cluster. We show through simulations that the proposed approach attains near-optimality.
