This poster presents preliminary investigation of the content and quality of on-line peer mentoring in competitive problem solving. Discussion board postings from the Queue-ICPC Challenge were analyzed with respect to content, including type of communication, topic, intended audience and accuracy, as well as attempts at relationship building. Responses outnumbered questions more than 2 to 1, suggesting that even in a competition, people are willing to assist others. Interestingly, some of the most successful competitors were also the most willing to offer help to others. As part of a voluntary competition, this kind of peer mentoring is useful resource for attracting and supporting new participants. In the academic context, peer mentoring may be an essential aspect of learner support for large, traditional classes. In very large scale efforts such as MOOCs, it may provide a scalable resource for helping participants to succeed and remain engaged.
