The OpenVXI is a portable open source based toolkit that interprets the VoiceXML dialog markup language. It is designed to serve as a framework for system integrators and platform vendors who want to incorporate VoiceXML into their platform. A first version of the toolkit was released in the winter of 2001, with a second version released in September of 2001. A number of companies and individuals have adopted the toolkit for their platforms. In this paper we discuss the architecture of the toolkit, the architectural issues involved with implementing a framework for VoiceXML, performance results with the OpenVXI, and future directions for the toolkit.
