Symbolic layout and compaction is reaching a mature status. This is demonstrated, in part, by the recent or imminent introductions of a number of commercial symbolic layout and compaction systems. The two most frequently used symbolic layout compaction approaches, constraint graph compaction and virtual grid compaction, are reviewed in this paper. The current status of these two approaches is presented by looking at the results of the ICCD87 compaction benchmark session.
