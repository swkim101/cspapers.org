This paper describes an approach that can introduce some of the concepts of software engineering to general business, engineering, and science students in an introductory FORTRAN programming course. The approach integrates the notions of top-down design, stepwise refinement, structured flowcharting, test case description, and analysis in the context of a methodology for systematically developing and documenting programs. Qualitative results from teaching these concepts are presented.
