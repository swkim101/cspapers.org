The demand for second generation expert systems will soon bring forward the demand for tools to build them. ZDEST-2 is built to test the authors' ideas on what characteristics such tools should have and how to reflect them consistently within a system. New concepts such as three-level control scheme and 3-D explanation are introduced; multiple representation methods and inference engines are offered and integrated. The most distinguished characteristics of ZDEST-2 are: (1) It is a general tool suitable for building various domain oriented expert systems(ESs). (2) The ESs built by it can fullyreflect the nature of applicated domains. (3) Well-developed environment is provided for the building and using of ESs. (4) A user friendly interface is emphasized, explanations can be tailored to the elaboration needed, and, external procedure accesses are allowed. This paper gives a quite detailed description about how ZDEST-2 gains such characteristics.
