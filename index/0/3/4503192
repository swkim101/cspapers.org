This paper develops a novel tree-based algorithm, called Bonsai, for efficient prediction on IoT devices - such as those based on the Arduino Uno board having an 8 bit ATmega328P microcontroller operating at 16 MHz with no native floating point support, 2 KB RAM and 32 KB read-only flash. Bonsai maintains prediction accuracy while minimizing model size and prediction costs by: (a) developing a tree model which learns a single, shallow, sparse tree with powerful nodes; (b) sparsely projecting all data into a low-dimensional space in which the tree is learnt; and (c) jointly learning all tree and projection parameters. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Bonsai can make predictions in milliseconds even on slow microcontrollers, can fit in KB of memory, has lower battery consumption than all other algorithms while achieving prediction accuracies that can be as much as 30% higher than state-of-the-art methods for resource-efficient machine learning. Bonsai is also shown to generalize to other resource constrained settings beyond IoT by generating significantly better search results as compared to Bing's L3 ranker when the model size is restricted to 300 bytes. Bonsai's code can be downloaded from (BonsaiCode).
