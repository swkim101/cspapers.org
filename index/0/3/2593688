In December of 1972, a study effort was undertaken at TRA to determine if it was feasible to create a computer based system that would significantly improve the generation, usage and dissemination of geometric information in an engineering, design and manufacturing environment. The effort was divided into several phases: study, system design and economic evaluation and, finally, implementation.
 The system which has been implemented is a highly interactive keystroke driven system which executes under the TSO (Time Sharing Option) provided on IBM computers. The specific functional capabilities provided by the system appear to the end user as an extension of the time sharing system command language.
