This paper proposes an adaptive framework for single shot motion planning, i.e., planning without preprocessing. This framework can be used in any situation, and in particular, is suitable for crowded environments in which the robot's free C-space has narrow corridors such as maintainability studies in complex 3D CAD models. Our iterative strategy adaptively selects a planner whose strengths match the current situation, and then, online, switches to a different planner when circumstances change. This requires techniques to evaluate the characteristics of the current query, and a set of planners which are characterized so that we can match the query with the best planner for it. Our experimental results in complex 3D CAD environments show that our strategy solves queries that none of the planners could solve on their own.
