Time is an important dimension of any information space and can be very useful in information retrieval and in particular clustering and exploration of search results. Search result clustering is a feature integrated in some of today's search engines, allowing users to further explore search results. However, only little work has been done on exploiting temporal information embedded in documents for the presentation, clustering, and exploration of search results along well-defined timelines. In this paper, we present an add-on to traditional information retrieval applications in which we exploit various temporal information associated with documents to present and cluster documents along timelines. Temporal information expressed in the form of, e.g., date and time tokens or temporal references, appear in documents as part of the textual context or metadata. Using temporal entity extraction techniques, we show how temporal expressions are made explicit and used in the construction of multiple-granularity timelines. We discuss how hit-list based search results can be clustered according to temporal aspects, anchored in the constructed timelines, and how time-based document clusters can be used to explore search results that include temporal snippets. We also outline a prototypical implementation and evaluation that demonstrates the feasibility and functionality of our framework.
