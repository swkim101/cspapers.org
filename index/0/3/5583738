In our research we investigate rational agent which consciously balances deliberation and acting, and uses learning to augment its reasoning. It creates several partial plans, uses past experience to choose the best one and, by executing it, gams new Knowledge about the world. We analyse a possible application of Inductive Logic Programming to learn how to evaluate partial plans in a resource-constrained way. We also discuss how ILP framework can generalise partial plans.
