Controlled light conditions improve considerably the performance of most computer vision algorithms. Dynamic light conditions create varying spatial changes in color and intensity across the scene. These condition, caused by a moving shadow for example, force developers to create algorithms which are robust to such variations. We suggest a computational camera which produces images that are not influenced by environmental variations in light conditions. The key insight is that many years ago, similar difficulties were already solved in radio communication, As a result each channel is immune to interference from other radio channels. Amplitude Modulated (AM) video camera separates the influence of a modulated light from other unknown light sources in the scene, Causing the AM video camera frame to appear the same - independent of the light conditions in which it was taken. We built a prototype of the AM video camera by using off the shelf hardware and tested it. AM video camera was used to demonstrate color constancy, shadow removal and contrast enhancement in real time. We show theoretically and empirically that: 1. the proposed system can produce images with similar noise levels as a standard camera. 2. The images created by such camera are almost completely immune to temporal, spatial and spectral changes in the background light.
