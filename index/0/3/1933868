A critical problem in the implementation of distributed databases is that of update "synchronization." This paper presents a distributed algorithm for update control whereby the update initiating node acts as a semi- centralized manager for that update. A timestamp is not required to be stored with each of the data items for this algorithm to work. An analysis of the performance of the algorithm, along with a comparison with the majority consensus algorithm, is also included.
