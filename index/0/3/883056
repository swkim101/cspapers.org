While cloud storage services offer manifold benefits such as cost-effectiveness or elasticity, there also exist various security and privacy concerns. Among such concerns, we pay our primary attention to data residency -- a notion that requires outsourced data to be retrievable in its entirety from local drives of a storage server in-question. We formulate such notion under a security model called Proofs of Data Residency (PoDR). can be employed to check whether the data are replicated across different storage servers, or combined with storage server geolocation to "locate" the data in the cloud. We make key observations that the data residency checking protocol should exclude all server-side computation and that each challenge should ask for no more than a single atomic fetching operation. We illustrate challenges and subtleties in protocol design by showing potential attacks to naive constructions. Next, we present a secure PoDR scheme structured as a timed challenge-response protocol. Two implementation variants of the proposed solution, namely NVeri and EVeri, describe an interesting use-case of trusted computing, in particular the use of Intel SGX, in cryptographic timed challenge-response protocols whereby having the verifier co-locating with the prover offers security enhancement. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to exhibit potential attacks to insecure constructions and validate the performance as well as the security of our solution.
