This paper introduces new approaches to the conceptual design of electro-mechanical systems from qualitative specifications of behaviour and function. The power of these methods stems from the integration of techniques in qualitative physics, symbolic mathematics, computational geometry and constraint programming. This is illustrated with an effective kinematic synthesis method that integrates reasoning with configuration spaces and constraint-programming techniques.
