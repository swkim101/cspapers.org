We demonstrate an information credibility analysis system called WISDOM. The purpose of WISDOM is to evaluate the credibility of information available on the Web from multiple viewpoints. WISDOM considers the following to be the source of information credibility: information contents, information senders, and information appearances. We aim at analyzing and organizing these measures on the basis of semantics-oriented natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
