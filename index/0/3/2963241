In this paper an extension of the resolution principle to uncertain clauses is proposed. Uncertainly is here estimated in terms of necessity measures introduced in the framework of possibility theory. A refutation method using a linear strategy is presented. It makes use of an ordered search method (with a non-additive evaluation function) in order to produce an optimal refutation, which enables us to obtain the greatest possible lower bound for the necessity measure attached to the clause to prove. An illustrative example is given. Further extensions of the proposed approach, especially to cope with inconsistent sets of clauses, are mentioned.
