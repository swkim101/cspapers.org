In this paper we examine the semantics and develop constructs for temporal data independent of any traditional data model, such as the relational or network data models. Unlike many other works which extend existing models to support temporal data, our purpose is to characterize the properties of temporal data and operators over them without being influenced by traditional models which were not specifically designed to model temporal data. We develop data constructs that represent sequences of temporal values, identify their semantic properties, and define operations over these structures.
