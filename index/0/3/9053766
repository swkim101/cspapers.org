This paper describes a set of author developed interactive web exercises and a development environment designed to facilitate language acquisition in a beginning course in C++. The exercises test the students' understanding of several C++ language constructs as well as general programming concepts such as scope of variables. The environment allows students to write and test sections of code in a instructor controlled setting. Together the exercises and environment can be used to enhance computer science education for both traditional and distance learning students. The paradigm of generalization and automation of standard exercises can be extended to facilitate web education in other courses.
