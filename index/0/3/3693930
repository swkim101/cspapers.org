Research shows that active learning can increase student performance and engagement, but access to materials is a notable barrier to using research-based instruction strategies in CS and Engineering. We present results of a project-in-progress that aims to create, pilot, revise, and disseminate POGIL activities for Computer Organization and Architecture. POGIL is a research-based instruction strategy that comprises self-managed teams, guided inquiry (or, exploration), and development of process skills, such as critical thinking and assessment. The strategy has been shown to improve student performance and engagement in courses in scientific disciplines and, more recently, CS. This poster presents how we have applied the methodology for POGIL activities to Computer Organization and Architecture and highlights one activity in depth. From 2 pilots with 36 and 70 students we produced revisions and timings for 6 activities. We also discuss lessons learned in a) facilitation, such as the importance of roles and the tradeoffs of class-level synchrony and b) authorship, such as the appropriate choice of model (or, subject of inquiry) and level of guidance in the exploration phase of an activity. The intended outcome of this project is to make these activities publicly available on cspogil.org.
