Software Engineering (SE) is an important topic to be taught in Computer Science courses. However, teaching of theoretical concepts with no link to their practical applications or no examples in the student's context may discourage learning, justifying why teaching and learning are great challenges of education in universities. In attempt to bridge such gap, several approaches have been proposed and applied to improve teaching and learning SE such as project based learning (PBL), a well-known approach already applied to teach SE. Nevertheless, there's a lack of understanding about how to better apply PBL and how to take advantage of this approach, for future use. There is also a lack of experience report describing how to use, its challenges and difficulties, what could be hampering to widely adopt it. We present our experience applying a PBL approach combined with project management to create an environment considering aspects such as dealing with managers and real stakeholders. The goal is to bring students closer to the reality of developing a software project in the business context. Our experience indicates positive results on the adoption of a PBL approach. In general, students were enthusiastic and positive about the use of this approach, the presence of a manager and the importance of using real-world problems with real stakeholders.
