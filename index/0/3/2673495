Abstractâ€”Event-triggered real-time systems interact with theenvironment by executing actions in response to monitoredevents. Such systems may be implemented using event conditionaction (ECA) rules, which execute an action if the associatedevent occurs and a specified condition is true. However, the ECArule paradigm is known to be hard to analyze with respect tocorrectness and timeliness, which is not conducive to the highpredictability requirements typically associated with real-timesystems. To still take advantage of the ECA rule paradigm whenevent-triggered real-time systems are developed, we propose anapproach where systems are specified and analyzed in a high-levelformal language (timed automata) and later transformed into theECA rule paradigm. We especially focus on a high-level approachfor specifying and analyzing composite event occurrences in timedautomata
