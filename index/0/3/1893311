The CotsBots are inexpensive and modular mobile robots built entirely from commercial off-the-shelf components. These robots provide a convenient platform on which to investigate algorithms, cooperation, and distributed sensing in large (> 50) robot networks. Each robot is small (13 cm /spl times/ 6.5 cm base) and costs under $200. Each is equipped with on-board processing, radio communication, and a base platform for mobility. Software is written using TinyOS, an open-source, event-driven operating system for large-scale distributed sensor and actuator networks. TinyOS also provides a modular software environment where implementation details many be abstracted away from the robot application developer. A simple robot diffusion algorithm has been outlined to demonstrate the ease of using CotsBots for large-scale systems.
