We present SR-ORAM1, the first single-round-trip polylogarithmic time Oblivious RAM that requires only logarithmic client storage. Taking only a single round trip to perform a query, SR-ORAM has an online communication / computation cost of O(log n log log n), and an offline, overall amortized per-query communication cost of O(log2 n log log n), requiring under 2 round trips. The client folds an entire interactive sequence of Oblivious RAM requests into a single query object that the server can unlock incrementally, to satisfy a query without learning its result. This results in an Oblivious RAM secure against an actively malicious adversary, with unprecedented speeds in accessing large data sets over high-latency links. We show this to be the most efficient storage-free-client Oblivious RAM to date for today's Internet-scale network latencies.
