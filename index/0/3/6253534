One of the most promising approaches to building high speed networks and distributed multiprocessors is the use of optical interconnections. The basic component of such a system is a switch (interconnection network) that has a capacity of interconnecting a large number of inputs to outputs. In this paper we present an analysis of an N1 x N2 asynchronous crossbar switch model for all-optical circuit-switching networks that incorporates multi-rate arrival traffic with varied arrival distributions. We compare the model behavior using traffic loads derived from the Binomial, Pascal, and Poisson statistical distributions. We give efficient algorithms to compute the performance measures. We analyze the effect of load changes from particular traffic distribution streams on system performance and give a simple “economic” interpretation.
