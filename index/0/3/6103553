We present CoCoTest, a tool for automated testing of continuous controllers at the Model-in-the-Loop stage. CoCoTest combines explorative and exploitative search algorithms to identify scenarios in the controller input space that violate or are likely to violate the controller requirements. This enables a scalable and systematic way to test continuous properties of such controllers. Our experiments show that CoCoTest identifies critical flaws in the controller design that are rarely found by manual testing and go unnoticed until late stages of embedded software system development.
