Different from traditional SVMs, IKSVM essentially is a non-convex optimization problem. Some algorithms directly change the spectrum of the indefinite kernel matrix at the cost of losing some valuable information involved in the kernels so as to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one. Other algorithms aim to solve the dual form of IKSVM, but suffer from the dual gap between the primal and dual problems in the case of indefinite kernels. In this paper, we directly focus on the non-convex primal form of IKSVM and propose a novel algorithm termed as IKSVM-DC. According to the characteristics of the spectrum for the indefinite kernel matrix, IKSVM-DC decomposes the objective function into the subtraction of two convex functions and thus reformulates the primal problem as a difference of convex functions (DC) programming which can be optimized by the DC algorithm (DCA). In order to accelerate convergence rate, IKSVM-DC further combines the classical DCA with a line search step along the descent direction at each iteration. A theoretical analysis is then presented to validate that IKSVM-DC can converge to a local minimum. Systematical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of IKSVM-DC compared to state-of-the-art IKSVM related algorithms.
