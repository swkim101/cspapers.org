We present a consistency and recovery control scheme for replicated files. The purpose of a replicated file is to improve the availability of a logical file in the presence of site failures and network partitions. The accessible physical copies of a replicated file will be mutually consistent and behave like a single copy as far as the user can tell. Our recovery scheme requires no manual intervention. The scheme tolerates any number of site failures and network partitions as well as repairs.
