A new architecture-implementation mapping approach, 1.x-way mapping, is presented to address architecture-implementation conformance. It targets maintaining conformance of structure and behavior, providing a solution to architecture changes, and protecting architecture-prescribed code from being manually changed. Technologies developed in this work include deep separation of generated and non-generated code, an architecture change model, architecture-based code regeneration, and architecture change notification.
