In this paper, we present an algorithm that constructs sparse evaluation graphs for forward or backward monotone data flow problems. The sparse graph combines information as early as possible, yet directly connects nodes that generate and use information. This allows problems from the large, general class of monotone data flow problems to err joy the advantages of solutions based on Static Single Assignment (SSA) form.
