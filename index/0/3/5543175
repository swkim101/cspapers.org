We describe Emuli - a method of replacing sensor data with a network-wide model of stimuli events. Sensor readings are generated on demand from the modeling data stored at each device. This approach allows for both repeatable and variable experimentation with a network of physical devices for existing and planned sensing modalities. We illustrate the approach with (i) a light sensor and (ii) a hypothetical range sensor used in a tracking application.
