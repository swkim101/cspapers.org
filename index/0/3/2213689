We describe a model of visual word recognition that accounts for several aspects of the temporal processing of sequences of briefly presented words. The model utilizes a new representation for written words, based on dynamic time warping and multidimensional scaling. The visual input passes through cascaded perceptual, comparison, and detection stages. We describe how these dynamical processes can account for several aspects of word recognition, including repetition priming and repetition blindness.
