In this paper, we consider the application of the singular value decomposition (SVD) to a search term suggestion system in a pay-for-performance search market. We propose a positive and negative refinement method based on orthogonal subspace projections. We demonstrate that SVD subspace-based methods: 1) expand coverage by reordering the results, and 2) enhance the clustered structure of the data. The numerical experiments reported in this paper were performed on Overture's pay-per-performance search market data.
