This paper addresses the motion planning problem in the presence of obstacles for underactuated robots that are assigned a geometric task. It is assumed that the robot is subject to kinematic (joint limits, joint velocity bounds) as well as dynamic (torque bounds) constraints. Building on our previous work on task-constrained motion planning, we describe a randomized planner that works directly at the torque level and generates solutions by separating geometric motions from time history. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by planning collision-free swing-up maneuvers for a Pendubot system.
