Conventional toolkits today require the programmer to attach call-back procedures to most buttons, scroll bars, menu items, and other widgets in the interface. These procedures are called by the system when the user operates the widget in order to notify the application of the userâ€™s actions. Unfortunately, real interfaces contain hundreds or thousands of widgets, and therefore many call-back procedures, most of which perform trivial tasks, resulting in a maintenance nightmare. This paper describes a system that allows the majority of these procedures to be eliminated. The user interface designer can specify by demonstration many of the desired actions and connections among the widgets, so call-backs are only needed for the most significant application actions. In addition, the callbacks that remain are completely insulated from the widgets, so that the application code is better separated from the user interface.
