An ad-hoc network is the cooperative engagement of a collection of (typically wireless) mobile nodes without the required intervention of any centralized access point or existing infrastructure. To provide optimal communication ability, a routing protocol for such a dynamic self-starting network must be capable of unicast, broadcast, and multicast. In this paper we extend Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), an algorithm for the operation of such ad-hoc networks, to offer novel multicast capabilities which follow naturally from the way AODV establishes unicast routes. AODV builds multicast trees as needed (i.e., on-demand) to connect multicast group members. Control of the multicast tree is distributed so that there is no single point of failure. AODV provides loop-free routes for both unicast and multicast, even while repairing broken links. We include an evaluation methodology and simulation results to validate the correct and efficient operation of the AODV algorithm.
