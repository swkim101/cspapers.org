Trust plays a crucial role in helping users collect reliable information in an online world, and has attracted more and more attention in research communities lately. As a conceptual counterpart of trust, distrust can be as important as trust. However, distrust is rarely studied in social media because distrust information is usually unavailable. The value of distrust has been widely recognized in social sciences and recent work shows that distrust can benefit various online applications in social media. In this work, we investigate whether we can obtain distrust information via learning when it is not directly available, and propose to study a novel problem - predicting distrust using pervasively available interaction data in an online world. In particular, we analyze interaction data, provide a principled way to mathematically incorporate interaction data in a novel framework dTrust to predict distrust information. Experimental results using real-world data show that distrust information is predictable with interaction data by the proposed framework dTrust. Further experiments are conducted to gain a deep understand on which factors contribute to the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
