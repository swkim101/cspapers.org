Most vehicles today inter-connect their electronic (sensing) components using wired communications such as CAN, Diognistic-CAN, or LIN. However, despite its simple design in connecting various automotive components, the cost and weight of installing wired connectors can increase quickly with the increasing number of electronic control units (ECUs) a vehicle supports. This work looks into the option of enabling wireless communications for intra-vehicle services, especially for less safety-critical applications. We present a wireless communication hardware platform that is used to design a vehicle's body controller / gateway device, which interconnects ECUs of heterogenous communication mediums (e.g., CAN, LIN, etc.). We show using this demo, in which we present prototype implementations, that the latency and packet delivery performance of wireless links can be suitable for supporting various vehicular applications that relate less towards passenger safety.
