Now a day, grid computing is considered as one of the emerging technology in which jobs are distributed across the network or Internet. Among the several software toolkits those help us to implement a grid environment, Alchemi is widely used and open source toolkit that runs on the Windows operating system in the .NET Framework. The node which requests an application to be performed is called owner. The node that receives the requested application and sends result back to the owner is called manager. An application is divided into many threads and theses threads are then submitted to other nodes called executor. The executors execute the thread(s) which is assigned to them and return the result to the Manager after successful completion of execution. During the execution, if any thread fails to complete, then the task is rescheduled to other executor from its initial state. But if we can save the last execution point as well as the results and transfer that information to the manager, we can complete the same job in less time. Based on this principle, in this paper, we have proposed file based grid thread implementation technique that stores the results of a thread during its execution. In case of any failure, the thread restarts from its last saved value rather than starting from its initial point.
