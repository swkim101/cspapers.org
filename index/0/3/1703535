We predict discourse segment boundaries from linguistic features of utterances, using a corpus of spoken narratives as data. We present two methods for developing segmentation algorithms from training data: hand tuning and machine learning. When multiple types of features are used, results approach human performance on an independent test set (both methods), and using cross-validation (machine learning).
