In this paper we argue that gender difference thinking, with regards to attitudes towards computing, can work against diversity in the field of computing. Indeed, gender difference approaches to the participation of women in computing have not provided adequate explanations for women's declining interest in computer science (CS) and related technical fields. As yet "The Changing Face of Computing" has not led to significant changes in the levels of women's participation. Indeed, the number of computer science degrees awarded to women has steadily declined since 1984. Our objective in this paper is to present a critique on why gender difference approaches may be problematic and propose that a cultural approach offers a more effective framework for investigating and increasing women's participation in CS. We support our findings and recommendations from the most recent research in a series of studies carried out at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) over the past 10 years. In brief, we found the Women-CS fit at CMU continues to present a positive and encouraging story. Our findings demonstrate that under certain conditions women, alongside their male peers, can fit successfully into a CS environment and help shape that environment and computing culture, for the benefit of everyone, without accommodating presumed gender differences or any compromises to academic integrity.
