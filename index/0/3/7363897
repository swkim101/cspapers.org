Software engineering problems often involve large sets of objects and complex relationships among them. This report proposes that graphical visualization techniques can help engineers undersland and solve a class of these problems. To illustrate this, two problems are analyzed and recast using the graphical language GraphLog. The first problem is that of simplifying dependencies among components of a system, which translates into removing cycles from a graph. The second problem is that of designing an efficient code overlay structure, which is facilitated in several ways through graphical techniques.
