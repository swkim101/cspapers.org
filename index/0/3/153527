We describe an approach to the problem of managing resources in routine decision-making tasks. The central feature of this approach is the use of reusable RAP-like plans to generate decisions. This allows our system, APEX, to take advantage of the flexibility in scheduling and method selection provided by execution mechanisms and thereby minimize or circumvent resource conflicts. We then discuss an application of APEX for simulating a human air traffic controller in order to aid in the evaluation of radar display designs.
