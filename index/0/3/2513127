We present a noise sensitivity analysis of the differential optimal structure from motion problem. Given optical flow measurements for a set of feature points, we formulate a least squares cost function based on a more reasonable additive isotropic model of measurement noise, normalized by depth, that also leads to statistically consistent estimates of the shape and motion parameters. A cyclic coordinate descent algorithm is developed, and its performance examined through experiments.
