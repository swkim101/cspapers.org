The problem of data base access via different data models has been investigated for the network model and the relational model. The network model is based on the Codasyl proposal (l), which has been modified in two major respects: only one member record type is allowed per set type, and one data item of each record type is assumed to serve as primary key. For a given network model of the data base a coexistent relational model is proposed. The proposal is based on an extension of the usual relational model (2) by an incorporation of appropriate network parameters. First an equivalent set of relations is defined for a given network. The following translation process is along the lines of (4). For each record type a relation is introduced so that domains correspond to data items and tuples correspond to record occurrences. Thus for each set type the associated member record type and owner record type are translated into the set's member relation and owner relation, respectively. Such a set type is used to specify a partial function from member record occurrences to owner record occurrences. It is further used to specify a relative order among the member occurrences of each individual set occurrence. Conceptually such a set can be translated into a ternary relation which has one triple for each tuple of the member relation. Its primary key domain identifies the associated tuple in the member relation, its second domain identifies a tuple in the owner relation (the owning tuple) , and its third domain specifies the ordering. Furthermore these ternary relations are incorporated tuple by tuple into the corresponding member relations, which then contain for each associated set one OWNER IDENTIFICATION. DOMAIN and one RELATIVE ORDER DOMAIN. By this equivalence the same contents of information is guaranteed for both data models. The relational user can choose any of the usual relational languages (such as ALPHA, SQUARE, or SEQUEL > to formulate his queries.
