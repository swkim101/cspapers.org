Electrotactile stimulation has been used to provide sensory information of forearm prosthesis to users. Although conventional sensory feedback method, where one electrode expresses sensory information of only one finger, could provide force information of three fingers by using three electrodes, it showed less cognitive accuracy when more than two electrodes were stimulated simultaneously compared to individual stimulation. To improve the cognitive accuracy, we presented a sensory feedback method called two-channel electrotactile stimulation for the thumb, index and middle fingers using only two electrodes. The force information of the index and middle fingers was delivered into two electrodes, respectively, by intermittent stimulation. The information of the thumb was delivered to the user by inserting additional offset pulses onto the channel of the index finger based on an assumption that the force of thumb is proportional to the sum of the forces of the index and middle fingers. The presence of offset pulses in the channel indicates the binary state of thumb if it contacts with an object or not. We conducted two psychophysical experiments where healthy subjects classified the binary states of each finger and identified intensity from two-channel stimuli. The cognitive accuracies for intensity identification were 78.8% and 62.2% for the intermittent stimulation and conventional method, respectively, and accuracy for classifying the fingers was 93.1% for every combination of the three fingers. The results demonstrated that the proposed two-channel electrotactile stimulation could be an attractive method to express the information of fingers of prosthesis with high accuracy.
