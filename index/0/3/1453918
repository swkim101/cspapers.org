A prototype dialog system is presented which specializes in responding to the questions of a user who is assumed to be attempting to form an evaluation of a given object. On the basis of explicit assumptions concerning the evaluator's standards and prior expectations, the system goes beyond the direct answering of the questions by selecting additional comments according to their anticipated impact on the evaluator's impressions of the object. The system may be positively or negatively biased in its selection of comments; taking into account the (possibly different) bias which it assumes the evaluator to ascribe to it, it anticipates how the fact that it has failed to make certain comments is likely to be interpreted. The system's central concepts are also used to quantify the notion of the relatedness of a given comment to a given topic and to guide the selection of connectives and sentential adverbs.
