Many modern applications are faced with the task of knowledge discovery in entity-relationship graphs, such as domain-specific knowledge bases or social networks. Mining an "informative" subgraph that can explain the relations between k(>= 2) given entities of interest is a frequent knowledge discovery scenario on such graphs. We present MING, a principled method for extracting an informative subgraph for given query nodes. MING builds on a new notion of informativeness of nodes. This is used in a random-walk-with-restarts process to compute the informativeness of entire subgraphs.
