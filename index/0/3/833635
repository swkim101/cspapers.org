In this paper we present four results on the inference of evolutionary trees from ordinal information. An evolutionary tree T, or phylogeny, is an ordinal representation of a distance matrix , for all species a, b, c and d under consideration. In particular, we show that (1) Ordinal representations of distance matrices can be found in O(n{sup 2}log{sup 2} n) time where n is the number of species. Ordinal representations are shown to be unique, when they exist. (3) Determining if there is an ordinal representation for an incomplete distance matrix, a situation which arises in evolutionary studies, is NP-complete. (3) Finding a phylogeny that best fits a distance matrix containing ordinal errors is NP-complete. (4) Under reasonable conditions, a weighted ordinal representation of a distance matrix can be obtained in polynomial time.
