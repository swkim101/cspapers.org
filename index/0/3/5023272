The directed topology tree data structure is developed for maintaining binary trees dynamically. Each of a certain set of tree operations is shown to takeO(logn) time, wherenis the number of vertices in the trees. The directed topology trees are used to implement link?cut trees and dynamic expression trees. The results of experimental comparisons with the dynamic trees of Sleator and Tarjan are presented.
