Unfamiliar, large-scale virtual environments are difficult tonavigate. This paper presents design guidelines to ease navigationin such virtual environments. The guidelines presented here focuson the design and placement of landmarks in virtual environments.Moreover, the guidelines are based primarily on the extensiveempirical literature on navigation in the real world. A rationalefor this approach is provided by the similarities betweennavigational behavior in real and virtual environments.
