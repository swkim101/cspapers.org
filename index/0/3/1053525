One potential technology to provide high speed data rate and reliable transmission for modern networks is multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which are equipped multiple antennas at both the transmitters and receivers. The main purpose of this paper is to present our own design and implementation of MIMO Space-time block coding (STBC) systems with various number of transmit and receive antennas. They are implemented on FPGA Altera Stratix DSP Development KIT using Verilog HDL. BER performance of the systems with the different number of transmit and receive antennas is measured and compared in term of hardware and software simulation.
