In this paper, the concept and first results of a novel toolbox for nanoscale characterization are presented. A nanorobotic AFM system is being developed and integrated into a high resolution SEM/FIB system allowing nanoanalysis, -manipulation and -structuring. The compact and modular AFM setup enables probe- as well as sample-scanning and uses self-sensing AFM cantilevers. Image fusion algorithms are developed to merge SEM and AFM information for hybrid analysis of nanoscale objects. A commercial AFM controller is embedded into a special control system architecture that allows for automation of nanomanipulation sequences.
