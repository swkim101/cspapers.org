Multifaceted search is a commonly used interaction paradigm in e-commerce applications, such as Web shops. Because of the large amount of possible product attributes, Web shops usually make use of static information to determine which facets should be displayed. Unfortunately, this approach does not take into account the user query, leading to a non-optimal facet drill down process. In this paper, we focus on automatic facet selection, with the goal of minimizing the number of steps needed to find the desired product. We propose several algorithms for facet selection, which we evaluate against the state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. We implement our approach in a Web application called faccy.net. The evaluation is based on simulations employing 1000 queries, 980 products, 487 facets, and three drill down strategies. As evaluation metrics we use the average number of clicks, the average utility, and the top-10 promotion percentage. The results show that the Probabilistic Entropy algorithm significantly outperforms the other considered algorithms.
