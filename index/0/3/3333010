Testing is an important process that is performed to support quality assurance. Testing activities support quality assurance by gathering information about the nature of the software being studied. These activities consist of designing test cases, executing the software with those test cases, and examining the results produced by those executions. Studies indicate that more than fty percent of the cost of software development is devoted to testing, with the percentage for testing critical software being even higher. As software becomes more pervasive and is used more often to perform critical tasks, it will be required to be of higher quality. Unless we can nd ecient ways to perform eective testing, the percentage of development costs devoted to testing will increase signicantly. This report briefly assesses the state of the art in software testing, outlines some future directions in software testing, and gives some pointers to software testing resources.
