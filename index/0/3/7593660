VFER is a portable, user-space tool for high-performance data transport. VFER enables the use of advanced congestion control without kernel modifications. Two modes of use are supported: stand-alone file transfer tool and use as a library for multimedia and other complex applications that currently use simple UDP and can benefit from congestion control. The stand-alone file transfer tool uses normal SSH credentials users already have. VFER uses advanced TCP-friendly congestion control that, by taking delay into account, quickly recovers from non-congestive packet loss.
