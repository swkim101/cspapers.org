The Ensemble computing portal originated under the NSF NSDL program and enjoys the respect and continued interest of the computing education community. The project has reached a maturity level at which it is time to focus on the long-term viability of the activity. The original proposal included a commitment from the Villanova University library to adopt the system and keep in running in perpetuity. However, merely keeping the system running will not preserve nor extend the true promise of the project. That requires an active, engaged community. The leaders of the Ensemble project invite our partner projects and the SIGCSE community to join us in an initial meeting of an organization devoted to the continued development and support of the Ensemble vision: that of a community of educators sharing their best efforts, showcasing the best resources, and archiving materials that deserve long term preservation.
