The national importance of creating "content reflecting cutting edge developments in STEM fields" has been recognized the National Science Foundation. The National Research Council has also noted that creating engaging laboratory and classroom experiences is a challenge to effective undergraduate education in STEM disciplines. In this paper we present our endeavors to address these issues in the field of computer networks. We discuss our experiences with novel laboratory and classroom projects using OPNET and Wireshark software products in undergraduate networking courses. These laboratories help undergraduate students understand fundamental networking concepts through modeling and simulation of computing systems. We have found that their use enhances student learning and interest in the subject of computer networks.
