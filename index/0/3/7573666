Recently, tools for browsing XML Schema documents have become popular, but they cannot support advanced browsing functionalities. We have implemented a new graphical schema browser which provides traversals not only along a composition hierarchy but also along a type hierarchy defined in the documents. In this demonstration, we show how users can quickly and easily understand the semantic structures by freely navigating to any datatypes or elements located at any position in the hierarchies.
