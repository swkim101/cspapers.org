The introductory computer science at Stanford University have a combined annual enrollment of over 1000 students. Teaching introductory programming to a population of this size requires significant instructional support to ensure that students receive the individual attention most beginning programmers need. This paper describes the approach that has evolved at Stanford for the introductory computer science courses, which is based on the extensive use of advanced undergraduates to teach sections of the introductory course. In our experience, using undergraduates as part of the teaching staff has created an effective learning environment for both the students in the classes and the undergraduate section leaders themselves.
