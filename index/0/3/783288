In 1999, most computer science students participate in at least one group project in some class prior to graduation. However, assessing individual student contributions to a group project is a difficult task faced by instructors of these classes. In this paper, we have compiled a wide range of assessment instruments, and identified situations where they can be effective. This paper is a compilation of potential evaluation strategies. No comparison is made among the many strategies nor are particular techniques ranked above or below others. The goal is simply to provide a wide range of potential team evaluation techniques. Since each technique evaluates a particular characteristic and different team project courses have different goals it is up to the instructor to choose the techniques that best evaluate the individual in light of the course goals.
