This paper addresses the problem of motion planning for free-flying robots. Full state actuation is considered to allow for large displacements of the spacecraft. Motion planning is formulated as an optimization problem and kinematic as well as dynamic constraints are considered. The chosen optimization criteria are spacecraft actuation and final time. The proposed method allows solutions which do not require any spacecraft actuation for those end goals for which the robot motion is sufficient.
