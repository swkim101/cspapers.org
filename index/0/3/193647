An ideal retrieval system should retrieve images that satisfy the user's need, and should, therefore, measure image similarity in a manner consistent with human's perception. However, existing computational similarity measures are not perceptually consistent. This paper proposes an approach of improving retrieval performance by improving the perceptual consistency of computational similarity measures for textures based on relevance feedback judgments.
