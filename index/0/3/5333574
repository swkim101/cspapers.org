The paper summarizes a system that understands, solves, and learns how to solve geometry problems. The system is represented homogeneously as production rules of Labelled Production System. A brief introduction to the system architecture is given, followed by an example of how the system works. Then the paper discusses briefly some theoretical problems focused upon in design and implementation of the system.
