To give appropriate translation equivalents for target words is one of the most fundamental problems in machine translation systems.Especially, when the MT systems handle languages that have completely different structures like Japanese and European languages as source and target languages. In this report, we discuss about the data structure that enables appropriate selections of translation equivalents for verbs in the target language. This structure is based on the concepts structure with associated information relating source and target languages.Discussion have been made from the standpoint of realizability of the structure (e.g. from the standpoint of easiness of data collection and arrangement, easiness of realization and compactness of the size of storage space).
