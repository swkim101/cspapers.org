Wikis may be on track to take the academic world by storm. Though researchers have used them as collaborative tools for more than a decade, it is only in the past year or two that they have become widespread in education. Of the articles published by SIGCSE on wikis, nearly two-thirds (30 out of 46) of them gave appeared since the beginning of 2006. References to wikis in the educational database ERIC are approximately doubling each year. What is it about wikis that has suddenly made them so attractive? Among other things, it is the fact that collaboration becomes so easy. Students have the opportunity to revise each other’s work without the need to send documents back and forth. Because an edit history is kept, it is easy to see how much work each student has done—and to verify that it has not been downloaded from a third-party source on the eve of the due date. Wikis have been used for a wide variety of assignments, from discussion boards to writing a textbook from student contributions. This panel will present several collaborativelearning exercises that have been carried out with wikis, and give advice to instructors who want to use wikis in their classes.
