We have fabricated a test chip in 2 micron CMOS that can perform supervised learning in a manner similar to the Boltzmann machine. Patterns can be presented to it at 100,000 per second. The chip learns to solve the XOR problem in a few milliseconds. We also have demonstrated the capability to do unsupervised competitive learning with it. The functions of the chip components are examined and the performance is assessed.
