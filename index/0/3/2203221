In this paper, we address an issue on non-existence of a CAD model of an object in a model-based virtual visual servoing system. The approach for reconstructing a 3D model with fewer faces from point cloud data is presented. Because of a number of faces on the model surface, this reconstructed model required less rendering time than a CAD model, consequently, high speed and high accuracy model-based visual servoing can be achieved. We present the experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness in terms of rendering time, convergence speed, and tracking speed measurements. The comparison of performances of a model-based visual servoing using different models, i.e.- CAD, Coarse mesh, Fine mesh, and Propose models, is also presented.
