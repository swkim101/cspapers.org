A decision algorithm is given for the quantifier-free theory of recursively defined data structures which, for a conjunction of length n, decides its satisfiability in time linear in n. The first-order theory of recursively defined data structures, in particular the first-order theory of LISP list structure (the theory of CONS, CAR, CDR), is shown to be decidable but not elementary recursive.
