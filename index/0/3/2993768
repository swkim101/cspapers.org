In this paper we identify the need for a new theory of information. An information model is developed which distinguishes between data, as directly observable facts, information, as structured collections of data, and knowledge as methods of using information. The model is intended to support a wide range of information systems. In the paper we develop the use of the model for a semantic information retrieval system using the concept of semantic categories. The likely benefits of this area discussed, though as yet no detailed evaluation has been conducted.
