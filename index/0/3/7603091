This paper describes the approach taken at the State University of New York at Oswego to develop a new undergraduate program in software engineering. The existing undergraduate degree in computer science offered at SUNY Oswego already emphasizes ‘systems” issues related to software engineering. Mod situdenttt take a variety of systems courses such as compiler construction, operating systems, net working, and parallel/distributed systems. However, there were compelling reasons for widening and strengthening this historical, informal focus into an undergraduate program in software engineering, In recent years, there has been a great deal of discussion about the wisdom of pre vidlng undergraduate programs in software engineering. First, there is a lack of agreement about what constitutes a reasonable program in software engineering. Second, many software practitioners believe that professional maturity is gained only after some experience both in life and in a career. This maturity cannot be amumed of or expected from the typical traditional undergraduate student. Moreover, undergraduate students
