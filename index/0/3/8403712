IVR (interactive voice response) menu navigation has long been recognized as a frustrating interaction experience. We propose an IM-based system that sends a coordinated visual IVR menu to the caller's computer screen. The visual menu is updated in real time in response to the caller's actions. With this automatically opened supplementary channel, callers can take advantages of different modalities over different devices and interact with the IVR system with the ease of graphical menu selection. Our approach of utilizing existing network infrastructure to pinpoint the caller's virtual location and coordinating multiple devices and multiple channels based on users' ID registration can also be more generally applied to create integrated user experiences across a group of devices.
