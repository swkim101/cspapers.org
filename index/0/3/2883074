This Tutorial+Workshop will discuss opportunities and challenges involved in using neuro-physiological tools/techniques (such as fMRI, fNIRS, EEG, eye-tracking, GSR, HR, and facial expressions) and theories in information retrieval. The hybrid format will engage researchers and students at different levels of expertise, from those who are active in this area to those who are interested and want to learn more. The workshop will combine presentations, discussions and tutorial elements and consist of four segments (tutorial, completed research, work-in-progress, closing panel).
