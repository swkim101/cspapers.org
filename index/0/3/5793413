In this paper we present methods for improving the disambiguation of noun phrase (NP) coordination within the framework of a lexicalised history-based parsing model. As well as reducing noise in the data, we look at modelling two main sources of information for disambiguation: symmetry in conjunct structure, and the dependency between conjunct lexical heads. Our changes to the baseline model result in an increase in NP coordination dependency f-score from 69.9% to 73.8%, which represents a relative reduction in f-score error of 13%.
