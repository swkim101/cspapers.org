Plausible inference is an essential aspect of logic-based information disclosure. This paper proposes a context-sensitive plausible inference mechanism based on a so-called index expression belief network. Plausible inference is cloaked as probabilistic evidence propagation within this network. Preliminary experiments show general evidence propagation algorithms to be too inefficient for real-life information disclosure applications. The paper sketches two optimizations whereby efficient, special-purpose evidence propagation may be realized.
