The work of Mannila et al. [4] of finding frequent episodes in sequences is extended to finding temporal logic patterns in temporal databases. It is argued that temporal logic provides an appropriate formalism for expressing temporal patterns defined over categorical data. It is also proposed to use Temporal Logic Programming as a mechanism for the discovery of frequent patterns expressible in temporal logic. It is explained in the paper how frequent temporal patterns can be discovered by constructing temporal logic programs.
