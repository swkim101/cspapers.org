This paper presents a method for predicting slip using Gaussian process regression. Slip models are learned for visually classified terrain types as a function of terrain geometry. Spatial correlations between terrain properties are leveraged for on-line slip model adaptation. Results show that regression-based modeling using in-situ rover data outperforms the state-of-practice, terrestrially-calibrated slip curves in both mean prediction and uncertainty bounds. Local adaptation improves slip prediction results, particularly in high-slip sand areas that pose the greatest threat to rovers. Slip estimates made using a visual classifier to identify terrain type are compared to estimates using on-line model selection with only proprioceptive slip measurements as inputs. The proprioceptive results nearly match the visual results, showing that this approach could work even when a visual classifier is not available.
