Methods are introduced to decide the solvability of transformation problems. Such methods may be applied to save some of the problem solving effort. Supposition for applying the stated methods is that information about the structure of the problem space is available for detecting separated subsets of the situation set. Solvability of transformation problems is decided by means of systems of separated subsets of situations. For a class of problem spaces the detection of separated subsets of situations and the decision of solvability of problems are investigated in more detail.
