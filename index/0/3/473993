This work presents tSEARCH, a web-based application that provides mechanisms for doing complex searches over a collection of translation cases evaluated with a large set of diverse measures. tSEARCH uses the evaluation results obtained with the ASIYA toolkit for MT evaluation and it is connected to its on-line GUI, which makes possible a graphical visualization and interactive access to the evaluation results. The search engine offers a flexible query language allowing to find translation examples matching a combination of numerical and structural features associated to the calculation of the quality metrics. Its database design permits a fast response time for all queries supported on realistic-size test beds. In summary, tSEARCH, used with ASIYA, offers developers of MT systems and evaluation metrics a powerful tool for helping translation and error analysis.
