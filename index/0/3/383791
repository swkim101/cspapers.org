We consider the integration of a domain decomposition technique with a new quadratic spline collocation discretization scheme for solving second order elliptic boundary value problems on rectangles. The domain decomposition method is based on the capacitance matrix technique. Due to the limitations of existing methods for solving the corresponding capacitance problem, we develop and analyze iterative methods for its solution. The optimum partitioning and mapping of the underlying computation is studied on hypercube architectures. A numerical realization of this method is presented on NCUBE/7 (128 processors) and its comparative efficiency is measured. The resulting parallel quadratic spline collocation-capacitance method is seen to be efficient in achieving accurate solutions and in using parallel architectures.
