Local communication and sensing between individuals are frequently used for control in multi-robot systems. However, in current flying multi-robot systems, such as swarms of quadrotors, these abilities are often only emulated using global communication and global position sensing. This is mainly due to the complexity, cost, weight, or power requirements for such sensors. Here we present a system that can allow for more natural swarming behaviors by enabling direct bearing and elevation sensing, as well as communication between nearby rotor-craft. This system takes advantage of the existing motion of the vehicles propellers, is low power, and can be adapted to existing vehicles with only simple modifications. We describe the system, present a working prototype, show performance of this prototype, and conclude by describing future work integrating the system into a rotor-craft swarm.
