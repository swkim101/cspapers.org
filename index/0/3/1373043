Compliance in robot mounted force/torque sensors is useful for soft mating of parts. However it generates nearly undamped oscillations when moving the end-effector in free space. In this paper, input shaping control is investigated to damp such unwanted flexible modes. We present a new design technique that creates long impulse sequences to adapt input shaping to systems with long sampling period and to compensate the resulting time delay. This makes the method feasible for industrial robots. In addition to the conventional input shaping which causes oscillations to stop only after applying the last impulse, we also minimize the quadratic control error until this time step is reached.
