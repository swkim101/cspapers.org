In software product line engineering, core assets are shared among multiple products. Core assets and products generally evolve independently. Developers need to capture evolution in both contexts and to propagate changes in both directions between the core assets and the products. We propose a version control system to support product line engineering by supporting the evolution of product line, product derivation, and change propagation from core assets to products and vice versa.
