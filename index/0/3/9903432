Inclusive education is the practice of making sure that all students of all abilities have positive learning experiences. The study presented in this paper explores the current state of inclusive practices in computing education by presenting four case studies of students with disabilities taking their first computing courses. Their experiences share many common themes that reveal insights into their college experiences and connect with current theories as to how to achieve inclusive education. New technologies, such as podcasting, for promoting inclusion are also suggested.
