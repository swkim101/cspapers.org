Many real-world data are naturally represented as tensors, or multi-dimensional arrays. Tensor decomposition is an important tool to analyze tensors for various applications such as latent concept discovery, trend analysis, clustering, and anomaly detection. However, existing tools for tensor analysis do not scale well for billion-scale tensors or offer limited functionalities. In this paper, we propose BIGtensor, a large-scale tensor mining library that tackles both of the above problems. Carefully designed for scalability, BIGtensor decomposes at least 100Ã— larger tensors than the current state of the art. Furthermore, BIGtensor provides a variety of distributed tensor operations and tensor generation methods. We demonstrate how BIGtensor can help users discover hidden concepts and analyze trends from large-scale tensors that are hard to be processed by existing tensor tools.
