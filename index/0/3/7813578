There are many applications in CFD and structural analysis that can be more accurately modeled using unstructured grids. Parallelization of implicit methods for unstructured grids is a difficult and important problem. This paper deals with coloring techniques to overlap computation and communication during the solution of implicit methods on message passing distributed memory multicomputers. An evaluation of coloring techniques for partitioned unstructured grids is first presented. Results show the importance of using partitioning information during coloring. It is next shown that overlapping computation and communication can be formalized as a generalized coloring problem. Modified coloring algorithms are used for this purpose. The PARTI library has been extended to support non-blocking gather-scatter operations and used in conjunction with these algorithms. Practicality issues are evaluated with experimental results on an Intel Paragon multicomputer.
