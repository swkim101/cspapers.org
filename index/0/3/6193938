In this paper we describe Gilded Gait, a system that changes the perceived physical texture of the ground, as felt through the soles of users' feet. Ground texture, in spite of its potential as an effective channel of peripheral information display, has so far been paid little attention in HCI research. The system is designed as a pair of insoles with embedded actuators, and utilizes vibrotactile feedback to simulate the perceptions of a range of different ground textures. The discreet, low-key nature of the interface makes it particularly suited for outdoor use, and its capacity to alter how people experience the built environment may open new possibilities in urban design.
