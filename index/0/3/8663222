We propose a method of organizing reading materials for vocabulary learning. It enables us to select a concise set of reading texts (from a target corpus) that contains all the target vocabulary to be learned. We used a specialized vocabulary for an English certification test as the target vocabulary and used English Wikipedia, a free-content encyclopedia, as the target corpus. The organized reading materials would enable learners not only to study the target vocabulary efficiently but also to gain a variety of knowledge through reading. The reading materials are available on our web site.
