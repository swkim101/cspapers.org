In this research, we focused on the degrees-of-freedom for robot foot mechanism. To realize the functions of human locomotion on biped robots, we should know the fundamental aspects of human foot mechanisms through intensive observations of human locomotion. We proposed a novel mechanical shoe with 2-DOF toe parts, which move independently and are able to constrain human foot in various ways. Wearing the mechanical shoes, three subjects were measured on their walking speed, toe joint angles, and center of pressure. They were walking in straight, zigzag and slalom courses. Through these observations, we show that a biped robot with the proposed toe mechanism could potentially walk faster than conventional ones.
