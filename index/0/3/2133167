In this paper, we proposed a perspective Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (pHDP) model to deal with user-tagged image modeling. The contribution is two-fold. Firstly, we associate image features with image tags. Secondly, we incorporate the user's perspectives into the image tag generation process and introduce new latent variables to determine if an image tag is generated from user's perspectives or from the image content. Therefore, the model is able to extract both embedded semantic components and user's perspectives from user-tagged images. Based on the proposed pHDP model, we achieve automatic image tagging with users' perspective. Experimental results show that the pHDP model achieves better image tagging performance compared to state-of-the-art topic models.
