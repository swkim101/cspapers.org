In this paper, we introduce the fractal summarization model based on the fractal theory. In fractal summarization, the important information is captured from the source text by exploring the hierarchical structure and salient features of the document. A condensed version of the document that is informatively close to the original is produced iteratively using the contractive transformation in the fractal theory. User evaluation has shown that fractal summarization outperforms traditional summarization.
