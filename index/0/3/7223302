Using an accelerometer on the base of a robot, it is possible to calculate the torque required from each actuator in order to maintain a known pose regardless of base orientation with respect to the direction or magnitude of gravity. A simple and novel method has been developed and implemented for overcoming gravity induced torques on the RAVENTM surgical research robot. This innovation will allow for accurate control of serial robot manipulators with re-orientable bases or for those operating in non-stationary environments such as boats, space stations, or moving vehicles.
