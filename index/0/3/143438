This paper compares two algorithms to solve a multiagent patrol problem with uncertain durations. The first algorithm is reactive and allows adaptive and robust behavior, while the second one uses planning to maximize longterm information retrieval. Experiments suggest that on the considered instances, using a reactive and local coordination algorithm performs almost as well as planning for long-term, while using much less computation time.
