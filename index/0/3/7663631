In this paper, we present a complete analysis of redundant relationships in the entity-relationship model. Existing approaches use the concept of functional dependencies for identifying redundancy but ignore minimum wdinality umstmints that carry important information about the structure of the model. Research literature on the topic is rare and usualiy is confined to the ‘Many to One’-‘mandatory participation’ case. Our approach differs from previous works in that we consider both maximum and minimum cardinal@ constraints to analyze the 4096 cases required to perform a complete study. Our approach frrst looks at the maxinmm cardinality constraints to develop a set of general rules to identify groups of trivial and arnb@ous structures, and then we give greater consideration to the minimum cardiiality constraints in those groups that require detailed investigation. With this approach we have provided a thorough pattern analysis of redundant relationships from both a structural and semantic view. The scope of this paper focuses on a complete and thorough analysis of a bmary relationship redundant with respect to the composite of two binary relationships and establishes inferences that can extend this analysis to the more complex ‘n-relationship path’ case. We provide a complete set of heuristics for identifying redundant relationships that can be easily applied by data modelers and system analysis people.
