This abstract describes README-EVAL, a novel measure for semantic parsing evaluation of interpreters for instructions in computer program README files. That is enabled by leveraging the tens of thousands of Open Source Software programs that have been annotated by package maintainers of GNU/Linux operating systems. We plan to make available a public shared implementation of this evaluation.
