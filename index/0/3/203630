XML is the most used language for structuring data and documents, besides being the de-facto standard for data exchange. Keyword based search has been implemented by the XQuery Full-Text language extension, allowing document fragments to be retrieved and ranked via keyword-based matching in the Information Retrieval style. In this demo the implementation of an XQuery extension allowing users to express their vague knowledge of the underlying XML structure is presented. The integration has been performed on top of the BaseX query engine; the work, as initially done by Panzeri at al. in IIR 2013 as a proof-of-concept has been further enhanced and extended.
