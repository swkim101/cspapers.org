The bubble cursor is a promising cursor expansion technique, improving a user's movement time and accuracy in pointing tasks. We introduce a brain-based target expansion system, which improves the efficacy of bubble cursor by increasing the expansion of high importance targets at the optimal time based on brain measurements correlated to a particular type of multitasking. We demonstrate through controlled experiments that brain-based target expansion can deliver a graded and continuous level of assistance to a user according to their cognitive state, thereby improving task and speed-accuracy metrics, even without explicit visual changes to the system. Such an adaptation is ideal for use in complex systems to steer users toward higher priority goals during times of increased demand.
