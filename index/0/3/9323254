Streaming video has received a lot of attention from industry and academia. In this work, we study the characteristics and challenges associated with large-scale live video delivery. Using logs from a commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN), we study live video delivery for a major entertainment event that was streamed by hundreds of thousands of viewers in North America. We analyze Quality-of-Experience (QoE) for the event and note that a significant number of users suffer QoE impairments. As a consequence of QoE impairments, these users exhibit lower engagement metrics.
