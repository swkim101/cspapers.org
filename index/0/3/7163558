We discuss the design and implementation of an interdisciplinary non-majors course Cybersecurity for future presidents, which broadens the types of computational courses available for non-majors. The goal of our course is to build awareness of cybersecurity issues and to promote thinking critically about them. Student debates on controversial cybersecurity issues facing society today motivate the technical and policy content. We present student assessment results, which demonstrate an increase of students' awareness, and outline directions for future course improvements.
