This paper explores direct touch and manipulation techniques for surface computing platforms using a special force feedback stylus named ImpAct(Immersive Haptic Augmentation for Direct Touch). Proposed haptic stylus can change its length when it is pushed against a display surface. Correspondingly, a virtual stem is rendered inside the display area so that user perceives the stylus immersed through to the digital space below the screen. We propose ImpAct as a tool to probe and manipulate digital objects in the shallow region beneath display surface. ImpAct creates a direct touch interface by providing kinesthetic haptic sensations along with continuous visual contact to digital objects below the screen surface.
