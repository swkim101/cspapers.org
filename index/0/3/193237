The paper is on preliminary work on systems engineering concepts and their deployment. We consider requirement evolution with a systems engineering approach can be modelled by systems engineering processes at least for the on development phases of the product. The paper is very technology oriented and wholly based on EIA-632 standards; the paper is extended with requirement evolution issues and a methodological approach is proposed.
