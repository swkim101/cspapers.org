In this paper, we consider a general problem of semi-supervised preference learning, in which we assume that we have the information of the extreme cases and some ordered constraints, our goal is to learn the unknown preferences of the other places. Taking the potential housing place selection problem as an example, we have many candidate places together with their associated information (e.g., position, environment), and we know some extreme examples (i.e. several places are perfect for building a house, and several places are the worst that cannot build a house there), and we know some partially ordered constraints (i.e. for two places, which place is better), then how can we judge the preference of one potential place whose preference is unknown beforehand? We propose a Bayesian framework based on Gaussian process to tackle this problem, from which we not only solve for the unknown preferences, but also the hyperparameters contained in our model.
