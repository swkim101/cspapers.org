Abstract-Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) for future mixedcriticality systems must handle a growing variety of traffic requirements, ranging from safety-critical real-time traffic to bursty latency-sensitive best-effort traffic. Additionally, safety standards (e.g. ISO 26262) require sufficient independence among different criticality levels or a full system certification according to the highest applicable safety level. Hence, a NoC must provide performance isolation for safety-critical traffic, while sustaining low latency for best-effort traffic. This paper presents a run-time configurable NoC design enabling latency guarantees for safety-critical traffic with reduced adverse impact on the performance of best-effort traffic. In contrast to existing approaches, we prioritize best-effort over safety-critical traffic and only switch priorities when required. Doing this, we exploit the latency slack of safety-critical applications, while providing sufficient independence among different criticality levels w.r.t. timing properties. We present a formal analysis and an experimental evaluation, showing that the approach provides performance isolation for safety-critical applications, while reducing the adverse effects through strict prioritization on best-effort applications
