Following the standard bag-of-words (BOW) pipeline, when coding the data matrix in the sense of low-rankness incorporates contextual information into the traditional BOW model, this can capture the dependency relationship among neighbor patches. It differs from the traditional sparse coding paradigms which encode patches independently. Current LRC-based methods use l_1 norm to increase the discrimination and sparseness of the learned codes. However, such methods fail to consider the local manifold structure between dataspace and dictionary space. To solve this problem, we propose a locality-constrained low-rank coding (LCLR) algorithm for image representations. By using the geometric structure information as a regularization term,we can obtain more discriminative representations. In addition, we present a fast and stable online algorithmto solve the optimization problem. In the experiments,we evaluate LCLR with four benchmarks, including one face recognition dataset (extended Yale B), one handwrittendigit recognition dataset (USPS), and two image datasets (Scene13 for scene recognition and Caltech101 for object recognition). Experimental results show thatour approach outperforms many state-of-the-art algorithmseven with a linear classifier.
