Concepts and necessity of a dummy (human model) which can simulate a disaster victim for the purpose of evaluating rescue equipments including robots and rescue skills of human and robots are proposed. By contrast of conventional dummies in various fields, the concrete requirements are made clear. The plan of research and development project based on the concept is described. In the latter part of this paper, the 1st prototype under development is introduced. It is based on a human model (doll) for training of bathing assistance, and is equipped with 8-channel telemetric sensors, a wireless camera, a voice recorder, a heater vest, and a carbon dioxide gas tank.
