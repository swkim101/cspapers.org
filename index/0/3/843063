There exist solutions for tracking of objects in 3D space involving hi-tech cameras and powerful computer systems capable of tracking many objects in large dynamic space simultaneously in real time. On the other hand, there are situations where such functionality is not necessary and the conditions may be specified in more detail, which makes the task significantly easier. This paper shows the possibility to track a single object using low-cost cameras on an ordinary laptop in a small-scale and mostly static environment. This solution is useful for standalone tracking in mobile robotics and particularly in the debugging phases, where the user needs to judge the robot movement system independently on what the robot claims.
