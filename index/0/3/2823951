In this work we recast some design principles commonly used in software engineering and adapt them to the design and analysis of domain descriptions in reasoning about actions. We show how the informal requirements of cohesion and coupling can be turned into consistency tests of several different arrangements of modules. This gives us new criteria for domain description evaluation and clarifies the link between software and knowledge engineering in what concerns the meta-theory of actions.
