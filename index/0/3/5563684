This paper introduces a new framework for extending consistent domains of numeric CSP. The aim is to offer the greatest possible freedom of choice for one variable to the designer of a CAD application. Thus, we provide here an efficient and incremental algorithm which computes the maximal extension of the domain of one variable. The key point of this framework is the definition, for each inequality, of an univariate extrema function which computes the left most and right most solutions of a selected variable (in a space delimited by the domains of the other variables). We show how these univariate extrema functions can be implemented efficiently. The capabilities of this approach are illustrated on a ballistic example.
