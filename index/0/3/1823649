In this paper, we propose a flexible principle-based approach (PBA) for reader-emotion classification and writing assistance. PBA is a highly automated process that learns emotion templates from raw texts to characterize an emotion and is comprehensible for humans. These templates are adopted to predict reader-emotion, and may further assist in emotional resonance writing. Results demonstrate that PBA can effectively detect reader-emotions by exploiting the syntactic structures and semantic associations in the context, thus outperforming wellknown statistical text classification methods and the state-of-the-art reader-emotion classification method. Moreover, writers are able to create more emotional resonance in articles under the assistance of the generated emotion templates. These templates have been proven to be highly interpretable, which is an attribute that is difficult to accomplish in traditional statistical methods.
