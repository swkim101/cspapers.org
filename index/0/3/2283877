Large multimedia data bases become feasible due to recent advances in hardware technology. A very important component of multimedia data base management systems will be the presentation manager which will be responsible for effective multimedia presentation and browsing on the screen of workstations.
In this paper we present the functions provided for multimedia presentation and browsing in MINOS, a multimedia information system. The presentation and browsing capabilities provided make effective use of the capabilities of a modern workstation to increase the man-machine communication bandwidth. We regard voice as an important means of communication. Symmetric capabilities for text and voice browsing are provided.
