For fixed <i>k</i> we present linear and almost-linear time algorithms to find a directed cycle of length ≥ <i>k</i>, if one exists. We find a directed cycle of length ≥ log <i>n</i>/log log <i>n</i> in polynomial time, if one exists. Under an appropriate complexity assumption it is known to be impossible to improve this by more than a log log <i>n</i> factor. Our approach is based on depth-first search.
