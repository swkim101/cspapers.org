A set of programs has been developed to aid in the design, testing, and documenting of logic circuits. The user can input logic descriptions by freehand sketching logic diagrams, or he can enter gate connectivity descriptions via a keyboard. Both input forms are then transformed into an internal data structure which can serve as input to logic simulation and test generation programs. Good documentation is encouraged by permitting easy editing and updating of drawings with a TX-2 graphics console which consists of a conventional oscilloscope and an input tablet. A Lincolnwriter is available for typed input and output.
