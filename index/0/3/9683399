In this paper, we present a dynamically consistent control approach for manipulators with Cartesian Admittance Control (CAC) while guaranteeing a Remote Center of Motion (RCM) constraint. The dynamically consistent extended formulation was used in order to achieve a dynamically decoupled redundancy resolution, while a null-motion feedback was implemented that improves the tracking of the null-motion. Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) procedures are proposed as applications of the control approach formulated in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach was verified in simulation by using the Kuka LBR 7 iiwa R800 robot arm.
