We describe the design issues in an implementation of the ESA/390 architecture based on binary translation to a very long instruction word (VLIW) processor. During binary translation, complex ESA/390 instructions are decomposed into instruction “primitives” which are then scheduled onto a wide-issue machine. The aim is to achieve high instruction level parallelism due to the increased scheduling and optimization opportunities which can be exploited by binary translation software, combined with the efficiency of long instruction word architectures. A further aim is to study the feasibility of a common execution platform for different instruction set architectures, such as ESA/390, RS?6000, AS/400 and the Java Virtual Machine, so that multiple systems can be built around a common execution platform.
