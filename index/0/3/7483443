This paper presents a robust adaptive control scheme of an underactuated manipulator. The proposed control schemes are a joint position-to-position (PTP) control scheme and a Cartesian end-point control scheme tracking a continuous path in Cartesian space. The proposed joint and Cartesian controllers are verified by experimental results for an actual three-link SCARA robot manipulator with a passive joint. In this robot experiment, the third joint of this robot is passive.
