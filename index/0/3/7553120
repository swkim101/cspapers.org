3D die stacking is an exciting new technology that increases transistor density by vertically integrating two or more die with a dense, high-speed interface. The result of 3D die stacking is a significant reduction of interconnect both within a die and across dies in a system. For instance, blocks within a microprocessor can be placed vertically on multiple die to reduce block to block wire distance, latency, and power. Disparate Si technologies can also be combined in a 3D die stack, such as DRAM stacked on a CPU, resulting in lower power higher BW and lower latency interfaces, without concern for technology integration into a single process flow. 3D has the potential to change processor design constraints by providing substantial power and performance benefits. Despite the promising advantages of 3D, there is significant concern for thermal impact. In this research, we study the performance advantages and thermal challenges of two forms of die stacking: Stacking a large DRAM or SRAM cache on a microprocessor and dividing a traditional micro architecture between two die in a stack
