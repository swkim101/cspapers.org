During neurosurgery, nonrigid brain deformation prevents preoperatively acquired images from accurately depicting the intraoperative brain. Stereo vision systems can be used to track cortical surface deformation and update preoperative brain images in conjunction with a biomechanical model. However, these stereo systems are often plagued with calibration error, which can corrupt the deformation estimation. In order to decouple the effects of camera calibration and surface deformation, a framework is needed which can solve for disparate and often competing variables. Game theory, which was developed specifically to handle decision making in this type of competitive environment, has been applied to various fields from economics to biology. In this paper, we apply game theory to cortical surface tracking and use it to infer information about the physical processes of brain deformation and image acquisition.
