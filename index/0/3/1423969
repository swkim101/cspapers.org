We derive a spectral method for unsupervised 
learning ofWeighted Context Free Grammars. 
We frame WCFG induction as finding a Hankel 
matrix that has low rank and is linearly 
constrained to represent a function computed 
by inside-outside recursions. The proposed algorithm picks the grammar that agrees with a sample and is the simplest with respect to the nuclear norm of the Hankel matrix.
