All operations of the information processing on computer relate to text editor. The misspellings or typing errors often make in text editor. In MS Office applications have English spellchecking function. The current Vietnamese spellchecking methods are mostly based on Vietnamese vocabulary corpus because most words are presented in these corpus. Currently, the Ede vocabulary corpus is also being gradually improved. Therefore, Ede spellchecking basing on vocabulary corpus has a lot of difficulties. From that, the spellchecking Ede syllable basing on the Ede syllable models has been proposed. The objective of this study is building the Ede syllable spellchecking algorithm basing on the Ede syllable models. This algorithm is applied to separate the words which are not in the Ede vocabulary into two structure groups: correct and incorrect syllables. The correct syllables are saved for the input data of the Ede-Vietnamese vocabulary corpus developing application. This research has contributed to support spellchecking Ede language in text editor and to develop Ede and Ede-Vietnamese vocabulary corpus.
