Flow balance and homogeneity assumptions are needed to derive operational counterparts of M/M/1 queue length and response time formulas. This paper presents relationships between the assumption errors and the errors in the queue length and response time estimates. A simpler set of assumption error measures is used to derive bounds on the error in the response time estimate. An empirical study compares actual errors with their bounds.
