This paper presents the design and control of a teleoperated robotic system for dexterous micromanipulation tasks at the meso-scale, specifically open microsurgery. Robotic open microsurgery is an unexplored yet potentially a high impact area of surgical robotics. Microsurgical operations, such as microanastomosis of blood vessels and reattachment of nerve fibers, require high levels of manual dexterity and accuracy that surpass human capabilities. A 3-DoF robotic wrist is designed and built based on a spherical five-bar mechanism. The wrist is attached to a 3-axis commercial off-the-shelf linear stage, achieving a fully dexterous system. Design requirements are determined using motion data collected during a simulated microanastomosis operation. The wrist design is optimized to maximize workspace and manipulability. The system is teleoperated using a haptic device, and has the required bandwidth to replicate microsurgical motions. The system was successfully used in a micromanipulation task to stack 1 mm-diameter metal spheres. The micromanipulation system presented here may improve surgical outcomes during open microsurgery by offering better accuracy and dexterity to surgeons.
