In this paper we present a new method for Boolean matching of completely specified Boolean functions. The canonical Generalized Reed-Muller forms are used as a powerful analysis tool. Input permutation, as well as input and output negation for matching are handled simultaneously. To reduce the search space for input correspondence, we have developed a method that can detect symmetries of any number of inputs simultaneously. Experiments on MCNC benchmark circuits are very encouraging.
