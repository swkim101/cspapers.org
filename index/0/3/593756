In this paper the formation stabilization problem for a system of heterogeneous agents is considered. Agents are characterized by different linear dynamics, and assumed to be able to collaborate by exchanging information if they are within their range of communication. A sufficient algebraic condition for the stability of the formation based on a generalization of the Gerschgorin circle theorem for block matrices is proposed. Furthermore, conditions under which the formation remains stable under switching topology are investigated. Simulation results are given to corroborate the theoretical results.
