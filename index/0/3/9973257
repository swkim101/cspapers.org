The most popular form of user authentication on websites is the use of passwords. When entering a password, it is crucial that the website uses HTTPS (for the entire content). However, this is often not the case. We propose PassSec - a Firefox Add-On to support users to detect password fields on which their password might be endangered. In addition, PassSec displays a non-blocking warning next to the password field, once users click into the password field. The user is provided with possible consequences of entering a password, recommendations and further information if wanted.
