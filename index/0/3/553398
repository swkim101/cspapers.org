Relevance Feedback (RF) is a technique allowing to enrich an initial query according to the user feedback. The goal is to express more precisily the user's needs. Some open issues appear when considering semi-structured documents like XML documents. Most of the RF approaches proposed in XML retrieval are simple adaptations of traditional RF to the new granularity of information. They enrich queries by adding terms extracted from relevant elements instead of terms extracted from whole documents. In this paper we show how structural constraints can also be used in RF. We propose a new approach that is able to extend the initial query by adding one or more generative structures. This approach is applied to unstructured queries. Experiments are carried out on INEX collection and results show the interest of our method.
