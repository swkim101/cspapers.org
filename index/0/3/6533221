An analysis of the random carrier sense multiple access channel is presented in terms of the behaviour of each participating station. A detailed model of the station protocol, including the control policy used in case collisions, is used to derive the traffic and throughput of each station. The channel traffic characteristics are derived from this model and used, in turn, to derive the traffic parameters entering into the station model. This provides a solution method for complete system characteristics for a finite prespecified set of stations. The approach is then used to analyse control policies of the type used in ETHERNET. We show, in particular, that as the propagation delay becomes small, the specific form of the control policy tends to have a marginal effect on network performance. The approach also applies to the DANUBE and XANTHOS networks.
