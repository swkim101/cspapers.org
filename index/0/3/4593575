Most automated testing techniques for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) produce test cases that are only concerned with covering the elements (widgets, menus, etc.) on the interface, or the underlying program code, with little consideration of test case semantics. This is effective for functional testing where the aim is to find as many faults as possible. However, when one wants to mimic a real user for evaluating usability, or when it is necessary to extensively test important end-user tasks of a system, or to generate examples of how to use an interface, this generation approach fails. Capture and replay techniques can be used, however there are often multiple ways to achieve a particular goal, and capturing all of these is usually too time consuming and unrealistic. Prior work on human performance regression testing introduced a constraint based method to filter test cases created by a functional test case generator, however that work did not capture the specifications, or directly generate only the required tests and considered only a single type of test goal. In this paper we present EventFlowSlicer, a tool that allows the GUI tester to specify and generate all realistic test cases relevant to achieve a stated goal. The user first captures relevant events on the interface, then adds constraints to provide restrictions on the task. An event flow graph is extracted containing only the widgets of interest for that goal. Next all test cases are generated for edges in the graph which respect the constraints. The test cases can then be replayed using a modified version of GUITAR. A video demonstration of EventFlowSlicer can be found at https://youtu.be/hw7WYz8WYVU.
