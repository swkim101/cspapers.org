In this paper we give an overview on the 4th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb). The goal of TempWeb is to provide a venue for researchers of all domains (IE/IR, Web mining, etc.) where the temporal dimension opens up an entirely new range of challenges and possibilities. The workshop's ambition is to help shaping a community of interest on the research challenges and possibilities resulting from the introduction of the time dimension in web analysis. Having a dedicated workshop will help, we believe, to take a rich and cross-domain approach to this new research challenge with a strong focus on the temporal dimension. For the fourth time, TempWeb has been organized in conjunction with the International World Wide Web (WWW) conference, being held on April 8, 2014 in Seoul, Korea.
