A bio-inspired model for an analog programmable array processor (APAP), based on studies on the vertebrate retina, has permitted the realization of complex programmable spatio-temporal dynamics in VLSI. This model mimics the way in which images are processed in the visual pathway, rendering a feasible alternative for the implementation of early vision applications in standard technologies. A prototype chip has been designed and fabricated in a 0.5^m standard CMOS process. Computing power per area and power consumption is amongst the highest reported for a single chip. Design challenges, trade-offs and some experimental results are presented in this paper.
