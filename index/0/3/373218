Peer services depend on one another to accomplish their tasks, and their structures may evolve. A service composition may be designed to replace its member services whenever the quality of the composite service fails to meet certain quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Finding services and service invocation endpoints having the greatest impact on the quality are important to guide subsequent service adaptations. This paper proposes a technique that samples the QoS of composite services and continually analyzes them to identify artifacts for service adaptation. The preliminary results show that our technique has the potential to effectively find such artifacts in services.
