Ubiquitous computing aims to provide personalised services. To do so, it captures and stores huge set of personal data in the user models. These stores pose challenges for effective user control and privacy. This thesis aims to tackle some of these by creating mechanisms and interfaces for forgetting. The key contributions of this research are to establish the theoretical foundations for the design of mechanisms for forgetting in such models, and to develop and evaluate the framework and its interfaces for users to control these mechanisms.
