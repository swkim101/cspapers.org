In this paper we propose a new approach to the generation of pseudowords, i.e., artificial words which model real polysemous words. Our approach simultaneously addresses the two important issues that hamper the generation of large pseudosense-annotated datasets: semantic awareness and coverage. We evaluate these pseudowords from three different perspectives showing that they can be used as reliable substitutes for their real counterparts.
