We report on the MultilingualWeb initiative, a collaboration between the W3C Internationalization Activity and the European Commission, realized as a series of EC-funded projects. We review the outcomes of "MultilingualWeb", which conducted 4 workshops analyzing "gaps" within Web standardization that currently hinder multilinguality. Gap analysis led to formation of "MultilingualWeb-LT" - project and W3C Working Group with cross industry representation that will address priority issues via standardization of interoperability metadata.
