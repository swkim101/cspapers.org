In this paper, we propose new probe device which can realize soft handling of single cells using thermal gel. In general, probe devices are one of the important devices for single cell manipulation. However, conventional probe devices have some problems: damage to the manipulated cells and difficulty to release the manipulated objects by the effect of surface force. As one solution of these problems, we propose “soft handling probe” in this paper. The probe has an electrode as a microheater. The thermoresponsive polymer can be gelled when a current is applied to the electrode in the thermoresponsive polymer solution. The electrode was fabricated by cupper wire and sputtering of gold on the probe. Thermal gelation of the thermoresponsive polymer was realized at the fabricated probe tip. The manipulation of micro objects and assembly of three dimensional structures were demonstrated by the probe. The handling of yeast cell and liposome were also realized by the probe. It is expected that the probe can realize the soft handling by the generated thermal gel and realize the precise positioning by reducing the effect of surface force.
