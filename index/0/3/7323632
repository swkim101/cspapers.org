The structural features of XML components are an extra source of information that should be used in a content-oriented retrieval task on this type of documents. In this paper we explore one of the structural features from the INEX collection [1] that could be used in content-oriented search. We analyse the gain this knowledge could add to the performance of an information retrieval system and present a first approach on how this structural information could be extracted from a relevance feedback process to be used as priors in a language modelling framework.
