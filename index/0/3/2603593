A partial continuation is a prefix of the computation that remains to be done. We propose in this paper a new operator which precisely controls which prefix is to be abstracted into a partial continuation. This operator is strongly related to the notion of dynamic extent which we denotationally characterize. Some programming examples are commented and we also show how to express previously proposed control operators. A suggested implementation is eventually discussed.
