Researchers evaluate and contrast new network routing, admission control, congestion control and flow control algorithms through simulation. Analytically de-rived arguments justifiably lack credibility because, in the attempt to model the underlying physical system, the analyst is forced to make compromising approximations. However, unlike analytical techniques like Jackson Queueing Networks, simulations require significant computation and a simulation's state can consume a great deal of memory.This paper describes a technique that we developed to reduce the memory consumption of communication network simulators. Reduced memory makes simulations of larger and higher bandwidth-delay networks possible, but introduces an adjustable degree of approximation in the simulation. The higher the memory savings, the less accurate the computed measures. We call our technique Flowsim. The paper motivates the need to simulate computer networks rather than model them analytically, motivates why a simulator's state can grow quickly, and explains why analytical techniques have failed to model modern communication networks.
