We address the problem of efficient spatio-temporal clustering of speed data in road segments with multiple lanes. We postulate that the navigation/route plans typically reported by different providers as a single-value need not be accurate in multi-lane networks. Our methodology generates lane-aware distribution of speed from GPS data and agglomerates the basic space and time units into larger clusters. Thus, we achieve a compact description of speed variations which can be subsequently used for more accurate trips planning. We provide experiments that demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approaches.
