We describe an algorithm for Japanese analysis that does both base phrase chunking and dependency parsing simultaneously in linear-time with a single scan of a sentence. In this paper, we show a pseudo code of the algorithm and evaluate its performance empirically on the Kyoto University Corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm with the voted perceptron yields reasonably good accuracy.
