Database theory is the application of mathematical techniques to the solution of problems related to ths design, implementation, and use of database mangement systems. It is not a tightly integrated mathematical theory. Rather, it is a' collection of.resul!ts on mult.ifarioustopics that are,,connected loosely or not at all. Some of these topics are data models, views, dependencies, power of query lenwages, dynamic&rage structures , quip opt@i"xat(on, concurrency control, recover.+, security, and,semantic integrity. The field began'with Codd's insight that relations .a&prqdicate cal&ulus provide a,powerful and easy to use interface to databases. Codd's application of a math&n+ical'language and techniques to database mandgement are the most impor-'tant contributions to database theory. They gave the mathematical framework for much of the field. Functional dependencies, also defined by Codd, were the first area of intense mathematical.anal-ysis. Dependency structures are still one of the most popular topics; Useful application has been achieved for database'design and universal relation interfaces and, to a lesser extent, for view updating and query simplification. View updating has benefited from a mathematical treatment that demonstrates,that most useful views are not updatabie. .The theory also gives metho& fo? proving that a translation of view updates into databases is correct. There are a n-r of interesting results comparing ths power af relational-style query l&n-guages. For example, it is,known that nestings of aggregate queries has the sams expressive power as alternations of qua&if&s, and that trensi-tive closure is not expressible in relational calculus. Sow of the,most popular dynamic storage structures ,'such as 8:trees.and dynamic (extendible) hashing,:,&re'deveioped with the help of analyses of the computational complexity of retrievals and updates. There are severai important theoretical re-' suits on query optimissjtion: Wang and Youseffi's decomposition algorithm;-qireti &ritplifiication using tableaux, and,$emijoin theory.-Bowever, many open problems r&in, such'as &e*'&&iia-tion of queries containing aggregat&, quantifiers, or disjunctions.
