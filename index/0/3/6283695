Cache prediction for preemptive scheduling is an open issue despite its practical importance. First analysis approaches use simplified models for cache behavior or they assume simplified preemption and execution scenarios that seriously impact analysis precision. We present an analysis approach which considers multiple executions of processes and preemption scenarios for static priority periodic scheduling. The results of our experiments show that caches introduce a strong and complex timing dependency between process executions that are not appropriately captured in the simplified models.
