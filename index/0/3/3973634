Recent advances in the application field increasingly demand the use of wireless camera sensor networks (WCSNs), for which localization is a crucial task to enable various location-based services. Most of the existing localization approaches for WCSNs are essentially interactive, i.e. require the interaction among the nodes throughout the localization process. As a result, they are costly to realize in practice, vulnerable to sniffer attacks, inefficient in energy consumption and computation. In this paper we propose LISTEN, a non-interactive localization approach. Using LISTEN, every camera sensor node only needs to silently listen to the beacon signals from a mobile beacon node and capture a few images until determining its own location. We design the movement trajectory of the mobile beacon node, which guarantees to locate all the nodes successfully. We have implemented LISTEN and evaluated it through extensive experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that it is accurate, efficient, and suitable for WCSNs that consist of low-end camera sensors.
