We propose that the binding and segmentation of visual features is mediated by two complementary mechanisms; a low resolution, spatial-based, resource-free process and a high resolution, temporal-based, resource-limited process. In the visual cortex, the former depends upon the orderly topographic organization in striate and extrastriate areas while the latter may be related to observed temporal relationships between neuronal activities. Computer simulations illustrate the role the two mechanisms play in figure/ground discrimination, depth-from-occlusion, and the vividness of perceptual completion.
