We present a mobile touchable application for online topic graph extraction and exploration of web content. The system has been implemented for operation on an iPad. The topic graph is constructed from N web snippets which are determined by a standard search engine. We consider the extraction of a topic graph as a specific empirical collocation extraction task where collocations are extracted between chunks. Our measure of association strength is based on the pointwise mutual information between chunk pairs which explicitly takes their distance into account. An initial user evaluation shows that this system is especially helpful for finding new interesting information on topics about which the user has only a vague idea or even no idea at all.
