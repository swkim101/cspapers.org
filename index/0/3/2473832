Derivational models are still an underresearched area in computational morphology. Even for German, a rather resourcerich language, there is a lack of largecoverage derivational knowledge. This paper describes a rule-based framework for inducing derivational families (i.e., clusters of lemmas in derivational relationships) and its application to create a highcoverage German resource, DERIVBASE, mapping over 280k lemmas into more than 17k non-singleton clusters. We focus on the rule component and a qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Our approach achieves up to 93% precision and 71% recall. We attribute the high precision to the fact that our rules are based on information from grammar books.
