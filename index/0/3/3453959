Pair programming in CS1 courses has been shown to have many benefits (both to students and instructors), and it is widely employed. Other than assignment by instructors, how do students select their partners, and what are their perceptions of working with a partner? In our study, students in a CS1 course for non-majors were required to complete a brief, anonymized survey after each homework assignment; we analyzed their survey responses over the course of the semester and compared the results of students who worked with a partner and students who worked alone. Pairs and individuals judged assignments to be about the same difficulty, but pairs spent less time on assignments. Individuals generally worked alone out of preference, but a minority of them reported interest in working with partners but could not find one on their own. Through our analysis we model relationships between survey constructs, student success, and student satisfaction.
