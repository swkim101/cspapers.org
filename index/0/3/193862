Students learn best in environments where they can meaningfully engage with materials that emulate real-world scenarios. Incorporating software engineering best practices and supporting tools in introductory courses provides students the opportunity to engage in course materials as a novice member of the profession. We support student engagement with industry tools to support software engineering best practices for tutorials, in-class labs, and programming projects. The goal of the research is to improve student learning, engagement in the course and profession, and retention through the use of software engineering practices and tools that introduce students to the software engineering profession. A prior study on the incorporation of in-class laboratories, supported with software engineering best practices, on linear data structures showed an increase in engagement, but did not show a difference on student learning when compared with active learning lectures. We are currently expanding the study by incorporating in-class laboratories across a full semester of a CS1.5 class at NC State University. The poster presents the preliminary results from Fall 2015.
