There is a great deal of research evolved around systems to deliver precise alignment in the range of nanometer and arc the second for applications, such as positioning of samples used in surface analysis, or the alignment of chip sized components for assembly etc. These technologies feature the use of small-scale motors that rotate a relevant axis to provide a precise motion to a working stage. The problem with these technologies is there small output and the dependence on moving parts, which require maintenance. The aim of this paper is to present a model which is in the initial development phase, a low cost nanometer positioning robotic stage (NPRS) for the referenced applications. The NPRS comprises of two major units, one to provide lateral motion, which consists of a series of arrays of micro robots in the form of piezoelectric wires. The micro robots have the capability to displace laterally in the surface plane (X-Y) due to the supplied voltage (piezoelectric effect). The second unit is a novel micro actuator, which provides rotation to the micro robots. The difference between the proposed NRPS and current technologies, beside its low cost, is the utilization of hair-sized wires made of smart materials as micro robots, and the utilisation of the internal forces inside smart materials to generate the necessary rotation, the expected resolution is in the range of arc the second.
