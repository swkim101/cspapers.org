In this paper, we present a method to utilize semantic constraints that play an important role in search space reduction and termination of query evaluation in object-oriented databases. Our approach consists of three successive refinement steps: rule generation, semantic knowledge compilation, and semantic reformulation. In the rule generation step, we generate a set of deductive rules based on an object-oriented database schema or semantic knowledge about the domain of the database. In the semantic knowledge compilation step, we compile semantic knowledge together with object-oriented database schema to identify semantic knowledge that is potentially relevant(beneficial) to each class in the object-oriented database schema. We associate the fragments of valid and useful semantic knowledge, called residues with classes. After this step, semantic knowledge is grouped according to the classes that it references. During the semantic reformulation step, we receive a userâ€™s query, select the set of relevant semantic knowledge in a query context, and transform the query with associated semantic knowledge into another form which is more efficiently processed. To our knowledge, there is no significant research that has been done about semantic query optimization in object-oriented databases using deductive approach. The unique contribution of this paper is that we extend semantic query optimization techniques developed for deductive databases to apply to object-oriented databases. Our approach attempts to minimize the number of operations that will be performed at run time.
