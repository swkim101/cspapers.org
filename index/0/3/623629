Biological sensory systems are faced with the problem of encoding a high-fidelity sensory signal with a population of noisy, low-fidelity neurons. This problem can be expressed in information theoretic terms as coding and transmitting a multi-dimensional, analog signal over a set of noisy channels. Previously, we have shown that robust, overcomplete codes can be learned by minimizing the reconstruction error with a constraint on the channel capacity. Here, we present a theoretical analysis that characterizes the optimal linear coder and decoder for one- and two-dimensional data. The analysis allows for an arbitrary number of coding units, thus including both under- and over-complete representations, and provides a number of important insights into optimal coding strategies. In particular, we show how the form of the code adapts to the number of coding units and to different data and noise conditions to achieve robustness. We also report numerical solutions for robust coding of high-dimensional image data and show that these codes are substantially more robust compared against other image codes such as ICA and wavelets.
