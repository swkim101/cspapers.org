This article introduces a method for tracking the internal structures of the liver during robot-assisted procedures. Vascular network, tumors and cut planes, computed from pre-operative data, can be overlaid onto the laparoscopic view for image-guidance, even in the case of large motion or deformation of the organ. Compared to current methods, our method is able to precisely propagate surface motion to the internal structures. This is made possible by relying on a fast yet accurate biomechanical model of the liver combined with a robust visual tracking approach designed to properly constrain the model. Augmentation results are demonstrated on in-vivo sequences of a human liver during robotic surgery, while quantitative validation is performed on an ex-vivo porcine liver experimentation. Validation results show that our approach gives an accurate surface registration with an error of less than 6mm on the position of the tumor.
