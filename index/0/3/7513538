This report develops a new set of criteria for evaluating computer architectures that are to support systems with security requirements. Central to these criteria is the concept of a domain, here interpreted as a set of information and authorizations for the manipulation of that information in a comput system. Architectural requirements are grouped in three categories: logical structure, the physical structure. These criteria were developed in order to assess the utility of Navy standard computers as bases for secure embedded systems, but they are not specific to those computers.
