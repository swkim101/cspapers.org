My thesis is largely focused on the parallelisation of UCT (and other Best-First Search techniques) and the ramifications of doing so. I have identified issues with chunking in UCT, created by some forms of parallelisation, and developed a solution to this involving buffering of simulations that appear "out of order" and reevaluation of propagation data. I have developed a technique for scalable distribution of both tree data and computation across a large scale compute cluster. The context of most of my work is General Game Playing, but the techniques themselves are largely agnostic to domain.
