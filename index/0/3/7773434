Computer games are a multi-billion dollar industry and have become an important part of our private and social lives. It is only natural, then, that the technology used to create games should become part of a computing science curriculum. However, game development is more than a massive programming endeavor. Today's games are largely about generating content within multidisciplinary teams. CMPUT 250 is a new computing science course at the University of Alberta that emphasizes creating games in multidisciplinary teams. This paper describes our experiences with the course, emphasizing the issues of multidisciplinary interactions: teaching, teamwork, and evaluation.
