In order to speed up the segmentation of image sequences containing moving objects, an approach is proposed which employs knowledge from different sources to control the extraction of regions. Here, regions are connected image components which exhibit grayvalue characteristics determined by specific values of the parameters supplied to the extraction algorithm. These values may be inferred from outside knowledge and previous interpretation results, e.g. from older frames in a sequence. Various segmentations of the same image with parameters adapted to different expected object surface characteristics may be obtained. Thus, this approach is an attempt to overcome the sharp partition of segmentation and interpretation found in conventional scene analysis paradigms.
