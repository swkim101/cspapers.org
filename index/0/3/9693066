In this paper we propose a framework for synchronization based control (SBC) using neural oscillators for motion assist. A neural oscillator is used to accomplish synchronization and entrainment between periodic motions by the human and robot. The mutual joint torque between the human and robot is used as an external input signal for the neural oscillator, which generates the desired trajectory of a robot joint angle, so that the robot motion synchronizes with the external mutual joint torque. The validity and feasibility of the proposed method is examined from three points of view. The first is whether synchronization of action between human and robot can be realized. The second is whether the assist effect can be obtained, and the third is whether the proposed method has an acceptable level of usability for the user. We explored those three points of view by conducting computer simulations on a human-motion assist system and experiments with a joint torque sensing robot suit.
