Using real time eye tracking, gaze-contingent displays can modify their content to represent depth (e.g., through additional depth cues) or to increase rendering performance (e.g., by omitting peripheral detail). However, there has been no research to date exploring how gaze-contingent displays can be leveraged for manipulating perceived color. To address this, we conducted two experiments (color matching and sorting) that manipulated peripheral background and object colors to influence the user's color perception. Findings from our color matching experiment suggest that we can use gaze-contingent simultaneous contrast to affect color appearance and that existing color appearance models might not fully predict perceived colors with gaze-contingent presentation. Through our color sorting experiment we demonstrate how gaze-contingent adjustments can be used to enhance color discrimination. Gaze-contingent color holds the promise of expanding the perceived color gamut of existing display technology and enabling people to discriminate color with greater precision.
