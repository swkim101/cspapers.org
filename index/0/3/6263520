We present the demonstration of MobileInsight, a software tool that collects, analyzes and exploits runtime information from operational cellular network. MobileInsight runs on commercial off-the-shelf phones without extra hardware or additional support from cellular network operators. It exposes cellular protocol messages from the 3G/4G chipset, and performs in-device protocol analysis. We demonstrate the in-device runtime cellular message collection, analysis of the protocol states, visualization of runtime wireless channel and mobility dynamics, and how mobile applications benefit from MobileInsight.
