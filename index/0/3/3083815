Most conceptual clustering systems rely solely on data to form concepts without supervision; the few that exploit causalities in the background knowledge do so only after the completion of a similarity-based learning phase. In this paper, we describe a multistrategy misconception discovery system, MMD, that utilizes data and theory in a more tightly coupled way. The integration of similarity- and causality-based learning in MMD is shown to be essential for the automatic construction of accurate and meaningful misconceptions that account for errors in novice behavior.
