This paper presents an extended system EPDL of propositional dynamic logic by allowing a proposition as a modality for representing and specifying direct and indirect effects of actions in a unified logical structure. A set of causal logics based on the framework are proposed to model causal propagations through logical relevancy and iterated effects of causation. It is shown that these logics capture the basic properties of causal reasoning.
