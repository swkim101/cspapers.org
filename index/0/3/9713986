This paper deals with target tracking control of unicycle type mobile robots. Target tracking function is essential for autonomous robots such as guide robots, security guard robots, etc. In the field of mobile robot control, many control schemes for posture stabilization and trajectory tracking problem have been proposed. Target tracking control, however, cannot be achieved using these kinds of control laws. Therefore, a new global asymptotic stable controller for this problem is designed using the backstepping method. The stability of the system is proved using the Lyapunov function. Various simulation results validate the performance and theoretical analysis.
