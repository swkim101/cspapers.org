The central thesis of "Leonardo's Laptop" (MIT Press, 2002) is that designers who are sensitive to human needs are more likely to make the breakthroughs that yield new technologies successes. Therefore, a theory of mobile devices would focus on compact devices that support human relationships, provide salient information, and enable creative expression. The foundations are not only the megahertz of connectivity, but also the usability and universality of interfaces. Demonstrations include digital photo applications, personal info, healthcare, and e-commerce.
