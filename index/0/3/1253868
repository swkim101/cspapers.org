Recently several CSMA algorithms based on the Glauber dynamics model have been proposed for multihop wireless scheduling, as viable solutions to achieve the throughput optimality, yet are simple to implement. However, their delay performances still remain unsatisfactory, mainly due to the nature of the underlying Markov chains that imposes a fundamental constraint on how the link state can evolve over time. In this paper, we propose a new approach toward better queueing and delay performance, based on our observation that the algorithm needs not be Markovian, as long as it can be implemented in a distributed manner, achieving the same throughput optimality and better delay performance. Our approach hinges upon utilizing past state information observed by local link and then constructing a high-order Markov chain for the evolution of the feasible link schedules. Our proposed algorithm, named delayed CSMA, adds virtually no additional overhead onto the existing CSMA-based algorithms, achieves the throughput optimality under the usual choice of link weight as a function of queue length, and also provides much better delay performance by effectively resolving temporal link starvation problem. From our extensive simulations we observe that the delay under our algorithm can be often reduced by a factor of 20 over a wide range of scenarios, compared to the standard Glauber-dynamics-based CSMA algorithm.
