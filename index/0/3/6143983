This paper present a new method for parsing English sentences. The parser called LUTE-EJ parser is combined with case analysis and ATNG-based analysis. LUTE-EJ parser has two interesting mechanical characteristics. One is providing a structured buffer, Structured Constituent Buffer, so as to hold previous fillers for a case structure, instead of case registers before a verb appears in a sentence. The other is extended HOLD mechanism(in ATN), in whose use an embedded clause, especially a "bedeleted" clause, is recursively analyzed by case analysis. This parser's features are (1)extracting a case filler, basically as a noun phrase, by ATNG-based analysis, including recursive case analysis, and (2)mixing syntactic and semantic analysis by using case frames in case analysis.
