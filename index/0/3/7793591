Given a set <?Pub Fmt italic>P<?Pub Fmt /italic> of<?Pub Fmt italic>n<?Pub Fmt /italic> points in the plane, we wish tofind a set <?Pub Fmt italic>Q<?Pub Fmt /italic> <inline-equation><f>âŠ‚</f><?Pub Caret></inline-equation> <?Pub Fmt italic>P<?Pub Fmt /italic> of<?Pub Fmt italic>k<?Pub Fmt /italic> points for which the convex hull<?Pub Fmt italic>conv(Q><?Pub Fmt /italic> has the minimum area. Wesolve this, and the related problem of finding a minimum area convex<?Pub Fmt italic>k<?Pub Fmt /italic>-gon, in time<?Pub Fmt italic>O<?Pub Fmt /italic>(<?Pub Fmt italic>n<?Pub Fmt /italic><supscrpt>2</supscrpt>log <?Pub Fmt italic>n<?Pub Fmt /italic>) for fixed<?Pub Fmt italic>k<?Pub Fmt /italic>, almost matching known bounds forthe minimum area triangle problem. Our algorithm is based on finding acertain number of <?Pub Fmt italic>nearest verticalneighbors<?Pub Fmt /italic> to each line segment determined by two inputpoints. We use a classical result of Ramsey theory to prove that thesenearest neighbors suffice to determine the minimum convex<?Pub Fmt italic>k<?Pub Fmt /italic>-gon.
