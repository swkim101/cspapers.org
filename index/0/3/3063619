We have recognized that the natural tendency to teach according to the structure of one's own understanding runs contrary to established models of cognitive development. Bloom's Taxonomy has provided a basis for establishing a more efficacious pedagogy. Emphasizing a hierarchical progression of skill sets and gradual learning through example, our approach advocates teaching software development from the inside/out rather than beginning with either console apps or monolithic designs.
