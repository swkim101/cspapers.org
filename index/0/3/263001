Model-based testing of systems has long been a goal of the testing research community, and many paradigms have been proposed and developed. However, while model-based testing approaches are successfully used in industry, they have yet to be adopted as mainstream practices. This workshop explored the impact of object-orientation on model-based testing, as it affects both the creation of test generation tools, and the application of tools to object-oriented systems. Our primary purpose was to identify the key challenges to widespread use of model-based testing approaches for testing object oriented software, and to determine possible ways that object-orientation (and related approaches) may be helpful in overcoming these challenges.
