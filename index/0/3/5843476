The lack of exact semantics for user-defined operators interferes with the query optimization process, thus putting the burden of suggesting, at least partial, query plans on the user. In an attempt to ease this burden, we propose a formal model that allows for data-parallel program synthesis (DPPS) in a semantically well-defined manner. We show that this model generalizes existing frameworks for data-parallel computation, while providing the flexibility of query plan generation that is currently absent from these frameworks. In particular, we show how existing, off-the-shelf, AI planning tools can be used for solving DPPS tasks.
