There are many situations that one needs to find comparable others for a given researcher. Examples include finding peer reviewers, programming committees for conferences, and comparable individual asked in recommendation letters for tenure evaluation. The task is often done on an ad hoc and informal basis. In this paper, we address an interesting problem that has not been adequately studied so far: mining cumulated large scale scholarly data to find comparable researchers. We propose a standard to quantify the quality of individual's research output, through the quality of publishing venues. We represent a researcher as a sequence of her publication records, and develop methods to compute the distance between two researchers through sequence matching. Multiple variations of distances are considered to target different scenarios. We define comparable relation by the distance, and conduct experiments on a large corpus and demonstrate the effectiveness our methods through examples. In the end of the paper, we identify several promising directions for further work.
