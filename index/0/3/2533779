In the design of SPUR, a high-performance multiprocessor workstation, the use of large caches and hardware-supported cache consistency suggests a new approach to virtual address translation. By performing translation in each processor's virtually-tagged cache, the need for separate translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) is eliminated. Eliminating the TLB substantially reduces the hardware cost and complexity of the translation mechanism and eliminates the translation consistency problem. Trace-driven simulations show that normal cache behavior is only minimally affected by caching page table entries, and that in many cases, using a separate device would actually reduce system performance.
