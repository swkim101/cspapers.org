This paper describes our experience extending the educational software program JFLAP. JFLAP enables students to design and simulate automata such as Finite State Machines, push-down automata, and Turing Machines. It is a valuable aid in any Automata Theory course. We modified JFLAP so that students could write Java programs that alter the actual automaton itself. This utility greatly increases the students' ability to grasp such fundamental topics as the Church-Turing thesis and the theory of undecidability.
