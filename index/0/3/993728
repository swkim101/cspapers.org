The modulo r coloring principle states that for any r-coloring of a set of size n and any partition of that set into groups of size r, each group cent aining exactly one element of each color, each color occurs at most ~ times. For n a multiple of r, we show ~ nn (lOg”) lower bound on the length of cutting planes proof systems for modulo r coloring principles by extending Razborov’s well-known lower bound on the size of monotone boolean circuits that compute Perfect Mat thing. The lower bound is extended to monotone circuits over the reals that compute the same function.
