The knapsack-based task scheduler has been previously shown to provide Quality of Service to malleable tasks on computational grids. In this study, we measure the sensitivity of the knapsack-derived schedules to variations in the prescribed allocation policies and their corresponding utility functions. In particular, we explore the effects of varying the strengths of an external user-specified monetary metric, an intrinsic estimated response time mediated by nearness to completion time metric, and of varying the shape of a sigmoidal normalizing utility function. The results of our analyses show that the knapsack strategy results in schedules that are consistent with the defined allocation policies. We conclude by indicating the recommended metric weights, that is, those that produce desirable schedule characteristics.
