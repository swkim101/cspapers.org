This paper describes a symbolic formulation that allows incorporation of speculative operation execution (preexecution) in an exact control-dependent scheduling of arbitrary forward branching control/data paths. The technique provides a closed form solution set in which all satisfying schedules are encapsulated in a compressed OBDD-based representation. To extract parallelism implicit in the input specification Boolean 'guard' functions are used to identify paths where operations have to be scheduled and the execution order of the conditionals is dynamically resolved. An efficient and systematic iterative construction method is presented along with benchmark results.
