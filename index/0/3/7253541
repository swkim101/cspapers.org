In this paper we present a demonstration of a multilingual generalization of Word-Class Lattices (WCLs), a supervised lattice-based model used to identify textual definitions and extract hypernyms from them. Lattices are learned from a dataset of automatically-annotated definitions from Wikipedia. We release a Java API for the programmatic use of multilingual WCLs in three languages (English, French and Italian), as well as a Web application for definition and hypernym extraction from user-provided sentences.
