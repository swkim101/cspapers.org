We consider the problem of computing a minimum-distortion bijection between two point-sets in R2. We prove the first non-trivial inapproximability result for this problem, for the case when the distortion is constant. More precisely, we show that there exist constants 0 < α < β, such that it is NP-hard to distinguish between spaces for which the distortion is either at most α, or at least β, under the Euclidean norm. This addresses a question of Kenyon, Rabani and Sinclair [KRS04], and extends a result due to Papadimitriou and Safra [PS05], who gave inapproximability for point-sets in R3.
 We also apply similar ideas to the problem of computing a minimum-distortion embedding of a finite metric space into R2. We obtain an analogous inapproximability result under the l∞ norm for this problem. Inapproximability for the case of constant distortion was previously known only for dimension at least 3 [MS08].
