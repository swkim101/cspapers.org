The ITP/INPLANS CCS Network Topology Analyzer is a Bellcore product which performs automated design of cost effective survivable CCS (Common Channel Signaling) networks, with survivability meaning that certain path-connectivity is preserved under limited failures of network elements. The algorithmic core of this product consists of suitable extensions of primal-dual approximation schemes for Steiner network problems. Even though most of the survivability problems arising in CCS networks are not strictly of the form for which the approximation algorithms with proven performance guarantees apply, we implemented modifications of these algorithms with success: In addition to duality-based performance guarantees that indicate, mathematically, discrepancy of no more than 20% from optimality for generic Steiner problems and no more than 40% for survivable CCS networks, our software passed all commercial benchmark tests, and our code was deployed with the August 94 release of the product. CCS networks fall in the general category of low bit-rate backbone networks. The main characteristic of survivability problems for these networks is that each edge, once present, can be assumed to carry arbitrarily many paths. For high bit-rate backbone networks, such as the widely used ATM and SONET, this is no longer the case. We discuss versions of network survivabilitymore » with capacitated edges that appear to model survivability considerations in such networks.« less
