In this article, a new ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna for UWB application is proposed. This antenna is designed with the operation of bandwidth from 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz. The purpose is to design a simple and compact antenna with broad bandwidth VSWR â‰¤ 2. Antenna characteristics such as radiation pattern, maximal gain are also thoroughly investigated.
