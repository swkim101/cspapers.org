Publishing has undergone many changes since the 1960's, often driven by rapid technological development. Technology impacts the creation and dissemination of knowledge only to a certain extent, and in this talk I'll try to give a publisher's perspective of some technological drivers impacting Academic publishing today, and how the many actors involved are learning to cooperate as well as compete in an increasingly distributed environment to better turn information into knowledge. Technically, organizationally, and with regard to shared standards and infrastructure. Publishing has been called many different things by many different people. A simple definition could be that publishing is 'organizing content', so the focus of this talk will be on Elsevier's current use of Linked Data & Semantic technology in organizing scientific content, including some early lessons learned. This view from a publisher aims to help the discussion on how we can all contribute to better disseminate and promote the enormous creativity made through core research contributions.
