In the semantic Web architecture, Web ontology languages arebuilt on top of RDF(S). However, serious difficulties have arisen when trying to layer expressive ontology languages, like OWL, on top of RDF-Schema. Although these problems can be avoided, OWL (andthe whole semantic Web architecture) becomes much more complex than it should be. In this paper, a possible simplification of thesemantic Web architecture is suggested, which has several import antadvantages with respect to the layering currently accepted by the W3C Ontology Working Group.
