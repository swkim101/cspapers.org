A framework for producing dynamic data structure visualizations within the context of a lightweight IDE is described. Multiple synchronized visualizations of a data structure can be created with minimal coding through the use of an external viewer model. The framework supplies a customizable viewer template as well as high-level APIs to a graph drawing library and the Java Debugger Interface. Initial classroom use has demonstrated the framework's ease of use as well as its potential to as an aid to student learning.
