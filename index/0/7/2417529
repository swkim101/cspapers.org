In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), random failures at the sensor nodes and the communication level reduce the likelihood of completing a prescribed mission. This likelihood is further reduced when geographically correlated failures affect the sensing and communication capabilities of the network. In this work, a mission allocation algorithm for WSNs accounting for geographically correlated failures is proposed. The algorithm maximizes the likelihood of completing a mission in WSNs by allocating resources onto the sensor nodes according to a score that weighs the resources, the availability, and the likelihood of sensor nodes to be affected by geographically correlated failures.
