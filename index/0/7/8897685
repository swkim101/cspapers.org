We present a novel way of odometry estimation from Velodyne LiDAR point cloud scans. The aim of our work is to overcome the most painful issues of Velodyne data - the sparsity and the quantity of data points - in an efficient way, enabling more precise registration. Alignment of the point clouds which yields the final odometry is based on random sampling of the clouds using Collar Line Segments (CLS). The closest line segment pairs are identified in two sets of line segments obtained from two consequent Velodyne scans. From each pair of correspondences, a transformation aligning the matched line segments into a 3D plane is estimated. By this, significant planes (ground, walls, ...) are preserved among aligned point clouds. Evaluation using the KITTI dataset shows that our method outperforms publicly available and commonly used state-of-the-art method GICP for point cloud registration in both accuracy and speed, especially in cases where the scene lacks significant landmarks or in typical urban elements. For such environments, the registration error of our method is reduced by 75% compared to the original GICP error.
