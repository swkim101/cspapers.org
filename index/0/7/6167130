In this work, we employ distance bounding (DB) and verifiable trilateration (VT) for secure localization in an intelligent transportation system (ITS). We first demonstrate several possible attack scenarios, and then establish an analytical framework to evaluate the security of these schemes. Results are derived in terms of the probability of a given position being spoofed by maliciously-controlled vehicles assuming randomly distributed colluding attackers. The results show that while VT outperforms DB, both methods have a high probability of being spoofed.
