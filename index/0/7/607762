We consider the ploying all optica P roblem of routing in networks emrouting technology. In these networks, messages travel in optical form and switchin is f! erformed directly on the optical signal. By using %. iferent uravelengths, several messages may use the same edge concurrently, Howeve!, messages assigned the same wavelength must use disjoznt paths, or else be routed at separate rounds. No bufferin at, intermediate nodes is available. Thus, routing in ing wavelengths, paths, and time slots messages. that For arbitrary bounded degree networks, we show any permutation can be routed efficiently in one round using at most 0(log2n/P2) wavelengths, where p is the edge expansion of the network. This improves a quadratic factor on previous results, and almost matches the R(1/P2) existential lower bound. We consider two of the more popular architectures for parallel corn uters. K For bounded dimension arrays we give the rst per-instance approximation algorithm. Given a limited number of wavelengths and a set, of messages to be routed, the algorithm approximates to within polylogarithmlc factors the optimal number of rounds necessary to route all messages. Previous results for arrays give on1 we show that on t K worst-case performance. Finally, e hypercube an be routed using only a constant num i: permutation can er of wavelengths. The previous known bound was O(log n).
