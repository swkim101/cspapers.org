This paper proposes a nonlinear feedback path controller for a skid-steering mining vehicle. The dynamic model of the vehicle is derived using the Boltzmann-Hamel formalism. The control design utilizes the computed torque type technique combined with an auxiliary continuous static state feedback, which involves error coordinates expressed in a moving reference frame partially linked to the vehicle. Assuming that the lateral friction forces caused by the skidding of the wheels are not exactly known, the last part of the paper is centered on the analysis of the effect of Coulomb friction on the behaviour of the system. Asymptotic stabilization of the equilibrium set is achieved for the closed-loop system with discontinuous right-hand side.
