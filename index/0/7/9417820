Animated text is an appealing field of creative graphical design. Manually designed text animation is largely employed in advertising, movie titles and web pages. In this paper we propose to link, through state of the art NLP techniques, the affective content detection of a piece of text to the animation of the words in the text itself. This methodology allows us to automatically generate affective text animation and opens some new perspectives for advertising, internet applications and intelligent interfaces.
