In this paper, we describe development of the multi-axial micromanipulation organized by versatile micro robots using micro tweezers. To conduct microscopic operations, a unique locomotion mechanism composed of four piezoelectric actuators and two electromagnets is proposed. Here two legs arranged to cross each other are connected by four piezoelectric actuators so that the robot can move in any direction, i.e. in X and Y directions as well as rotate at the specified point precisely in the manner of an inchworm. To manipulate micro objects by these versatile micro robots, we have developed micro tweezers driven by 3 piezoelectric actuators. We have also developed an electromagnetic spherical micromanipulator to position the micro tweezers. The electromagnetic spherical micromanipulator rotates in yaw, roll and pitch directions independently. The electromagnetic spherical micromanipulator is a 1-inch cube size, so we can easily attach them on top of the versatile micro robots. We have developed the multi-axial micromanipulation organized by 3 versatile micro robots with the electromagnetic spherical micromanipulator and micro tweezers. The whole manipulation device is very small, 200 mm in diameter and 70 mm in height, so we can easily attach the device to micro processing instruments even if the working area is very small. This device has 21 DOF with less than 100 nm resolution. In experiments, we have demonstrated flexible handling of miniscule glass spheres with a diameter of 20 mum. We have also succeeded in fixing miniscule glass spheres on a sample table by an ultraviolet cure adhesive. The design procedure, basic performance and micro-assembling applications of this tiny robot are also discussed as part of the new field of micro robotics requiring especially high precision in certain regions.
