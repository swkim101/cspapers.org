Knowledge discovery in databases requires not only development of novel mining techniques but also fair and comparable quality assessment based on objective evaluation measures. Especially in young research areas where no common measures are available, researchers are unable to provide a fair evaluation. Typically, publications glorify the high quality of one approach only justified by an arbitrary evaluation measure. However, such conclusions can only be drawn if the evaluation measures themselves are fully understood. In this paper, we provide the basis for systematic evaluation in the emerging research area of subspace clustering. We formalize general quality criteria for subspace clustering measures not yet addressed in the literature. We compare the existing external evaluation methods based on these criteria and pinpoint limitations. We propose a novel external evaluation measure which meets the requirements in form of quality properties. In thorough experiments we empirically show characteristic properties of evaluation measures. Overall, we provide a set of evaluation measures that fulfill the general quality criteria as recommendation for future evaluations. All measures and datasets are provided on our website and are integrated in our evaluation framework.
