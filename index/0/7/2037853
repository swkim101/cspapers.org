Artificial creatures are autonomous mobile agents that have to react in real-time to sensors and plan and perform actions in the real world. Current effective architectures for artificial creatures are behavior-based and use variants of the subsumption architecture. The paper proposes an extension to these architectures in terms of a layer which introduces cognitive capabilities to artificial creatures. This extension is frame-based and uses emergent frame recognition to determine which frame should become active.
