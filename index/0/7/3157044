Following people in different video sources is a challenging task: variations in the type of camera, in the lighting conditions, in the scene settings (e.g. crowd or occlusions) and in the point of view must be accounted. In this paper we propose a system based only on appearance information that, disregarding temporal and spatial information, can be flexibly applied on both moving and static cameras. We exploit the joint use of transductive learning and spectral properties of graph Laplacians proposing a formulation of the people tracing problem as a semi-supervised classification. The knowledge encoded in two labeled input sets of positive and negative samples of the target person and the continuous spectral update of these models allow us to obtain a robust approach for people tracing in surveillance video sequences. Experiments on publicly available datasets show satisfactory results and exhibit a good robustness in dealing with short and long term occlusions.
