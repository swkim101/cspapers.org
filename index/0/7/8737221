A virtual flexible curved bar coupled with force delay algorithm is proposed for automatic vehicle following, aiming at improving the accuracy of vehicle trajectory tracking, especially when leader vehicle is accelerating or making turns. A virtual flexible curved bar with force delay has been modeled that connects the leader to the follower. The length of this virtual bar is a function of the turning radiuses of the leader vehicle. Through this model, the follower vehicle is in effect being virtually dragged by the leader through the virtual flexible curved bar. It is the virtual dragging force that makes the follower accelerate/decelerate so as to adjust its speed to match that of the leader. Finally, simulations were carried out in MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed algorithm has improved the trajectory tracking error greatly, compared to the virtual rigid straight link approach.
