Most existing subspace analysis-based tracking algorithms utilize a flattened vector to represent a target, resulting in a high dimensional data learning problem. Recently, subspace analysis is incorporated into the multilinear framework which offline constructs a representation of image ensembles using high-order tensors. This reduces spatio-temporal redundancies substantially, whereas the computational and memory cost is high. In this paper, we present an effective online tensor subspace learning algorithm which models the appearance changes of a target by incrementally learning a low-order tensor eigenspace representation through adaptively updating the sample mean and eigenbasis. Tracking then is led by the state inference within the framework in which a particle filter is used for propagating sample distributions over the time. A novel likelihood function, based on the tensor reconstruction error norm, is developed to measure the similarity between the test image and the learned tensor subspace model during the tracking. Theoretic analysis and experimental evaluations against a state-of-the-art method demonstrate the promise and effectiveness of this algorithm.
