We have developed a system to support communication between students and teachers on the computer network. By using e-mail, they can exchange information, e.g., questions and reports whenever and wherever they can access the Internet. And by using World Wide Web, the teacher can provide impressive teaching material for the student. Moreover the system provides "easy maintenance" facilities. So the teachers who use it don't have to master the details of the system. They can use it easily by following various navigational information instructions. And to use the system for many years, it can reuse information and setups which were made previously.
