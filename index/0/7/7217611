Content understanding is a crucial issue for website adaptation. In this paper we present a Function-based Object Model (FOM) that attempts to understand authors’ intention by identifying Object function instead of semantic understanding. Every Object in a website serves for certain functions (Basic and Specific Function) which reflect authors’ intention towards the purpose of an Object. Based on this consideration we have proposed the FOM model for website understanding. FOM includes two complementary parts: Basic FOM based on the basic functional properties of Object and Specific FOM based on the category of Object. An automatic approach to detect the functional properties and category of Object is presented for FOM generation. Two level adaptation rules (general rules and specific rules) based on FOM are combined for practical adaptation. A system for web content adaptation over Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is developed as an application example of the proposed model. Experiments have shown satisfactory results and extensibility.
