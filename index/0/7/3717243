In recent years, much research has been done to develop various direct teaching schemes, in which an operator directly teaches a robot by hand guiding instead of using a teach pendant. However, conventional direct teaching methods are usually sensor based, thus leading to an expensive solution. To deal with this problem, this study proposes a sensorless hand guiding method based on torque control. The dynamic model of a robot along with the motor current and friction model is used to determine the user's intention to move the end-effector of a robot instead of directly sensing the external force by the user. A friction torque observer is employed for the friction model identification. The proposed method was experimentally verified using a 6 DOF robot. The experimental results show that the proposed sensorless hand guiding scheme is quite useful for practical direct teaching although the sensitivity is slightly lower than the sensor-based approach.
