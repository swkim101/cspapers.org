The complexity and growing scale of RDF data has made data management back end the performance bottleneck of Semantic Web applications. Caching is one of the ways that could solve this problem. However, few existing research projects focus on caching in RDF data processing. We present an adaptive caching scheme that caches intermediate result of basic graph pattern SPARQL queries. Benchmark test results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our caching scheme.
