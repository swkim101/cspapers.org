It was recently shown that certain nonparametric regressors can escape the curse of dimensionality when the intrinsic dimension of data is low ([1, 2]). We prove some stronger results in more general settings. In particular, we consider a regressor which, by combining aspects of both tree-based regression and kernel regression, adapts to intrinsic dimension, operates on general metrics, yields a smooth function, and evaluates in time O(log n). We derive a tight convergence rate of the form n-2/(2+d) where d is the Assouad dimension of the input space.
