Formal specifications of operating system interfaces can be a useful part of their documentation. We illustrate this by documenting the Threads synchronization primitives of the Taos operating system. We start with an informal description, present a way to formally specify interfaces in concurrent systems, give a formal specification of the synchronization primitives, briefly discuss the implementation, and conclude with a discussion of what we have learned from using the specification for more than a year.
