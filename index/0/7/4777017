In this paper, a review analysis has been carried out on navigational methodologies of robots with the help of various artificial intelligence techniques such as Fuzzy Logic, Neural Network, Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and other Artificial Intelligence techniques. During the survey analysis a systematic review has been done and shown how various artificial intelligence techniques can be successfully used for control and navigation of various types of robots subjected to various environmental conditions.
