The enforcement of security policies is an open challenge in environments where the IT infrastructure has been outsourced to a third party. Although the outsourcing allows companies to gain economical benefits and scalability, it imposes the threat of leaking the private information about the sensitive data managed and processed by untrusted parties. In this work, we propose an architecture to enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) style of authorisation policies in outsourced environments. As a proof of concept, we have implemented a demo and measured the performance overhead incurred by the proposed architecture.
