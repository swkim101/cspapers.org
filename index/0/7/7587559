Content-based indexing [MCM01] is a technique of proven effectiveness for efficient transference of file contents over low bandwidth network links. Departing from this context, the natural step of extending the application of this technique to local file storage has been proposed by a number of storage solutions [CN02, QD02, BF04]. To some extent, all these solutions share a core storage model. File contents are divided into disjoint chunks of data, each of which is individually stored, along with a unique hash of its contents, in a repository of chunks. The actual files are then stored as sequences of possibly shared references to chunks in the repository.
