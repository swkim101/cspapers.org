This paper describes Community Connections, an ongoing service-learning project at the University of San Francisco aimed at bridging the digital divide. We discuss Community Connections' work both in San Francisco and in Peru, the advantages and learning outcomes of incorporating service-learning into a traditional computer science curriculum, outline some of the pitfalls and challenges in implementing this program, and provide advice for implementing technology-oriented service-learning programs at other institutions based on our experiences.
