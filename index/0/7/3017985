This paper presents the design, deployment, and empirical study of a wireless clinical monitoring system that collects pulse and oxygen saturation readings from patients. The primary contribution of this paper is an in-depth clinical trial that assesses the feasibility of wireless sensor networks for patient monitoring in general hospital units. We present a detailed analysis of the system reliability from a long term hospital deployment over seven months involving 41 patients in a step-down cardiology unit. The network achieved high reliability (median 99.68%, range 95.21% -- 100%). The overall reliability of the system was dominated by sensing reliability of the pulse oximeters (median 80.85%, range 0.46% -- 97.69%). Sensing failures usually occurred in short bursts, although longer periods were also present due to sensor disconnections. We show that the sensing reliability could be significantly improved through oversampling and by implementing a disconnection alarm system that incurs minimal intervention cost. A retrospective data analysis indicated that the system provided sufficient temporal resolution to support the detection of clinical deterioration in three patients who suffered from significant clinical events including transfer to Intensive Care Units. These results indicate the feasibility and promise of using wireless sensor networks for continuous patient monitoring and clinical deterioration detection in general hospital units.
