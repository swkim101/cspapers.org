Designing interfaces for interactive handheld projectors is an exiting new area of research that is currently limited by two problems: hand jitter resulting in poor input control, and possible reduction of image resolution due to the needs of image stabilization and warping algorithms. We present the design and evaluation of a new interaction technique, called zoom-and-pick, that addresses both problems by allowing the user to fluidly zoom in on areas of interest and make accurate target selections. Subtle design features of zoom-and-pick enable pixel-accurate pointing, which is not possible in most freehand interaction techniques. Our evaluation results indicate that zoom-and-pick is significantly more accurate than the standard pointing technique described in our previous work.
