Various versions of our first-order logic theorem prover SCOTT have been developed over the past decade to employ the concept of semantic guidance for improving the underlying system OTTER by McCune (Slaney, Lusk, & McCune 1994; Hodgson & Slaney 2001; 2002). We introduce our latest attempt to speed up OTTERâ€™s proof search, Softie. While the various SCOTTs consulted an ordinary constraint solver to gain information about the problem to be solved, Softie is implemented from scratch and uses a solver capable of handling soft constraints.
