We show that distinguishing 1/2-satisfiable Unique-Games instances from (3/8 + ε)-satisfiable instances is NP-hard (for all ε > 0). A consequence is that we match or improve the best known c vs. s NP-hardness result for Unique-Games for all values of c (except for c very close to 0). For these c, ours is the first hardness result showing that it helps to take the alphabet size larger than 2. Our NP-hardness reductions are quasilinear-size and thus show nearly full exponential time is required, assuming the ETH.
