We present Flush, a reliable, high goodput bulk data transport protocol for wireless sensor networks. Flush provides end-to-end reliability, reduces transfer time, and adapts to time-varying network conditions. It achieves these properties using end-to-end acknowledgments, implicit snooping of control information, and a rate-control algorithm that operates at each hop along a flow. Using several real network topologies, we show that Flush closely tracks or exceeds the maximum goodput achievable by a hand-tuned but fixed rate for each hop over a wide range of path lengths and varying network conditions. Flush is scalable; its effective bandwidth over a 48-hop wireless network is approximately one-third of the rate achievable over one hop. The design of Flush is simplified by assuming that different flows do not interfere with each other, a reasonable restriction for many sensornet applications that collect bulk data in a coordinated fashion, like structural health monitoring, volcanic activity monitoring, or protocol evaluation. We collected all of the performance data presented in this paper using Flush itself.
