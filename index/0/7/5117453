A <i>P</i><inf>4</inf> is a set of four vertices of a graph that induces a chordless path; the <i>P</i><inf>4</inf>-structure of a graph is the set of all <i>P</i><inf>4</inf>'s. Vašek Chvátal asked if there is a polynomial time algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary four-uniform hypergraph is the <i>P</i><inf>4</inf>-structure of some graph. The answer is yes; we present such an algorithm.
