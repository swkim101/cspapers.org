This paper presents the implementation of an automatic router for the custom design of MOS integrated circuits. Standard cells are utilized for the logical functions and are interconnected by the router according to the specific design being produced. The design program operates at a very low cost and yields results comparable to manual routing. An expansion technique is used which will give 100 percent completion of interconnection. The router will handle any cell size and will route according to any predetermined design rules. An accuracy of one-hundredth of a mil can be maintained on chips over 300 mils on a side. The router may be used to build designs automatically or, because of its very low cost, can allow manual intervention to achieve more efficient layouts.
