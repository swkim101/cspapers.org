Improvisation is viewed by many people as jazz musicians jamming in the early morning hours or comedians ad-libbing to create a funny skit, but it is so much more. Improv is about listening and moving a conversation (or music) forward in a positive and supportive manner. Above all, it is about supporting all members of the team. These precepts can be found in the Agile, UX (user experience), and the AI worlds and companies are using improv methods as a way of creating more innovative and collaborative teams and which are so necessary for success in today's work environment. Dick Costolo, the former CEO of Twitter and a computer scientist, is an accomplished improviser and credits these techniques in advancing his professional life. The skills learned through using improv are as important as the technical skills for all computer scientists and they can help one to become better a learner, listener, and communicator. This workshop will cover some of the basics of improvisation and its rules as well as ideas on how it can be used in a classroom or a place of employment. Come and learn about improv and why organizations such as IDEO, Marriott, and NASA have embraced improv to create more than just teams, but ensembles of highly functioning creative and caring individuals. This workshop is interactive and attendees will have fun learning and practicing the skills within a safe and accepting environment.
