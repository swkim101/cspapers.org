Consider an edge-weighted tree <i>T</i> = (<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>w</i> : <i>E</i> ↣ R<sup>+</sup>), in which a subset <i>R</i> of the nodes (called the <i>required</i> nodes) are colored red and the remaining nodes in <i>S</i> = <i>V</i>\<i>R</i> are colored black (and called the <i>Steiner</i> nodes). The shortest-path distance according to the edge-weights defines a metric <i>d<subscrpt>T</subscrpt></i> on the vertex set <i>V</i>.
We now ask the following question: Is it possible to define another weighted tree <i>T</i>* = (<i>R</i>, <i>E</i>*, <i>w</i>* : <i>E</i>* ↣ R<sup>+</sup>), this time on <i>just the red vertices</i> so that the shortest-path metric <i>d<subscrpt>T</subscrpt></i>* induced by <i>T</i>* on the vertices in <i>R</i> is “close” to the metric <i>d<subscrpt>T</subscrpt></i> restricted to the red vertices? I.e., does there exist a weighted tree <i>T</i>* = (<i>R</i>, <i>E</i>*, <i>c</i>*) and a (small) constant α such that <i>d<subscrpt>T</subscrpt></i>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) ≤ <i>d<subscrpt>T</subscrpt></i>* (<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) ≤ α <i>d<subscrpt>T</subscrpt></i>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) for any two red vertices <i>u</i>, <i>v</i> ∈ <i>R</i>?
We answer this question in the affirmative, and give a linear time algorithm to obtain a tree <i>T</i>* with α ≤ 8. We also give two applications of this result: an upper bound, in which we show that emulating multicasts using unicasts can be almost as good as general multicasts for certain performance measures; and a lower bound, in which we give a simple combinatorial proof of the fact that the metric generated by a graph of girth<i>g</i> must suffer a distortion of at least &OHgr;(<i>g</i>) when approximated by a tree.
