Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is an artificial perception problem: the input is raw, continuous patterns (no symbols!) and the desired output, which may be words, phonemes, meaning or text, is symbolic. The most successful approach to automatic speech recognition is based on stochastic models. A stochastic model is a theoretical system whose internal state and output undergo a series of transformations governed by probabilistic laws [1]. In the application to speech recognition the unknown patterns of sound are treated as if they were outputs of a stochastic system [18,2]. Information about the classes of patterns is encoded as the structure of these "laws" and the probabilities that govern their operation. The most popular type of SM for ASR is also known as a "hidden Markov model."
