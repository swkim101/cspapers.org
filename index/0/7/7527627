This paper presents two specialized approaches to the design of a database incorporating cryptography in a fundamental way. Most processing is carried out on the encrypted version of the database at an insecure central site. Query initiation and final query interpretation occur at a secure local workstation. The first approach implements a text file with searches based on keywords. The second approach uses subfields and homophonic representations to create a secure database with fairly broad capabilities.
