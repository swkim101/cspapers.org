A variety of models have been proposed for the study of synchronous parallel computation. We review these models and study further some prototype problems. We distinguish two classes of models, fixed connection networks and models based on a shared memory. Routing is the prototype problem for the networks. In particular, routing provides the basis for simulating the more powerful shared memory models. We show that a simple but important class of deterministic strategies (oblivious routing) is necessarily inefficient with respect to worst case analysis. Routing can be viewed as a special case of sorting and the existence of a deterministic O(logn) routing or sorting algorithm for an n processor fixed connection network remains open. However, if we consider the more powerful class of shared memory models, we are -&-ldquo;almost-&-rdquo; able to achieve such an efficient sort via Valiant's parallel merging algorithm. Within a spectrum of models, we show that log log n - log log r is asymptotically optimal for rn processors to merge two sorted lists of n elements.
