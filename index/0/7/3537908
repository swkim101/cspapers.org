We consider the question "How much strong generative power can be squeezed out of a formal system without increasing its weak generative power?" and propose some theoretical and practical constraints on this problem. We then introduce a formalism which, under these constraints, maximally squeezes strong generative power out of context-free grammar. Finally, we generalize this result to formalisms beyond CFG.
