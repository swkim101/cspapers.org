This work replaces conventional marker of augmented reality (AR) with Quick Response (QR) code, in which we take the advantages of QR code, i.e. the capability of error correction and the capability of carrying an abundant of information, to reinforce the occlusion immunity of AR and broaden the scale of AR applications. Basically, we combined QR code and the idea of AR together, designed and implemented a prototype system named QRAR. Meanwhile, we adopted Kalman filter to solve complete and temporary marker occlusion which the error correction can not cope with, in QRAR to gain the robustness.
