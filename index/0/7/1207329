Manipulation planning involves planning the combined motion of objects in the environment as well as the robot motions to achieve them. In this paper, we explore a hierarchical approach to planning sequences of non-prehensile and prehensile actions. We subdivide the planning problem into three stages (object contacts, object poses and robot contacts) and thereby reduce the size of search space that is explored. We show that this approach is more efficient than earlier strategies that search in the combined robot-object configuration space directly.
