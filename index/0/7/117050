This paper presents the structure of a new elective course at the University of Florida, Artificial Intelligence in Computer Games, which addresses not only the technical aspects of creating realism within computer games, but also the need for more experiences in oral communication. Key elements of this course include the students conducting a majority of the teaching and actively participating in evaluating each other.
