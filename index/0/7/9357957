We describe cs1graphics, a new Python drawing package designed with pedagogy in mind. The package is simple enough that students can sit down and make use of it from the first day of an introductory class. Yet it provides seamless support for intermediate and advanced lessons as students progress. In this paper, we discuss its versatility in the context of an introductory course. The package is available at www.cs1graphics.org.
