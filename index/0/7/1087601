We present a new energy harvesting technology that generates electrical energy from a user's interactions with paper-like materials. The energy harvesters are flexible, light, and inexpensive, and they utilize a user's gestures such as tapping, touching, rubbing and sliding to generate electrical energy. The harvested energy is then used to actuate LEDs, e-paper displays and various other devices to create novel interactive applications, such as enhancing books and other printed media with interactivity.
