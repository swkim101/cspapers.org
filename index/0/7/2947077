It is no longer news that undergraduates in computer science need to learn more about parallelism. The range of options for parallel programming is truly staggering, involving hundreds of languages. How can a CS instructor make informed choices among all the options? This panel provides a guided introduction to parallelism in programming languages and their potential for undergraduate CS education, organized into four progressive categories: low-level libraries and; higher-level libraries and features; programming languages that incorporate parallelism; and frameworks for productive parallel programming. The four panelists will present representative examples in their categories, then present viewpoints on how those categories relate to coursework, curriculum, and trends in parallelism.
