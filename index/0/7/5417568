We define two logics of safety specifications for reactive systems. The Iogics provide a setting for the stud y of composition and refinement rules, and a framework for the use of the modular specification methods that these rules underpin. The two logics arise naturally from extant specification approaches; one of the logics is intuitionistic, while the other one is linear.
