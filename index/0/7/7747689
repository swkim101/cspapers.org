Query auto-completion (QAC) facilitates faster user query input by predicting users' intended queries. Most QAC algorithms take a learning-based approach to incorporate various signals for query relevance prediction. However, such models are trained on simulat- ed user inputs from query log data. The lack of real user interaction data in the QAC process prevents them from further improving the QAC performance. In this work, for the first time we collect a high-resolution QAC query log that records every keystroke in a QAC session. Based on this data, we discover two user behaviors, namely the horizontal skipping bias and vertical position bias which are crucial for rele- vance prediction in QAC. In order to better explain them, we pro- pose a novel two-dimensional click model for modeling the QAC process with emphasis on these behaviors. Extensive experiments on our QAC data set from both PC and mobile devices demonstrate that our proposed model can accurate- ly explain the users' behaviors in interacting with a QAC system, and the resulting relevance model significant improves the QAC performance over existing click models. Furthermore, the learned knowledge about the skipping behavior can be effectively incorpo- rated into existing learning-based models to further improve their performance.
