In this work we present a method for Named Entity Recognition (NER). Our method does not rely on complex linguistic resources, and apart from a hand coded system, we do not use any language-dependent tools. The only information we use is automatically extracted from the documents, without human intervention. Moreover, the method performs well even without the use of the hand coded system. The experimental results are very encouraging. Our approach even outperformed the hand coded system on NER in Spanish, and it achieved high accuracies in Portuguese.
