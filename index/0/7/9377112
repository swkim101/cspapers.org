Inclusion of third-party scripts is a common practice, even among major sites handling sensitive data. The default browser security policies are ill-suited for securing web sites from vulnerable or malicious third-party scripts: the choice is between full privilege (<script>) and isolation (<iframe>), with nearly all use cases (advertisement, libraries, analytics, etc.) requiring the former. Previous work attempted to bridge the gap between the two alternatives, but all the solutions were plagued by one or more of the following problems: (a) lack of compatibility, causing most existing third-party scripts to fail (b) excessive performance overheads, and (c) not supporting object-level policies. For these reasons, confinement of JavaScript code suitable for widespread deployment is still an open problem. Our solution, JaTE, has none of the above shortcomings. In contrast, our approach can be deployed on today's web sites, while imposing a relatively low overhead of about 20%, even on web pages that include about a megabyte of minified JavaScript code.
