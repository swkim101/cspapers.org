The Component Object Model (COM) facilitates the creation of software plugins for applications running in Microsoft Windows. ActiveX is a common instantiation of this infrastructure, and uses COM to create plugins for Internet Explorer. As vulnerabilities in COM objects included in the installation of Windows have been found, Microsoft has responded by blacklisting their use by specific applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that the defense mechanisms protecting vulnerable COM objects can be easily circumvented. Specifically, our attack exploits systemic transitive trust among COM objects and allows for the instantiation and exploitation of any of several hundred known flawed controls. After demonstrating this weakness on fully patched Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 machines, we design and implement a system-wide enforcement architecture called COMBlocker, which checks the instantiation of COM objects against a global policy. We then show that COMBlocker is an effective mitigation for such attacks while imposing minimal overhead (approximately 0.5ms per policy check). In so doing, our techniques make the exploitation of default COM objects significantly more difficult.
