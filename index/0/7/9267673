In this paper, a language model adapted to graph-based representation of image content is proposed and assessed. The full indexing and retrieval processes are evaluated on two different image corpora. We show that using the spatial relationships with graph model has a positive impact on the results of standard Language Model (LM) and outperforms the baseline built upon the current state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method.
