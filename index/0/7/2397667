The idea of “nugget pyramids” has recently been introduced as a refinement to the nugget-based methodology used to evaluate answers to complex questions in the TREC QA tracks. This paper examines data from the 2006 evaluation, the first large-scale deployment of the nugget pyramids scheme. We show that this method of combining judgments of nugget importance from multiple assessors increases the stability and discriminative power of the evaluation while introducing only a small additional burden in terms of manual assessment. We also consider an alternative method for combining assessor opinions, which yields a distinction similar to micro- and macro-averaging in the context of classification tasks. While the two approaches differ in terms of underlying assumptions, their results are nevertheless highly correlated.
