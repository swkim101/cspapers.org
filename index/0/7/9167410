In the fall of 1998, the ACM Education Board and the Educational Activities Board of the IEEE Computer Society appointed representatives to a joint task force to prepare Computing Curricula 2001 (CC2001), the next installment in a series of reports on the undergraduate computer science curriculum that began in 1968 and was then updated in 1978 and 1991. Interim reports on the initial planning of the curriculum were presented at the SIGCSE symposium and the IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference in both 1999 and 2000. The CC2001 Task Force released its first draft report at the 2000 SIGCSE conference and plans to release its penultimate draft at SIGCSE 2001. The purpose of this session is to describe how we expect the recommendations of the report to apply in practice. The panelists represent a range of institutions and can therefore speak to the questions that audience members from similar institutions might have.
