Complex robot behaviors are often structured as

state machines, where states encapsulate actions

and a transition function switches between states.

Since transitions depend on physical parameters,

when the environment changes, a roboticist has to

painstakingly readjust the parameters to work in

the new environment. We present interactive SMT-

based Robot Transition Repair (SRTR): instead of

manually adjusting parameters, we ask the roboticist to identify a few instances where the robot is

in a wrong state and what the right state should

be. An automated analysis of the transition function 1) identifies adjustable parameters, 2) converts the transition function into a system of logical constraints, and 3) formulates the constraints

and user-supplied corrections as a MaxSMT problem that yields new parameter values. We show

that SRTR finds new parameters 1) quickly, 2)

with few corrections, and 3) that the parameters

generalize to new scenarios. We also show that

a SRTR-corrected state machine can outperform a

more complex, expert-tuned state machine.
