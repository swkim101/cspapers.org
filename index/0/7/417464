Ad-hoc retrieval relies on the evidence from a userâ€™s query to provide a sufficient variety of terms as well as different term frequencies for differentiating term importance. Short queries lack both typea of information. A new method of automatically weighting query terms for ad-hoc retrieval is introduced that works for short queries. It is based on the term usage statistics in a collection and no training is required. Expximents with both the TREC2 and TREC4 ad-hoc queries show that this weighting scheme can provide significantly better results at the initial retrievat stage. At the expanded query stage, results vary from equal to significantly better than those relying on the originst query weights. In particular, this automatic method provides similar improvements to extra short queries of two to four content terms only.
