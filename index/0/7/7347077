The key objective of this workshop is to explore innovative approaches to the adoption of software engineering tools and practices---in particular by embedding them in extensions of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software products and/or middleware technologies. The workshop aims to advance the understanding and evaluation of adoption of software engineering tools and practices by bringing together researchers and practitioners who investigate novel solutions to software engineering adoption issues.
