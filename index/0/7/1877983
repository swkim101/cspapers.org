We study trade-offs between the update time and the query time for comparison based external memory dictionaries. The main contributions of this paper are two lower bound trade offs between the I/O complexity of member queries and insertions: If N < M insertions perform at most Δ · <i>N</i>/<i>B</i> I/O<inf><sc>s</sc></inf>, then (1) there exists a query requiring N/(M. ·~<sup><i>O</i>(Δ)</sup>) I/O<sc>s</sc>, and (2) there exists a query requiring Ω(log<inf>Δlog<sup>2</sup>N</inf> ~ I/O<sc>s</sc> when Δ is <i>O</i>(<i>B</i>/log<inf>3</inf> <i>N</i>) and <i>N</i> is at least <i>M</i><sup>2</sup>. For both lower bound we describe data structures which give matching upper bounds for a wide range of parameters, thereby showing the lower bounds to be tight within these ranges.
