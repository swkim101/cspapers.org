@p of degree d < p is testable, with an argument that uses no detailed algebraic information about polynomials, except that having low degree is preserved by composition with affine maps. 
 
The complexity of an affine-invariant property P refers to the maximum complexity, as defined by Green and Tao (Ann. Math. 2008), of the sets of linear forms used to characterize P. A more precise statement of our main result is that for any fixed prime p ≥ 2 and fixed integer R ≥ 2, any affine-invariant property P of functions f:
