The IS '97 Model Curriculum reaffirmed the need to prepare information technology students to work effectively in an international environment. Yet, as computer science educators, we face a never-ending struggle to stay current in our field. How can we incorporate yet another educational goal in the curriculum? What is "internationalization"? What form might "internationalization" take in our courses? This seminar will answer some basic questions about internationalizing our courses. In addition, the seminar will provide practical suggestions, examples and resources to help you easily infuse an international perspective in your courses.As participants in a global economy and society, exposure to international perspectives can help us build, maintain and support global information systems and technology. Computer science and information systems bring to the world technologies that advance global interaction. Information technology workers are building systems that will be used by people from many different backgrounds and experiences. In the United States, the work force is becoming more diverse. And with the growing focus on collaboration, teamwork and virtual offices, projects will often involve working closely with people around the world. In such an environment, an awareness of other peoples and cultures becomes increasingly important.There have been a number of initiatives in government, education and information technology that emphasize the need for increasing our knowledge of other countries, nations and cultures. This session will endeavor to help participants become acquainted with the move to "internationalize" curriculum and suggest some practical ways to implement "internationalization" in computer science and information systems.
