Ontology has found application in multiple domains to represent relationships among classes and their instances. Ontology is being popularly applied as a tool for vocabulary conceptualization and optimization. To build vocabulary it requires mapping and merging of ontologies from heterogeneous sources of data. Many varied tools and techniques have been developed by researchers for ontology mapping and merging. This manuscript is an attempt to analyze and appreciate the tools available for ontology mapping and merging. The varied available tools automate integration, unification, aligning and merging of varied related ontologies. We also attempt to draw an efficient analysis among some popular tools while applying the PROMPT tool
