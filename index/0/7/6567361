Failure reproduction and fault isolation are key activities in the post-release phase. As we develop techniques to exploit field data to accelerate and improve these activities, we must be aware of the impact of field data integrity. This work scopes and provides details about a study we are conducting to quantify the impact of usersâ€™ contribution and filtering processes in the integrity of field data, and their effect on failure reproduction and fault isolation techniques.
