This paper addresses the problem of finding glass objects in images. Visual cues obtained by combining the systematic distortions in background texture occurring at the boundaries of transparent objects with the strong highlights typical of glass surfaces are used to train a hierarchy of classifiers, identify glass edges, and find consistent support regions for these edges. Qualitative and quantitative experiments involving a number of different classifiers and real images are presented.
