To allow efficient parallel processing of Prolog programs on distributed multiprocessors, a nonshared variable binding approach is required such that binding environments can be independently distributed among processors. This paper presents a binding scheme, which realises the independence of a clause's binding environment by eagerly instantiating variables across clause arguments. The application of the scheme on a Prolog virtual machine has illustrated its features of efficiency in execution and simplicity in implementation. The preliminary performance evaluation has demonstrated the feasibility of the scheme.
