A network model with temporal sequencing and state-dependent modulatory features is described. The model is motivated by neurocognitive data characterizing different states of waking and sleeping. Computer studies demonstrate how unique states of sequencing can exist within the same network under different aminergic and cholinergic modulatory influences. Relationships between state-dependent modulation, memory, sequencing and learning are discussed.
