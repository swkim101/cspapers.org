Understanding the nature and characteristics of e business workloads is an essential step to improve quality of service Using a multi layer hierarchical workload model this paper presents a characterization of the workload generated by autonomous agents and robots The characterization of the robot workload focuses on the statistical properties of the arrival process and on the robot behavior graph model A multi scale time analysis is used to understand the impact of robot workloads on the performance of e business sites Based on the workload characterization we develop an analytical model for the interaction between robots and e business sites Using the model we show the resource utilization associated with robots requests Multiple time scale analysis point out that server overload may occur at ne time scales even though average utilizations at larger time scales do not show evidences of overloading These results indicate not only the need for a better understanding of the behavior of robots but also help to quantify the impact of robots on the quality of service provided by a site
