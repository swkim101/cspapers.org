Online video websites receive huge amount of videos daily from users all around the world. How to provide valuable recommendation of videos to viewers is important for video websites. Previous studies focus on analyzing the view count of a video, which measures the video's value in terms of popularity. However, the long-lasting value of an online video, namely longevity, is hidden behind the history that a video accumulates its "popularity" through time. Generally speaking, a longevous video tends to constantly draw society's attention. With a focus on Youtube, this paper proposes a scoring mechanism to quantify the longevity of videos. We introduce the concept of latent social impulses and use them to assess a video's longevity. In order to derive latent social impulses, we view the video website as a digital signal filter and formulate the task as a convex minimization problem. The proposed longevity computation is based on the derived social impulses. Unfortunately, the required information to derive social impulses is not always public, which disallows a third party to directly evaluate the longevity of all videos. Thus, we formulate a semi-supervised learning task by using videos of which the longevity scores are known to predict the unknown ones. We develop a Gaussian Random Markov Field model with Loopy Belief Propagation to solve it. The experiments on Youtube demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the prediction results comparing to two baseline models.
