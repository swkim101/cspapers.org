We describe a planning algorithm that integrates two approaches to solving Markov decision processes with large state spaces. It uses state abstraction to avoid evaluating states individually. And it uses forward search from a start state, guided by an admissible heuristic, to avoid evaluating all states. These approaches are combined in a novel way that exploits symbolic model-checking techniques and demonstrates their usefulness in solving decision-theoretic planning problems.
