The limitations of minimally invasive surgery include the inability to sense forces exerted by the instruments on tissue and the limited visual cues available through the endoscope. A modular laparoscopic instrument capable of measuring force and position has been designed to address these limitations. Novel image-based position tracking software has been developed and integrated within a graphical user interface. This modular system is low cost, versatile, and could be used for training, localization of critical features or for guidance during surgical procedures.
