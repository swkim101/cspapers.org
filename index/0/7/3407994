Memory deduplication has been widely used in various commodity hypervisors. However, while this technique improves memory efficiency, it has an impact on system security. In particular, memory deduplication is usually implemented using a variant of copy-on-write techniques, for which, writing to a shared page would incur a longer access time than those non-shared. By exploiting this artifact, we demonstrate a new covert channel can be built in a virtualized environment.
