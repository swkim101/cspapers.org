This paper presents preliminary development of autonomous sensor-guided behaviors for a six-legged dynamical robot (RHex). The behaviors represent the exteroceptive closed-loop locomotion strategies for this system. Simple motion models for RHex are described and used to deploy controllers for inertial straight line locomotion and visual line following. Results are experimentally validated on the robot.
