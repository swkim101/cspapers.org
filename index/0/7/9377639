Weighted A* (WA*) is a popular search technique that scales up A* while sacrificing solution quality. Recently, researchers have proposed two variants of WA*: KWA* adds diversity to WA*, and MSC-WA* adds commitment to WA*. In this paper, we demonstrate that there is benefit in combining them. The resulting MSC-KWA* scales up to larger domains than WA*, KWA* and MSC-WA*, which is rather surprising since diversity and commitment at first glance seem to be opposing concepts.
