Botnets pose serious threats to the Internet. In spite of substantial efforts to address the issue, botnets are dramatically spreading. Bots in a botnet execute commands under the control of the botnet owner or controller. A first step in protecting against botnets is identification of their presence, and activities. In this paper, we propose a method of identifying the high-level commands executed by bots. The method uses run- time monitoring of bot execution to capture and analyze run- time call behavior. We find that bots have distinct behavior patterns when they perform pre-programmed bot commands. The patterns are characterized by sequences of common API calls at regular intervals. We demonstrate that commands aiming to achieve the same result have very similar API call behavior in bot variants, even when they are from different bot families. We implemented and evaluated a prototype of our method. Run-time monitoring is accomplished by user-level hooking. In the experiments, the proposed method successfully identified the bot commands being executed with a success rate of 97%. The ability of the method to identify bot commands despite the use of execution obfuscation is also addressed.
