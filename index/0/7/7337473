The paper discusses the findings of a study designed to increase the generalisability, validity and reliability of earlier studies concerning the relationships between attitude toward the ad and aspects of the advertising hierarchy of effects model in the online marketing context. The findings suggest that the traditional advertising hierarchy of effects model is relevant in the online marketing environment, and that investment in online marketing communication can be evaluated using this stable and reliable method. It is, however, suggested that further research is needed to improve the generalisability of the findings.
