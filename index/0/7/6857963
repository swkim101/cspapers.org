This paper describes a compositional modeling system called CDME (Collaborative Device Modeling Environment) for constructing domain theories of physical systems, composing models of devices, and simulating their behavior. We have implemented the system with the goal of encouraging sharing as well as the collaborative construction of knowledge bases describing physical domains. To maximize the chance of sharing and reuse of knowledge, CDME is implemented as a collection of network services on the World Wide Web. Knowledge is represented at three distinct levels: the physical, ontological, and logical. We describe the levels of representation, and how the system enables knowledge sharing at each level.
