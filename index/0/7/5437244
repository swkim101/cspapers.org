The paper is concerned with the design of a module system for logic programming so as to satisfy many of the requirements of software engineering. The design is based on the language Godel which is a logic programming language which already has a simple type and module system. The module system described here extends the Godel module system so as to include parameterised modules. In particular, this extended system allows general purpose predicates that depend on facts and rules for specific applications to be defined in modules that are independent of their applications.
