The Internet is moving fast to a new era where million of services and things will be available. In this way, as there will be many functionally-equivalent services for a specific user task, the service non-functional aspect should be considered for filtering and choosing the appropriate services. The related approaches in service discovery mainly concentrate on exploiting constraint solving techniques for inferring if the user non-functional requirements are satisfied by the service nonfunctional capabilities. However, as the matchmaking time is proportional to the number of non-functional service descriptions, these approaches fail to fulfill the user request in a timely manner. To this end, two alternative techniques for improving the non-functional service matchmaking time have been developed. The first one is generic as it can handle non-functional service specifications containing n-ary constraints, while the second is only applicable to unary-constrained specifications. Both techniques were experimentally evaluated. The preliminary evaluation results show that the service matchmaking time is significantly improved without compromising matchmaking accuracy.
