They have formed a new Web, Social Web and further formed social networks (SWN.) SWN generates a lot of structured and semi-structured information. This information greatly enlarges the content of Web.

These research issues have been receiving in the recent years growing attentions. SWSM2008 aimed at providing a forum for researchers from all over the world to share information on their latest investigations in SWN search, mining and its application particularly in academic research area.
