Short texts usually encounter data sparsity and ambiguity problems in representations for their lack of context. In this paper, we propose a novel method to model short texts based on semantic clustering and convolutional neural network. Particularly, we first discover semantic cliques in embedding spaces by a fast clustering algorithm. Then, multi-scale semantic units are detected under the supervision of semantic cliques, which introduce useful external knowledge for short texts. These meaningful semantic units are combined and fed into convolutional layer, followed by max-pooling operation. Experimental results on two open benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
