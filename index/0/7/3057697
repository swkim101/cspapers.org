The recent availability of human mobility traces has driven a new wave of research on human movement with straightforward applications in wireless/cellular network. In this paper we revisit the human mobility problem with new assumptions. We believe that human movement is not independent of the surrounding locations, i.e. the points of interest that they visit; most of the time people travel with specific goals in mind, visit specific points of interest, and frequently revisit favorite places. Using GPS mobility traces of a large number of users located across two distinct geographical locations we study the correlation between people's trajectories and the differently spread points of interest nearby.
