An Internet transaction is a transaction that involves communication over the Internet using standard Internet protocols such as HTTPS. Such transactions are widely used in Internet-based applications such as e-commerce. With the growth of the Internet, the volume and complexity of Internet transactions are rapidly increasing. We present data versioning techniques that can reduce the complexity of managing Internet transactions and improve their scalability and reliability. These techniques have been implemented using standard database technology, without any change in database kernel. Our initial empirical results argue for the effectiveness of these techniques in practice.
