From signal processing to drug target modeling to fixed income derivatives pricing, computer simulations have become critical tools driving the innovation economy. This session discusses the performance boost provided by using stream processors to tackle these problems. Attendees will learn how they can increase the power, space and budget efficiency of computation clusters using stream processors. Stream processors are a new class of data parallel processor architectures that offer impressive performance-per-dollar and per-watt vs. general purpose processors. Today, stream processors have not been widely used by application developers due to programming difficulty and lack of efficient application development environments. By providing a substantial increase in computing power, you'll learn how to reduce the cost of computing infrastructure, increase developer productivity and dramatically increase your competitive advantage.
