Detecting and eliminating duplicates in databases is a task of critical importance in many applications. Although solutions for traditional models, such as relational data, have been widely studied, recently there has been some focus on solutions for more complex hierarchical structures as, for instance, XML data. Such data presents many different challenges, among which is the issue of how to exploit the schema structure to determine if two objects are duplicates. In this paper, we argue that structure can indeed have a significant impact on the process of duplicate detection. We propose a novel method that automatically restructures database objects in order to take full advantage of the relations between its attributes. This new structure reflects the relative importance of the attributes in the database and avoids the need to perform a manual selection. To test our approach we applied it to an existing duplicate detection system. Experiments performed on several datasets show that, using the new learned structure, we consistently outperform both the results obtained with the original database structure and those obtained by letting a knowledgeable user manually choose the attributes to compare.
