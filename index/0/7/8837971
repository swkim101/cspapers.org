In this paper we extend previous work on the boundary-based approach to describing shape, by deriving an unbounded hierarchy of "atomic" shape descriptors (called tokens) based on tangent bearing and its successive derivatives, and incorporating angle and cusp curve features. Both open and closed curves have token-string descriptions at all levels in the hierarchy. We provide a pair of compatibility matrices for generating transition tables for any level, from which level-specific token ordering graphs that encode basic string syntax can be systematically constructed.
