The next generation of wireless networks, the 'fifth generation" or 5G, will have to cope with impressive new challenges. It includes a traffic expected to grow by up to 1000, an extremely low latency, the connection of cars, robots, smart cities, with billions of machines talking to each other and their sensors, new use of spectrum, new architectures and so on. The EU has committed â‚¬700 million of public funding over seven years to boost the research in 5G communications and a first wave of about 20 projects started this summer. The talk will address the scientific research challenges to develop 5G networks, the technology building blocks new projects are dealing with, notably as regards the Radio Access Network and the novel mobile architectures.
