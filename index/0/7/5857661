In this paper, we present an algorithm to solve the Multi-Robot Persistent Coverage Problem (MRPCP). Here, we seek to compute a schedule that will allow a fleet of agents to visit all targets of a given set while maximizing the frequency of visitation and maintaining a sufficient fuel capacity by refueling at depots. We also present a heuristic method to allow us to compute bounded suboptimal results in real time. The results produced by our algorithm will allow a team of robots to efficiently cover a given set of targets or tasks persistently over long periods of time, even when the cost to transition between tasks is dynamic.
