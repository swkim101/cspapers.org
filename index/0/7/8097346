In this paper, we develop simple models to study the performance of BitTorrent, a second generation peer-to-peer (P2P) application. We first present a simple fluid model and study the scalability, performance and efficiency of such a file-sharing mechanism. We then consider the built-in incentive mechanism of BitTorrent and study its effect on network performance. We also provide numerical results based on both simulations and real traces obtained from the Internet.
