The AFM is a common tool for ultra-precise surface characterization and a standard instrument a variety of research and development disciplines. However, the characterization of three dimensional high-aspect ratio and sidewall structures remains a hardly accomplishable task. Novel exchangeable and customizable scanning probe tips - NanoBits - can be attached to standard AFM cantilevers offering unprecedented freedom in adapting the shape and size of the tips. These NanoBits of few Î¼m size have to be assembled into micro-cartridges. This challenging assembly task is performed inside the SEM by a micro-gripper. A powerful automation framework has been developed facilitating image based automation and visual servoing for this task. Template matching, BLOB-detection, and special SEM-based detection approaches are used to achieve the automated assembly.
