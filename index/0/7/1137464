This paper describes ETK (Ensemble of Transformation-based Keys) a new algorithm for inducing search keys for name filtering. ETK has the low computational cost and ability to filter by phonetic similarity characteristic of phonetic keys such as Soundex, but is adaptable to alternative similarity models. The accuracy of ETK in a preliminary empirical evaluation suggests that it is well-suited for phonetic filtering applications such as recognizing alternative cross-lingual transliterations.
