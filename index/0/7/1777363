Our goal is to provide tools to support working meetings on an electronic whiteboard, called Tivoli. This paper describes how we have integrated structured domain objects, which represent the subject matter of meetings, into the freeform whiteboard environment. Domain objects can be tailored to produce meeting tools that are finely tuned to meeting practices. We describe the language for defining domain objects and show examples of meeting tools that have been built with the language. We show that the system can interpret the spatial relationships of domain objects on the whiteboard to encode the meanings of the spatial arrangements, and we describe the computational mechanisms. We discuss some of the design principles for tailoring gestures for domain objects. Finally, we enumerate the techniques we have used to integrate the structured objects into the freeform whiteboard environment.
