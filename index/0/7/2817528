Over the last fifty years, the “Big Five” model of personality traits has become a standard in psychology, and research has systematically documented correlations between a wide range of linguistic variables and the Big Five traits. A distinct line of research has explored methods for automatically generating language that varies along personality dimensions. We present PERSONAGE (PERSONAlity GEnerator), the first highly parametrizable language generator for extraversion, an important aspect of personality. We evaluate two personality generation methods: (1) direct generation with particular parameter settings suggested by the psychology literature; and (2) overgeneration and selection using statistical models trained from judge’s ratings. Results show that both methods reliably generate utterances that vary along the extraversion dimension, according to human judges.
