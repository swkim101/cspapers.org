As modern 64-bit x86 processors no longer support the segmentation capabilities of their 32-bit predecessors, most research projects assume that strong in-process memory isolation is no longer an affordable option. Instead of strong, deterministic isolation, new defense systems therefore rely on the probabilistic pseudo-isolation provided by randomization to "hide" sensitive (or safe) regions. However, recent attacks have shown that such protection is insufficient; attackers can leak these safe regions in a variety of ways. In this paper, we revisit isolation for x86-64 and argue that hardware features enabling efficient deterministic isolation do exist. We first present a comprehensive study on commodity hardware features that can be repurposed to isolate safe regions in the same address space (e.g., Intel MPX and MPK). We then introduce MemSentry, a framework to harden modern defense systems with commodity hardware features instead of information hiding. Our results show that some hardware features are more effective than others in hardening such defenses in each scenario and that features originally conceived for other purposes (e.g., Intel MPX for bounds checking) are surprisingly efficient at isolating safe regions compared to their software equivalent (i.e., SFI).
