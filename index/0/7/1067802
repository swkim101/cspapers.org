In this paper, we investigate how offline advertising, by means of TV and radio, influences online search engine advertisement. Our research is based on the search engine-driven conversion actions of a 2012 marketing campaign of the potato chips manufacturer Lays. In our analysis we use several models, including linear regression (linear model) and Support Vector Regression (non-linear model). Our results confirm that offline commercials have a positive effect on the number of conversion actions from online marketing campaigns. This effect is especially visible in the first 50 minutes after the advertisement broadcasting.
