Political campaigning and the corresponding advertisement money are increasingly moving online. Some analysts claim that the U.S.~elections were partly won through a smart use of (i) targeted advertising and (ii) social media. But what type of information do politicized users consume online? And, the other way around, for a given content, e.g. a YouTube video, is it possible to predict its political audience? To address this latter question, we present a large scale study of anonymous YouTube video consumption of politicized users, where political orientation is derived from visits to "beacon pages", namely, political partisan blogs. Though our techniques are relevant for targeted political advertising, we believe that our findings are also of a wider interest.
