As both a user of public domain CAD software and a supplier of CAD software to the government, I am interested in obtaining and supplying such software as efficiently as possible. I feel that the U. S. Government, by taking three relatively inexpensive actions, can increase the CAD productivity of companies in the defense industry.
 First, a set of standard data interchange formats should be specified and made into industry standards.
 Second, once these standards are developed, actions should be taken to enforce them.
 Third, a central “database” of CAD software available for a fee or in the public domain should be established.
 These three steps can be implemented at a reasonably small cost, yet would provide large cost savings to government contractors. The long term benefit to the government will be that labor and money spent in modeling devices, reformatting data, and duplicating existing capabilities can be spent on more productive efforts.
