As the CMOS feature enters the era of extreme scaling (14nm, 11nm and beyond), manufacturability challenges are exacerbated. The nanopatterning through the 193nm lithography is being pushed to its limit, through double/triple or more general multiple patterning, while non-conventional lithography technologies such as extreme ultra-violet (EUV), e-beam direct-write (EBDW), and so on, still have grand challenges to be solved for their adoption into IC volume production. This tutorial will provide an overview of key overarching issues in nanometer IC design for manufacturability (DFM) with these emerging lithography technologies, from modeling, mask synthesis, to physical design and beyond.
