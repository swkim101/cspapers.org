Int#ra-operator (or partitioned) parallelism is a well-established mechanism for achieving high performance in parallel database systems. However, the problem of how to exploit intra-operator parallelism in a multi-query environment is not well underst,ood. This paper presents a detailed performance evaluation of several algorithms for managing intra-operator parallelism in a parallel database system. A dynamic scheme based on the concept of matching the ra.te of flow of tuples between operat,ors is shown to perform well on a variety of workloads and configurations.
