(MATH) We prove that Minimu Vertex Cover on 4-regular hyper-graphs (or in other words, Minimum Hitting Set where all sets have size exactly 4), is hard to approximate within $2 - ε. We also prove that the maximization version, in which we are allowed to pick <i>B</i> = <i>pn</i> elements in an <i>n</i>-vertex hyper-graph, and are asked to cover as many edges as possible, is hard to approximate within 1/(1 — (1—p)<sup>4</sup>) - ε when <i>p</i> &rhoe; 1/2 and within ((1—<i>p</i>)<sup>4</sup> + <i>p</i><sup>4</sup>)/(1 &mdadsh; (1—<i>p</i>)<sup>4</sup>) — ε when <i>p</i> ξ 1/2. From this follows that the general problem when <i>B</i> is part of the input is hard to approximate within 16/15 - ε.
