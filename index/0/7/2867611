Event extraction is the task of detecting certain specified types of events that are mentioned in the source language data. The state-of-the-art research on the task is transductive inference (e.g. cross-event inference). In this paper, we propose a new method of event extraction by well using cross-entity inference. In contrast to previous inference methods, we regard entity-type consistency as key feature to predict event mentions. We adopt this inference method to improve the traditional sentence-level event extraction system. Experiments show that we can get 8.6% gain in trigger (event) identification, and more than 11.8% gain for argument (role) classification in ACE event extraction.
