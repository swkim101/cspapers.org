The maximum agreement subtree problem is the following. Given two rooted trees whose leaves are drawn from the same set of items (e.g., species), find the largest subset of these items so that the portions of the two trees restricted to these items are isomorphic. We consider the case which occurs frequently in practice, i.e., the case when the trees are binary, and give an O(nlog n) time algorithm for this problem.
