The BUBBLE program generates relationship diagrams from a list of elements (rooms, peoples, functions, etc.) and a relationship matrix between these elements which specifies desirable distances. Every element is considered as a point in 2-D space in which vectors approximating the specified distances are applied. An equilibrium state is reached after a few iterations. Because the program can also take into account the size of elements and their orientation, it is a useful tool in preliminary architectural layout. The layout problem is described and the BUBBLE approach is stated and compared with other layout techniques such as enumeration, hill-climbing, build-up models, a detailed description of the algorithm is supplied. Some examples are discussed. Test-cases describe the efficiency and the limits of the approach. The program is currently being used by students in architecture to help them gain insight on using relationship matrices to solve preliminary layout problems.
