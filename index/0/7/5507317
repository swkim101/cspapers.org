This paper considers space-efficient data structures for storing an approximation <i>S'</i> to a set <i>S</i> such that <i>S</i> ⊆ <i>S'</i> and any element not in <i>S</i> belongs to <i>S'</i> with probability at most ∈. The <i>Bloom filter</i> data structure, solving this problem, has found widespread use. Our main result is a new RAM data structure that improves Bloom filters in several ways:• The time for looking up an element in <i>S'</i> is <i>O</i>(1), <i>independent of ∈.</i>• The space usage is within a lower order term of the lower bound.• The data structure uses <i>explicit</i> hash function families.• The data structure supports insertions <i>and deletions on S</i> in amortized expected constant time.The main technical ingredient is a succinct representation of dynamic multisets. We also consider three recent generalizations of Bloom filters.
