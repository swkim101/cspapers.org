Do you teach or are you interested in teaching digital media? Do you work in a digital media degree program or department? This BOF will explore different ways of merging computer science and the arts. We invite you to apply to attend our creative, collaborative Computing in the Arts community of CS educators this summer at our NSF-funded faculty workshop. Additionally, we want to learn what you teach in digital media, and how your program is structured. Is it part of Computer Science, Art, Mass Communications, New Media, or something else? High schools in many states require no computing education beyond studying office suite software. However, these same students are experienced and enthusiastic digital media users. Computing in the Arts degree programs can harness this interest and experience, facilitating both critical and creative thinking. Computing theory and practice can be applied in art and, at the same time, be informed by artistic concepts and methods. Moreover, art theory and practice can be enriched by computational methods and techniques.
