In this note, we present first linear time algorithms for computing the center and the diameter of several classes of face regular plane graphs: triangulations with inner vertices of degree ≥ 6, quadrangulations with inner vertices of degree ≥ 4 and the subgraphs of the regular hexagonal grid bounded by a simple circuit of this grid.
