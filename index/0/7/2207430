Pedestrian detection is a well-studied problem. Even though many datasets contain challenging case studies, the performances of new methods are often only reported on cases of reasonable difficulty. In particular, the issue of small scale pedestrian detection is seldom considered. In this paper, we focus on the detection of small scale pedestrians, i.e., those that are at far distance from the camera. We show that classical features used for pedestrian detection are not well suited for our case of study. Instead, we propose a convolutional neural network based method to learn the features with an end-to-end approach. Experiments on the Caltech Pedestrian Detection Benchmark showed that we outperformed existing methods by more than 10% in terms of log-average miss rate.
