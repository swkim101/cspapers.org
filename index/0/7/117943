Based on the research done in the last decade, attempts have been made to propose description logics as unifying formalisms for the various class-based representation languages used in different areas. These attempts have made apparent that sound, complete, and decidable description logics still suffer from several limitations, regarding modeling classes of aggregate objects, expressing general inclusion axioms, and the ability of navigating links between classes. In this paper we make description logics accomplish the necessary leap in order to become suitable for the new challenging applications they are faced with. In particular, we propose a powerful description logic overcoming the above limitations and we show that its reasoning tasks are decidable in worst case exponential time.
