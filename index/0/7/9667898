Hinton [6] proposed that generalization in artificial neural nets should improve if nets learn to represent the domain's underlying regularities. Abu-Mustafa's hints work [1] shows that the outputs of a backprop net can be used as inputs through which domain-specific information can be given to the net. We extend these ideas by showing that a backprop net learning many related tasks at the same time can use these tasks as inductive bias for each other and thus learn better. We identify five mechanisms by which multitask backprop improves generalization and give empirical evidence that multitask backprop generalizes better in real domains.
