Given an <i>n</i>-vertex graph <i>G</i>, a <i>drawing</i> of <i>G</i> in the plane is a mapping of its vertices into points of the plane, and its edges into continuous curves, connecting the images of their endpoints. A <i>crossing</i> in such a drawing is a point where two such curves intersect. In the Minimum Crossing Number problem, the goal is to find a drawing of <i>G</i> with minimum number of crossings. The value of the optimal solution, denoted by OPT, is called the graph's <i>crossing number</i>. This is a very basic problem in topological graph theory, that has received a significant amount of attention, but is still poorly understood algorithmically. The best currently known efficient algorithm produces drawings with <i>O</i>(log<sup>2</sup> <i>n</i>)·(<i>n</i> + OPT) crossings on bounded-degree graphs, while only a constant factor hardness of approximation is known. A closely related problem is Minimum Planarization, in which the goal is to remove a minimum-cardinality subset of edges from <i>G</i>, such that the remaining graph is planar.
 Our main technical result establishes the following connection between the two problems: if we are given a solution of cost <i>k</i> to the Minimum Planarization problem on graph <i>G</i>, then we can efficiently find a drawing of <i>G</i> with at most poly(<i>d</i>) · <i>k</i> · (<i>k</i> + OPT) crossings, where <i>d</i> is the maximum degree in <i>G.</i> This result implies an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> · poly(<i>d</i>) · log<sup>3/2</sup> <i>n</i>)-approximation for Minimum Crossing Number, as well as improved algorithms for special cases of the problem, such as, for example, <i>k</i>-apex and bounded-genus graphs.
