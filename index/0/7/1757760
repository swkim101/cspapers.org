Energy efficiency is a common requirement for most WSN applications. We present our approach utilizing precise distributed monitoring of energy consumption to support the development of energy efficient protocols. There-fore we designed dedicated energy monitoring and management hardware for a wireless sensor network testbed. In our demonstration we show distributed energy measurement in a typical sensor network application based on an area monitoring scenario.
