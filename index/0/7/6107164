Location-dependent applications are becoming very popular in mobile environments. To improve system performance and facilitate disconnection, caching is crucial to such applications. In this paper, a semantic caching scheme is used to access location dependent data in mobile computing. We first develop a mobility model to represent the moving behaviors of mobile users and formally define location dependent queries. We then investigate query processing and cache management strategies. The performance of the semantic caching scheme and its replacement strategy FAR is evaluated through a simulation study. Our results show that semantic caching is more flexible and effective for use in LDD applications than page caching, whose performance is quite sensitive to the database physical organization. We also notice that the semantic cache replacement strategy FAR, which utilizes the semantic locality in terms of locations, performs robustly under different kinds of workloads.
