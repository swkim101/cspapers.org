A file directory is a listing of information of the files available to the users of the distributed data base in a computer network. Such a directory will enable a user at any node to determine where in a network a specific sharable file exists. One can consider such a directory to be similar to a card catalogue in a public library. Users at each node may offer to list their files in this directory of public files for sharing purposes. A user may interrogate this list to determine its contents or obtain information on where a specific sharable file exists. The nonshared files is assumed to be stored at the computer that is known to the user and therefore is not considered here. We assume each computer has its own local directory which consists of all the sharable files stored in that computer. To search for a file that is not stored in a local computer, the user must consult the file directory.
