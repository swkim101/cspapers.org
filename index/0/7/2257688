This paper presents PATTY: a large resource for textual patterns that denote binary relations between entities. The patterns are semantically typed and organized into a subsumption taxonomy. The PATTY system is based on efficient algorithms for frequent itemset mining and can process Web-scale corpora. It harnesses the rich type system and entity population of large knowledge bases. The PATTY taxonomy comprises 350,569 pattern synsets. Random-sampling-based evaluation shows a pattern accuracy of 84.7%. PATTY has 8,162 subsumptions, with a random-sampling-based precision of 75%. The PATTY resource is freely available for interactive access and download.
