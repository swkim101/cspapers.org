The IEEE 802.16e mobile WiMAX system may not be quite suitable in some applications where the uplink (UL) requires higher transmission rate than the downlink (DL). In particular, many cases in military applications often require higher transmission rate in the uplink. In this paper, we propose a new mobile WiMAX scheme that provides the DL to UL ratio (DUR) to be 9:33 by modify the frame structure. Fading channels for the modified mobile WiMAX system are presented. We evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance and compare the throughput at the different DUR.
