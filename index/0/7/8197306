The paper describes a method of fault-tolerant adaptive gait generation based on CPG controller with interlimb coordination for multi-limbed working robot. Multi-limbed robot is expected to work in dangerous, complicated narrow spaces, where human workers cannot reach. However, if one of the limbs is broken in the dangerous/narrow working space, human operators cannot go to the space to repair it. Even in these situations, the proposed method generates a new gait adaptively using the remaining usable limbs depending on the current situation of the multi-limbed robot. This fault-tolerant ability is effective for multi-limbed robots working in dangerous/narrow space. The method is implemented to a model of a multi-limbed robot “ASTERISK” in a dynamical simulator (ODE). Experimental results show effectiveness of the proposed method.
