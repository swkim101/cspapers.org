Feature structures are informational elements that have been used in several linguistic theories and in computational systems for natural-language processing. A logical calculus has been developed and used as a description language for feature structures. In the present work, a framework in three-valued logic is suggested for defining the semantics of a feature structure description language, allowing for a more complete set of logical operators. In particular, the semantics of the negation and implication operators are examined. Various proposed interpretations of negation and implication are compared within the suggested framework. One particular interpretation of the description language with a negation operator is described and its computational aspects studied.
