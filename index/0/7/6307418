However, constructing such large-scale fully-labeled datasets generally requires painstaking manual effort. One possible solution to this problem is to employ community contributed text tags as weak labels, however, the concepts underlying a single text tag strongly depends on the users. We instead present a new paradigm for learning discriminative features by making full use of the human curation process on social networking services (SNSs). During the process of content curation, SNS users collect content items manually from various sources and group them by context, all for their own benefit. Due to the nature of this process, we can assume that (1) content items in the same group share the same semantic concept and (2) groups sharing the same images might have related semantic concepts. Through these insights, we can define human curated groups as weak labels from which our proposed framework can learn discriminative features as a representation in the space of semantic concepts the users intended when creating the groups. We show that this feature learning can be formulated as a problem of link prediction for a bipartite graph whose nodes corresponds to content items and human curated groups, and propose a novel method for feature learning based on sparse coding or network fine-tuning.
