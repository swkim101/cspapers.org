We present a system, ConEx, for monitoring query execution in a relational database management system. ConEx offers a unified view of query execution, providing continuous visual feedback on the progress of the query, and the status of operators in the query evaluation plan. It incorporates novel techniques to dynamically estimate important parameters affecting query progress efficiently. We describe the design and features of ConEx, and discuss its technology.
