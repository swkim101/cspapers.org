This paper examines the system dynamics of a networked multi-agent system, operating with a consensus-type algorithm, that can be influenced by external agents. We refer to this class of networks as semi-autonomous. We introduce a control scheme for such semi-autonomous networks, involving excitation of the network by the external agents, with the objective of manipulating or steering the network. In this context, we consider the situation where the external agents deliver a constant mean control signal. We proceed to examine the resultant mean and covariance of the network output and relate these quantities to circuit-theoretic notions of the network, quantifying the network's amenability to external signals. Four protocols for tree graphs, to promote and deter convergence and to increase and reduce average variance within the network are then presented. These protocols involve decentralized local edge swaps that can be performed in parallel and asynchronously.
