We propose a novel data augmentation approach to enhance computational behavioral analysis using social media text. In particular, we collect a Twitter corpus of the descriptions of annoying behaviors using the #petpeeve hashtags. In the qualitative analysis, we study the language use in these tweets, with a special focus on the fine-grained categories and the geographic variation of the language. In quantitative analysis, we show that lexical and syntactic features are useful for automatic categorization of annoying behaviors, and frame-semantic features further boost the performance; that leveraging large lexical embeddings to create additional training instances significantly improves the lexical model; and incorporating frame-semantic embedding achieves the best overall performance.
