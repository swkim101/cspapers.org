We know that students bring diverse experiences and an assortment of learning styles into our classrooms. We greet them and hand out a syllabus listing the required textbook(s). One size does not fit all when it comes to textbooks. In this session, participants will discover teaching activities that can be used to supplement any computer science textbook. These activities include human modeling and role playing, interactive whiteboard activities, case studies, class projects, games, and more. By exploring "extra" activities not found in most textbooks, participants will learn how these hands-on, interesting and fun activities can help students understand the topics listed in the AP Computer Science A Course Description: Object-oriented Program Design, Program Implementation, Program Analysis, Standard Data Structures, Standard Algorithms, and Computing in Context. Student attention spans seem to be getting shorter. The panelists found themselves spending more and more time searching for and/or developing supplemental resources in efforts to reach and retain students. Members of the AP Computer Science-A Development Committee will share these resources and lead a discussion of proven strategies and lesson ideas for teaching outside the textbook.
