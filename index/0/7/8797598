Do improvements in system performance demonstrated by batch evaluations confer the same benefit for real users? We carried out experiments designed to investigate this question. After identifying a weighting scheme that gave maximum improvement over the baseline in a non-interactive evaluation, we used it with real users searching on an instance recall task. Our results showed the weighting scheme giving beneficial results in batch studies did not do so with real users. Further analysis did identify other factors predictive of instance recall, including number of documents saved by the user, document recall, and number of documents seen by the user.
