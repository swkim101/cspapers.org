We show how to instantiate an existing framework for Open Objects to support a case-study for the Internet of Things. The resulting prototype illustrates the feasibility of the framework for a particular class of applications where physical objects with computational capabilities can collaborate in a decentralised manner. The framework described forms an initial step towards End-User Development on such complex distributed environments.
