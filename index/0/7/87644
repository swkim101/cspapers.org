We propose an approach for emptying of bin using a combination of Image and Range sensor. Offering a complete solution: calibration, segmentation and pose estimation, along with approachability analysis for the estimated pose. The work is novel in the sense that the objects to be picked are featureless and uniformly black in colour, hence existing approaches are not directly applicable. A key point involves optimal utilization of range data acquired from the laser scanner for 3-D segmentation using localized geometric information. This information guides segmentation of the image for better object pose estimation, used for pick-and-drop. We analytically assure the approachability of the object to avoid collision of the manipulator with the bin. Disturbance of objects caused during pick up has been modelled, which allows pickup of multiple pellets based on information from a single range scan. This eliminates the necessity of repeated scanning and data conditioning. The proposed method offers high object detection rate and pose estimation accuracy. The innovative techniques aimed at reducing the average pickup time makes it suitable for robust industrial operation.
