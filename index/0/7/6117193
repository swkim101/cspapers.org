When people talk to each other, they nod and change their facial expression while listening to each other in response to what the other says. Neonates are also observed to respond to their mother's voice in this way. Facial reactions to speech therefore appear to be an essential part of communication, and this reaction mechanism is adaptable to facilitate human-computer information exchange. We have reported a voice-reactive system that, with timing that simulates a human being's nodding, turns a level meter lamp on and off in response to speech input, demonstrating that visual feedback can be effective in assisting smooth speech input.
