Most attempts to integrate FrameNet in NLP systems have so far failed because of its limited coverage. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of distributional and WordNet-based models on the task of lexical unit induction, i.e. the expansion of FrameNet with new lexical units. Experimental results show that our distributional and WordNet-based models achieve good level of accuracy and coverage, especially when combined.
