Millennial students (those born after 1982), particularly African Americans and women, have demonstrated a propensity toward collaborative activities. We conducted a collective case study at North Carolina State University and North Carolina A&T to ascertain the role of collaboration and social interaction in attracting and retaining students in information technology. Responses from semi-structured interviews with 11 representative African American students in these classes were coded and analyzed. The responses from these minority students were used to evolve a social interaction model. The conjectures generated from the model suggest that pair programming and agile software methodologies effectively create a collaborative environment that is desirable to Millennial students, male and female, and, with the new evidence, minority and majority. Additionally, the African American Millennial students enjoy learning from their peers and believe that a collaborative environment better prepares them for the "real world".
