Graphical relationships among Web pages have been exploited inmethods for ranking search results. To date, specific graphicalproperties have been used in these analyses. We introduce a WebProjection methodology that generalizes prior efforts of graphicalrelationships of the web in several ways. With the approach, wecreate subgraphs by projecting sets of pages and domains onto thelarger web graph, and then use machine learning to constructpredictive models that consider graphical properties as evidence. Wedescribe the method and then present experiments that illustrate theconstruction of predictive models of search result quality and userquery reformulation.
