The scope of this paper is the modeling, identification and compensation of multivariable creep in piezoelectric actuators. Based on the inverse multiplicative scheme, we propose an approach to model and reduce the creep when the actuators have multiple degrees of freedom. The approach is simple to compute and easy to implement. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach on piezoelectric actuators.
