This survey paper reviews a large sample of publications on the teaching of discrete structures and discrete mathematics in computer science curricula. The approach is systematic, in that a structured search of electronic resources has been conducted, and the results are presented and quantitatively analyzed. A number of broad themes in discrete structures education are identified relating to course content, teaching strategies and the means of evaluating the success of a course.
