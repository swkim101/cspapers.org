We report on an examination of work practice in a knowledge-based, document-intensive organization and describe the role of paper in that work. We show how such an examination can provide a resource for (1) the determination of system design modifications that can be undertaken in the short term; (2) the determination of entirely new systems design requiring longer term research and development; and (3) helping to specify where paper will continue to he used in future document-related work practice.
