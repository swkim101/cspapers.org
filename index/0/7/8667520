In this demo, we present RichReview, a multi-modal peer discussion system, implemented as an XBlock in the edX courseware platform. The system brings richness similar to face-to-face communication into online learning at scale. With this demonstration, we discuss the system?s scalable back-end architecture, semantic voice editing user interface, and a future research plan for the profile based group-assignment scheme.
