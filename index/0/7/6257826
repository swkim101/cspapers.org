In this study, an experimental introductory CS course was implemented focusing on two pedagogic factors: the use of App Inventor for Android (AIA), a visual blocks programming environment for creating smart phone applications; and the adoption of studio-based learning (SBL) as the main teaching methodology. Participants included 18 non-CS major undergraduates. The Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) was implemented at several stages. With the exception of the Peer Learning scale in the mid-MSLQ, all participants scored in the high range in the three MSLQs. Results indicated that participants were comfortable collaborating with peers and asking questions. Additional data were collected from entry and exit interviews as well as student-created mind maps. The study revealed positive student response to the pedagogic factors and positive attitudes towards CS, and the subjects also demonstrated significant academic achievement. The experimental approach was found to have a positive effect on students' motivation, creativity, achievement, and attitude towards CS.
