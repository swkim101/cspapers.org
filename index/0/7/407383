Online Curriculum Portals aim to support networks of instructors and learners by providing a space of convergence for enhancing peer-to-peer learning interactions among individuals of an educational institution. To this end, effective, open and scalable e-learning systems are required to acquire, store, and share knowledge under the form of learning objects (LO). In this paper, we are interested in exploiting the semantic relationships that characterize these LOs (e.g., prerequisite, part-of or see-also) in order to capture and access individual and group knowledge in conjunction with the learning processes supported by educational institutions. To achieve this functionality, Semantic Web (e.g., RDF/s) and declarative query languages (e.g., RQL) are employed to represent LOs and their relationships (e.g., LOM), as well as, to support navigation at the conceptual e-learning Portal space. In this way, different LOs could be presented to the same learners, according to the traversed schema navigation paths (i.e., learning paths). Using the Apache Jetspeed framework we are able to generate and assemble at run-time portlets (i.e., pluggable web components) for visualizing personalized views as dynamic web pages. Last but not least, both learners and instructors can employ the same Portal GUI for updating semantically described LOs and thus support an open-ended continuum of learning. To the best of our knowledge, the work presented in this paper is the first Online Curriculum Portal platform supporting the aforementioned functionality.
