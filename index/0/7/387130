In biology, the construction of plasmids is a routine technique, yet under-optimal, expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we model the Plasmid Cloning Problem (PCP) in constraint programing, in order to optimize the construction of plasmids. Our technique uses a new propagator for the AtMostNVector constraint. This constraint allows the design of strategies for constructing multiple plasmids at the same time. Our approach recommends the smallest number of different cloning steps, while selecting the most efficient steps. It provides optimal strategies for real instances in gene therapy for retinal blinding diseases.
