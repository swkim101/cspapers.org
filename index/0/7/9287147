A methodology is formulated for determining if a microprocessor-based specialized system is practical for the solution of a problem in an application. This methodology is followed in the description and justification of of a back-end system for use with a statistical database system. The functions to be performed by the back-end system include those related to attribute partitioning, compression, and data access. It is shown that the system designed (the Microprocessor Assist System) will be costeffective in increasing the performance of a statistical data management system.
