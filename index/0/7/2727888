A weakly-supervised extraction method identifies concepts within conceptual hierarchies, at the appropriate level of specificity (e.g., Bank vs. Institution), to which attributes (e.g., routing number) extracted from unstructured text best apply. The extraction exploits labeled classes of instances acquired from a combination of Web documents and query logs, and inserted into existing conceptual hierarchies. The correct concept is identified within the top three positions on average over gold-standard attributes, which corresponds to higher accuracy than in alternative experiments.
