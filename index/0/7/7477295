This paper presents two extensions for XQuery. The first extension allows the definition and processing of different kinds of windows over an input sequence; i.e., tumbling, sliding, and landmark windows. The second extension extends the XQuery data model (XDM) to support infinite sequences. This extension makes it possible to use XQuery as a language for continuous queries. Both extensions have been integrated into a Java-based open source XQuery engine. This paper gives details of this implementation and presents the results of running the Linear Road benchmark on the extended XQuery engine.
