The objectives of the workshop cover perspectives on Web Engineering, navigation and adaptivity, design aspects, acceptance criteria for Web-based systems, development and management of Web-based systems, Web metrics and case studies. Researchers and practitioners interested in WebApps development were invited to submit papers describing their work and methodological approaches to WebApps development. Each submission was reviewed by at least two members of the Programme Committee. The selected papers will be presented by the speakers and will form the basis of discussions all round. The workshop will close with a panel discussion.
