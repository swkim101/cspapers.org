While the theoretical possibilities of metacomputing, in the sense of “heterogeneous supercomputing using WANs”, are obvious, it is difficult to utilize this potential in practice. In this paper, a programming model and communication library are presented which enable an efficient distribution of applications on a metacomputer. This is achieved by communication optimizations and a good load balance even for linked computers with considerably different computational speeds. First practical results show the benefits of the optimizations.
