Programming projects are widely used in CS1 classes to develop students' coding skills. To improve the learning impact of these projects, we propose and study a special project format named two-stage project in an introductory computer science course. For the first stage, students submit their programming projects individually followed by a second stage where they are paired to work on the same project in order to create an improved solution. Through peer collaboration, students review each other's work from the first stage, and write correctly-styled, well-documented, and more thoroughly tested code during the second stage. We used isomorphic assessments before and after the second stage of a project to measure students' understanding of the course material. Results indicate that two-stage projects tend to improve student understanding of course learning objectives. We also studied students' perceptions and experiences with two-stage projects, and their confidence toward computing. Students liked working on two-stage projects because they saw new ways to approach the same problem, and they liked discussions with their peers.
