We show that the traveling salesman problem with triangle inequality cannot be approximated within ~0 when the edge lengths are allowed to be asymmetric and within 12_~9 z2s when the edge lengths are symmetric. The best previous 2s05 _ j 53s1 respectively. The reduction lower bounds were ~ ~ttt is from HÂ£stad's maximum satisfiability of linear equations modulo 2, and is nonconstructive.
