We address the problem of transferring grasp knowledge across objects and tasks. This means dealing with two important issues: 1) the induction of possible transfers, i.e., whether a given object affords a given task, and 2) the planning of a grasp that will allow the robot to fulfill the task. The induction of object affordances is approached by abstracting the sensory input of an object as a set of attributes that the agent can reason about through similarity and proximity. For grasp execution, we combine a part-based grasp planner with a model of task constraints. The task constraint model indicates areas of the object that the robot can grasp to execute the task. Within these areas, the part-based planner finds a hand placement that is compatible with the object shape. The key contribution is the ability to transfer task parameters across objects while the part-based grasp planner allows for transferring grasp information across tasks. As a result, the robot is able to synthesize plans for previously unobserved task/object combinations. We illustrate our approach with experiments conducted on a real robot.
