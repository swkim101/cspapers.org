We present a classification of synchronization delays inherent in multiprocessor systems programmed using the monitor paradigm. This characterization is useful in relating performance of such systems to algorithmic parameters in subproblems such as domain decomposition. We apply this approach to a parallel, adaptive grid code for solving the equations of one-dimensional gas dynamics implemented on shared memory multiprocessors such as the Encore Multimax.
