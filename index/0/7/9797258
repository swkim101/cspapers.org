We present DITTO, an automatic incrementalizer for dynamic, side-effect-free data structure invariant checks. Incrementalization speeds up the execution of a check by reusing its previous executions, checking the invariant anew only the changed parts of the data structure. DITTO exploits properties specific to the domain of invariant checks to automate and simplify the process without restricting what mutations the program can perform. Our incrementalizer works for modern imperative languages such as Java and C#. It can incrementalize,for example, verification of red-black tree properties and the consistency of the hash code in a hash table bucket. Our source-to-source implementation for Java is automatic, portable, and efficient. DITTO provides speedups on data structures with as few as 100 elements; on larger data structures, its speedups are characteristic of non-automatic incrementalizers: roughly 5-fold at 5,000 elements,and growing linearly with data structure size.
