This paper presents a novel form of dynamically constructed Bayes net, developed for multi-domain sketch recognition. Our sketch recognition engine integrates shape information and domain knowledge to improve recognition accuracy across a variety of domains using an extendible, hierarchical approach. Our Bayes net framework integrates the influence of stroke data and domain-specific context in recognition, enabling our recognition engine to handle noisy input. We illustrate this behavior with qualitative and quantitative results in two domains: hand-drawn family trees and circuits.
