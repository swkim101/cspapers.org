We introduce a novel method for grammatical error correction with a number of small corpora. To make the best use of several corpora with different characteristics, we employ a meta-learning with several base classifiers trained on different corpora. This research focuses on a grammatical error correction task for article errors. A series of experiments is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two different grammatical error tagged corpora.
