In this paper, we aim to study how the performance of modern answer set programming (ASP) solvers is inﬂuenced by the treewidth of the input program and to investigate the consequences of this relationship. We ﬁrst perform an experimental evaluation that shows that the solving performance is heavily inﬂuenced by the treewidth, given ground input programs that are otherwise uniform, both in size and construction. This observation leads to an important question for ASP, namely, how to design encodings such that the treewidth of the resulting ground program remains small. To this end, we deﬁne the class of connection-guarded programs, which guarantees that the treewidth of the program after grounding only depends on the treewidth (and the degree) of the input instance. In order to obtain this result, we formalize the grounding process using MSO transductions.
