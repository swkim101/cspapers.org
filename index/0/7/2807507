Several research networks around the world are implementing hybrid networks, that provide end-users with traditional routed IP together with lightpaths. These paths are dynamically configured at user request and network provisioning systems must have topology information, both intra- and inter-domain.We developed the Network Description Language (NDL), based on RDF, a semantic web technique. This language can be used to describe hybrid networks, so that different administrative domains can share and correlate topology information. It supports the end-user to express a lightpath reservation request, and helps the service provider to validate the feasibility of requests. It facilitates generation and exchange of network maps by allowing automatic correlation of information across domains.Our first application ground is GLIF, a collaboration promoting co-operation for Lambda Networking. Several tools for automatic provisioning are in development. However, these tools lack a common network description, which NDL can provide.
