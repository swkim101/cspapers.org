This paper describes a control strategy to achieve high fidelity dynamics simulation rendered on admittance controlled robotic facilities. It explores the reasons for an increasing energy found in the virtual dynamics of a free-floating satellite rendered on a six degree of freedom robot, which can lead the system to become unstable and proposes a method to cope with it. The proposed method identifies the sources of intrinsic instability provoked by time delays that are found in the computational loop of the rendered dynamics and counteracts their destabilizing effects using the passivity criteria. The performance of the system and the benefits of the method are shown in simulations and are verified experimentally.
