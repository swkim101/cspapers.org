There is a wide divergence of opinion as to the appropriate content for an introductory computer science course. Approaches to teaching the subject range from “computer appreciation” presentations to rigorous courses for computer science majors. This paper presents the thesis that computer science has reached a level of maturity which allows it to be presented in a stimulating and intellectually honest manner to liberal arts students regardless of their majors, and that such a course is an important, almost essential, part of the curriculum for such students. A rationale for this view will be presented, and a course conforming to the rationale will be described.
 In many liberal arts institutions, including mine, any subject which may be related to technology is regarded with suspicion; and zealous efforts are made to avoid contamination of the curriculum with unsuitable courses having a technological base. Because the rationale for the course seems to satisfy my colleagues in the more humanistic subjects, it is presented in some detail here for its possible value in other institutions.
