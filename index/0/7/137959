We show that any concurrent zero-knowledge protocol for a non-trivial language (i.e., for a language outside $\BPP$), whose security is proven via black-box simulation, must use at least \tilde&OHgr;(log n) rounds of interaction. This result substantially improves over previous lower bounds, and is the first bound to rule out the possibility of constant-round black-box concurrent zero-knowledge. Furthermore, the bound is polynomially related to the number of rounds in the best known concurrent zero-knowledge protocol for languages in ~$\NP$.
