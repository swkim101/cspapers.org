A Boolean function of <i>n</i> bits is balanced if it takes the value 1 with probability 1⁄2. We exhibit a balanced Boolean function with a randomized evaluation procedure (with probability 0 of making a mistake) so that on uniformly random inputs, no input bit is read with probability more than Θ(<i>n</i><sup>-1/2</sup>√ log <i>n</i>). We construct a balanced monotone Boolean function and a randomized algorithm computing it for which each bit is read with probability Θ(<i>n</i><sup>-1⁄3</sup> log <i>n</i>). We then show that for any randomized algorithm for evaluating a balanced Boolean function, when the input bits are uniformly random, there is some input bit that is read with probability at least Θ(<i>n</i><sup>-1𔊪)</sup>. For balanced monotone Boolean functions, there is some input bit that is read with probability at least Θ(<i>n</i><sup>-1𔊫</sup>).
