These datasets are characterized by theirsize, particularly their width (millions of features per data input). Specifically, we address the problem of detecting subtle, short-term changes inneural structure that are indicative of cognitive change and correlate withrisk factors for Alzheimer's disease. We introduce a new spatially-sensitivekernel that allows us to reason about individuals, as opposed to populations. In doing so, this paper presents the first evidence demonstrating that verysmall changes in white matter structure over a two year period can predictchange in cognitive function in healthy adults.
