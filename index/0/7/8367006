We prove a lower bound of <italic>4.5n - o(n)</italic> for the circuit complexity of an explicit Boolean function (that is, a function constructible in deterministic polynomial time), over the basis <italic>U_2</italic>. That is, we obtain a lower bound of <italic>4.5n - o(n)</italic> for the number of <italic>{and,or}</italic> gates needed to compute a certain Boolean function, over the basis <italic>{and,or,not}</italic> (where the <italic>not</italic> gates are not counted). Our proof is based on a new combinatorial property of Boolean functions, called <italic>Strongly-Two-Dependence</italic>, a notion that may be interesting in its own right. Our lower bound applies to any Strongly-Two-Dependent Boolean function.
