The term "machine-readable dictionary" can clearly be taken in two ways. In its stronger and better established interpretation, it presumably refers to dictionaries intended for machine consumption and use as in a language processing system of some sort. In a somewhat weaker sense, it has to do with dictionaries intended for human consumption, but through the intermediary of a machine. Ideally, of course, the two enterprises would be conflated, material from a single basic store of lexical information being furnished to different clients in different forms. Such a conflation would, if it could be accomplished, be beneficial to all parties. Certainly human users could surely benefit from some of the processes that the machine-oriented information in a machine-readable dictionary usually makes available. They can profit even more from other processes specifically oriented to the human user but which have not yet received much attention. For the~e reasons, 1 believe that machine-readable dictionaries should, and probably soon will, come to replace traditional book-form dictionaries fairly soon. 1 do not have in mind machine-readable dict~ionaries that single users load into their personal machines so much as centralized services to which individual clients subscribe.
