Four prototypes of biomimetic sensors have been designed and implemented for flight control of a robotic flying insect. The ocelli use four photodiodes to detect changes in light intensity in the surrounding. The halteres use piezo-actuated vibrating structures to sense body rotational velocities via the Coriolis forces. The optic flow sensors consist of linear arrays of elementary motion detectors (EMDs) to register optic flows. The magnetic field sensor uses three metal loops to detect changes in the magnetic field. Despite simplicity and novelty, the preliminary tests on these devices showed promising performance for using such biomimetic sensors on a robotic flying insect.
