In our research, we explore the role of negotiation for conflict resolution in distributed search among heterogeneous and reusable agents. We present negotiated search, an algorithm that explicitly recognizes and exploits conflict to direct search activity across a set of agents. In negotiated search, loosely coupled agents interleave the tasks of 1) local search for a solution to some subproblem; 2) integration of local subproblem solutions into a shared solution; 3) information exchange to define and refine the shared search space of the agents; and 4) assessment and reassessment of emerging solutions. Negotiated search is applicable to diverse application areas and problem-solving environments. It requires only basic search operators and allows maximum flexibility in the distribution of those operators. These qualities make the algorithm particularly appropriate for the integration of heterogeneous agents into application systems. The algorithm is implemented in a multi-agent framework, TEAM, that provides the infrastructure required for communication and cooperation.
