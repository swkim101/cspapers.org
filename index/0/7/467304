One of the crucial decisions in organizing a first course in computer science is the choice of a programming language. Although there is considerable variance of opinion as to what the ideal language should be, two main approaches can be delineated. The first approach stresses the necessity of learning the dominant scientific language, which in the Americas amounts to a vote for Fortran (2). The practicality of this choice is as indisputable as the awkwardness of the syntax of that language. The alternative view stresses the importance of the program structure in developing a sound sense of “algorithmic thinking”. Proponents of this view would suggest Algol W (4) or perhaps Pascal (5). We contend that both approaches have important advantages. This paper explores an approach which attempts to maximize the benefits of both.
