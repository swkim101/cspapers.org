One of the recurrent major environmental problems is the high energy consumption. It has been challenging to find methods of persuading people to have better habits on energy usage. We are proposing the use of personalization to enhance a mobile and pervasive-based gaming approach to better foster domestic energy awareness close to people. The game is based on real-time domestic energy consumption data and presents persuasive feedback information, beyond the competitive feeling of the game. The personalization mechanisms are provided by an external web service that is designed to serve different applications, even if from different systems or domains.
