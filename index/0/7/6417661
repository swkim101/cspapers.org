We propose a branch-and-cut strategy for efficient region-based object detection. Given an oversegmented image, our method determines the subset of spatially contiguous regions whose collective features will maximize a classifier's score. We formulate the objective as an instance of the prize-collecting Steiner tree problem, and show that for a family of additive classifiers this enables fast search for the optimal object region via a branch-and-cut algorithm. Unlike existing branch-and-bounddetection methods designed for bounding boxes, our approach allows scoring of irregular shapes â€” which is especially critical for objects that do not conform to a rectangular window. We provide results on three challenging object detection datasets, and demonstrate the advantage of rapidly seeking best-scoring regions rather than subwindow rectangles.
