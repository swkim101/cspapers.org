KQML is a message protocol and format for software agents to communicate with each other. In this paper we discuss the security features that a KQML user would expect and an architecture to satisfy those expectations. The proposed architecture is based on cryptographic techniques and would allow agents to verify the identity of other agents, detect message integrity violations, protect confidential data, ensure non-repudiation of message origin and take counter-measures against cipher attacks.
