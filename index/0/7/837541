REVI-MINER is a KDD-environment which supports the detection and analysis of deviations in warranty and goodwill cost statements. The system was developed within the framework of a cooperation between DaimlerChrysler Research & Technology and Global Service and Parts (GSP) and is based upon the CRISP-DM methodology as a widely accepted process model for the solution of Data Mining problems. Also, we have implemented different approaches based on Machine learning and statistics which can be utilized for data cleaning in the preprocessing phase. The Data Mining models applied have been developed by using a statistical deviation detection approach. The tool supports controllers in their task of auditing the authorized repair shops. In this paper we describe the development phases which have led to REVI-MINER.
