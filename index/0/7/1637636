In this paper we propose a high resolution digital calibration method for analog/RF circuits that is an extension of the statistical element selection (SES) approach. As compared to SES, the proposed ESES method provides wider calibration range to accommodate multiple variation sources and produces higher calibration yield for the same calibration resolution target. Two types of ESES-based calibration with application in analog/RF designs are demonstrated; current source calibration and phase/delay calibration. As compared to traditional calibration methods, the proposed ESES-based calibration incurs lower circuit overhead while achieving higher calibration resolution. ESES calibration is further applied to a wideband harmonic-rejection receiver design that achieves best-in-class harmonic-rejection performance after calibration.
