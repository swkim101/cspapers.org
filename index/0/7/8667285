This short paper Dresents a new algorithm for minimun information Bayesian Inferencing within Expert Systems. This algorithm is as efficient in both time and space as previously reported work [3 3 but always provides a minimum information result. In addition to describing the new algorithm, we will prove that it does indeed satisfy minimum information criteria. Since both algorithms are sub stantially different from the "Bayesian" approaches in well known expert systems such as the original Prospector [1], AL/X [8], and MYCIN [9 3, and from the approach of Kulikowski [5], background is provided to show the motivation for using the minimum information approach to Bayesian updating.
