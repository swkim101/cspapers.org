Database system technology which there is a moliferation has reached a of inderrendent stage now in svstems storing and manipul~ting enormous amount of data. Unfortunately, these systems typically have their own data models, communication processing protocols, query processing systems, concurrency control protocols, consistency management, and other similar aspects of database systems. There is also an increasing need for In teroperability among these systems. Though considerable amount of research has been done in the area of database interoperability, most of it has resulted in solutions that are ad-hoc and procedural. We have developed a declarative environment in which multiple heterogeneous databases interoperate by sharing, interpreting, and manipulating information, in a uniform way. An important criterion for Interacting with multiple databases is the abiIity to query them in a manner independent of the discrepancies in their structure and data semantics. In this demo, we exhibk two languages for querying across multiple databaaes which store semantically similar data using heterogeneous schema, ss well as for restructuring the queried data: (1) SchemaLog – a language that has its foundations in logic and (2) SchemaSQL – a language based on a principled extension to SQL.
