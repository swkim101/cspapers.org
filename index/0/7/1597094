E-learning has been recognized as a promising field in which to apply artificial intelligence technologies[1][2]. We proposed an economic education support system, which helps users learn about economic dynamics based on qualitative simulation[3]. Our paper describes how our system should support end-users learning in the economic education. Existing study, such as [2], proposed the useful tools based on qualitative simulation for middle school students. The main aim of this paper is showing how students are intelligently supported based on their conditons. We show, in this paper, a method of supporting using an example of qualitative simulation in economic education. The advantages of qualitative reasoning in education are as follows. Student knowledge is formed and developed through learning conceptual foundations. If there are any mechanisms in the (dynamic) system, the user can understand these mechanisms using qualitative methods. Generally, students also understand dynamic systems through qualitative principles, rather than through mathematical formula. In our study, we developed our approach in least formula and took learning by non-specialist users into consideration. The feature of our study is that users can learn without teacher. Our goal is developing a system in which users can understanding economic dynamics through their selflearning. We consider an approach and system in which nonspecialist naive and novice users can use our system based on simple input. The contribution of our paper is the integration of theory and shows an approach to support method for qualitative simulation-based education system.
