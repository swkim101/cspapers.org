Page ranking is a fundamental step towards the construction of effective search engines for both generic (horizontal) and focused (vertical) search. Ranking schemes for horizontal search like the PageRank algorithm used by Google operate on the topology of the graph, regardless of the page content. On the other hand, the recent development of vertical portals (vortals) makes it useful to adopt scoring systems focussed on the topic and taking the page content into account.In this paper, we propose a general framework for Web Page Scoring Systems (WPSS) which incorporates and extends many of the relevant models proposed in the literature. Finally, experimental results are given to assess the features of the proposed scoring systems with special emphasis on vertical search.
