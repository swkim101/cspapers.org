We have performed a study of the usage of the Windows NT File System through long-term kernel tracing. Our goal was to provide a new data point with respect to the 1985 and 1991 trace-based File System studies, to investigate the usage details of the Windows NT file system architecture, and to study the overall statistical behavior of the usage data.In this paper we report on these issues through a detailed comparison with the older traces, through details on the operational characteristics and through a usage analysis of the file system and cache manager. Next to architectural insights we provide evidence for the pervasive presence of heavy-tail distribution characteristics in all aspect of file system usage. Extreme variances are found in session inter-arrival time, session holding times, read/write frequencies, read/write buffer sizes, etc., which is of importance to system engineering, tuning and benchmarking.
