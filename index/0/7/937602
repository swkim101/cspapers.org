Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems often use a pipeline architecture for sequential decision making. Recent studies however have shown that treating NLG decisions jointly rather than in isolation can improve the overall performance of systems. We present a joint learning framework based on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) which uses graphical models for surface realisation. Our focus will be on a comparison of Bayesian Networks and HMMs in terms of user satisfaction and naturalness. While the former perform best in isolation, the latter present a scalable alternative within joint systems.
