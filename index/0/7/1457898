The development of integrated computer-aided manufacturing systems demands that the generic functions and common information be identified and classified. This paper presents an automated approach for modeling the functional aspect of an integrated manufacturing system. The approach is called IDEF/sub 0/ and is being used by the Air Force ICAM program for all system development. The rationale, design approach and implementation of the automated tool AUTOIDEF/sub 0/, which supports the use of IDEF/sub 0/, is presented.
