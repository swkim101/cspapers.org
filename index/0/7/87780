Term weighting scheme, which has been used to convert the documents as vectors in the term space, is a vital step in automatic text categorization. In this paper, we conducted comprehensive experiments to compare various term weighting schemes with SVM on two widely-used benchmark data sets. We also presented a new term weighting scheme tf-rf to improve the term's discriminating power. The controlled experimental results showed that this newly proposed tf-rf scheme is significantly better than other widely-used term weighting schemes. Compared with schemes related with tf factor alone, the idf factor does not improve or even decrease the term's discriminating power for text categorization.
