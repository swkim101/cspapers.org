Authentication is an important mechanism for the reliable operation of any Voice over IP (VoIP) infrastructure. Digest authentication has become the most widely adopted VoIP authentication protocol due to its simple properties. However, even this lightweight protocol can have a significant impact on the performance and scalability of a VoIP infrastructure. In this paper, we present Proxychain - a novel VoIP authentication protocol based on a modified hash chain construction. Proxychain not only improves performance and scalability, but also offers additional security properties such as mutual authentication. Through experimental analysis we demonstrate an improvement of greater than 1700% of the maximum call throughput possible with Digest authentication in the same architecture. We show that the more efficient authentication mechanisms of Proxychain can be used to improve the overall security of a carrier-scale VoIP network.
