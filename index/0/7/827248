The proliferation of online video content has triggered numerous works on its evolution and popularity, as well as on the effect of social sharing on content propagation. In this paper, we focus on the observable dependencies between the virality of video content on a micro-blogging social network (in this case, Twitter) and the popularity of such content on a video distribution service (YouTube). To this end, we collected and analysed a corpus of Twitter posts containing links to YouTube clips and the corresponding video meta-data from YouTube. Our analysis highlights the unique properties of content that is both popular and viral, which allows such content to attract high number of views on YouTube and achieve fast propagation on Twitter. With this in mind, we proceed to the predictions of popular-and-viral clips and propose a framework that can, with high degree of accuracy and low amount of training data, predict videos that are likely to be popular, viral, and both. The key contribution of our work is the focus on cross-system dynamics between YouTube and Twitter. We conjecture and validate that cross-system prediction of both popularity and virality of videos is feasible, and can be performed with a reasonably high degree of accuracy. One of our key findings is that YouTube features capturing user engagement, have strong virality prediction capabilities. This findings allows to solely rely on data extracted from a video sharing service to predict popularity and virality aspects of videos.
