The efficiency of optimal planning algorithms based on heuristic search crucially depends on the accuracy of the heuristic function used to guide the search. Often, we are interested in domain-independent heuristics for planning. In order to assess the limitations of domain-independent heuristic planning, we analyze the (in)accuracy of common domain-independent planning heuristics in the IPC benchmark domains. For a selection of these domains, we analytically investigate the accuracy of the h+ heuristic, the hm family of heuristics, and certain (additive) pattern database heuristics, compared to the perfect heuristic h*. Whereas h+and additive pattern database heuristics usually return cost estimates proportional to the true cost, non-additive hm and nonadditive pattern-database heuristics can yield results underestimating the true cost by arbitrarily large factors.
