This paper proposes a strategy to reduce the amount of hardware involved in the solution of search engine queries. It proposes using a secondary compact cache that keeps minimal information stored in the query receptionist machine to register the processors that must get involved in the solution of queries which are evicted from the standard result cache or are not admitted in it. This cache strategy produces exact answers by using very few processors.
