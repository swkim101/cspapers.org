This paper describes the evolution, implementation, and use oflogjam, a system for video logging. The system features agame-board that senses the location and identities of pieces placedupon it. The board is the interface that enables a group of peopleto log video footage together. We report on some of the surprisingphysical and social dynamics that we have observed in multi-personlogging sessions using the system.
