What are the opinions and biases of students entering this course today? What do these students think they know, what do they think they should be learning? Have their opinions been altered by the technological and software trends? Do younger and older students have similar or markedly differing views and computer experiences. Can the needs of the students be met by such courses, or are the students actually more technologically literate than we believe? Noting the changes that have taken place over the last three or four years in the literacy course, the authors prepared a survey that was completed by all the students in two universities (317 students) during the first class of the fall 1985 semester. The results of that survey are the basis of this paper.
