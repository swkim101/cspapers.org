This paper tackles the problem of tracking walking people with multiple moving robots equipped with laser rangefinders. We present an adaptation to the classic Multiple Hypothesis Tracking method, which allows for one-to-many associations between targets and measurements in each cycle and is thus capable of operating in a multi-sensor scenario. In the context of two experiments, the successful integration of our tracking algorithm to a dual-robot setup is assessed.
