An increasing amount of applications build their functionality on the utilisation and manipulation of web resources. Consequently REST gains popularity with a resource-centric interaction architecture that draws its flexibility from links between resources. Linked Data offers a uniform data model for REST with self-descriptive resources that can be leveraged to avoid a manual ad-hoc development of web-based applications. For declaratively specifying interactions between web resources we introduce Data-Fu, a lightweight declarative rule language with state transition systems as formal grounding. Data-Fu enables the development of data-driven applications that facilitate the RESTful manipulation of read/write Linked Data resources. Furthermore, we describe an interpreter for Data-Fu as a general purpose engine that allows to perform described interactions with web resources by orders of magnitude faster than a comparable Linked Data processor.
