When devices become less visible and recede to the background, what kinds of influences would they have on users'? This paper presents two experiments (N=48 and N=96) that examine the effects of four different types of microphones (and voice vs. text output) on user's behaviors and attitudes. The microphones differ with respect to their visibility and users' mobility. Participants performed two different tasks: a standard creativity task and a standard disclosure task. Mobility facilitated creativity and disclosure of personal information. Recording reminder discouraged creativity and disclosure. Output modality had no significant effect. Implications for ubiquitous computing and voice user interfaces are discussed.
