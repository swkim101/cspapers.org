In this paper, a position sensing system using magnet and magnetic sensor for autonomous vehicle robot is designed. Magnetic sensing is a reliable technology that has been developed for the purposed of position measurement and guidance, especially for applications in autonomous vehicle robot. The magnetic fields from a sample magnet are first measured to determine the characteristics of the field patterns as the basis for detection and position identification. A discussion of a position sensing system with a rejection algorithm of background field is presented. The position sensing technique was implemented in the guidance of autonomous vehicle robot. The results of lateral motion control show that position-sensing system can be useful for an autonomous vehicle robot.
