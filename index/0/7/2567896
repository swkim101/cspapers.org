Question Answering provides a method of locating precise answers to specific questions but in technical domains the amount of Multi-Word Terms complicates this task.This paper outlines the Question Answering task in such a domain and explores two ways of detecting relations between Multi-Word Terms. The first targets specific semantic relations, the second uses a clustering algorithm, but they are both based on the idea of syntactic variation. The paper demonstrates how the combination of these two methodologies provide sophisticated access to technical domains.
