We propose a technique that overlays natural images on the real world using the information from multiple flashlight devices. We focus on finding areas of overlapping lights in a multiple light-source scenario and overlaying multi-layered information on a real world object in these areas.In order to mix multiple images, we developed a light identification and overlapping area detection technique using rapid synchronization between high-speed cameras and multiple light devices.In this paper, we describe the concept of our system and a prototype implementation.We also describe two different applications.
