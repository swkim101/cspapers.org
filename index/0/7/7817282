In accordance with the growth of complexity and amount of logic, computer-aided design of electronic computer became indispensable for designing and manufacturing. Though many design automation systems to support physical implementation design, manufacturing process and test process have been developed by computer manufacturers in Japan, there are few reports on logic design of digital systems.
 To describe the functions or the macroscopic structure of digital systems, various kinds of language have been proposed but it seems difficult to describe digital systems in various stages of design by a single level of language. So languages which have several levels corresponding to various design stages had been proposed, (1)(2)(3) and automatic conversion of the language from a rough level to a fine level has been studied. Though they seem to be very helpful for designing large scale digital systems, further study seems necessary to put them into practical use. On the other hand it is almost impossible to design error-free large scale digital systems without using any kind of design verification tool such as logic simulators. However, logic simulation requires a lot of test data to verify the designed system and also needs a lot of computer time.
