The continuous increase in the volume of data, decrees the employment of Parallel and Distributed Computing. The processing requirements of parallel environments are complex and more stringent than the uniprocessor systems. Efficient exploitation of parallelism dictates an even partitioning of the computation across the processing sites. To achieve a uniform load, the database optimizers require statistical information of the underlining relations. We developed a query optimization approach, named Dynamic Optimization on Multiprocessor Engines (DOME), that uses a dynamic sampling methodology to determine the frequency distribution along each level of the query tree. DOME covers the three main multiprocessor query optimization areas of Workload Partitioning, Site Selection, and Operation Ordering. We present the Site Selection segment of DOME. The Site Selection segment receives the statistical characteristics of the participating relations from the Workload Partitioning segment and performs three major operations: identifies an allocation scheme between buckets and nodes; partitions the relations residing on the various processor of the distributed environment into the appropriate buckets; transfers the buckets to their corresponding nodes. We implemented DOME on an Intel i860 hypercube with 32 nodes and tested its behavior through experimentation. The Site Selection algorithms provide approximately a six fold factor improvement over a static allocation approach for the Join relational operation.
