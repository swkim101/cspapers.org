In this paper, we consider the performance of a node in a high speed network which is subject to a threshold type of feedback control policy. We obtain the loss probability and throughput at the node as a function of round-trip propagation delay and buffer size. These parameters are critical in high speed networks. We show that the simple feedback control policy is effective only when the ratio of propagation delay to job transmission time is not too large. Otherwise, a simple static “open-Icmp” control policy, which does not rely on constant exchanges of state information, can perform better.
