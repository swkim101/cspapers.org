Data cubes are designed to pro vide aggregate information that can be used to analyze the contents of databases and data w arehouses. A range query applies an aggregation operation (e.g., SUM, A VERAGE) over all selected cells in a data cube, where the selection is speci ed by providing ranges of values on di erent dimensions. Previous approaches to process the range sum query on data cubes (e.g., pre x sum) have low query costs but have high update costs. We use the discrete wavelet transformation to decompose a data cube into w avelet coe cients of di erent resolutions. The resulting decomposed data cube can be used for progressiv eand appro ximatequery processing. This new approach can handle clustered and sparse data gracefully and can provide e cient performance for both queries and updates, which makes the wavelet decomposition technique suitable for dynamic data cube environments.
