Area coverage is an important task for mobile robots, mainly due to its applicability in many domains, such as search and rescue. In this paper we study the problem of multi-robot coverage, in which the robots must obey a strong communication restriction: they should maintain connectivity between teammates throughout the coverage. We formally describe the Multi-Robot Connected Tree Coverage problem, and an algorithm for covering perfect N -ary trees while adhering to the communication requirement. The algorithm is analyzed theoretically, providing guarantees for coverage time by the notion of speedup factor . We enhance the theoretically-proven solution with a dripping heuristic algorithm, and show in extensive simulations that it signiﬁcantly decreases the coverage time. The algorithm is then adjusted to general (not necessarily perfect) N -ary trees and additional experiments prove its efﬁciency. Furthermore, we show the use of our solution in a simulated ofﬁce-building scenario. Finally, we deploy our algorithm on real robots in a real ofﬁce building setting, showing efﬁcient coverage time in practice.
