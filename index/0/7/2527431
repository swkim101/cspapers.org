This paper addresses the issue of how linguistic feedback expressions, prosody and head gestures, i.e. head movements and face expressions, relate to one another in a collection of eight video-recorded Danish map-task dialogues. The study shows that in these data, prosodic features and head gestures significantly improve automatic classification of dialogue act labels for linguistic expressions of feedback.
