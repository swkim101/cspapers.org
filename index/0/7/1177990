Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) variations can significantly degrade the performance benefits expected from next nanoscale technology. The primary circuit implication of the PVT variations is the resultant timing emergencies. In a multi-core processor running multiple programs, variations create spatial and temporal unbalance across the processing cores. Most prior schemes are dedicated to tolerating PVT variations individually for a single core, but ignore the opportunity of leveraging the complementary effects between variations and the intrinsic variation unbalance among individual cores. We find that the notorious delay impacts from different variations are not necessary aggregated. Cores with mild variations can share the violent workload from cores suffering large variations. If operated correctly, variations on different cores can help mitigating each other and result in a variation-mild environment. In this paper, we propose Timing Emergency Aware Thread Migration (TEA-TM), a delay sensor-based scheme to reduce system timing emergencies under PVT variations. Fourier transform and frequency domain analysis are conducted to provide the insights and the potential of the PVT co-optimization scheme. Experimental results show on average TEA-TM can help save up to 24% throughput loss, at the same time improve the system fairness by 85%.
