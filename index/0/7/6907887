Semantic applications typically extract information from intermediate structures derived from sentences, such as dependency parse or semantic role labeling. In this paper, we study Open Information Extractionâ€™s (Open IE) output as an additional intermediate structure and find that for tasks such as text comprehension, word similarity and word analogy it can be very effective. Specifically, for word analogy, Open IE-based embeddings surpass the state of the art. We suggest that semantic applications will likely benefit from adding Open IE format to their set of potential sentencelevel structures.
