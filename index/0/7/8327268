Our method decomposes a set of colored point clouds into local surface patches and encodes them based on an overcomplete dictionary. Instead of storing the entire point cloud, we store a dictionary, surface patch positions, and a sparse code description of the depth and RGB attributes for every patch. The dictionary is learned in an unsupervised way from surface patches sampled from indoor maps. We show that better dictionaries can be learned by extending the K-SVD method with a binary weighting scheme that ignores undefined surface cells. Through experimental evaluation on real world laser and RGBD datasets we demonstrate that our method produces compact and accurate models. Furthermore, we clearly outperform an existing state of the art method in terms of compactness, accuracy, and computation time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our sparse code descriptions can be utilized for other important tasks such as object detection.
