This paper summarizes a probabilistic approach for localizing people through the signal strengths of a wireless IEEE 802.1 lb network. Our approach uses data labeled by ground truth position to learn a probabilistic mapping from locations to wireless signals, represented by piecewise linear Gaussians. It then uses sequences of wireless signal data (without position labels) to acquire motion models of individual people, which further improves the localization accuracy. The approach has been implemented and evaluated in an office environment.
