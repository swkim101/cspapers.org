Production system architectures are useful for knowledge representation. We have applied the architecture to image analysis in the framework of region growing and developed an outdoor-scene analyzer. In this paper, the following three problems are addressed to make production systems workable in scene analysis. 1) Appropriate size of knowledge represented in a. production rule. 2) Reduction of computation. 3) Control of the analysis toward goal.
