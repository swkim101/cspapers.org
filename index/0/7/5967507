This paper proposes ajuzzy neural expert system (FNES) with the following two functions: (1) Generalization of the information derived from the training data and embodiment of knowledge in the form of the fuzzy neural network; (2) Extraction of fuzzy If-Then rules with linguistic relative importance of each proposition in an antecedent (I f -part) from a trained neural network. This paper also gives a method to extract automatically fuzzy If-Then rules from the trained neural network. To prove the effectiveness and validity of the proposed fuzzy neural expert system. a fuzzy neural expert system for medical diagnosis has been developed.
