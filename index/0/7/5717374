Recently, overlapping community detection becomes a trend due to the ubiquity of overlapping and nested communities in real world. However, existing approaches have ignored the use of implicit link preference information, i.e., links can reflect a node's preference on the targets of connections it wants to build. This information has strong impact on community detection since a node prefers to build links with nodes inside its community than those outside its community. In this paper, we propose a preference-based nonnegative matrix factorization (PNMF) model to incorporate implicit link preference information. Unlike conventional matrix factorization approaches, which simply approximate the original adjacency matrix in value, our model maximizes the likelihood of the preference order for each node by following the intuition that a node prefers its neighbors than other nodes. Our model overcomes the indiscriminate penalty problem in which non-linked pairs inside one community are equally penalized in objective functions as those across two communities. We propose a learning algorithm which can learn a node-community membership matrix via stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling. We evaluate our PNMF model on several real-world networks. Experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and can be applied to large datasets.
