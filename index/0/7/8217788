This paper proposes TEASE (Technology Exploration and Analysis for SoC-level Evaluation), a framework to systematically analyze and evaluate system design in finFET-based technology node. The proposed framework combines both lithography and electrical constraints of a particular technology node to optimize the standard cell library performance. Growing complexity of logic design at nodes below 20nm causes to adopt a design style that can embrace the simplicity required to enable manufacturing, along with a process technology that can be finely tuned to the desired performance constraints. Additionally, the introduction of finFET based devices poses a new challenge for the designers to come up with an efficient standard cell template. The proposed framework can be used to detect the technology constraints that act as the bottleneck for the enablement of design at these advanced nodes. Results presented in this paper show by optimizing these bottlenecks we can improve the performance of a standard cell library significantly. Furthermore, adapting to such an analysis framework at an early stage of technology development helps to take the design constraints into the decision loop for realization of technology research into real products.
