Web Programming, Graphics, and Design is a course with no prerequisites that teaches non-computer science majors how to create their own sophisticated web pages. The course begins with the use of popular software such as Dreamweaver and Fireworks and then progresses to writing interactive web pages in Java. Students learn how to program with Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) as well as the graphics library, leading to the creation of 3D images. Solving problems involving mathematics is a theme throughout much of the course. Finally, following Wheaton College's curricular emphasis on inter-departmental offerings, the course is linked with Graphic Design I in the Art Department, enabling students to learn the design portion in even greater depth.
