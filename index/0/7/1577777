Many computer science students and faculty want to participate in service projects; these projects might include service learning in the classroom, service experiences in the local community, or service projects at a domestic or international site. Developing service projects that incorporate computer science and/or technology skills that are both interesting and meaningful often presents a challenge. During this BOF participants will discuss and answer questions about service projects in which they have participated, their successes and failures, techniques for finding appropriate partners, logistical issues, etc. This session will be helpful to faculty having no prior service experience, as well as veteran faculty who have organized multiple service trips.
