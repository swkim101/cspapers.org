Default logic and the various forms of circumscription were developed to deal with similar problems. In this paper, we consider what is known about the relationships between the two approaches and present several new results extending this knowledge. We show that there are interesting cases in which the two formalisms do not correspond, as well as cases where default logic subsumes circumscription. We also consider positive and negative results on translating between defaults and circumscription, and develop a context in which they can be evaluated.
