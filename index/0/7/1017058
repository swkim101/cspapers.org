In this paper we present a model of the formation and evolution of innovation network in an oligopolistic industry. A series of theoretical analysis of knowledge characteristics and simulation analysis of the weighted efficient have been studied. The results indicate that there exists the optimal relative knowledge distance and the codified extent of knowledge for collaboration. Moreover the weighted efficient of the performance of the best knowledge benefit and the expected average knowledge benefit has a certain influence on the number of active firms.
