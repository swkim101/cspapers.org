We present the S-Space Package, an open source framework for developing and evaluating word space algorithms. The package implements well-known word space algorithms, such as LSA, and provides a comprehensive set of matrix utilities and data structures for extending new or existing models. The package also includes word space benchmarks for evaluation. Both algorithms and libraries are designed for high concurrency and scalability. We demonstrate the efficiency of the reference implementations and also provide their results on six benchmarks.
