This paper proposes a novel shuffle-translating method that combines shuffle turns repeatedly for a humanoid robot. Conventionally, the walking motion of a humanoid robot is performed through a repeated foot stepping motion. However, this motion is inefficient and has low stability. Previously, we have studied the shuffle-turning method for a humanoid robot, which can perform a stepless and stable turning. In this paper, we present a precise shuffle turn with feedback control and a new shuffle translation method by repeating shuffle turns. Experiments using a humanoid robot were conducted and the results revealed that the proposed method was effective for shuffle translation.
