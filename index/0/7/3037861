This paper describes a new technique in the Network Weather Service for producing multi-variate forecasts. The new technique uses the NWSâ€™s univariate forecasters and emprically gathered Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) to make predictions from correlated measurement streams. Experimental results are shown in which throughput is predicted for long TCP/IP transfers from short NWS network probes.
