The simulation model of hot rolling coupling was established using finite element method base on studying and analyzing of universal rolling method for H-beam. The distribution of temperature field and stress field in contact area as the main research subjects during hot rolling under the given rolling regulations of H-beam, the whole process of hot rolling was completely simulated. The results show that the temperature of H-beam was a downward trend in the hot rolling process, however, local temperature display rising trend, uneven deformation of flange lead to more complex temperature distribution, there is a certain correlation between equivalent plastic stress and temperature distributions, increasing of equivalent plastic stress as the temperature increases, research results can provide theoretical basis for rolling regulations and reference of the production of hot rolling for H-beam.
