A corpus of inference rules between a pair of relation phrases is typically generated using the statistical overlap of argument-pairs associated with the relations (e.g., PATTY, CLEAN). We investigate knowledge-guided linguistic rewrites as a secondary source of evidence and find that they can vastly improve the quality of inference rule corpora, obtaining 27 to 33 point precision improvement while retaining substantial recall. The facts inferred using cleaned inference rules are 29-32 points more accurate.
