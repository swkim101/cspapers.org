Limited write endurance is one of major obstacles to adopt Phase Change Memories (PCMs) in practice as future main memory. Considering process variation (PV) and non-uniform write intensity, PCM cells with low endurance (i.e. weak cells) can wear out in seconds under intensive writes. To prolong PCMs' lifetime, many PV-aware wear leveling schemes have been proposed following a common idea: intensive writes are predicted and allocated to cells with high endurance (i.e. strong cells) based on the write intensity distribution, which should be consistent at predicted intervals. However, we discover that this idea leaves a serious vulnerability against a malicious program, which is designed to have an inconsistent write intensity distribution. Prior wear-leveling schemes can even be leveraged to speed up wearing out weak cells. To counteract this attack, we propose Toss-up Wear Leveling (TWL), a novel scheme that randomly allocates writes between two bond blocks discounting the consistency of write distribution. Experiment results demonstrate that, compared to prior works, TWL can improve lifetime substantially with negligible overhead in performance and hardware cost.
