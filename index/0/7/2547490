When a Web user's underlying information need is not clearly specified from the initial query, an effective approach is to diversify the results retrieved for this query. In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework for Web search result diversification, which explicitly accounts for the various aspects associated to an underspecified query. In particular, we diversify a document ranking by estimating how well a given document satisfies each uncovered aspect and the extent to which different aspects are satisfied by the ranking as a whole. We thoroughly evaluate our framework in the context of the diversity task of the TREC 2009 Web track. Moreover, we exploit query reformulations provided by three major Web search engines (WSEs) as a means to uncover different query aspects. The results attest the effectiveness of our framework when compared to state-of-the-art diversification approaches in the literature. Additionally, by simulating an upper-bound query reformulation mechanism from official TREC data, we draw useful insights regarding the effectiveness of the query reformulations generated by the different WSEs in promoting diversity.
