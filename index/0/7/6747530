This paper describes design and implementation of an IPC model for a distributed software testbed Shoshin. The IPC model was designed to provide a reliable message communication among distributed processes and to support implementations of user level protocols for various applications. A multiprocess structure, which separates a link level and a transport level, has been used to provide a flexible protocol management. The basic performance of the current implementation and the extensibility of the model are also discussed.
