The following study concerns itself with the generation of rough ideas of floor plans in a relatively short time and low cost. A methodical procedure is sought in the form of a computer program which may subsequently be used by someone unskilled on an interactive basis that will help the designer and his client gain an understanding of the layout.
 The idea of user generated design is the foundation of this work. Client's values of required proxemic distances are translated into a spatial layout, in the form of dimensioned map, with great ease. Preference values are first used to build a polyomino reflecting the order of importance given to each pair-wise distances between cells.
 The technique that transforms a set of proxemic distances generated by the client into a spatial layout (a polyomino) and which in turn was thought to be the minimum of absolute differences in the summation of distances between the pattern generated and a given set of preferences was first introduced by R. S. Frew in, “Towards a Theory of System Architecture” University of Waterloo, Canada.
 The means of finding the order of links from the highest to lowest priority was retained but a new procedure has been developed to build patterns (polyominoes), the effectiveness of each judged under the same criteria stated above.
 The present study, then, introduced a new procedure for pattern construction and in addition worked out and coded a procedure for the conversion of a polyomino into a dimensional map in which each of the elements can be of different proportion or size.
