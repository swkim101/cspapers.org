Given explosive data traAEc in the world-wide web (WWW), it is crucial to achieve the scalable performance of web servers. The overall performance and resource utilization can be improved by spreading document requests among a group of web servers. This leads to the design and implementation of Distributed Cooperative Apache (DC-Apache) web server. In this paper, we describe the unique features of the DC-Apache system (1) to migrate and replicate documents among cooperating servers, (2) using dynamic hyperlink generation to distribute requests for documents to balance the load, and (3) to maintain replicated copies in a consistent state. We also address the issue of storage management for more e ective document replication under limited capacity. In the experiments, the DC-Apache system demonstrated its ability to achieve high performance and scalability by e ectively distributing load among a group of cooperating Apache servers and by eliminating hot spots and performance bottleneck with replicated documents. The DC-Apache system is an e ective and practical solution to provide high performance and scalability to cope with ever increasing demands from clients all over the web. keywords: WWW, Scalable Web server, Apache, DCApache, Distributed Web server, Replication, Load balancing
