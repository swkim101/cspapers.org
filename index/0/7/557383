Knowledge Base Population (KBP) tasks, such as slot filling, show the particular importance of entity-oriented automatic relevant document acquisition. Rich, diverse and reliable relevant documents satisfy the fundamental requirement that a KBP system explores the nature of an entity. Towards the bottleneck problem between comprehensiveness and definiteness of acquisition, we propose a collaborative archiving method. In particular we introduce topic modeling methodologies into entity biography profiling, so as to build a bridge between fuzzy and exact matching. On one side, we employ the topics in a small-scale high-quality relevant documents (i.e., exact matching results) to summarize the life slices of a target entity (i.e., biography), and on the other side, we use the biography as a reliable reference material to detect new truly relevant documents from a large-scale partially complete pseudo-feedback (i.e., fuzzy matching results). We leverage the archiving method to enhance slot filling systems. Experiments on KBP corpus show significant improvement over stateof-the-art.
