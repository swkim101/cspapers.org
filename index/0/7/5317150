The task of managing and accessing large information spaces is a problem in large scale cognition. Enwrging technologies for 3D visualization and interactive aninlaiion offer potential solutions to this problenl, especially when the structure of the information can be visualized. We describe one of these Information Visualtzaiion techniques, called the Cone Tree, which is used for visualizing hierarchical information structures. The hierarchy is presented in 3D to nlaxilnize effective use of available screen space and enable visualization of the whole structure. Interactive aninlation is used (,o shift sonle of the userâ€™s cognitive load to the human perceptual system,
