Many embedded development environments are stuck somewhere in the backwash of software technology. Structured programming practices, with the artifacts of those methodologies liberally scattered about, are the norm in these environments. The world has changed since structured methodologies first emerged, with shorter and shorter market windows and increasingly sophisticated customers demanding more and more capabilities at lower and lower cost. Embedded system development must also adapt to these market imperatives to stay competitive. This paper describes the challenges, obstacles, and successes encountered in applying eXtreme Programming on an embedded legacy product with a team of seasoned, veteran C programmers.
