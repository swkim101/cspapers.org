The problem of finding the set of pareto optimals for constraints and qualitative preferences together is of great interest to many application areas. It can be viewed as a preference constrained optimization problem where the goal is to find one or more feasible solutions that are not dominated by other feasible outcomes. Our work aims to enhance the current literature of the problem by providing solving methods targeting the problem in a dynamic environments. We target the problem with an eye on adopting and benefiting from the current constraint satisfaction techniques.
