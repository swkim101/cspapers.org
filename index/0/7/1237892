From recent conferences, position papers, special journal issues, and informal hallway discussions, we have witnessed a quickly rising tide of interest among the database research community in querying and processing data streams. Numerous modem applications operate over data that arrives in the form of rapid, continuous streams, and in many of these applications simply diverting the streams in their entirety into a conventional DBMS and querying them in a conventional fashion is infeasible in terms of performance and functionality. Example applications include sensor networks, Web tracking, financial monitoring, telecommunications, network monitoring and traffic engineering, and manufacturing processes. On one hand it is tempting to claim that data streams offer a brand new paradigm for thinking about data management, opening the dam for a flood of new research. On the other hand, on closer inspection we may discover that data streams offer only a small tributary to a river of research that's been meandering along for decades. After all, one can certainly argue that, say, processing continuous queries over data streams is little more than setting triggers on or creating views over a sequence database. So, which is it... a fresh current or stagnant backwater? The panel will draw upon researchers who have worked in some of the established areas that appear closely related to data streams. In the first "role playing" round, each panelist will argue vociferously that the new area of data streams is swallowed up by their area. In the second round, the panelists will each counter one or two of the others, highlighting challenges or data stream application demands not met by minor modifications to previous research. The final segment of the panel, which includes audience partic-
