Hypermedia systems provide online access to complex networks of information with the goal of making it easier to find and use information. To validate the utility of their systems, several researchers and system developers have attempted to collect evaluation data on the usability and effectiveness of their systems and the features in their systems. Because of the potential complexity of hypermedia systems and the information structures they may represent, a variety of evaluation measures and methods have been used. These trade off the need for timely feedback in the development of new technology, the difficulty of controlling one or two variables in systems with dozens or hundreds of components, and the goal of gaining an understanding of hypermedia systems.
