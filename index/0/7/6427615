While conducting a security analysis of JavaScript and VBScript, the most popular scripting languages on the Web, we found some serious flaws. Motivated by this outcome, we propose steps towards a sound definition and design of a security framework for scripting languages on the Web. We show that if such a security framework had been integrated into the respective scripting languages from the very beginning, the probability of preventing the multiple security flaws, that we and other research groups identified, would have been greatly increased.
