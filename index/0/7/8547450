We present an experimental study of IEEE 802.11n (high throughput extension to the 802.11 standard) using commodity wireless hardware. 802.11n introduces a variety of new mechanisms including physical layer diversity techniques, channel bonding and frame aggregation mechanisms. Using measurements from our testbed, we analyze the fundamental characteristics of 802.11n links and quantify the gains of each mechanism under diverse scenarios. We show that the throughput of an 802.11n link can be severely degraded (up â‰ˆ85%) in presence of an 802.11g link. Our results also indicate that increased amount of interference due to wider channel bandwidths can lead to throughput degradation. To this end, we characterize the nature of interference due to variable channel widths in 802.11n and show that careful modeling of interference is imperative in such scenarios. Further, as a reappraisal of previous work, we evaluate the effectiveness of MAC level diversity in the presence of physical layer diversity mechanisms introduced by 802.11n.
