With navigation algorithms reaching a certain maturity in the field of mobile robots, the community now focuses on more advanced tasks like path planning towards increased autonomy. While the goal is to efficiently compute a path to a target destination, the uncertainty in the robot's perception cannot be ignored if a realistic path is to be computed. With most state of the art navigation systems providing the uncertainty in motion estimation, here we propose to exploit this information. This leads to a system that can plan safe avoidance of obstacles, and more importantly, it can actively aid navigation by choosing a path that minimizes the uncertainty in the monitored states. Our proposed approach is applicable to systems requiring certain excitations in order to render all their states observable, such as a MAV with visual-inertial based localization. In this work, we propose an approach which takes into account this necessary motion during path planning: by employing Rapidly exploring Random Belief Trees (RRBT), the proposed approach chooses a path to a goal which allows for best estimation of the robot's states, while inherently avoiding motion in unobservable modes. We discuss our findings within the scenario of vision-based aerial navigation as one of the most challenging navigation problem, requiring sufficient excitation to reach full observability.
