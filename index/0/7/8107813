Software-defined Networking (SDN) is seen as a promising solution that allows for a more distributed, flexible, and scalable network. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), initiated as an Industry Specification Group (ISG) within ETSI, is also emerging as a low-latency and high-throughput cloud environment at the edge of network. The noticeable success that aforementioned technologies made attracts massive research interests and the interplay between them on programmable network requires an open source platform to evaluate. In this work, we present a low-latency MEC platform (LL-MEC) providing the required flexibility and programmability to meet the expected performance gain following SDN and MEC principles. We also demonstrate an use case of real-time content caching application using LL-MEC platform and OpenAirInterface LTE implementation on commodity hardware.
