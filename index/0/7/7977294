The difficult takes a while to accomplish, the impossible takes just a little longer. VLSI is significantly more complex than any technology today. A VLSI chip of the '80s is depicted within the industry as having 0.5 micron minimum feature size, 106 devices per chip, and 105 gates per chip. With the expected capability of placing so much logic on a chip, what are the design challenges and how can they be met?
 Chart I illustrates the many aspects of design. They are strongly interrelated and dependent upon each other. Choosing an optimal design methodology for VLSI is critical since a bad choice will leave a designer with inadequate design tools and a lack of design integrity.
