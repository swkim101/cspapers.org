Techniques for information fusion are at the heart of multimodal system design. To develop new user-adaptive approaches for multimodal fusion, the present research investigated the stability and underlying cause of major individual differences that have been documented between users in their multimodal integration pattern. Longitudinal data were collected from 25 adults as they interacted with a map system over six weeks. Analyses of 1,100 multimodal constructions revealed that everyone had a dominant integration pattern, either simultaneous or sequential, which was 95-96% consistent and remained stable over time. In addition, coherent behavioral and linguistic differences were identified between these two groups. Whereas performance speed was comparable, sequential integrators made only half as many errors and excelled during new or complex tasks. Sequential integrators also had more precise articulation (e.g., fewer disfluencies), although their speech rate was no slower. Finally, sequential integrators more often adopted terse and direct command-style language, with a smaller and less varied vocabulary, which appeared focused on achieving error-free communication. These distinct interaction patterns are interpreted as deriving from fundamental differences in reflective-impulsive cognitive style. Implications of these findings are discussed for the design of adaptive multimodal systems with substantially improved performance characteristics.
