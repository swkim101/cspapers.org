We focus on comanipulation, i.e. manipulation of an object simultaneously held by a robot and a human operator. In this domain, a major difficulty is raised by significant variations of human dynamics, which depend not only on the arm posture, but also on the muscular activity (muscular co-contraction) and more generally on the type of task being performed: fine positioning, gross and rapid movements, repeated movements, etc. An ideal comanipulation system should be able of adapting its behavior to the operator's functional intention, resulting in an intuitive assisting device. Toward this goal, we present in this paper first results of our research aimed at developing an instrumented handle mounted on a robot end-effector and held by an operator, that can be used for estimating the grasping force and for adapting the robot controller accordingly. We show first experimental evidences that changes in the grasping force drastically affect the robot controller performances. We thus propose a handle design and a gain scheduling strategy that result in a robot behavior adequate for any kind of grasps. This solution is successfully experimented with a 1 degree of freedom robot under largely variable comanipulation conditions, exhibiting a stable and efficiently adaptive behavior.
