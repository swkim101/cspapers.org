In this paper, we propose the first identity-based broadcast encryption scheme, which can simultaneously achieves confidentiality and full anonymity against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks under a standard assumption. In addition, two further desirable features are also provided: one is fully-collusion resistant which means that even if all users outside of receivers S collude they cannot obtain any information about the plaintext. The other one is stateless which means that the users in the system do not need to update their private keys when the other users join or leave our system. In particular, our scheme is highly efficient, where the public parameters size, the private key size and the decryption cost are all constant and independent to the number of receivers.
