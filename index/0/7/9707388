This paper describes work in progress towards using non-phonemic respellings as an additional source of information besides spelling in the process of extending pronunciation lexicons for speech recognition and text-to-speech systems. Preliminary experimental data indicates that the approach is likely to be successful. The major benefit of the approach is that it makes extending pronunciation lexicons accessible to average users.
