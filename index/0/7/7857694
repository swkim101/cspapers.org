Evolutionary computation is a useful technique for learning behaviors in multiagent systems. Among the several types of evolutionary computation, one natural and popular method is to coevolve multi-agent behaviors in multiple, cooperating populations. Recent research has suggested that revolutionary systems may favor stability rather than performance in some domains. In order to improve upon existing methods, this paper examines the idea of modifying traditional coevolution, biasing it to search for maximal rewards. We introduce a theoretical justification of the improved method and present experiments in three problem domains. We conclude that biasing can help coevolution find better results in some multiagent problem domains.
