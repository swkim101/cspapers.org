Manual deadlock fixing is error-prone and time-consuming. Exist-ing generic approach (GA) simply inserts gate locks to fix dead-locks by serializing executions, which could introduce various new deadlocks and incur high runtime overhead. We propose a novel approach DFixer to fix deadlocks without introducing any new deadlocks by design. DFixer only selects one thread of a deadlock to pre-acquire a lock w together with another lock h, where before fixing, the deadlock occurs when the thread holds lock h and waits for lock w. As such, DFixer eliminates a hold-and-wait necessary condition, preventing the deadlock from occurring. The thread per-forming pre-acquisition is carefully selected such that no other syn-chronization exists in between the two original acquisitions. Other-wise, DFixer further introduces a context-aware conditional protect-ed by above lock w to guarantee the correctness of DFixer. The evaluation is on 20 deadlocks, including 17 from widely-used real-world C/C++ programs. It shows that DFixer successfully fixed all deadlocks. Whereas GA introduced 9 new deadlocks; a latest work Grail failed to fix 8 deadlocks and introduced 3 new deadlocks on others. On average, DFixer incurred only 2.1% overhead, where GA and Grail incurred 15.8% and 11.5% overhead, respectively.
