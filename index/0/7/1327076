Relational queries applied on probabilistic databases have been established as a powerful tool for accessing huge data sets of uncertain data. Often various parts of such queries have different significances for a specific user. Thus, a query language should allow us to give subqueries different weights to quantify the individual user preferences. In this work we introduce a theoretical foundation for weighted algebra operators on probabilistic databases within a SQL-like query language.
