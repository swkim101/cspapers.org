Combining the Alamouti space-time block code with spatial modulation (STBC-SM) was recently demonstrated as an effective way to increase the spectral efficiency and achieve a transmit diversity order of two as compared to the original spatial modulation (SM). This paper investigates a new transmission scheme that is based on a high-rate space-time block code rather than the Alamouti STBC. A simplified maximum likelihood (ML) detection is also developed for the proposed scheme. Analysis of coding gains and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms previously-proposed spatial modulation schemes at high data transmission rates.
