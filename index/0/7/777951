Dynomite is a portable electronic notebook for the capture and retrieval of handwritten and audio notes. Dynomite provides a casual, paper like interface, allowing the user to write or draw on a screen resembling an ordinary paper notebook. Indexing is provided by allowing users to attach properties, or data types, to specific ink, and by allowing the user to associate text keywords with pages of notes. Dynomite notes can be organized into sub notebooks based on these indexes. In addition, Dynomite records audio synchronously with notes and allows users to mark or highlight significant sections, so that they may be easily located and replayed. In order to understand how well the features of Dynomite support natural note taking practices, we conducted usage studies, which showed that Dynomite's indexing capabilities clearly improve the ability to find information in notes.
