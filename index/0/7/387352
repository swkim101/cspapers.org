Presented are techniques for designing, modeling, and control of reliable pneumatic artificial muscle actuators with integrated low profile sensors for position feedback. The sensor is fabricated through a three-dimensional manufacturing process based on a modified lathe approach for controlling viscous and viscoelastic materials as well as on direct writing of liquid metal. Next, a new precision pneumatic muscle design and its integration with the sensor is illustrated. A theoretical model and experimental characterization of the muscle-sensor package are presented with high correlation and repeatability. Finally, a position feedback sliding mode controller is implemented with a position error of <0.9% of maximum muscle contraction.
