In this paper, we extend the initial classification scheme for Social Machines (SM) by including Personal APIs as a new SM-related topic of research inquiry. Personal APIs basically refer to the use of Open Application Programming Interfaces Open APIs) to programmatically access information about a person (e.g., personal basic info, health-related statistics, busy data) and/or trigger his/her human capabilities in a standardized way. Here, we provide an overview of some existing Personal APIs and show how this approach can be used to enable the design and implementation of people as individual SMs on the Web. A proof-of-concept system that demonstrates these ideas is also outlined in this paper.
