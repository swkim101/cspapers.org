I will present the LogicBlox database and describe business applications that use it. The LogicBlox database marries declarative programming (logic-based specifications) with cloud deployment over large datasets. The database is programmed with a variant of the Datalog programming language. The flexibility of declarative programming allows us to integrate both traditional business application development and "probabilistic" applications: machine-learning or search-based solutions, as required by the domain. Our approach aims to eliminate the distance between prototyping and deployed, high-performance implementations. I will discuss real customer applications and actual deployment instances that elastically adapt to several thousands of machines.
