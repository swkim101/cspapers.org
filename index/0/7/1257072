Life-size humanoids which have the same joint arrangement as humans are expected to help in the living environment. In this case, they require high load operations such as gripping and conveyance of heavy load, and holding people at the care spot. However, these operations are difficult for existing humanoids because of their low joint output. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop the highoutput life-size humanoid robot. We first designed a motor driver for humanoid with featuring small, water-cooled, and high output, and it performed higher joint output than existing humanoids utilizing. In this paper, we describe designed humanoid arm and leg with this motor driver. The arm is featuring the designed 2-axis unit and the leg is featuring the water-cooled double motor system. We demonstrated the arm's high torque and high velocity experiment and the leg's high performance experiment based on water-cooled double motor compared with air-cooled and single motor. Then we designed and developed a life-size humanoid with these arms and legs. We demonstrated some humanoid's experiment operating high load to find out the arm and leg's validity.
