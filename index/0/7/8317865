Computer science programs often use a course with a title such as “assembly language” to meet the objectives of the Curriculum ‘78 CS3 course. The computer system used for this course has frequently been an IBM System/360 or a descendent of this architecture. Microcomputers are now widely available for instructional use. This paper explores the similarities and differences between teaching assembly language for the System/360 architecture and for the Intel 80x86 architecture.
