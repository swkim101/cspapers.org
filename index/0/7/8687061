A major online file of chemical journal literature complete with graphics is being developed to test theusability of fully eleckonic access to documents. Thetest file will include tenyears of the American Chemical Societyâ€™s online journals, supplemented with the graphics from the paper publibation, mdthekdexing of thewticles from Chemical Abs&acts. Ourgoals are(l) to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of electronic access to primary journals as compared with paper, and (2) to identify the most desirable functions of the user interface to an electronic system of journals, including in particular a comparison of page image display with Ascii display interfaces. This paper describes the chemical journal data, the interfaces for searching and reading it, and the experiments being done.
