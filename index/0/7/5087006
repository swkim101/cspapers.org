A significant body of research in ubiquitous computing deals with mobile networks, i.e. networks of mobile devices interconnected by wireless communication links. Due to the very nature of such mobile networks, addressing and communicating with remote objects is significantly more difficult than in their fixed counterparts. This paper reconsiders the remote object reference concept - one of the most fundamental programming ions of distributed programming languages - in the context of mobile networks. We describe four desirable characteristics of remote References in mobile networks, show how existing remote object References fail to exhibit them, and subsequently propose ambient references: remote object references designed for mobile networks.
