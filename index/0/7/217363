Recently, there has been increasing work in using policy in pervasive systems. Policy is a relatively new field and much work is still required to explore designs, concepts, and architecture for using policy in pervasive computing environments. In this paper, we briefly introduce the concepts and design of a policy based pervasive system, using Mobile Hanging Services as an example. The main aim of this paper is to investigate several techniques that can be used to statically or dynamically detect and resolve conflicts in pervasive systems. We discuss the conflict detection and resolution techniques in the system as a case study.
