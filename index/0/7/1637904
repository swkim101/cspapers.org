Technovation Challenge introduces computer science to high school girls in a dynamic learning environment that offers exciting, real-world challenges to conquer; fresh new ways of thinking and problem solving; and the support of hands-on mentors drawn from academia and the tech industry. Over the course of 12 intensive weeks, students identify a problem drawn from their own real-life experiences and program a mobile phone application to solve it. They research their competition and identify ways in which they can win users and earn revenue. They practice their pitch with experienced investors who give them feedback on their app and business plan. The girls then pitch their ideas to a panel of venture capitalists. The winning team receives funding to take their app to market.
 Evaluations are conducted by an external evaluator. This past year, 67% of girls said they would like to go on to learn another programming language and we saw a 40% increase in girls' interest in studying computer science after completing the program. The number of girls who understand what a computer scientist does doubled, and the number of girls who said they knew how to write a computer program increased by 67%. Over the past three years over 800 high-school girls have programmed 163 mobile phone apps and learned how to launch their startups.
