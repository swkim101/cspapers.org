With the proliferation of the world's “information highways” a renewed interest in efficient document indexing techniques has come about. In this paper, the problem of incremental updates of inverted lists is addressed using a new dual-structure index. The index dynamically separates long and short inverted lists and optimizes retrieval, update, and storage of each type of list. To study the behavior of the index, a space of engineering trade-offs which range from optimizing update time to optimizing query performance is described. We quantitatively explore this space by using actual data and hardware in combination with a simulation of an information retrieval system. We then describe the best algorithm for a variety of criteria.
