The integration of a variety of IP cores into a single chip to meet the high demand of new applications leads to many challenges in timing issues, especially the interface between different clock domains. Globally Asynchronous, Locally Synchronous (GALS) approach addresses these challenges by dividing a chip into several independent subsystems working with different clock signals. In multi-synchronous Network-on-Chip (NoC) based on GALS architecture, the network routers run with different frequencies, so the problem is how to transfer data safely and efficiently between them. In order to build a synchronization unit to tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel efficient asynchronous First-In-First-Out architecture targeting to multi-synchronous NoCs. Token ring structure, register-based memory, and modified Asynchronous Assertion - Synchronous De-assertion techniques are applied to improve the performance of the proposed asynchronous FIFO. After simulating and verifying the design, we have implemented our asynchronous FIFO architecture with CMOS 180nm technology from AMS. Implementation results are analyzed and compared with previous works to show the strong points of our design.
