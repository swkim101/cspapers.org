Assisted living systems aim at increasing the independence of persons facing challenges in performing their daily tasks either due to cognitive diseases or aging. In addition, many systems try to help their caregivers in providing effective care to them. However, in order to be useful assisted living systems must be easy to use for the affected persons as well as for their caregivers. Furthermore, to be cost-effective the systems must be inexpensive. In this paper, we discuss our experiences from our assisted living system WebDA and based on the lessons learned we present the Living++ platform which strives to fulfill the mentioned goals. The Living++ platform is built on top of low cost and widely available devices, it provides a familiar TV-based user interface to its users and enables remote monitoring and management through freely available on-line services.
