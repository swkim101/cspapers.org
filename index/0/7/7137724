In this paper, we present an extension of PSA strategy (Parallel Scheduling Algorithm ), to determine an appropriate mapping of operations onto physical processors, taking into account the interconnection network topology of a sharednothing architecture. Performance evaluation, which relies on two benchmarks shows the efficiency of PSA strategy by comparing to Static Right-Deep strategy and to Bushy Tree Scheduling strategy. The major contributions of this work are (i) the incorporation of the mapping process into PSA strategy and (ii) the PSA strategy which provides a good trade-off between response time minimization and throughput maximization.
