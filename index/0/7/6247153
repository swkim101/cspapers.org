Introductory Computer Graphics is a popular and motivational course for computer science undergraduates. The students have the ability to “see” the results of their programs, the opportunity to apply a high level of creativity, and the satisfaction of impressing their peers. Computer animation provides similar advantages from a motivational point of view. A normal scheduling sequence for these two courses would place them in successive semesters (or quarters) in the curriculum, presumably in the senior year so students have as much computer science experience as possible prior to starting the graphics course. Unfortunately, at the Air Force Academy, such a sequence was not possible, forcing us to investigate the integration of the two courses during the same semester (second semester senior year). Our experience is that the two courses could not only be successfully integrated during the same semester, but that the student experience in each course benefited from the concepts being simultaneously presented in the complementary course. This paper will provide background on the two courses, describe our experience in teaching them simultaneously, and discuss our future plans for expanding the pilot program.
