Appositions are adjacent NPs used to add information to a discourse. We propose systems exploiting syntactic and semantic constraints to extract appositions from OntoNotes. Our joint log-linear model outperforms the state-of-the-art Favre and Hakkani-TÂ¨ ur (2009) model by 10% on Broadcast News, and achieves 54.3% Fscore on multiple genres.
