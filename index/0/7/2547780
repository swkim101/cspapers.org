We introduce an platform architecture and algorithm to frequency synchronize multiple devices. The platform allows clock unification among oscillator, microcontroller, and radio. The platform accesses complex baseband samples from the radio, estimates the carrier frequency offset, and iteratively drives the main local oscillator (LO) frequency difference between two devices to zero.
