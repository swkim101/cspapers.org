The objective of this paper is to present cost models for estimating the response time for the distributed data mining (DDM) process. These cost models form the basis for developing a hybrid approach to distributed data mining which integrates the client-server and mobile agent paradigms. The underlying objective of the hybrid model is to optimise the DDM process.
