A new approach to autonomous pursuit evasion by a wheeled mobile robot in the presence of wheel slip is presented. Classical pursuit evasion problem, such as the Homicidal Chauffeur problem, considers the kinematic model of the pursuer and does not consider slip in its trajectory, and thus cannot predict a realistic pursuit evasion scenario. In this work we present a new dynamics-based approach to pursuit evasion problem in the presence of wheel slip. We first show how a feedback linearization controller can achieve capture with wheel slip. We then improve the capture time by designing a new extremum seeking controller that maximizes lateral traction force to effect a sharper but stable turn. The simulation results show the efficacy of our proposed control approach.
