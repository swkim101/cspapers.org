We demonstrate an end-to-end use case of the semantic web's utility for synthesizing ecological and environmental data. ELVIS (the Ecosystem Location Visualization and Information System) is a suite of tools for constructing food webs for a given location. ELVIS functionality is exposed as a collection of web services, and all input and output data is expressed in OWL, thereby enabling its integration with other semantic web resources. In particular, we describe using a Triple Shop application to answer SPARQL queries from a collection of semantic web documents.
