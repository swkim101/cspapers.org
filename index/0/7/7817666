This demonstration will describe how Timber, a native XML database system, has been extended with the capability to answer XML-style structured queries (e.g., XQuery) with embedded IR-style keyword-based non-boolean conditions. With the original structured query processing engine and the IR extensions built into the system, Timber is well suited for efficiently and effectively processing queries with both structural and textual content constraints.
