Data visualization and iterative/interactive data mining are growing rapidly in attention, both in research as well as in industry. However, integrated methods and tools that combine advanced visualization and/or interaction with data mining techniques are rare, and those that exist are specialized to a single problem or domain. We present SIDE, a generic tool for Subjective Interactive Data Exploration, which lets users explore high dimensional data via subjectively informative two-dimensional data visualizations. In contrast to most visualization tools, it is not based on the traditional dogma of manually zooming and rotating data. Instead, the tool initially presents the user with an ‘interesting’ projection, and then allows users to flexibly and intuitively express their interests or beliefs using visual interactions that update/constrain a background model of the data. These constraints expressed by the user are then taken into account by a projection-finding algorithm employing data randomization to compute a new ‘interesting’ projection. This process can be iterated until the user runs out of time or finds that the difference between the randomized data and the real data is no longer interesting. We present the tool by means of two case studies, one controlled study on synthetic data and another on real census data.
