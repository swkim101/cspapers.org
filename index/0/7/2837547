Finding patterns of social interaction within a population has wide-ranging applications including: disease modeling, cultural and information transmission, and behavioral ecology. Social interactions are often modeled with networks. A key characteristic of social interactions is their continual change. However, most past analyses of social networks are essentially static in that all information about the time that social interactions take place is discarded. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical and computational framework that enables analysis of dynamic social networks and that explicitly makes use of information about when social interactions occur.
