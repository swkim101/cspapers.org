Against in adaptive adversary, we show that the power of randomization in on-line algorithms is severely limited! We prove the existence of an efficient “simulation” of randomized on-line algorithms by deterministic ones, which is best possible in general. The proof of the upper bound is existential. We deal with the issue of computing the efficient deterministic algorithm, and show that this is possible in very general cases.
