This paper describes the external forces that motivate financial institutions to collect, aggregate, analyze, and mine data so that it can be transformed into information, one of a financial institution’s most valuable assets. In this paper we refer to this strategic information asset as “information currency.” In general, we describe the state of banking and the rapid global changes that affect financial institutions. We analyze how Bank of America (BofA) created and employed its information currency using the TeradataTM Relational Database Management System (Teradata RDBMS). The Teradata RDBMS manages a very large data warehouse (NCR Scalable Data Warehouse) for BofA using an NCR WorldMarkTM 51OOM MPP (Massive Parallel Processing) platform [Wck93].
