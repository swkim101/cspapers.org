We present a tracking algorithm based on motion analysis of regional affine invariant image features. The tracked object is represented with a probabilistic occupancy map. Using this map as support, regional features are detected and probabilistically matched across frames. The motion of pixels is then established based on the feature motion. The object occupancy map is in turn updated according to the pixel motion consistency. We describe experiments to measure the sensitivities of our approach to inaccuracy in initialization, and compare it with other approaches.
