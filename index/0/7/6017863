Searching for information in distributed ledgers is currently not an easy task, as information relating to an entity may be scattered throughout the ledger with no index. As distributed ledger technologies become more established, they will increasingly be used to represent real world transactions involving many parties and the search requirements will grow. An index providing the ability to search using domain specific terms across multiple ledgers will greatly enhance to power, usability and scope of these systems. We have implemented a semantic index to the Ethereum blockchain platform, to expose distributed ledger data as Linked Data. As well as indexing block- and transaction-level data according to the BLONDiE ontology, we have mapped smart contracts to the Minimal Service Model ontology, to take the first steps towards connecting smart contracts with Semantic Web Services.
