The social impact from the World Wide Web cannot be underestimated, but technologies used to build the Web are also revolutionizing the sharing of business and government information within intranets. In many ways the lessons learned from the Internet carry over directly to intranets, but others do not apply. In particular, the social forces that guide the development of intranets are quite different, and the determination of a "good answer" for intranet search is quite different than on the Internet. In this paper we study the problem of intranet search. Our approach focuses on the use of rank aggregation, and allows us to examine the effects of different heuristics on ranking of search results.
