In this paper, we propose a family of operators for merging stratified knowledge bases under integrity constraints. The operators are defined in a model-theoretic way. Our merging operators can be used to merge stratified knowledge bases where no numerical information is available. Furthermore, the original knowledge bases to be merged can be individually inconsistent. Both logical properties and computational complexity issues of the operators are studied.
