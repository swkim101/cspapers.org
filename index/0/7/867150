The problem of grasping force optimization for a robotic system equipped with multi-fingered hands is considered in this paper. This problem is cast as a convex optimization problem, considering also joint torque constraints. A solution suitable for on-line implementation is proposed, which allows a substantial reduction of the computational load by dynamically decreasing the number of active torque constraints. Moreover, for the case of a bimanual manipulation system, a sub-optimal single-hand optimization algorithm is presented and compared with the optimal one. The effectiveness of the described methods has been tested in a simulation case study.
