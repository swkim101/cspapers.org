Although there has been an ANSI standard for Smalltalk for some years, there has not been a verification suite for it. This has allowed the various dialects to deviate from the standard without much notice. One of the first Camp Smalltalk projects was a test suite for the ANSI standard protocols. It has several thousand tests based on SUnit, a way of testing protocol conformance, and way of reusing protocol-based tests for each of the concrete classes that is supposed to support a protocol.
