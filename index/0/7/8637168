A number of execution strategies for parallel evaluation of multi-join queries have been proposed in the literature; their performance was evaluated by simulation. In this paper we give a comparative performance evaluation of four execution strategies by implementing all of them on the same parallel database system, PRISMA/DB. Experiments have been done up to 80 processors. The basic strategy is to first determine an execution schedule with minimum total cost and then parallelize this schedule with one of the four execution strategies. These strategies, coming from the literature, are named: Sequential Parallel, Synchronous Execution, Segmented Right-Deep, and Full Parallel. Based on the experiments clear guidelines are given when to use which strategy.
