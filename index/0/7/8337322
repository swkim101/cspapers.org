A knowledge system architecture is a level of description of knowledge systems that specialises general AI implementation techniques to suit a class of problem solving tasks. This paper presents three complementary views of the architecture level, and analyzes their implications for the design of knowledge engineering tools. The analysis is illustrated with an architecture for managing uncertainty by reasoning about actions, and with a hierarchy of knowledge engineering tools to support system development and knowledge acquisition at the architecture level.
