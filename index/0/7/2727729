The Test Support Program (TSP) is a real-time interactive computer-based simulation model that provides the environment for testing and verifying the operation of netted air control systems. It provides computer-to-computer simulation of data link timing; message interpretation, response, and transmission; and on-line data analysis and recording for up to nine interfaced systems of various types.
 Event execution and timing is performed in accordance with a time-ordered pre-stored scenario and operator-initiated console inputs. Live and simulated system interfaces and data may be used. The simulation model can accept and use data from live systems. Event and data inputs are structured in a special language and are validated by a pre-processor to aid in test design and error-free execution. Event control and data entry during program execution are from a CRT/keyboard or magnetic tape.
 TSP permits earlier and more effective verification of program performance, easier design of complicated tests, and reduces reliance on establishment and operation of large complexes of operational and test bed systems. Program operation can be verified in advance of the availability of interfacing hardware and software in a controlled environment.
