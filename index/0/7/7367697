At SNLA, the primary computer-aided drafting tool is the Applicon Graphics System (AGS). The data base for mechanical parts on the AGS is a "wire frame" model. Experiments are underway for adding surface information to the wire frame and passing this information "up stream" to a VAX computer. On this computer, a programming system for manipulating polygonal information (MOVIE.BYU) is available. One of the output devices is a RAMTEK 9400 high resolution color display. This display has also been interfaced to a color recorder.
