We present a Bayesian CAD system for robotic applications. We address the problem of the propagation of geometric uncertainties, and how to take this propagation into account when solving inverse problems. We describe the methodology we use to represent and handle uncertainties using probability distributions of the system's parameters and sensor measurements. It may be seen as a generalization of constraint-based approaches where we express a constraint as a probability distribution instead of a simple equality or inequality. Appropriate numerical algorithms used to apply this methodology are also described. Using an example, we show how to apply our approach by providing simulation results using our CAD system.
