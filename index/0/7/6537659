In memory-based natural language processing, semantic phrasal patterns constitute a main knowledge source for recognizing input sentences. Although the memory-based parsing approach has many advantages, one significant problem is that a very large number of semantic phrasal pat terns is needed. Manual crest ion of patterns is unrealistic, and even for a small applicat ion domain, it is very time consuming. To solve the scalability problem, automatic acquisition of semantic patterns must be provided. In this paper, we present a practical approach to solve this problem. The PALKA (Parallel Automatic Linguistic Knowledge Acquisition) system acquires semantic patterns from a set of domain specific sample texts and their desired output represent ations. The acquired patterns are tuned further through generalizations and specializations of semantic constraints. This paper presents the PALKA system and its application to a set of news articles.
