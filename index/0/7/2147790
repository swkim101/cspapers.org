Today, users of the grid may easily authenticate themselves to computing resources around the world using a public key security infrastructure. However, users are forced to employ a patchwork of local identities, each assigned by a different local authority. This forces each grid system to provide a mapping from global to local identities, creating a significant administrative burden and inhibiting many possibilities of data sharing. To remedy this, we introduce the technique of identity boxing. This technique allows a high-level identity to be attached directly to each process and resource that a user employs, rendering the local account name irrelevant. This allows a grid user to be known by the same name consistently at all sites, thus reducing administrative burdens and enabling new forms of sharing. We have implemented identity boxing at the user level within a secure system-call interposition agent and applied it to a distributed storage and execution system. The performance overhead of this implementation is only 0.7 to 6.5 percent for a selection of scientific applications, but as high as 35 percent for a metadata-intensive software build. We conclude with some reflections on how the operating system might be modified to better support grid computing.
