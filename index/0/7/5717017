Navigation systems based on animal behavior have attracted considerable attention in the past few years. Navigation systems using artificial pheromones have not been extensively developed. Therefore, this paper presents a model for realizing an artificial pheromone system by using data carriers and autonomous robots. By introducing an artificial pheromone system composed of data carriers and autonomous robots, a robotics system creates a potential field for navigation. First, we develop pheromone density in a discrete nominal model. Then, we extend the model to deal with a random layout that is suitable for real conditions of data carriers. For demonstration of the effectiveness of our proposed model, computer simulations and hardware implementations are performed. The artificial pheromone potential field constructed using our proposed model can be used for the navigation of autonomous robots.
