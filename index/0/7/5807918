We have proposed "attentive workbench (AWB)," an assembly cell that supports the production activities of human workers. Attentive workbench is composed of an augmented desk interface and self-moving trays with the Sawyer planar motors. In this paper, real assembly experiments using the implemented AWB system are carried out. The merit of the physical assembly support by the proposed system is evaluated quantitatively in the view of necessary time for product assembly.
