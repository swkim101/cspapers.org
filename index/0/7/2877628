In this paper, we present an approach for finding violations of safety properties of hybrid systems. Existing approaches search for complete system trajectories that begin from an initial state and reach some unsafe state. We present an approach that searches over segmented trajectories, consisting of a sequence of segments starting from any system state. Adjacent segments may have gaps, which our approach then seeks to narrow iteratively. We show that segmented trajectories are actually paths in the abstract state graph obtained by tiling the state space with cells. Instead of creating the prohibitively large abstract state graph explicitly, our approach implicitly performs a randomized search on it using a scatter-and-simulate technique. This involves repeated simulations, graph search to find likeliest abstract counterexamples, and iterative refinement of the abstract state graph. Finally, we demonstrate our technique on a number of case studies ranging from academic examples to models of industrial-scale control systems.
