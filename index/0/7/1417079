In a business environment, resource, budget and schedule constraints profoundly affect a product's user interface design. This paper describes the design of a graphical workflow application as it was affected by compromise between management, design and development during the product life cycle. The product is tracked from its initial implementation as a highly functional utility with a non-standard user interface, to its brief life as a prototype representing the ultimate workflow tool. Primary focus is on the third, most recent version, and the design problems that arose in delivering a highly usable interface within practical, real world constraints.
