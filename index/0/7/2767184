A sentence extract summary of a document is a subset of the document's sentences that contains the main ideas in the document. We present an approach to generating such summaries, a hidden Markov model that judges the likelihood that each sentence should be contained in the summary. We compare the results of this method with summaries generated by humans, showing that we obtain significantly higher agreement than do earlier methods.
