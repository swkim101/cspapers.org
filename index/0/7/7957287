The capability to securely manage embedded devices is arguably a fundamental functionality for the emerging Internet of Things (IoT). Current Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) approaches are not applicable directly for IoT deployments due to new challenges from emerging IoT applications. We propose to address this shortcoming and enhance the process while providing a sufficient level of security. This work proposes to design, implement and evaluate an efficient and secure software update/manage architecture for the IoT. We plan to conduct an extensive experimental study on a public testbed to evaluate the design tradeoff and quantify the performance of our architecture.
