In recent years, with the rapid development of positioning technologies, online social networks, sensors and smart devices, large scale human behavioral data are now readily available. The growing availability of such behavioral data provides us unprecedented opportunities to gain more in depth understanding of users in both the physical world and cyber world, especially in online social networks. In this talk, I will introduce our recent research efforts in social and urban mining based on large-scale human behavioral datasets showcased by two projects: 1) LifeSpec: Modeling the spectrum of urban lifestyles based on heterogeneous online social network data. 2) L2P: Inferring demographic attributes from location check-ins.
