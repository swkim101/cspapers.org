In this paper, we present a new impedance control strategy that allows to reproduce a time-varying stiffness. By properly controlling the energy exchanged during the action, we guarantee the system passivity for any choice of the stiffness matrix, especially in case of time-varying stiffness, and therefore a stable behavior of the robot both in free motion and in interaction with an environment.
