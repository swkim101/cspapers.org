Database indexing is a well studied problem. However, the advent of Hypertext databases opens new questions in indexing. Searches are often demarcated by pointers between text items. Thus the scope of the search may change dynamically, whereas traditional indexes cover a statically defined region such as a relation. We present techniques for indexing in hypertext databases and compare their performance.
