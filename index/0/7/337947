In the last few years there has been an increased interest from researchers and practitioners in exploring time as a dimension that can benefit several information retrieval tasks. There is exciting work in analyzing and exploiting temporal information embedded in documents as relevance cues for the presentation, organization, and the exploration of search results in a temporal context. Most of the current approaches focus on leveraging the temporal information available in document sources like web pages or news articles. However, the Web keeps evolving beyond simple web pages and new information sources and services are adopted very rapidly. For example, the incredible amount of content that is generated by users in social networks offers another aspect to examine how people produce and consume content over time. We review the current activities centered on identifying and extracting time information from document collections and the applications to the information seeking process. We outline the potential of new sources for studying temporal information by presenting new problems. Finally, we discuss a number of scenarios where a temporal perspective can provide insights when exploring Web contents.
