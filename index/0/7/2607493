Bilingual dictionaries are expensive resources and not many are available when one of the languages is resource-poor. In this paper, we propose algorithms for creation of new reverse bilingual dictionaries from existing bilingual dictionaries in which English is one of the two languages. Our algorithms exploit the similarity between word-concept pairs using the English Wordnet to produce reverse dictionary entries. Since our algorithms rely on available bilingual dictionaries, they are applicable to any bilingual dictionary as long as one of the two languages has Wordnet type lexical ontology.
