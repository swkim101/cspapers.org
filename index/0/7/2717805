This paper proposed a task function method for the point-to-point (PTP) control problem of non-redundant robot manipulators. A task function to compress the conventional task space to a new one with lower dimensions increases the redundancy degree so that the original manipulator becomes a redundant one, such that we can apply redundant control laws to achieve online subtasks, such as obstacle avoidance without trajectory replanning. The four basic properties of the task function method which are necessary to ensure the good performance of the PTP control problem are presented. The experiment results verify the effectiveness of the presented method.
