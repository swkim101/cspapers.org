Fast and exact motions of continuum robots are hardly seen so far. Partly this is caused by physical constraints, e.g. small available actuation forces. Another reason is the dynamic coupling between the actuators that cannot be neglected during fast motions. Therefore, a model-based MIMO controller in actuator space was developed, that is based on a spatial dynamic model with one mass point per section. Using feedback linearization, the actuators can be decoupled and feedforward control in combination with linear controllers can be applied. Measurements of an example manipulator show the good tracking result of pure feedforward action with feedback linearization. Adding a linear PD-controller increases the robustness against disturbances without reducing the possibility of fast motions.
