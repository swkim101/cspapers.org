Generation of texts in natural language requires making conceptual and linguistic decisions. This paper shows first that these decisions involve the use of a discourse grammar, secondly that they are all dependent on one another but that there is a priori no reason to give priority to one decision rather than another. As a consequence, a generation algorithm must not be modularized in components that make these decisions in a fixed order.
