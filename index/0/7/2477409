A key problem in operating systems is permitting the orderly introduction of new properties and new implementation techniques. We describe a mechanism, subcontract, that within the context of an object-oriented distributed system permits application programmers control over fundamental object mechanisms. This allows programmers to define new object communication mechanisms without modifying the base system. We describe how new subcontracts can be introduced as alternative communication mechanisms in the place of existing subcontracts. We also briefly describe some of the uses we have made of the subcontract mechanism to support caching, crash recovery, and replication.
