This paper describes a torque control scheme unifying feedback PD control and feed-forward impedance control to realize human-inspired walking on a novel planar footed bipedal robot: AMBER2. It starts with high fidelity modeling of the robot including nonlinear dynamics, motor model, and impact dynamics. Human data is then used by an optimization algorithm to produce a human-like gait that can be implemented on the robot. To realize the bipedal walking, first a PD controller is utilized to track the optimized trajectory. Next, impedance control parameters are estimated from the experimental data. Finally, the unified PD, impedance torque control law is experimentally realized on the bipedal robot AMBER2. Through the evidence of sustainable and unsupported walking on AMBER2 showing high consistency with the simulated gait, the feasibility of AMBER2 walking scheme will be verified.
