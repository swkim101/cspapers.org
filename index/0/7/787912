Choreography analysis has been a crucial problem in service oriented computing. Interactions among services involve message exchanges across organizational boundaries in a distributed computing environment, and in order to build such systems in a reliable manner, it is necessary to develop techniques for analyzing such interactions. Choreography conformance involves verifying that a set of services behave according to a given choreography specification that characterizes their interactions. Unfortunately this is an undecidable problem when services interact with asynchronous communication. In this paper we present techniques that identify if the interaction behavior for a set of services remain the same when asynchronous communication is replaced with synchronous communication. This is called the synchronizability problem and determining the synchronizability of a set of services has been an open problem for several years. We solve this problem in this paper. Our results can be used to identify synchronizable services for which choreography conformance can be checked efficiently. Our results on synchronizability are applicable to any software infrastructure that supports message-based interactions.
