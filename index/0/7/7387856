Finite-state transducers give efficient representations of many Natural Language phenomena. They allow to account for complex lexicon restrictions encountered, without involving the use of a large set of complex rules difficult to analyze. We here show that these representations can be made very compact, indicate how to perform the corresponding minimization, and point out interesting linguistic side-effects of this operation.
