We introduce a modular approach for literature-based discovery consisting of a machine reading and knowledge assembly component that together produce a graph of inﬂuence relations (e.g., “A promotes B”) from a collection of publications. A search engine is used to explore direct and indirect inﬂuence chains. Query results are substantiated with textual evidence, ranked according to their relevance, and presented in both a table-based view, as well as a network graph visualization. Our approach operates in both domain-speciﬁc settings, where there are knowledge bases and ontologies available to guide reading, and in multi-domain settings where such resources are absent. We demonstrate that this deep reading and search system reduces the effort needed to uncover “undis-covered public knowledge”, and that with the aid of this tool a domain expert was able to drastically reduce her model building time from months to two days.
