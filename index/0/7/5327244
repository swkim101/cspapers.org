Collision avoidance is a main issue in applications empl oying free-ranging, computer-controlled vehicles. In this paper we look at the r egulation of locally crossing traffic. Collisions are typically avoided by changing spe ed and/or changing route, but– to keep efficiency high– as minimal as possible. If we look at humans going by foot in crowded areas or dri ving by car in urban traffic, we observe a high degree of flexibility. The c hallenge is to reach the same flexibility with computer controlled driver systems. Pre liminary research on dynamic ways of traffic control [1] has indicated that consider able improvements can be reached in comparison to the more static approach of tr aditional zone claiming methods, in particular in case of busy traffic. When searching for the best solutions there are many criteria to consider: time delay, throughput, total travel time, planned arrival time, energy consumption, comfort, et cetera. We will limit our selves to a single optimality criterion: minimal time delay. Even then we are faced with a huge space-time resource allo ation problem [2]. In the paper, first we analyze the passage of two vehic les that drive on a conflicting course as depicted in the left part of Fig. 1.
