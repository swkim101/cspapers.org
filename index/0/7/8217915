Planar communication networks are used to facilitate communications in VLSI chips. Rearrangeable networks and superconcentrators are two principal planar communication networks of theoretical importance. We describe such networks in terms of graphs. One seeks such networks with as few edges (i.e., switching elements) and as small degree for each vertex as possible satisfying the communication requests. In this paper, we study planar communication networks under the assumption of independent random switch failures. We construct planar rearrangeable networks and superconcentrators with concerns not only of the size (the number of edges, i.e., switches in the networks) and the degrees of vertices, but also of the degree of fault tolerance. We show that any fault tolerant planar rearrangeable n-network (network failing to be a planar rearrangeable n-network with probability approaching O as n co) and any fault tolerant planar n-superconcentrator must contain Cl(n) vertices, each having fl(log n) degree. And we construct fault tolerant planar rearrangeable n-networks with size O(na) and maximum degree O(log n), and having O(n) vertices with degree Cl(log n); we construct fault tolerant planar n-superconcentrators with size O(n2) and maximum degree O(log n), and having O(n) vertices with degree fl(log n). In both cases, the sizes are asymptotically optimal.
