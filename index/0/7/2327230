Welcome to the SIGCOMM 2003 Data Communications Festival in Karlsruhe, Germany!This year's SIGCOMM is hosted in a typical German town: Karlsruhe, a multifaceted vibrant and friendly city. Karlsruhe, population 425,000, was founded in 1715 and is located in the famous Rhine Basin in the South of Germany at the borders of the beautiful Black Forest close to France. Overall this region has more days of sunshine than any other German city. The highlight of the 2003 social program gives you a chance to explore the world-famous castle and the picturesque old town of Heidelberg. The conference is hosted by the University of Karlsruhe, the oldest Technical University in Germany. We appreciate the generosity of our host as well as the corporate sponsors of the conference: Intel Research and Microsoft Research, Cambridge.This year's conference broadens the traditional scope of the annual SIGCOMM conference in a number of ways: an expanded technical program including position papers exploring various viewpoints and a poster session showcasing work-in-progress; a set of six workshops and two tutorials that are interleaved with the technical conference to encourage participation by a broad set of attendees. Five workshops are held for the first time, covering networking research (MoMe Tools and NREDS), future architectures (FDNA), network - I/O convergence (NICELI), and a QoS retrospective (RIPQoS). The highly successful education workshop (NetEd) returns for a second year. Tutorials given by renowned experts cover network security and self-similar traffic.
