Over the past few years, community QA websites (e.g. Yahoo! Answers) have become a useful platform for users to post questions and obtain answers. However, not all questions posted there receive informative answers or are answered in a timely manner. In this paper, we show that the answers to some of these questions are available in online domain-specific knowledge bases and propose an approach to automatically discover those answers. In the proposed approach, we would first mine appropriate SQL query patterns by leveraging an existing collection of QA pairs, and then use the learned query patterns to answer previously unseen questions by returning relevant entities from the knowledge base. Evaluation on a collection of health domain questions from Yahoo! Answers shows that the proposed method is effective in discovering potential answers to user questions from an online medical knowledge base.
