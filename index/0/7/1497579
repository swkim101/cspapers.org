If EDA technology innovation drives return on investment, what drives innovation? Is it tied to the semiconductor retooling cycle? To productivity requirements? To Moores Law? Or is there something more fundamental that we are missing? What driving forces could result in a $30 billion EDA industry, and what role will innovation play? Will the industry provide the needed breakthroughs for their customers, or seek instead the lowest common denominator user? Will designers “roll their own” tools or seek common solutions? How does EDA innovation track with the semiconductor business cycle? Does a slowdown accelerate or depress creation of new tools and new designs? Panelists will discuss the forces at work in the EDA industry of tomorrow.
