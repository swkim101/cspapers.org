Word Sense Disambiguation suffers from a long-standing problem of knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Although state of the art supervised systems report good accuracies for selected words, they have not been shown to be promising in terms of scalability. In this paper, we present an approach for learning coarser and more general set of concepts from a sense tagged corpus, in order to alleviate the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. We show that these general concepts can be transformed to fine grained word senses using simple heuristics, and applying the technique for recent SENSEVAL data sets shows that our approach can yield state of the art performance.
