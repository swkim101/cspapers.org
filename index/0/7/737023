In this paper we describe and evaluate several statistical models for the task of realization ranking, i.e. the problem of discriminating between competing surface realizations generated for a given input semantics. Three models (and several variants) are trained and tested: an n-gram language model, a discriminative maximum entropy model using structural information (and incorporating the language model as a separate feature), and finally an SVM ranker trained on the same feature set. The resulting hybrid tactical generator is part of a larger, semantic transfer MT system.
