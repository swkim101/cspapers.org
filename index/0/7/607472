Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI) is a cross-disciplinary field that connects advanced information technologies, systems, algorithms, and databases with international, national and homeland security related applications. Our NSF-funded project, titled Computing in Context, has a focus of developing new teaching modules and pedagogies for the ISI discipline at the undergraduate level. In this poster, we present five exemplar modules that we developed for the ISI discipline: database design for cybercrime investigation, securing private data on the Internet, data visualization for understanding privacy sentiment, security intelligence for healthcare mobility, and program design for digital forensics. Our materials are designed for inquiry-based learning and for active engagement of students through discussion, hands-on practices, and various exercises.
