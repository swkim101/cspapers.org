In the computer science field, educators face several obstacles when attempting to introduce rigorous software engineering concepts and practices into the curriculum. This paper addresses the issue of software engineering education and the role of megaprogramming in introductory courses for high school and college students. We highlight the need for, and the initial effort in megaprogramming education. We provide a brief description of developed materials and a proposed approach to integrate megaprogramming into high school computer science curriculum.
