In 1987 the Dept. of Computer Science at the University of Scranton received an NSF CSIP grant to develop a Software Engineering Laboratory. A decision was made to supplement that laboratory with computer assisted software engineering (CASE) tools. This paper describes the on going integration of CASE tools into the computing curricula at the University of Scranton.
