We present an experimental study of how storage techniques impact energy consumption in smartphones. We design and implement a system that tracks I/O activities of smartphones in real-time and dynamically changes storage configuration by matching I/O patterns in order to reduce energy consumption. Our system is evaluated on the 20 most popular applications from Android Market, and our results show that the optimal configurations save from 21% to 52% of battery life. We believe that they highlight a new and interesting direction in which the topic of smartphone energy consumption can be further evaluated and expanded upon.
