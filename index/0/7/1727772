Several natural language systems (e.g., Bobrow et al., 1977; Hendrix et al., 1978; Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1979) include heuristics for replacement and repetition ellipsis, but not expansion ellipsis. One general strategy has been to substitute fragments into the analysis of the previous input, e.g., substituting parse trees of the elliptical input into the parse trees of the previous input in LIFER (Hendrix, et al., 1978). This only applies to inputs of the same type, e.g., repeated questions.
