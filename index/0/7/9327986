One of the remarkable things about human information processing is the way we store and retrieve information. The human associative memory is a device that has been only rather crudely approximated with computers in flexibility, self-modifiability, and complexity of associations. In this paper, we descri language, AMPPL-II, which machine with an extensive, associative memory and parall capability. It was to be machine-independent and is embedded in a high-leve language. The version out built as an extension of SLI List Processing Language), embedded in FORTRAN IV. be a computer simulates a variable size el processing made fairly , therefore, 1 algebraic lined here is P (Symmetric itself beinq The expected range of applicability of AMPPL-II covers a rather wide area. Candidates in the non-numerical field are game playing, picture processing and image identification, encoding-decoding, simulation of cognitive behavior, multikey information retrieval, language analysis, sorting, merging, collating, query systems, and so on. Numerical applications would be matrix calculations, solution of partial differential equations, computation of auto-and cross-correlation functions, signal correction, etc. Stimulated by this languaae, new computational techniques and algorithms may, hopefully, be developed. These, on one hand, and technological advances, on the other, may render the hardware implementation of an AMPPL-like machine economical. *N.V.F. designed AMPPL and is responsible for the mistakes contained in this paper. W. R. McK. implemented the language on the CDC 6 400. Teiji Furugori's contribution to the latter is also acknowledged. Further, Peter Mullor and Charles Bergenstock worked on an IBM 7044 implementation of AMPPL-I.
