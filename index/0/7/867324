This paper describes the development of applications for the building and home management service section of the "Humanoid Robotics Project (HRP)" supported by METI. The objective of this section is to develop a system that enables users to control the humanoid robots in their homes remotely via the Internet with a simple mobile terminal. To construct such a system, we focused on developing sensor-based autonomy sufficient to achieve task-level teleoperations. The system included view simulation based on CG technologies to help users perceive conditions at the robot's site and the client-server architecture necessary for remote task execution to reduce the load on the mobile terminal. Based on these technologies, we implemented a prototype system and conducted some experiments that illustrate that the system achieves the basic required functions for a building and home management service.
