In order to verify orbital operations of a dual-arm space robot on the ground, a hybrid simulator (hardware in the loop simulator) is developed. The hybrid simulator includes a 14-degrees-of-freedom (14-DOF) dual-arm robot and 9-DOF motion table. A hybrid simulator has a great advantage in simulating complicated collision with multiple contacts, because it is difficult for a numerical simulation to get reliable and accurate results of such complicated phenomena. In this paper, the system architecture and the motion planning for three motion tables are presented. Two experiments are performed to confirm the basic motion and simulate a free-flying dual- arm space robot colliding with a floating object. The feasibility of robot operation is discussed from showing the position and force data obtained in the motion simulation.
