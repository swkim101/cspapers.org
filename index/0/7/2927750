Tapping on the same point twice is a common operation known as double tap, but tapping on distant points in sequence is underutilized. In this poster we explore the potential uses of consecutive distant tap operations, which we call Ta-Tap. As a single-touch operation, it is expected to be particularly useful for single-handed touch screen use. We examined three possible uses of Ta-Tap: simulating multi-touch operations, invoking a virtual scroll wheel, and invoking a pie-menu. We verified the feasibility of Ta-Tap through the experiment.
