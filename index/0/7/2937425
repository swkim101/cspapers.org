Massive graph data sets are pervasive in contemporary application domains. Hence, graph database systems are becoming increasingly important. In the study of these systems , it is vital that the research community has shared benchmarking solutions for the generation of database instances and query workloads having predictable and con-trollable properties. Similarly to TPC benchmarks for re-lational databases, benchmarks for graph databases have been important drivers for the Semantic Web and graph data management communities. Current benchmarks, however , are either limited to fixed graphs or graph schemas, or provide limited or no support for generating tailored query workloads to accompany graph instances. To move the community forward, a benchmarking approach which overcomes these limitations is crucial. In this paper, we present the design and engineering principles of gMark, a domain-and query language-independent graph benchmark addressing these limitations of current solutions. A core contribution of gMark is its ability to target and control the diversity of properties of both the generated graph instances and the generated query workloads coupled to these instances. A further novelty is the support of recursive regular path queries, a fundamental graph query paradigm. We illustrate the flexibility and practical usability of gMark by showcas-ing the framework's capabilities in generating high quality graphs and workloads, and its ability to encode user-defined schemas across a variety of application domains.
