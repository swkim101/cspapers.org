The Cartesian ad hoc routing protocols (CARP) is a set of efficient broadcast control mechanism for geographical position aware nodes. In CARP, when a source node tries to transmit a packet in the direction of the destination, a logical transmission area is formed. To reduce the flooding traffic, only nodes located inside this area will forward the packet. The CARP assume that a source knows the Cartesian address of the mobile ad hoc destination node and nodes have some knowledge about the density from previous activity of the network. This research paper presents an initialization mechanism for (CARP), to find the destination logical address through controlled broadcast. In this paper, an initialization mechanism based on controlled retransmission and geographical position is presented. To validate these algorithms, the simulation results are also presented.
