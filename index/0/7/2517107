We hope to alert attendees of this panel to a number of aspects of CS education research:&bull; previous work that provides good models for future research;&bull; current projects and results;&bull; areas that deserve more inquiry;&bull; questions for which research is unlikely at the moment to yield useful information.The panel is aimed at people who don't need to be convinced about the value of CS education research, but who perhaps are unfamiliar with what's happening or how they might get involved themselves.
