This paper describes a formal approach for developing concurrent rule-based programs. Specification refinement is used to generate an initial version of the program. Program refinement is then applied to produce a highly concurrent and efficient version of the same program. Techniques for deriving concurrent programs through either specification or program refinement have been described in previous literature. The main contribution of this paper consists of extending the applicability of these techniques to a broad class of rule-based programs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time formal derivation is employed in the context of rule-based programming.
