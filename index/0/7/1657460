This paper describes several ways sensor networks can benefit from geospatial information and identifies two research directions. First, better models of localization error, logical location, and communications costs are required to understand the interactions between spatial information and control and communications algorithms in sensor networks. Second, wider use of spatial information in densely deployed sensor networks will move sensor networking applications from simple tracking to object counting and area monitoring, and can enable data mining techniques sensor networks to accomplish “spatial sensor mining”.
