Many auditory theorists consider the temporal adaptation of the auditory nerve a key aspect of speech coding in the auditory periphery. Experiments with models of auditory localization and pitch perception also suggest temporal adaptation is an important element of practical auditory processing. I have designed, fabricated, and successfully tested an analog integrated circuit that models many aspects of auditory nerve response, including temporal adaptation.
