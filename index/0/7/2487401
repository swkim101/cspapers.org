Moving Target Defense (MTD) is emerging as a game changing approach consisting in a number of mechanisms that automatically change one or more system attributes in order to make a system's attack surface unpredictable to adversaries. The main objective of the First ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense (MTD 2014) is to address the challenges of developing new MTD techniques and evaluating the effectiveness of MTD techniques with theoretical analysis and experimental results. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from academia, government, and industry to report on the latest research efforts on moving target defense,and to have productive discussion and constructive debate on this topic.
