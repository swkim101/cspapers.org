A series of studies conducted from 1978 through 1982 resulted in the system design of a very-large, very-high-speed multiprocessor. The system, whose objective was to sustain throughput in excess of one billion floating point operations per second (1 GFLOP), was intended to support the solution of a broad range of large scientific problems, especially modeling problems such as those encountered in computational aerodynamics. Rather than having a central resource manager or scheduler, a philosophy of decentralized control was applied to the collection of 128 processors, to each processor individually, and to the interconnection networks. After introducing the background of the project and the planned system usage, the decentralized control mechanizations withih the multiprocessor and reasons for them are presented. Although business decisions led to the termination of the project before the system was implemented, the experiences related here will, hopefully, be useful to others with similar challenges.
