This article considers the problem of generating various calligraphy of Japanese character from some limited existing fonts. We propose a generation method based on the deformable contour model g-snake. By representing the outline of each stroke that makes of a character with a g-snake, we cast the generation problem into global and local deformation of g-snake under different control parameters, meanwhile, the local deformation obeys the energy minimization principle of regularization technique. The base value of the control parameters are learned from given sample fonts. The experimental results, i.e. the generated calligraphy show such a process as a reasonable way of generating characteristic calligraphy.
