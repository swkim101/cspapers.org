This paper presents a method for estimating the 6DOF pose of sweet-pepper (capsicum) crops for autonomous harvesting via a robotic manipulator. The method uses the Kinect Fusion algorithm to robustly fuse RGB-D data from an eye-in-hand camera combined with a colour segmentation and clustering step to extract an accurate representation of the crop. The 6DOF pose of the sweet peppers is then estimated via a nonlinear least squares optimisation by fitting a superellipsoid to the segmented sweet pepper. The performance of the method is demonstrated on a real 6DOF manipulator with a custom gripper. The method is shown to estimate the 6DOF pose successfully enabling the manipulator to grasp sweet peppers for a range of different orientations. The results obtained improve largely on the performance of grasping when compared to a naive approach, which does not estimate the orientation of the crop.
