A passive wand tracked in 3D using computer vision techniques is explored as a new input mechanism for interacting with large displays. We demonstrate a variety of interaction techniques that exploit the affordances of the wand, resulting in an effective interface for large scale interaction. The lack of any buttons or other electronics on the wand presents a challenge that we address by developing a set of postures and gestures to track state and enable command input. We also describe the use of multiple wands, and posit designs for more complex wands in the future.
