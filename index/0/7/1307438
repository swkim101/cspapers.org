Motivated by Google Sets, we study the problem of growing related words from a single seed word by leveraging user behaviors hiding in user records of Chinese input method. Our proposed method is motivated by the observation that the more frequently two words co-occur in user records, the more related they are. First, we utilize user behaviors to generate candidate words. Then, we utilize search engine to enrich candidate words with adequate semantic features. Finally, we reorder candidate words according to their semantic relatedness to the seed word. Experimental results on a Chinese input method dataset show that our method gains better performance.
