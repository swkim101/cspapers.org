When Object-Oriented languages are applied to distributed problem solving, the form of communication restricted to direct message sending is not flexible enough to naturally express complex interactions among the objects. We transformed the Tuple Space Communication Model[29] for better affinity with Object-Oriented computation, and integrated it as an alternative method of communication among the distributed objects. To avoid the danger of potential bottleneck, we formulated an algorithm that makes concurrent pattern matching activities within the Tuple Space possible.
