Events and their coreference offer useful semantic and discourse resources. We show that the semantic and discourse aspects of events interact with each other. However, traditional approaches addressed event extraction and event coreference resolution either separately or sequentially, which limits their interactions. This paper proposes a document-level structured learning model that simultaneously identifies event triggers and resolves event coreference. We demonstrate that the joint model outperforms a pipelined model by 6.9 BLANC F1 and 1.8 CoNLL F1 points in event coreference resolution using a corpus in the biology domain.
