Liquid cooling shows great potential in resolving the huge thermal obstacle in 3D ICs. However, it brings new challenges including large thermal gradient and high pumping requirement. In this paper, liquid cooling networks with flexible topology are investigated to achieve more desirable trade-offs between energy efficiency and thermal profile. Specifically, a fast thermal model for the cooling network is proposed and analyzed, followed by our optimization methodologies to construct cooling networks targeting at pumping power saving and thermal gradient reduction, respectively. Experimental results show that, under the same constraints, the cooling network can save as much as 84.03% pumping power or reduce 37.65% thermal gradient compared to straight microchannels.
