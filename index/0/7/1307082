An important class of queries is the LIKE predicate in SQL. In the absence of an index, LIKE queries are subject to performance degradation. The notion of indexing on substrings (or <i>q</i>-grams) has been explored earlier without sufficient consideration of efficiency. <i>q</i>-grams are used to prune away rows that do not qualify for the query. The problem is to identify a finite number of grams subject to storage constraint that gives maximal pruning for a given query workload. Our contributions include: i) a formal problem definition, that produces results within a provable error bound, ii) performance evaluation of the application of the novel method to real data, and iii) parallelization of the algorithm, scaling considerations and a proposal to handle scaling issues.
