This poster proposes a novel approach for generating summaries for ontology search. Following previous work, we define ontology summarization as the problem of ranking and selecting RDF sentences, for which we examine three aspects. Firstly, to assess the salience of RDF sentences in an ontology, we devise a bipartite graph model for representing the ontology and analyze random walks on this graph. Secondly, to reflect how an ontology is matched with user needs expressed via keyword queries, we incorporate query relevance into the selection of RDF sentences. Finally, to improve the unity of a summary, we optimize its cohesion in terms of the connections between constituent RDF sentences. We have implemented an online prototype system called Falcons Ontology Search.
