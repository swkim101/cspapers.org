Although we do not profess to be capable of defining a ' roadmap' for the mathematical foundations of SE over the next ten years, we can discern some important steps that would be extremely useful for the systematisat ion of design knowledge. The focal point is the concept o f normal design, in t roduced by [13] to descr ibe the systematic approach of mature engineering disciplines to standard design problems. It is worthy o f note that the mathematics (and science) used by engineers is not the same as those used by mathematicians (and scientists). Using his categorisation of engineering knowledge and a f ramework based on the ep i s t emology o f science developed by the logical empiricists, we were able to outline some useful theoretical and methodological issues, which would contribute to developing a mature SE praxis.
