We propose and empirically evaluate a method for the extraction of expert-comprehensible rules from trained neural networks. Our method operates in the context of a three-step process for learning that uses rule-based domain knowledge in combination with neural networks. Empirical tests using real-worlds problems from molecular biology show that the rules our method extracts from trained neural networks: closely reproduce the accuracy of the network from which they came, are superior to the rules derived by a learning system that directly refines symbolic rules, and are expert-comprehensible.
