We show that computing a relative---that is, multiplicative as opposed to additive---approximate Nash equilibrium in two-player games is PPAD-complete, even for constant values of the approximation. Our result is the first constant inapproximability result for the problem, since the appearance of the original results on the complexity of the Nash equilibrium [8, 5, 7]. Moreover, it provides an apparent---assuming that PPAD âŠˆ TIME(nO(log n))---dichotomy between the complexities of additive and relative notions of approximation, since for constant values of additive approximation a quasi-polynomial-time algorithm is known [22]. Such a dichotomy does not arise for values of the approximation that scale with the size of the game, as both relative and additive approximations are PPAD-complete [7]. As a byproduct, our proof shows that the Lipton-Markakis-Mehta sampling lemma is not applicable to relative notions of constant approximation, answering in the negative direction a question posed to us by Shang-Hua Teng [26].
