This paper presents VHDL-AMS model of an automotive vibration isolation seating system with an active electromechanical actuator. Five control algorithms for the actuator are implemented and their efficiencies are investigated by subjecting the system to a number of stimuli, such as a single jolt or noisy harmonic excitations. Simulations were carried out using the SystemVision simulator and results are shown to compare the relative performance merits of the control methods.
