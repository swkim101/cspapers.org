Addressed is the uplink access control problem for cellular CDMA systems that service heterogeneous traffic with various types of quality-of-service (&OS) and use Multi-Code CDMA (MC-CDMA) t o support variable bit rates. Considering its distinct QoS requirements, class-1 real-time traffic (e.g., voice and video) is differentiated from class-11 nonreal-time traffic (e.g., data). Connection-oriented transmission is achieved by assigning transmitter-oriented code channels for class-1 traffic where each corresponding mobile client needs to pass an admission test. Class-II traffic is transmitted in a best-effort manner using the bandwidth left unused by class-1 traffic and a transmission-rate request access scheme: whenever a mobile has class-11 messages to transmit, the mobile requests code channels via a receiveroriented transmission-request code channel, then, according to the base station scheduling, the transmission is scheduled and permitted. Addressed are the admission test for class-1 connections, power control, and how to maximize the aggregate throughput for class-11 trafiic. The admission region of voice and video connections and the optimum target signalto-interference ratio (SIR) of class-11 traftic are derived numerically. The performance of class-11 traffic transmissions in terms of average delay is also evaluated and discussed based on simulations.
