The <i>windows scheduling problem</i> is defined by the positive <i>integers h</i> and <i>w</i><inf>1</inf>, <i>w</i><inf>2</inf>,…, <i>w<inf>n</inf>.</i> The <i>window w<inf>i</inf></i> is associated with <i>page i</i> and <i>h</i> is the number of <i>slotted channels</i> available for broadcasting the pages. A schedule that solves the problem assigns pages to slots such that the gap between any two consecutive appearances of page <i>i</i> is at most <i>w<inf>i</inf></i> slots. We investigate two optimization problems. (i) The <i>optimal windows scheduling problem:</i> given <i>w</i><inf>1</inf>,…, <i>w<inf>n</inf></i> find a schedule in which <i>h</i> is minimized. (ii) The <i>optimal harmonic windows scheduling problem</i>: given <i>h</i> find a schedule for the windows <i>w<inf>i</inf></i> = <i>i</i> in which <i>n</i> is maximized. The former is a formulation of the problem of minimizing the bandwidth in push systems that support guaranteed delay and the latter is a formulation of the problem of minimizing the startup delay in media-on-demand systems. For the optimal windows scheduling problem we present an algorithm that constructs asymptotically close to optimal schedules and for the optimal harmonic windows scheduling problem, we show how to achieve the largest known <i>n</i>'s for all values of <i>h.</i>
