We here examine the current state of brute-force chess programs. We are interested in their strong points and how these are achieved, and in their weak points and what can be done about them. We compare some excellent play by Belle, the current World Computer Chess Champion, with what expert humans would do in the same situation. These comparisons show that such programs already are capable of displaying what is usually called imagination and understanding. Finally, we examine the prospects for a brute-force program in championship level play.
