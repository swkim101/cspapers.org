This Paper addresses the problem of nonholonomic motion planning for a bi-steerable car. The kinematic speci city of this system is the turning of its rear wheels as a function of the steering angle of the front wheels. The bi-steerable car was shown to be at. The aim of this work is to present its linearizing outputs. The computation of these outputs is the major step that allows us to propose the rst motion planner for a general bi-steerable car based on a suitable steering technique. We nish the paper with some simulation results on the Cycab robot, our experimental bi-steerable platform.
