Currently, one of the major bottlenecks in digital design is synthesis. Each iteration of a design takes several hours to synthesize, putting pressure on designers to carefully consider when to submit jobs and wait for the delayed feedback. This delay is especially important in FPGA emulation, when synthesis is performed frequently while fixing the system functionality. This work proposes LiveSynth, a different approach for digital design with relatively quick feedback after small, incremental changes. Our approach delivers results with close-to-optimal quality-within a few seconds of processing time in most cases. LiveSynth was able to improve synthesis time by about 10Ã— with minimal impact on QoR.
