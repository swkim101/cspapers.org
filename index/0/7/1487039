To address the non-stationary property of aging patterns, age estimation can be cast as an ordinal regression problem. However, the processes of extracting features and learning a regression model are often separated and optimized independently in previous work. In this paper, we propose an End-to-End learning approach to address ordinal regression problems using deep Convolutional Neural Network, which could simultaneously conduct feature learning and regression modeling. In particular, an ordinal regression problem is transformed into a series of binary classification sub-problems. And we propose a multiple output CNN learning algorithm to collectively solve these classification sub-problems, so that the correlation between these tasks could be explored. In addition, we publish an Asian Face Age Dataset (AFAD) containing more than 160K facial images with precise age ground-truths, which is the largest public age dataset to date. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address ordinal regression problems by using CNN, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both the MORPH and AFAD datasets.
