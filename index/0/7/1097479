Spectrum agility (SA) is a novel way of improving spectrum utilization efficiency and making greater bandwidth available to network applications. Despite its advantages, the fundamental operations (e.g., periodic spectrum sensing) involved in realizing SA can also adversely affect application performance. We propose Context-Aware Spectrum Agility (CASA), which uses application hints together with the current channel condition to adapt key SA parameters. Our preliminary evaluation shows that CASA improves throughput by 35%, and is also more effective in meeting application demands than conventional SA.
