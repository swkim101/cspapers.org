Features are added to an existing system to add functionality. A new feature interacts with an existing feature if the behavior of the existing feature is changed by the presence of the new feature. Our research group has started to investigate how to detect feature interactions during the requirements phase of feature development. We have adopted a layered state-transition machine model that prioritizes features and avoids interactions due to non-determinism. We have a tabular notation for specifying behavioral requirements of services and features. Specifications are composed into a reachability graph, and the graph is searched for feature interactions. This paper demonstrates how reachability analysis has been used to automatically detect known control interactions, data interactions, and resource contentions among telephony features.
