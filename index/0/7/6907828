We address the problem of discovering the influential nodes in social networks under the voter model, which allows multiple activations to the same node, by defining an integral influence maximization problem in a long term. We analyze the problem formulation and present an exact solution to the maximization problem. We also provide a sufficient condition for the convergence of the integral influence. We experimentally compare the exact solution with other heuristic algorithms in the aspects of quality and efficiency.
