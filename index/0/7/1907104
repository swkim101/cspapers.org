Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are believed to hold the potential to assist "bag-of-words" Information Retrieval (IR) in terms of retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we report a natural language based IR approach where the common syntactic structures between documents and the query is regarded to as a query-dependent feature for documents. Specifically, a "structural weight" is proposed for query terms, which can be seen as a weight to model the degree of term's involvement in the common syntactic structures. This structural weight is used together with the TF-IDF weighting scheme, which results in a new ranking function. The accumulation of this structural weight of all the query terms in the new ranking function will be seen as a measure of how much a document and a query share the common syntactic structures. The experimental results show that by using this ranking function, significant improvements in the retrieval performance are achieved.
