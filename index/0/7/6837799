We provide improved bounds on the size of cache-oblivious range reporting data structures that achieve the optimal query bound of O(log<sub><i>B</i></sub> <i>N</i> + <i>K</i>/<i>B</i>) block transfers. Our first main result is an O(<i>N</i>√log <i>N</i> log log <i>N</i>)-space data structure that achieves this query bound for 3-d dominance reporting and 2-d three-sided range reporting. No cache-oblivious o(<i>N</i> log <i>N</i>/log log <i>N</i>)-space data structure for these problems was known before, even when allowing a query bound of O(log<sub>2</sub><sup>O(1)</sup> <i>N</i> + <i>K</i>/<i>B</i>) block transfers. Our result also implies improved space bounds for general 2-d and 3-d orthogonal range reporting. Our second main result shows that any cache-oblivious 2-d three-sided range reporting data structure with the optimal query bound has to use Ω(<i>N</i> log<sup>ε</sup> <i>N</i>) space, thereby improving on a recent lower bound for the same problem. Using known transformations, the lower bound extends to 3-d dominance reporting and 3-d halfspace range reporting.
