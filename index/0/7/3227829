An approach to automatic detection of syllable structure is presented. We demonstrate a novel application of EM-based clustering to multivariate data, exemplified by the induction of 3- and 5-dimensional probabilistic syllable classes. The qualitative evaluation shows that the method yields phonologically meaningful syllable classes. We then propose a novel approach to grapheme-to-phoneme conversion and show that syllable structure represents valuable information for pronunciation systems.
