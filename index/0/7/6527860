This paper presents an overview of The System Architect's Workbench, a behavioral synthesis system under development at Carnegie Mellon University. This system converts an abstract behavioral description of a piece of hardware into a set of register-transfer components and a control sequence table. Two-synthesis methodologies are supported: one is tuned specifically to design microprocessors, and the other supports a more general design style. Results are presented here for both approaches.
