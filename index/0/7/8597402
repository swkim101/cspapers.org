Many design professionals assemble collections of off-theshelf software applications into toolbelts to perform their job. These designers use several different tools to create a variety of design representations. This case study shows how designers evolve initially generic toolbelts through a process of domain-enriching to make their own domainspecific design environments. Comparing this practice with theoretical findings concerning design processes highlights the benefits and limitations of this toolbelt approach. A key benefit is its flexible support for creating and evolving multiple design representations. A key limitation is how it hinders iterative design by making it difficult for designers to maintain consistency across the different design representations. This limitation could be remedied if tools could be extended or "tuned" to support the observed domain-enriching process. Such tuning would enable designers to extend tools during use to: (1) support important domain distinctions and (2) define dependencies between different design representations based on these domain distinctions.
