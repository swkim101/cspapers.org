This paper presents a novel idea in teaching computer architecture by using programmable hardware. Current teaching models for computer architecture today are either mostly theory-only or implementation oriented. Theory-based architecture courses lack the feedback to show students the effects of their decisions. Implementation-oriented instruction emphasizes the implementation aspects, that is, very low-level implementation strategies, over CPU architecture and forces the usage of very limited CPU designs to reduce complexity. High cost and long manufacturing times are other problems associated with this approach.
We propose to use field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to allow fast implementation of chip designs. This allows for a fast debug cycle, as designs can be altered and downloaded in a matter of hours. As FPGAs are pretested, only logic functionality has to be validated, reducing the time to get a workable implementation of a chip considerably.
