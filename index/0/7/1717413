Important for user experience on mobile devices, app launch responsiveness has received many recent attentions. This paper reveals a principled pitfall in previous studies. Most of these studies have used average reduction of response delays as the metric for responsiveness. Through a systematic user study and statistical analysis, this paper shows that the metric fails to faithfully reflect user experienced responsiveness. To avoid the pitfall, a straight-forward solution is to employ users' direct feedback as the responsiveness metric, which is unfortunately hard to obtain. This paper presents the promise of solving the dilemma through a SatScore model. It further demonstrates some new opportunities for responsiveness enhancement enabled by the SatScore model.
