The theme of this workshop is to bridge data mining and visual analytics for information and knowledge management. The topics include, but not limited to, the following: Big data mining and visual analytics, theory and foundations -- Knowledge discovery with data mining and visual analytics technologies -- Fusion, mining and visualization of rich and heterogeneous data source -- Security and privacy issues in data mining and visual analytics systems -- Information, social and biological graph mining and visualization -- Novel methods on visualization-oriented data mining -- Visual representations and interaction techniques of data mining results -- Data management and knowledge representation including scalable data representations -- Mathematical foundations and algorithms in data mining to allow interactive visual analysis -- Analytical reasoning including the human analytic, knowledge discovery, perception, and collaborative visual analytics -- Evaluation methods for data mining algorithms and visual analytics systems -- Applications of visual analytics and data mining techniques, including but not limited to applications in science, engineering, public safety, commerce, etc. The DAVA'16 workshop includes 3 invited keynote talks, 2 paper sessions and some posters. Authors of accepted oral papers give 20-minute presentation on their papers. Three keynote speakers from both data mining and visualization give invited talks in this workshop (40-minute each). The DAVA'16 organization committee selects one paper of the highest quality to receive the DAVA'16 best paper award and a cash award of $300. An extended version of the selected papers will be recommended to Chinese of Journal Electronics (SCI-indexed) or International Journal of Software and Informatics (IJSI) as a special issue on visual analytics.
