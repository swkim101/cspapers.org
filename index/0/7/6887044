The Language INtegrated Query (LINQ) language is a declarative query language integrated within an object-oriented programming language that provides a unified paradigm for querying relations, objects, and XML (ROX). This paper describes a suite of exercises, from cooperative in-class activities to larger-scale graded assignments, for incorporating LINQ into the database curriculum. These exercises support various student learning outcomes and illustrate the applicability of LINQ by querying the same database enterprise across the ROX data models.
