This paper describes the current state of the SEMSYN project, whose goal is to develop a module for generation of German from a semantic representation. The first application of this module is within the framework of a Japanese/German machine translation project. The generation process is organized into three stages that use distinct knowledge sources. The first stage is conceptually oriented and language independent, and exploits case and concept schemata. The second stage employs realization schemata which specify choices to map from meaning structures into German linguistic constructs. The last stage constructs the surface string using knowledge about syntax, morphology, and style. This paper describes the first two stages.
