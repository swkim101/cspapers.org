We introduce a soft-matter sensor that measures elastic pressure and shear deformation. The sensor is composed of a sheet of elastomer that is embedded with fluidic parallel-plate capacitors. When the elastomer is pressed or sheared, the electrodes of the embedded capacitors come closer together or slide past each other, respectively, leading to a change in capacitance. The magnitude and direction of the shear deformation is established by comparing the change in capacitance of multiple embedded capacitors. We characterize the soft sensor theoretically and experimentally. Experiments indicate that 2D shear and pressure deformation can be discriminated with approximately 500 Î¼m and 5 kPa sensitivity, respectively. The theoretical predictions and experimental results are in reasonable agreement. We also propose improvements to the fabrication method in order to facilitate integration of soft-matter sensing with wearable electronics.
