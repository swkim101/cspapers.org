This paper presents a practical and novel model for behavioral user profile construction using causal relationships. Causal relationships are extracted from behavior sequences for building user profiles. Our model discovers significant patterns from behavior sequences, then it discovers patterns associations using normalized mutual information. Causal relationships between significant patterns are then identified using the transfer entropy approach. We empirically demonstrate that these causality-based profiles accurately describe users profiles and allow developing practical Ubicomp applications.
