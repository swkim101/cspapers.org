This paper presents ongoing work that intends to simplify the introduction of everyday applications to interactive tabletops. SLAP Widgets bring tangible general-purpose widgets to tabletops while providing the flexibility of on-screen controls. Madgets maintain consistency between physical controls and their digital state. BendDesk represents our vision of a multi-touch enabled office environment. Our pattern language captures knowledge for the design of interactive tabletops. For each project, we describe its technical background, present the current state of research, and discuss future work.
