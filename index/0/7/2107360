We demonstrate a simple and easy-to-use system to produce logical semantic representations of sentences. Our software operates by composing semantic formulas bottom-up given a CCG parse tree. It uses flexible semantic templates to specify semantic patterns. Templates for English and Japanese accompany our software, and they are easy to understand, use and extend to cover other linguistic phenomena or languages. We also provide scripts to use our semantic representations in a textual entailment task, and a visualization tool to display semantically augmented CCG trees in HTML.
