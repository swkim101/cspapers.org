Children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) have social communication difficulties partly due to their abnormal avoidance of eye contact on human faces, yet they have a normal visual processing strategy on cartoon face. In this paper, we present KinToon, a face-to-face communication enhancement system to help ASD children in their training lessons. Our system use Kinect to scan human face and extract key points from facial contour, and match them to corresponding key points of a cartoon face. A modified cartoon face is projected to the communicator's face to achieve the effect of dynamic "makeup". ASD children will finally talk to the communicator with dynamic cartoon makeup, which would reduce their stress of interacting with people and make them easier to understand emotions. The interactive devices were applied to an ASD training lesson, and our creative approach was examined to be relatively effective in encouraging ASD children to fetch more emotional information and have more eye contact with people by eye tracking.
