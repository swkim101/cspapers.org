We present an algorithm which provably reconstructs a collection of curves with corners and endpoints from a sample set that satisfies a certain sampling condition. The algorithm outputs a polygonal reconstruction that contains the edges in the correct reconstruction of the curves and such that any additional edge between sample points is justified. Furthermore, we show that for any such collection of curves, there exists a sample set such that a slightly modified version of our algorithm outputs exactly the correct reconstruction. The algorithm also performs quite well in practice.
