In this paper, we present a novel Deep Decision Network (DDN) that provides an alternative approach towards building an efficient deep learning network. During the learning phase, starting from the root network node, DDN automatically builds a network that splits the data into disjoint clusters of classes which would be handled by the subsequent expert networks. This results in a tree-like structured network driven by the data. The proposed method provides an insight into the data by identifying the group of classes that are hard to classify and require more attention when compared to others. DDN also has the ability to make early decisions thus making it suitable for timesensitive applications. We validate DDN on two publicly available benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 and it yields state-of-the-art classification performance on both the datasets. The proposed algorithm has no limitations to be applied to any generic classification problems.
