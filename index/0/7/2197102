Recent research on handheld projector interaction has expanded the display and interaction space of handheld devices by projecting information onto the physical environment around the user, but has mainly focused on single-user scenarios. We extend this prior single-user research to co-located multi-user interaction using multiple handheld projectors. We present a set of interaction techniques for supporting co-located collaboration with multiple handheld projectors, and discuss application scenarios enabled by them.
