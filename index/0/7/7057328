Student examination performance in a third-year module, "Communications, Networks and Distributed Systems" (CNDS), is analyzed in terms of different responses to questions which required qualitative versus quantitative answers. This is matched to the results of a student survey conducted in the first lecture, in which students were asked about what they would hope to gain from the module. The observations indicate that there are significant differences in the manner in which students learn computer science, and that this may correlate with expectations about desired learning outcomes. This impacts upon aspects of course design and delivery, as well as approaches to assessment (and examination design in particular). It also suggests that examinations may be regarded as offering new avenues of feedback on student learning in addition to fulfilling traditional assessment related roles.
