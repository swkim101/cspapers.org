Future distributed systems a.re expected to support mobile computing through wireless extensions. In such environments, the spatial location of system resources, such as servers, can change dynamically as a result of host mobility. Consequently, a search or discovery cost is incurred whenever a client requests use of a mobile resource whose location is unknown. In addition, because of the acute dependence of radio link performance on the characteristics of indoor operating environments, the Quality of Service experienced by a client that utilizes a mobile resource can depend on the resource's specific location. The work reported in this paper proposes and evaluates a statistical framework for resource discovery in distributed computing environments with mobile hosts. Specifically, taking the peculiar attributes of wireless segments of the distributed system into account, we investigate the interplay between the cost of search for potentially mobile resources and the utility or benefit accrued to clients that require such resources. This interplay has important ramifications for resource allocation in distributed mobile computing environments.
