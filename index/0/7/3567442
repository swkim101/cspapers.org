In order to develop provably safe human-in-the-loop systems, accurate and precise models of human behavior must be developed. Driving is a good example of such a system because the driver has full control of the vehicle, and her likely actions are highly dependent on her mental state and the context of the current situation. This paper presents a testbed for collecting driver data that allows us to collect realistic data, while maintaining safety and control of the environmental surroundings. We extend previous work that focuses on set predictions consisting of trajectories observed from the nonlinear dynamics and behaviors of the human driven car, accounting for the driver mental state, the context or situation that the vehicle is in, and the surrounding environment in both highway and intersection scenarios. This allows us to predict driving behavior over long time horizons with extremely high accuracy. By using this realistic data and flexible algorithm, a precise and accurate driver model can be developed that is tailored to an individual and usable in semi-autonomous frameworks.
