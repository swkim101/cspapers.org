Stochastic Shortest Path problems (SSPs) can be efficiently dealt with by the Real-Time Dynamic Programming algorithm (RTDP). Yet, RTDP requires that a goal state is always reachable, what can be checked easily for a certain SSP, and with a more complex algorithm for an uncertain SSP, i.e. where only a possible interval is known for each transition probability. This paper makes a simplified description of these two processes, and demonstrates how the time consuming uncertain analysis can be dramatically speeded up. The main improvement still needed is to turn to a symbolic analysis in order to avoid a complete state-space enumeration.
