This special session will report on the work of the Computer Science Small Department Initiative (CS_SDI) in three areas. The first is the identification of strengths and challenges that are typically found in small departments (5 or fewer FTE CS faculty). The second area is relating the CC2001 guidelines directly to small departments. The third area is a set of departmental guidelines for areas such as faculty load and maintaining a departmental lab. The website for this work can be found at http://csis.olivet.edu/cs_sdi.
