We develop new schemes for anonymous authentication that support identity escrow. Our protocols also allow a prover to demonstrate membership in an arbitrary subset of users; key revocation is an important special case of this feature. Using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, our interactive authentication protocols yield new constructions for non-interactive group signature schemes. We use the higher-residuosity assumption, which leads to greater efficiency and more natural security proofs than previous constructions. It also leads to an increased vulnerability to collusion attacks, although countermeasures are available.
