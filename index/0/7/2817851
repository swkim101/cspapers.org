PL/CV is a new formal system which mixes commands and assertions. It includes axioms and rules for a theory of programming over integers and characters. Since arguments in the theory can be checked by the PL/CV Proof Checker, the system offers an approach to mechanical program verification. The Proof Checker is efficient enough for classroom use. Early experience with PL/CV indicates that it nicely supports formal verification of elementary arguments. Continued work should enable the formalization of non-elementary reasoning as well.
