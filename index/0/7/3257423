Most of the modern Integrated Development Environments are developed with plug-in based architectures that can be extended with additional functionalities and plug-ins, according to user needs. However, extending an IDE is still a possibility restricted to developers with deep knowledge about the specific development environment and its architecture. In this paper we present MASH, a tool that eases the programming of Integrated Development Environments. The tool supports the definition of workflows that can be quickly designed to integrate functionalities offered by multiple plugins, without the need of knowing anything about the internal architecture of the IDE. Workflows can be easily reshaped every time an analysis must be modified, without the need of producing Java code and deploying components in the IDE. Early results suggest that this approach can effectively facilitate programming of IDEs.
