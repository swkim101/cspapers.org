An algorithm for semantic interpretation is explained. The algorithm is based on predicates defined for WordNet verb classes. The algorithm is driven by the definition of these predicates whose thematic roles are linked to the WordNet ontology for nouns and to the syntactic relations that realize them. The algorithm has been tested in the identification of the meaning of the verb, thematic roles, and temporal and spatial adjuncts.
