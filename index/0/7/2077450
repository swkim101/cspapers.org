The next generation of advanced mechatronic systems is expected to use its software to exploit local and global networking capabilities to enhance their functionality and to adapt their local behavior when beneficial. Such systems will therefore include complex hard real-time coordination at the network level. This coordination is further reflected locally by complex reconfiguration in form of mode management and control algorithms. We present in this paper the integration of two tools which allow the integrated specification of real-time coordination and traditional control engineering specifically targeting the required complex reconfiguration of the local behavior.
