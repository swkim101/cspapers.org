We derive the correspondence between regularization operators used in Regularization Networks and Hilbert Schmidt Kernels appearing in Support Vector Machines. More specifically, we prove that the Green's Functions associated with regularization operators are suitable Support Vector Kernels with equivalent regularization properties. As a by-product we show that a large number of Radial Basis Functions namely conditionally positive definite functions may be used as Support Vector kernels.
