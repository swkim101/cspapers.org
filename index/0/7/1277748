In full-c hip elecrothermal analysis, the substrate is usually discretized into a lumped 3-D network to simulate the heat flow, which is computationally inefficient due to the numerous internal nodes represen ting the substrate interior. Y et traditional interconnect model reduction techniques are not v ery effectiv e at handling complex mlti-port networks with large port counts. In this work we overcome this limitation b y applying time-domain approximation techniques such as ARWE and Prony's method to further simplify the reduced substrate thermal netw ork. Experiments show that our method provides highly accurate simulation results with performance improvement in the range of 2x to 5x.
