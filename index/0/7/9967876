The Automated Logic Diagram, or ALD, is a well defined document prepared by engineers to specify the design of a machine. 1 The document is coded for computer input by highly trained transcription personnel. Changes or corrections are batched for a master file update computer run. Because of the number of queues involved, a day or more is normally required to complete this process.
 A project was undertaken to investigate the utility of a graphic display device as a direct interface between the designer and the computerized data base. The purpose was to drastically reduce the turnaround time of updating ALD's.
 In this paper, the format and contents of the ALD are first defined. This will aid the reader in understanding the document which this project was designed to display and update at the graphic console.
