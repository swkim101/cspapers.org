In this demonstration we show drag-and-drop distribution of centralized, modular Java applications.
 Our system is based on OSGi, an industry standard for building Java applications out of modular units loosely connected through services. Since OSGi is a centralized system, we have elaborated a solution to seamlessly distribute OSGi applications along the boundaries of services and thereby turning arbitrary OSGi applications into distributed applications. In this demonstration, we present an Eclipse based tool that takes the source code of an OSGi application as input, produces a graph of its modules and module dependencies, and allows the user to deploy the application across a distributed system by dragging-and-dropping its constituent modules on different machines. By defining constraints on the distribution, the tool can also support advanced features like load-balancing or redundancy of modules.
