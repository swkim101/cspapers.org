In this work, we present the SmartBridge, a novel bridge section model equipped with actively controlled arrays of flaps aiming at mitigating wind-induced vibrations of long-span bridges. The active model, as well as its support structure, is described in detail and the key design choices are motivated. Finally, the capabilities of the system and the active control of the bridge section model with moving flaps was validated by wind tunnel experiments. In spite of the relative simplicity of a, manually tuned, control law, the results are encouraging and show a significant damping of the pitch vibration of the deck.
