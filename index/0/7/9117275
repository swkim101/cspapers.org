Maintaining high annotation consistency in large corpora is crucial for statistical learning; however, such work is hard, especially for tasks containing semantic elements. This paper describes predicate argument structure analysis using transformation-based learning. An advantage of transformation-based learning is the readability of learned rules. A disadvantage is that the rule extraction procedure is time-consuming. We present incremental-based, transformation-based learning for semantic processing tasks. As an example, we deal with Japanese predicate argument analysis and show some tendencies of annotators for constructing a corpus with our method.
