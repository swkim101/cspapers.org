Web Applications typically have longer launch times compared to native applications, especially upon device boot up or if the browser is not already running in the background. In this paper, we propose an approach to speed up the launch time for web applications, by considering the user's usage of web applications and pre-launching the predicted web applications. We provide implementation details of our model and perform experiments on various web applications to measure the effectiveness of the framework for fast launch of the applications after the device boots.
