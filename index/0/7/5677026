Traditional search systems generally present a ranked list of documents as answers to user queries. In aggregated search systems, results from different and increasingly diverse verticals (image, video, news, etc.) are returned to users. For instance, many such search engines return to users both images and web documents as answers to the query "flower". Aggregated search has become a very popular paradigm. In this paper, we go one step further and study a different search paradigm: composite retrieval. Rather than returning and merging results from different verticals, as is the case with aggregated search, we propose to return to users a set of "bundles", where a bundle is composed of "cohesive" results from several verticals. For example, for the query "London Olympic", one bundle per sport could be returned, each containing results extracted from news, videos, images, or Wikipedia. Composite retrieval can promote exploratory search in a way that helps users understand the diversity of results available for a specific query and decide what to explore in more detail. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a variety of approaches to construct bundles that are relevant, cohesive and diverse. Compared with three baselines (traditional "general web only" ranking, federated search ranking and aggregated search), our evaluation results demonstrate significant performance improvement for a highly heterogeneous web collection.
