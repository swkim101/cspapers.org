Decoding algorithms for syntax based machine translation suffer from high computational complexity, a consequence of intersecting a language model with a context free grammar. Left-to-right decoding, which generates the target string in order, can improve decoding efficiency by simplifying the language model evaluation. This paper presents a novel left to right decoding algorithm for tree-to-string translation, using a bottom-up parsing strategy and dynamic future cost estimation for each partial translation. Our method outperforms previously published tree-to-string decoders, including a competing left-to-right method.
