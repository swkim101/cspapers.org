In this paper, we present a real time remote triggered laboratory which has multi-set, multi-group of wireless sensor network experimental setup which is envisioned to provide a practical experience of designing and implementing wireless sensor networks' algorithms in both indoor and outdoor conditions. The architecture provides a remote code editing mechanism using deluge protocol that offers the user a flexible environment for the experimentation. Central and local authentication agents serve a two level security mechanism which makes the system robust to security threats. The lab is accessible for all the students in the world through internet and it will provide an intuitive web-based interface, where registered users can access the code and do code editing.
