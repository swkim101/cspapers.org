This paper proposes online offering strategies for a storage-assisted renewable power producer that participates in hour-ahead electricity market. The online strategy determines the offering price and volume, while no exact or stochastic future information is available in a time-coupled setting in the presence of the storage. The proposed online strategy achieves the best possible competitive ratio of O(log θ), where θ is the ratio between the maximum and minimum clearing prices. Trace-driven experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves close-to-optimal performance.
