Designing optimal pricing policies and mechanisms for allocating tasks to workers is central to the online crowdsourcing markets. In this paper, we consider the following realistic setting of online crowdsourcing markets -- there is a requester with a limited budget and a heterogeneous set of tasks each requiring certain skills; there is a pool of workers and each worker has certain expertise and interests which define the set of tasks she can and is willing to do. Under the matching constraints given by this bipartite graph between workers and tasks, we design our incentive-compatible mechanism truthuniform which allocates the tasks to the workers, while ensuring budget feasibility and achieves near-optimal utility for the requester. Apart from strong theoretical guarantees, we carry out experiments on a realistic case study of Wikipedia translation project on Mechanical Turk. We note that this is the first paper to address this setting from a mechanism design perspective.
