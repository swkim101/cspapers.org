Scientists and artists share a conviction that key elements of their work-creativity, craft, analysis, intuition--are somehow deeply similar. Most Onward! participants will have a clear sense of the scientific variants of these qualities, and of what it takes to manifest them in our day-to-day work as researchers and software designers. This talk looks at how ideas are developed and refined in the making of visual art, how the same qualities--especially creativity, the most ineffable--come into play, and how artists and scientists grapple with the various fears that beset creative work.
