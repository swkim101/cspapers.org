We propose to use coreference chains extracted from a large corpus as a resource for semantic tasks. We extract three million coreference chains and train word embeddings on them. Then, we compare these embeddings to word vectors derived from raw text data and show that coreference-based word embeddings improve F1 on the task of antonym classification by up to .09.
