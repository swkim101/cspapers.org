This paper deals with a novel, distributed, QoS-aware, peer-to-peer checkpointing arrangement component for <u>Mo</u>bile <u>G</u>rid (MoG) computing systems middleware. Checkpointing is more crucial in MoG systems than in their wired counterparts due to node mobility and less reliable wireless links resulting in frequent and dynamic connections and disconnections. Having determined the globally optimal checkpoint arrangement to be NP-complete, we consider ReD, our Reliability Driven (ReD) protocol, employing QoS-aware heurisitcs, for constucting superior peer-to-peer checkpointing arrangements efficiently.
