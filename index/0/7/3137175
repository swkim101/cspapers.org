This paper examines high dimensional regression with noise-contaminated input and output data. Goals of such learning problems include optimal prediction with noiseless query points and optimal system identification. As a first step, we focus on linear regression methods, since these can be easily cast into nonlinear learning problems with locally weighted learning approaches. Standard linear regression algorithms generate biased regression estimates if input noise is present and suffer numerically when the data contains redundancy and irrelevancy. Inspired by Factor Analysis Regression, we develop a variational Bayesian algorithm that is robust to ill-conditioned data, automatically detects relevant features, and identifies input and output noise -- all in a computationally efficient way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques on synthetic data and on a system identification task for a rigid body dynamics model of a robotic vision head. Our algorithm performs 10 to 70% better than previously suggested methods.
