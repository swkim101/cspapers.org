Protocols for establishing, maintaining and terminating connections in packet switched networks have been studied in the literature and numerous standards have been developed to address this problem. In this paper, we reexamine connection establishment in the context of a fast packet network with an integrated traffic load, explain why previously proposed solutions are inadequate and develop a protocol for connection establishment/takedown that is appropriate for such a network. The underlying model that we use is the recently developed PARIS network, though our ideas are sufficiently general to cover many other fast packet networking architectures.
