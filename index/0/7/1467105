This paper presents a method for the automatic generation of a table-of-contents. This type of summary could serve as an effective navigation tool for accessing information in long texts, such as books. To generate a coherent table-of-contents, we need to capture both global dependencies across different titles in the table and local constraints within sections. Our algorithm effectively handles these complex dependencies by factoring the model into local and global components, and incrementally constructing the modelâ€™s output. The results of automatic evaluation and manual assessment confirm the benefits of this design: our system is consistently ranked higher than nonhierarchical baselines.
