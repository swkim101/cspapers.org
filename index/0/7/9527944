The "Killer Examples" series of workshops are highly interactive workshops which have been an annual occurrence at OOPSLA since 2002. The goals of the workshops are to bring together educators and developers to share their object-oriented expertise, and to provide a forum for discussion of teaching techniques and pedagogical goals. The theme of last year's workshop was design patterns; the the theme of this year's workshop is process: for teaching, learning and programming.
 While there is a formal application procedure to guarantee admission to the workshop, we accept walk-ins if space permits and the walk-ins have adequate interest and background to be able to contribute positively to the discussions.
