Dynamic power management features are now an integral part of processor chip and system design. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), core folding and per-core power gating (PCPG) are power control actuators (or "knobs") that are available in modern multi-core systems. However, figuring out the actuation protocol for such knobs in order to achieve maximum efficiency has so far remained an open research problem. In the context of specific system utilization dynamics, the desirable order of applying these knobs is not easy to determine. For complexity-effective algorithm development, DVFS, core folding and PCPG control methods have evolved in a somewhat decoupled manner. However, as we show in this paper, independent actuation of these techniques can lead to conflicting decisions that jeopardize the system in terms of power-performance efficiency. Therefore, a more robust coordination protocol is necessary in orchestrating the power management functions. Heuristics for achieving such coordinated control are already becoming available in server systems. It remains an open research problem to optimally adjust power and performance management options at runtime for a wide range of time-varying workload applications, environmental conditions, and power constraints. This research paper contributes a novel approach for a systematically architected, robust, multi-knob power management protocol, which we empirically analyze on live server systems. We use a latest generation POWER7+ multi-core system to demonstrate the benefits of our proposed new coordinated power management algorithm (called PAMPA). We report measurement-based analysis to show that PAMPA achieves comparable power-performance efficiencies (relative to a baseline decoupled control system) while achieving conflict-free actuation and robust operation.
