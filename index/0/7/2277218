Berman and Hartmanis [BH77] conjectured that there is a polynomial-time computable isomorphism between any two languages m-complete (“Karp” complete) for NP. Joseph and Young [JY85] discovered a structurally defined class of NP-complete sets and conjectured that certain of these sets (the <italic>K<supscrpt>k</supscrpt><subscrpt>ƒ</subscrpt></italic>'s) are not isomorphic to the standard NP-complete sets for some one-way functions ƒ. These two conjectures cannot both be correct.
We introduce a new family of strong one-way functions, the <italic>scrambling</italic> functions. If ƒ is a scrambling function, then <italic>K<supscrpt>k</supscrpt><subscrpt>fnof;</subscrpt></italic> is not isomorphic to the standard NP-complete sets, as Joseph and Young conjectured, and the Berman-Hartmanis conjecture fails. As evidence for the existence of scrambling functions, we show that much more powerful one-way functions--the <italic>annihilating</italic> functions--exist relative to a random oracle.
