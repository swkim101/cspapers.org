The novel concept of Trans-abdominal Active Magnetic Linkage for laparoendoscopic single site surgery has the potential to enable the deployment of a bimanual robotic platform trough a single laparoscopic incision. The main advantage of this approach consists in shifting the actuators outside the body of the patient, while transmitting a controlled robotic motion by magnetic field across the abdomen without the need for dedicated incisions. An actuation mechanism based on this approach can be comprised of multiple anchoring and actuation units, mixed depending upon the specific needs. A static model providing anchoring and actuation forces and torques available at the internal side of the magnetic link was developed to provide a tool to navigate among the many possibilities of such an open ended design approach. The model was assessed through bench top experiments, showing a maximum relative error of 4% on force predictions. An example of a single degree of freedom manipulator actuated with the proposed concept and compatible with a 12-mm access port is able to provide an anchoring force of 3.82 N and an actuation force of 2.95 N.
