We extends the previous 2D cascaded object pose regression work [9] in two aspects so that it works better for 3D articulated objects. Our first contribution is 3D pose-indexed features that generalize the previous 2D parameterized features and achieve better invariance to 3D transformations. Our second contribution is a principled hierarchical regression that is adapted to the articulated object structure. It is therefore more accurate and faster. Comprehensive experiments verify the state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach on the challenging 3D hand pose estimation problem, on a public dataset and our new dataset.
