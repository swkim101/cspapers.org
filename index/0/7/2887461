The AutoWitness project aims to deter, detect, and track theft of everyday objects using a combination of ultra low-power mobile tags and a wide-area network of static anchors. Key research challenges include dramatically driving down the cost and size of tags and increasing their lifetime, discriminating between normal activities and theft using motion detection and classification algorithms, reconstructing getaway trajectories from sparse anchor rendezvous, and ensuring sufficient coverage and connectivity in a sparse, wide-area network of anchors. The demonstration will show AutoWitness in operation including motion detection, classifying theft signatures, and tracking the trajectories of "stolen" objects near the conference venue.
