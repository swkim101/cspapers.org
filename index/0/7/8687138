In the fall of 1983, in anticipation of rapidly increasing demands on the available hardware and faculty by students, the Computer Science Department at Brigham Young University embarked on a project designed to put the best possible technology to use in the classroom. Projections at that time suggested that over 1,000 students per semester would be requesting an introductory skills class in programming. Conventional methods for meeting the increase in the number of students have been to increase the number of faculty and then acquire the additional physical facilities to meet the students' needs. The department decided to moderate the faculty involvement and try to reduce the instructional delivery costs with the effective use of technology.
