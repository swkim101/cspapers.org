Since the introduction of the 10 GbE standard in 2002, the ability of general purpose processors to efficiently process network traffic with common protocols such as TCP/IP has been revisited and critically evaluated. However, recent commercially available processors such as Intelreg Coretrade 2 Duo Processor introduce microarchitectural enhancements that could significantly influence the approach to accelerating network processing. We examine the network performance of a real platform containing Intelreg Coretrade micro-architecture based processors, the role of coherency and a prototype implementation of direct cache placement (direct cache access or DCA) of inbound network traffic. We observe that a substantial portion of the time relates to the inefficiency of I/O specific coherence protocols in the platform. We demonstrate that a relatively, low complexity implementation of DCA called 'Prefetch Hint' provides a 15 to 43% speed-up to receive-side processing across a range of I/O sizes and present a detailed characterization of the benefits.
