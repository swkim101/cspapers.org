This paper describes the propulsion of the catalytic tubular microjet using Navier-Stokes equations. Especially, the thrust capability of the microjet is outstanding compared with the other microsystems, but remains only partially understood. Studies have identified the internal precursory mechanisms of the propulsion of the microjet: its inner wall catalyzes the dismutation of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, and an oxygen bubble is then formed and migrates towards its widest opening. This impulses the propulsion of the microjet towards the opposite direction. However, the precise propellant role of the liquid surrounding the jet remains misunderstood. The same goes for the inner wall of the vessel in which the jet navigates, especially in narrowed environment. This article discusses these aspects in a simplified theoretical framework. Calculations are performed by explicit computation of Navier-Stokes equations. The obtained theoretical outcome are in good agreement with experimental results in the literature.
