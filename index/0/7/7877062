We address the problem of deciding when to spin down the disk of a mobile computer in order to extend bat tery life. Since one of the most critical resources in mobile computing environments is battery life, good energy conservation methods can dramatically increase the utility of mobile systems. We use a simple and ef ficient algorithm based on machine learning techniques that has excellent performance in practice. Our exper imental results are based on traces collected from HP C2474s disks. Using this data, the algorithm outper forms several algorithms that are theoretically optimal in under various worst-case assumptions, as well as the best fixed time-out strategy. In particular, the algo rithm reduces the power consumption of the disk to about half (depending on the disk's properties) of the energy consumed by a one minute fixed time-out. Since the algorithm adapts to usage patterns, it uses as lit tle as 88% of the energy consumed by the best fixed time-out computed in retrospect.
