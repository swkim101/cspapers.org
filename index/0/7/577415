Continuation-based Web servers provide advantages over traditional Web application development through the increase of expressive power they allow. This leads to fewer errors and more productivity for the programmers that adopt them. Unfortunately, existing implementation techniques force a hard choice between scalability and expressiveness. Our technique allows a smoother path to scalable, continuation-based Web programs. We present a modular program transformation that allows scalable Web applications to use third-party, higher-order libraries with higher-order arguments that cause Web interaction. Consequently, our system provides existing Web applications with more scalability through significantly less memory use than the traditional technique.
