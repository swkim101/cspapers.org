The problem of sorting on a one-dimensional sub-bus array of processors is addressed. A one-dimensional sub-bus array has a bus connecting the processors which can be segmented into sub-buses on which an active processor can broadcast. The sub-bus broadcast capability is implemented on the MasPar MP-1 and MP-2 parallel computers. The sub-bus broadcast operation makes possible a new class of parallel sorting algorithms which can be characterized by parallel insertion steps. We restrict our attention to the class of sorting methods where parallel insertion steps are in the same direction, say left. For this class of one-way sorting strategies we prove a lower bound and give two strategies, the left greedy sort and the left adaptive insertion sort, both of which achieve the lower bound. Because our parallel insertion model is quite general, it is not necessarily the case that a sorting strategy in the model can be e ciently implemented on a real sub-bus array of processors. The left greedy sort cannot be e ciently implemented, but the left adaptive insertion sort can be e ciently implemented. The two sorting strategies have di erent properties and each is interesting in its own right.
