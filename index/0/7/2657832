The local multi bottom-up tree transducer is introduced and related to the (non-contiguous) synchronous tree sequence substitution grammar. It is then shown how to obtain a weighted local multi bottom-up tree transducer from a bilingual and biparsed corpus. Finally, the problem of non-preservation of regularity is addressed. Three properties that ensure preservation are introduced, and it is discussed how to adjust the rule extraction process such that they are automatically fulfilled.
