The World Wide Web has not only revolutionized the area of tra- ditional hypermedia, it is also starting to influence adaptive hyper- media research. The main feature of the World Wide Web has been simplicity, standards based protocols and formats, and open envi- ronments and systems. In this paper we will investigate the poten- tial of these aspects for adaptive hypermedia systems, based on a discussion of existing standards useful for adaptive hypermedia and on experiences we have gained through an RDF-based P2P infras- tructure we have been developing in the context of several projects.
