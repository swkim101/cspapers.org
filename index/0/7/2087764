In this paper we present an API for programmatic access to BabelNet -- a wide-coverage multilingual lexical knowledge base -- and multilingual knowledge-rich Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). Our aim is to provide the research community with easy-to-use tools to perform multilingual lexical semantic analysis and foster further research in this direction.
