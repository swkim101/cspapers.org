eCAM is an ultra-compact, high data-rate wireless sensor node(WSN) with a miniature camera. It is constructed by interfacing a VGA quality digital video camera with the Eco node. The purpose of this demo is to show that Eco is not only one of the world's smallest self-contained WSNs, but its expansion capability facilitates the construction of new sensing systems over its expansion port. The results show that Eco is not only ultra-compact but also much higher performance than sensor nodes in its class.
