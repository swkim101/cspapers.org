In this paper is presented a mini-system with compliant minigripper and piezoelectric actuation. The piezoelectric actuator is controlled with ramp and sinus signals. The response of the mini-system is predicted by the finite elements method. The displacement of the compliant mini-gripper and piezoactuator are analyzed. In the end is presented a comparison of the experimental results for same actuator but for two different types of the signals with theoretical results.
