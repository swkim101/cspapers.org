The standard approach to decision tree induction is a top-down greedy agorithm that makes locally optimal irrevocable decisions at each node of a tree. In this paper we empircally study an alternative approach in which the algorithms use one-level lookahead to decide what test to use at a node. we systematically compare using a very large number of artificial data sets the quality of dimension trees induced by the greedy approach to that of trees induced using lookahead. The main observations from our experiments are (1) the greedy approach consistently produced trees that were just as at accurate as trees produced with the much more expensive lookahead step and (n) we observed many instances of pathology, i.e, lookahead produced trees that were both larger and less accurate than trees produced without it.
