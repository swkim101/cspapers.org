Naked Objects is an open-source Java-based framework designed specifically to encourage the creation of business systems from behaviourally-complete business objects. In fact, with the Naked Objects framework you have no alternative but to make your business objects behaviourally-complete. The reason is that the framework exposes core business objects, such as Customer, Product and Order, directly to the user. All user actions consist of invoking methods directly upon those business objects, or sometimes upon the object's class. There are no scripts, no controllers, nor even any dialog boxes in between the user and the 'naked' objects.
