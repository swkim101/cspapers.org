This paper describes research on automatic assessment of the pronunciation quality of spontaneous non-native adult speech. Since the speaking content is not known prior to the assessment, a two-stage method is developed to first recognize the speaking content based on non-native speech acoustic properties and then forced-align the recognition results with a reference acoustic model reflecting native and near-native speech properties. Features related to Hidden Markov Model likelihoods and vowel durations are extracted. Words with low recognition confidence can be excluded in the extraction of likelihood-related features to minimize erroneous alignments due to speech recognition errors. Our experiments on the TOEFLÂ® Practice Online test, an English language assessment, suggest that the recognition/forced-alignment method can provide useful pronunciation features. Our new pronunciation features are more meaningful than an utterance-based normalized acoustic model score used in previous research from a construct point of view.
