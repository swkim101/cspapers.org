Splitting compound words has proved to be useful in areas such as Machine Translation, Speech Recognition or Information Retrieval (IR). Furthermore, real-time IR systems (such as search engines) need to cope with noisy data, as user queries are sometimes written quickly and submitted without review. In this paper we apply a state-of-the-art procedure for German decompounding to other compounding languages, and we show that it is possible to have a single decompounding model that is applicable across languages.
