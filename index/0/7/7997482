We train recurrent networks to control chemotaxis in a computer model of the nematode C. elegans. The model presented is based closely on the body mechanics, behavioral analyses, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of C. elegans, each imposing constraints relevant for information processing. Simulated worms moving autonomously in simulated chemical environments display a variety of chemotaxis strategies similar to those of biological worms.
