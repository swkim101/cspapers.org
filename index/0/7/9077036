A kindergarten is an interesting community of young children. The children continuously share their interactions and experiences, and grow along similar developmental stages. In this setting, studying relative differences among them can be an interesting approach to investigating how to help their individual and social development. In this study, we present our intuition on inter-child behavioral relativity and apply it to a real kindergarten environment. We conduct a close user study necessitating the monitoring of the children's behavior. Then, utilizing wearable sensor technologies, we perform a field study to explore various interesting aspects of behavioral relativity in an automatic and quantitative fashion. We consulted the kindergarten teachers with our results obtained from our field study in order to validate the practical benefits in the kindergarten environment. We further discuss the potential, limitations, and opportunities of our approach.
