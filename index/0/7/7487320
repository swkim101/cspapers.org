The goal of Active Template research is to create a single, unified environment that a data analyst can use to carry out a knowledge discovery project, and to deliver the resulting solution in the form of an Active Template. An Active Template is a hyper-linked information structure that tightly integrates actions (executable programs and commands), results (models, datasets, predictions, reports), and documentation (explanations of decisions, actions, and results). The use of Active Templates provides a number of benefits, including user guidance, improved documentation of actions and results, and increased reuse of previous work.
