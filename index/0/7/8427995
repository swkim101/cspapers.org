However, previous exploratory mechanisms do not address exploration within the space sharing the same heuristic estimate (plateau) and the search bias in a breadth direction. In this abstract, we briefly describe two modes of exploration (diversification), which work inter-(across) and intra-(within) plateau, and also introduce IP-diversification, a method combining Minimum Spanning Tree and randomization, which addresses “breadth”-bias instead of the “depth”-bias addressed by the existing methods.
