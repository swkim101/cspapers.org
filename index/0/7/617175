Our model is based on a combination of multiple GPs with random hyperparameters. The model is trained by incrementally allocating new examples to a selected subset of GPs. The selection is carried out efficiently by optimizing a submodular function. Experiments on real-world data sets showed that our method outperforms existing online GP regression methods in both accuracy and efficiency. The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated by the mouse-trajectory prediction in an Internet banking scenario.
