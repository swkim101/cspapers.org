The 12th ACM SIGSAC Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security (PLAS 2017) is co-located with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). Over its now more than ten-year history, PLAS has provided a unique forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas about programming language and program analysis techniques with the goal of improving the security of software systems. PLAS aims to provide a forum for exploring and evaluating ideas on using programming language and program analysis techniques to improve the security of software systems. Strongly encouraged are proposals of new, speculative ideas, evaluations of new or known techniques in practical settings, and discussions of emerging threats and important problems.
