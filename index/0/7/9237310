A novel approach to perform motion planning on 2 or 3 degrees-of-freedom manipulators utilising a uid motion planning model is proposed. It is demonstrated that through the introduction of transformations, the conventional trajectory planning problem in the conguration space (C-space) can be eciently solved from the closed form solution of the uid motion planner. The proposed motion planner is designed to be computationally ecient for real-time implementation and dynamic environments. The manipulator uid motion planner is demonstrated on a 3-DoF 3-revolute (3R) planar manipulator example. The results show the simplicity, eectiveness and potential of the proposed novel method in manipulator motion planning.
