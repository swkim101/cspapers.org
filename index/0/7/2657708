The release and deployment phase of the software development process is often overlooked as part of broader software engineering research. In this paper, we discuss early results from a set of multiple semi-structured interviews with practicing release engineers. Subjects for the interviews are drawn from a number of different commercial software development organizations, and our interviews focus on why release process faults and failures occur, how organizations recover from them, and how they can be predicted, avoided or prevented in the future. Along the way, the interviews provide insight into the state of release engineering today, and interesting relationships between software architecture and release processes.
