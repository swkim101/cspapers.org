This paper describes a novel approach for generating the code of ECAD frameworks automatically from abstract models. Instead of providing the framework components of a design system in the form of a code library, we favor to use such a 'library' at modeling level. The framework components, common to all design tools, are described by easily understandable base models. For each design tool, the base models will be customized individually to meet the tool-specific requirements. Then, the customized models are input to a code generator that automatically generates tool specific, optimized source code. A generic modeling system and several code generators are implemented in a software generation environment called MOOSE.
