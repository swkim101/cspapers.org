Mining opinion targets from online reviews is an important and challenging task in opinion mining. This paper proposes a novel approach to extract opinion targets by using partially-supervised word alignment model (PSWAM). At first, we apply PSWAM in a monolingual scenario to mine opinion relations in sentences and estimate the associations between words. Then, a graph-based algorithm is exploited to estimate the confidence of each candidate, and the candidates with higher confidence will be extracted as the opinion targets. Compared with existing syntax-based methods, PSWAM can effectively avoid parsing errors when dealing with informal sentences in online reviews. Compared with the methods using alignment model, PSWAM can capture opinion relations more precisely through partial supervision from partial alignment links. Moreover, when estimating candidate confidence, we make penalties on higher-degree vertices in our graph-based algorithm in order to decrease the probability of the random walk running into the unrelated regions in the graph. As a result, some errors can be avoided. The experimental results on three data sets with different sizes and languages show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
