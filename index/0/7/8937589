Many institutions are considering offering a course on mobile application development to harness its popularity to attract new majors, retain those we have, and to motivate learning. The panelists present four experiences in teaching a mobile application development course. They share their experiences in an effort to start a discussion about mobile application development in computing curricula. In the first half of the session, each panelist presents their experience including: an overview of the course; its audience, position in the curriculum, and pre-requisites; the platform, language, and development environment used; positives about the course; and roadblocks and negatives about the course. This provides a foundation for an audience directed discussion in the second half.
