Inspired by the simplicity of how nature solves its problems, we implement a bacteria controller on a physical platform that would enable the localisation and subsequent mapping of environmental pollution. We investigate the effects of each parameter in the controller on the localisation and exploration ability of the platform used. We also present how we can tune the controller for a given environmental condition depending on whether localisation or exploration is of a major priority. Some experimental results are presented to show the feasibility and performance of the proposed bacteria control.
