Its main premise is that strategies programmed into these agents reliably reflect, to some extent, the behavior used by their programmers in real life. In this paper we show that PDA development has an important side effect that has not been addressed to date -- the process that merely attempts to capture one's strategy is also likely to affect the developer's strategy. The phenomenon is demonstrated experimentally, using several performance measures. This result has many implications concerning the appropriate design of PDA-based simulations, and the validity of using PDAs for studying individual decision making. Furthermore, we obtain that PDA development actually improved the developer's strategy according to all performance measures. Therefore, PDA development can be suggested as a means for improving people's problem solving skills.
