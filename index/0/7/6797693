We consider the following rectangle packing problem: Given a set of rectangles, each of which is associated with a profit, we are requested to pack a subset of the rectangles into a bigger rectangle to maximize the total profit of rectangles packed. The rectangles may not overlap and may or may not be rotated. This problem is strongly NP-hard even for packing squares with identical profits. A simple (3 + ε)-approximation algorithm is presented. We further improve the algorithm by showing a worst-case ratio of at most 5/2 + ε. Finally we devise a (2 + ε)-approximation algorithm. A number of restricted cases are also considered.
