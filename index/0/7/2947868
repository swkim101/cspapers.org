A mixed concurrency control, which allows the two techniques - two phase locking and certification - to coexist together in the same distributed dambase system, proves to be advantageous in a number of situations : interconnected databases, static or dynamic heterogeneity of transactions or objects. In this paper we propose a method which seems well adapted to the majority of the forms of heterogeneity, by using dynamic calculation of a serialization order and concurrent control of all types of transactions.
