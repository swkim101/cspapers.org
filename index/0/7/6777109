A misconception is an incorrect understanding of a concept or procedure that results in systematic discrepancies in behavior. Knowledge about the misconceptions of novices or students, when used well, can lead to more effective learning and remediation. Inferring the misconception(s) of a student from his or her behavior can be viewed as the primary task of a student modeling system. This task is reduced to one of bug detection and look-up when a l ibrary of misconceptions already exists; the challenge lies in automatically extending this l ibrary, or building it from scratch. This summary describes a novel approach to generating misconceptions from behavioral discrepancies in a programming domain. The research problem, proposed work plan, and progress to date are outlined in the sections that follow.
