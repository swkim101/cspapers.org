In this paper we propose a novel volumetric multi-resolution mapping system for RGB-D images that runs on a standard CPU in real-time. Our approach generates a textured triangle mesh from a signed distance function that it continuously updates as new RGB-D images arrive. We propose to use an octree as the primary data structure which allows us to represent the scene at multiple scales. Furthermore, it allows us to grow the reconstruction volume dynamically. As most space is either free or unknown, we allocate and update only those voxels that are located in a narrow band around the observed surface. In contrast to a regular grid, this approach saves enormous amounts of memory and computation time. The major challenge is to generate and maintain a consistent triangle mesh, as neighboring cells in the octree are more difficult to find and may have different resolutions. To remedy this, we present in this paper a novel algorithm that keeps track of these dependencies, and efficiently updates corresponding parts of the triangle mesh. In our experiments, we demonstrate the real-time capability on a large set of RGB-D sequences. As our approach does not require a GPU, it is well suited for applications on mobile or flying robots with limited computational resources.
