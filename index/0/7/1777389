MITRE's TICCIT program began in 1968 with the hypothesis that coupling television displays to a time-sharing computer system would result in a computer-based instruction system low enough in cost to permit schools to provide a significant quantity of individualized instruction to a large number of students. The subsequent TICCIT effort has demonstrated this hypothesis to be correct, and has led to the development of a model for this technology (See Figure I ) that has been shown by the ten TICCIT systems in operation and under construction to have a wide range of options which match a wide range of instructional and general purpose environments.
