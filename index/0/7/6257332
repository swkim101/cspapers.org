In this paper the impact of parallel programming paradigms and data distributions on the performance of a parallel nite di erence application is investigated. The nite di erence application is one of the kernel routines of a limited area numerical weather forecast model that is in use for producing routine weather forecasts at several European meteorological institutes. Results are shown for CRAY T3D and MasPar systems.
