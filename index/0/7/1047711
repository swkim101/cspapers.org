Theory revision systems are learning systems that have a goal of making small changes to an original theory to account for new data. A measure for the distance between two theories is proposed. This measure corresponds to the minimum number of edit operations at the literal level required to transform one theory into another. By computing the distance between an original theory and a revised theory, the claim that a theory revision system makes few revisions to a theory may be quantitatively evaluated. We present data using both accuracy and the distance metric on Audrey II, a rst-order theory revision system.
