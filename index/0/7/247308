We describe our experience with the object-oriented design methodology OMT [19] applied to a project in an undergraduate software engineering course at Carnegie Mellon University. The project involved 30 students previously unfamiliar with objectoriented modeling. They designed and implemented a system of 125 classes (27,000 lines of C++ and C code) in the relatively short time of 15 weeks. We describe the overall structure of the project and the system model, the usefulness of OMT and its impact on communication, and discuss some of the problems encountered during the development of the system.
