Recent technological advances have made multimedia on-demand servers feasible. Two challenging tasks in such systems are: a) satisfying the real-time requirement for continuous delivery of objects at specified bandwidths and b) efficiently servicing multiple clients simultaneously. To accomplish these tasks and realize economies of scale associated with servicing a large user population, the multimedia server can require a large disk subsystem. Although a single disk is fairly reliable, a large disk farm can have an unacceptably high probability of disk failure. Further, due to the real-time constraint, the reliability and availability requirements of multimedia systems are very stringent. In this paper we investigate techniques for providing a high degree of reliability and availability, at low disk storage, bandwidth, and memory costs for on-demand multimedia servers.
