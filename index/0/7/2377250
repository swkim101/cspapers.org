Autostereoscopic display systems can provide users a natural 3D visualization environment by projecting stereo video onto the user's eyes. Eye position localization is a central module in this kind of display system when users are allowed to move freely. This paper presents robust 3D eye tracking techniques that can provide accurate eye positions in real time. Technical batteries comprise: (1) robust face detection based on eigenspace method; (2) real-time face tracking; and (3) eye detection in the obtained face region. According to our implementation on a PC with a Pentium IV 1.2 GHz CPU, the frame rate of the eye tracking process can achieve 25 Hz.
