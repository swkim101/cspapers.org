We present cort, a modular toolkit for devising, implementing, comparing and analyzing approaches to coreference resolution. The toolkit allows for a unified representation of popular coreference resolution approaches by making explicit the structures they operate on. Several of the implemented approaches achieve state-ofthe-art performance.
