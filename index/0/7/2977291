Adversarial multi-robot problems, where teams of robots compete with one another, require the development of approaches that span all levels of control and integrate algorithms ranging from low-level robot motion control, through to planning, opponent modeling, and multiagent learning. Small-size robot soccer, a league within the RoboCup initiative, is a prime example of this multi-robot team adversarial environment. In this paper, we describe some of the algorithms and approaches of our robot soccer team, CMDragons'02, developed for RoboCup 2002. Our team represents an integration of many components, several of which that are in themselves state-of-the-art, into a framework designed for fast adaptation and response to the changing environment.
