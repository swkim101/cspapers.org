Air traff ic control is a time-criti cal activity with a strong cogniti ve component. Automated systems of the future will require controllers to input significantly more data, using a mouse and keypad as input devices. This article describes an experiment that compares six interaction techniques, using a double task technique to vary levels of cogniti ve load. The most eff icient procedure used a mouse to select the label and a keypad to enter specific digits. The Motif menu was the least effective of the menus tested.
