Application level message transfer systems, primarily used to transport electronic mail, have several unique characteristics that make using existing methods of dealing with deadlock impractical. The special requirements for the efficient transport of application level messages are discussed and a description of a hierarchical scheme that meets these requirements is given. For networks consisting of interconnected clusters of computers, the structured buffer pool technique can be combined with other deadlock-free message transport schemes to form a network-wide, deadlock-free message transport facility. A properly chosen hierarchical system has the advantages of the individual schemes while lessening the impact of their disadvantages. The hierarchical scheme is also applicable to packet-switched and datagram-based networks.
