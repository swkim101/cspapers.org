An antenna without phase center system used for DOA estimation and beam steering was introduced in. In the radar problem, the antenna can receive the signals scattered from a moving target. In this paper, an approach for passive radar using a smart antenna system is introduced. We assume that the primary transmitted signal comes from a known fix voice broadcasting station. The principle of the passive radar are presented.
