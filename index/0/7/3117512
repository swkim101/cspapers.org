Recently, strong equivalence for Answer Set Programming has been studied intensively, and was shown to be beneficial for modular programming and automated optimization. In this paper we define the novel notion of strong equivalence for logic programs with preferences. Based on this definition we give, for several semantics for preference handling, necessary and sufficient conditions for programs to be strongly equivalent. These results provide a clear picture of the relationship of these semantics with respect to strong equivalence, which differs considerably from their relationship with respect to answer sets. Finally, based on these results, we present for the first time simplification methods for logic programs with preferences.
