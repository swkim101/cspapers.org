The ability of an ISP to infer traffic volumes that are not directly measurable can be useful for research, engineering, and business intelligence. Previous work has shown that traffic matrix completion is possible, but there is as yet no clear understanding of which ASes are likely to be able to perform TM completion, and which traffic flows can be inferred. In this paper we investigate the relationship between the AS-level topology of the Internet and the ability of an individual AS to perform traffic matrix completion. We take a three-stage approach, starting from abstract analysis on idealized topologies, and then adding realistic routing and topologies, and finally incorporating realistic traffic on which we perform actual TM completion. Our first set of results identifies which ASes are best-positioned to perform TM completion. We show, surprisingly, that for TM completion it does not help for an AS to have many peering links. Rather, the most important factor enabling an AS to perform TM completion is the number of direct customers it has. Our second set of results focuses on which flows can be inferred. We show that topologically close flows are easier to infer, and that flows passing through customers are particularly well suited for inference.
