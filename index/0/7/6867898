This paper formulates the problem of visual search as Bayesian inference and defines a Bayesian ensemble of problem instances. In particular, we address the problem of the detection of visual contours in noise/clutter by optimizing a global criterion which combines local intensity and geometry information. We analyze the convergence rates of A* search algorithms using results from information theory to bound the probability of rare events within the Bayesian ensemble. This analysis determines characteristics of the domain, which we call order parameters, that determine the convergence rates. In particular, we present a specific admissible A* algorithm with pruning which converges, with high probability, with expected time O(N) in the size of the problem. In addition, we briefly summarize extensions of this work which address fundamental limits of target contour detectability (i.e. algorithm independent results) and the use of non-admissible heuristics.
