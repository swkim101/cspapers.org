Faceted search is a prominent search paradigm that became the standard in many Web applications and has also been recently proposed as a suitable paradigm for exploring and querying RDF graphs. One of the main challenges that hampers usability of faceted search systems especially in the RDF context is information overload, that is, when the size of faceted interfaces becomes comparable to the size of the data over which the search is performed. In this demo we present (an extension of) our faceted search system SemFacet and focus on features that address the information overload: ranking, aggregation, and reachability. The demo attendees will be able to try our system on an RDF graph that models online shopping over a catalogs with up to millions of products.
