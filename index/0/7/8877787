The unprecedented impact of noise coupling on Mixed-Signal Systems-On-a-Chip (MS-SOC) functionality, brings a new set of challenges for Electronics Design Automation (EDA) tool developers. In this paper, we propose a new approach which combines a thorough physical comprehension of the noise coupling effects with an improved Boundary-Element-Method (BEM) to accelerate the substrate model extraction and to avoid the dense matrix storage. The low computational efforts required, as well as speed and accuracy reached, makes this method a highly promising alternative to verify complex MS-SOCs.
