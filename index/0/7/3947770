Extending battery lifetime is an important issue for mobile devices. While extensive attempts have been made at the software level, optimization often risks hampering user experience. One fundamental method to increase battery lifetime is to improve the efficiency of the battery itself. We argue that the multi-cell battery system, which is widely used for enhancing battery efficiency in the electric vehicle (EV) field, can solve this issue. However, due to the hardware constraints and device usage characteristics, battery advancements in the EV field are not directly applicable to mobile devices. In this paper, we propose BattMan, a multi-cell battery management system for mobile devices, for the enhancement of battery efficiency. We develop an accurate battery cell model to estimate the expected battery lifetime considering the recovery effect, the rate capacity effect, and battery aging. We also propose a multi-cell scheduling algorithm to maximize the overall battery lifetime. We implemented BattMan on recent smartphones and evaluated its impact on battery lifetime. The experimental results show that a two-cell configuration of the proposed system increases battery lifetime by an average of between 14-19%, depending on cell aging, in real usage scenarios over a single-cell battery of the same overall capacity. We hope the proposed multi-cell battery scheme opens up a new direction towards battery lifetime improvement in mobile devices.
