In the case of single-channel ANC systems, the reference signal is picked up by a reference microphone, and the "antinoise" is generated by a canceling loudspeaker. This antinoise signal propagates downstream to cancel the unwanted noise. However it also propagates upstream and corrupts the reference signal. This is called acoustic feedback. The presence of strong acoustic feedback degrades the convergence speed and in worst case the ANC system may become unstable. In this paper, we proposed modified method for improved performance. The computer simulations are carried out, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, in comparison with the existing methods.
