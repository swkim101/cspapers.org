At the First International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, [Mineau, 1992c] presented a conceptual clustering method that could be applied to graphdescribed documents. The resulting classification structure provides for browsing retrieval capabilities. In practical terms, such a classification structure can be seen as a multiple index over complex objects. Often, indexing complex objects can be done more accurately if the structure itself of their graph-based descriptions are used in the classification process. The method we presented last year addresses this problem. However, as class formation depends on a similarity detection procedure, with a very expressive and powerful description language as needed to represent complex objects, it is best to regulate the expression of similar semantics using standard syntiictical structures, This article presents the added costs in terms of memory and space requirements for building and storing the resulting classification structure (the multiple index); and assesses the improvements this standardization provides in terms of simil,wity detection among the objects, which is vital to the recall obtained with such an index.
