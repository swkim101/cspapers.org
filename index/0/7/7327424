This poster proposes an adaptive flow control scheme for reliable packet delivery of Universal Serial Bus (USB) services when they are transmitted through wireless medium. In the future, USB can be utilized with the Wi-Fi technology to provide Wi-Fi USB (WSB). However, the data transmission of Wi-Fi and USB are asynchronous due to their different Medium Access Control (MAC) characteristics, which may result in buffer overflow. To prevent buffer overflow, we propose an adaptive flow control scheme that can select between the various transmission speeds of USB to match with the bandwidth provided by the Wi-Fi layer. Preliminary results of the proposed scheme evaluated via the NS-3 shows that the packet delivery ratio of USB data can be substantially increased, thus providing better USB reliability.
