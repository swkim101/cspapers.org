We prove that asymptotically (as <i>n</i> → ∞) almost all graphs with <i>n</i> vertices and 10<i>d n</i><sup>2</sup>--1/2<i>d</i> log <sup>1/<i>d</i></sup> <i>n</i> edges are universal with respect to the family of all graphs with maximum degree bounded by <i>d.</i> Moreover, we provide a polynomial time, deterministic embedding algorithm to find a copy of each bounded degree graph in every graph satisfying some pseudo-random properties. We also prove a counterpart result for random bipartite graphs, where the threshold number of edges is even smaller but the embedding is randomized.
