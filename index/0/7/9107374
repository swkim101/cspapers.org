Eisenberg and Gale (1959) gave a convex program for computing market equilibrium for Fisher's model for linear utility functions, and Eisenberg (1961) generalized this to concave homogeneous functions of degree one. We further generalize to:1. Homothetic, quasi-concave utilities. This also helps extend Eisenberg's result to concave homogeneous functions of arbitrary degree.2. We introduce the notion of a trading cone which enables us to compute market equilibrium in the presence of economies of scale in production provided differential pricing is allowed. Applications to network pricing are provided.
