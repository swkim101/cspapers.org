This paper is an extended abstract of the technical report [Z]. In this report, we have shown that the multicast problem in trees can be expressed in term of arranging tows and columns of boolean matrices. The application of this result is that, given a directed tree T whose arcs are oriented from the root toward the leaves, and given a subset of nodes D, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that computes az1 optimal multicast protocol from the root to all nodes of D.
