We describe a new technique that can be used to derandom-ize a number of randomized algorithms for routing and sorting on meshes. We demonstrate the power of this technique by deriving improved deterministic algorithms for a variety of routing and sorting problems. Our main results are an optimal algorithm for k-k routing on multi-dimensional meshes, a permutation routing algorithm with running time 2n+o(n) and queue size 5, and an optimal algorithm for 1-1 sorting.
