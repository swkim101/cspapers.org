Augmented Information Display (AiD) is an LCD-based communicative display device that transmits both visible (RGB) and invisible (infrared) information using temporal and spectral multiplexing. A field-sequential backlight system switches between a standard white or RGB LED backlight and a near-infrared (NIR) LED backlight at 120Hz frequency. The visible and invisible information are transmitted through the same LCD electro-optics elements but during different time intervals that synchronize with the corresponding backlights. We implemented several prototype software systems to demonstrate the potential applications of this novel display platform, such as an augmenting digital signage display, an information beacon for positioning systems, and an accessibility system for people with hearing impairments.
