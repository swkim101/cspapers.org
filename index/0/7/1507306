Participants will have fun learning and playing relatively unknown board games that are especially suitable for programming projects. We will present games where (1) all players can view the same screen, (2) the board is reasonably simple to program, and (3) there are several elements of the game that relate strongly to a common CS 1, CS 2, or discrete math topic. After we explain the rules and highlight the CS-related elements of the games, participants will have the opportunity to play the games, ask questions, and suggest rule variations that will improve the resulting programming project. See http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/~kurmasz/GamesWorkshop/ for more details and a list of games that may be presented. Laptop Optional.
