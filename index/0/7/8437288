A modern analog placer often needs to consider various geometrical constraints to generate desired layouts. To handle general constraints simultaneously, current state-of-the-art works adopt simulated annealing based on topological representations, due to their smaller solution spaces and higher efficiency. However, no published work achieves the optimal time complexity for general geometrical constraint handling and module packing. Besides, only limited constraints are considered and handled in each work. To remedy these insufficiencies, we present a new hybrid representation of a quadtree and B*-trees (QB-tree, for short) to handle general geometrical constraints while achieving linear, lower-bound time complexity of module packing and constraint handling. Experimental results based on real industrial designs with various constraints show that our placer outperforms the leading published works in both runtime and solution quality.
