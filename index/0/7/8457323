Shoogle is a novel, intuitive interface for sensing data withina mobile device, such as presence and properties of textmessages or remaining resources. It is based around activeexploration: devices are shaken, revealing the contents rattlingaround "inside". Vibrotactile display and realistic impactsonification create a compelling system. Inertial sensingis used for completely eyes-free, single-handed interactionthat is entirely natural. Prototypes are described runningboth on a PDA and on a mobile phone with a wireless sensorpack. Scenarios of use are explored where active sensing ismore appropriate than the dominant alert paradigm.
