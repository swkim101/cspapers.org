Drawing on this fact, action classification, relying heavily on the extracted features of high-dimensional tensors, may indeed benefit from tensor completion techniques. In this paper, we propose a low-rank tensor completion method for action classification, as well as image recovery. Since there may exist distortion and corruption in the tensor representations of video sequences, we project the tensors into a subspace, which contains the invariant structure of the tensors. In order to integrate useful supervisory information for classification, we adopt a discriminant analysis criterion to learn the projection matrices. The resulting multi-variate optimization problem can be effectively solved using the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our method results with better accuracy compared with some other state-of-the-art low-rank tensor representation learning approaches on the MSR Hand Gesture 3D database and the MSR Action 3D database. By denoising the Multi-PIE face database, our experimental setup testifies the proposed method can also be employed to recover images.
