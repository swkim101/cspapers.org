We study the task of entity linking for tweets, which tries to associate each mention in a tweet with a knowledge base entry. Two main challenges of this task are the dearth of information in a single tweet and the rich entity mention variations. To address these challenges, we propose a collective inference method that simultaneously resolves a set of mentions. Particularly, our model integrates three kinds of similarities, i.e., mention-entry similarity, entry-entry similarity, and mention-mention similarity, to enrich the context for entity linking, and to address irregular mentions that are not covered by the entity-variation dictionary. We evaluate our method on a publicly available data set and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
