Recently, image representations derived from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been demonstrated to achieve impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks, including place recognition. In this paper, we take a step deeper into the internal structure of CNNs and propose novel CNN-based image features for place recognition by identifying salient regions and creating their regional representations directly from the convolutional layer activations. A range of experiments is conducted on challenging datasets with varied conditions and viewpoints. These reveal superior precision-recall characteristics and robustness against both viewpoint and appearance variations for the proposed approach over the state of the art. By analyzing the feature encoding process of our approach, we provide insights into what makes an image presentation robust against external variations.
