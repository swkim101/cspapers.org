Many further problems can be solved by SAT Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers, which extend SAT solvers to handle additional types of constraints. However, building efficient SMT solvers is often very difficult. In this paper, we define the concept of a Boolean monotonic theory and show how to easily build efficient SMT solvers, including effective theory propagation and clause learning, for such theories. We present examples showing useful constraints that are monotonic, including many graph properties (e.g., shortest paths), and geometric properties (e.g., convex hulls). These constraints arise in problems that are otherwise difficult for SAT solvers to handle, such as procedural content generation. We have implemented several monotonic theory solvers using the techniques we present in this paper and applied these to content generation problems, demonstrating major speed-ups over SAT, SMT, and Answer Set Programming solvers, easily solving instances that were previously out of reach.
