In the current Web-dominated computing environment, it is increasingly important that students learn the principles of Web-based application design. But this topic is so broad and includes so many different technologies that it is virtually impossible to design an effective class around the traditional lecture-based model. This paper describes a successful approach to teaching the subject that uses a seminar format and features faithful simulation of real world development processes, meaningful case studies and flexibility in terms of coverage as its central themes.
