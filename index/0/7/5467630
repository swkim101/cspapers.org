In this paper we introduce a logic for describing trees which allows us to reason about both the parent and domination relationship. The use of domination has found a number of applications, such as in deterministic parsers based on Description theory (Marcus, Hindle & Fleck, 1983), in a compact organization of the basic structures of Tree-Adjoining Grammars (Vijay-Shanker & Schabes, 1992), and in a new characterization of the adjoining operation that allows a clean integration of TAGs into the unification-based framework (Vijay-Shanker, 1992) Our logic serves to formalize the reasoning on which these applications are based.
