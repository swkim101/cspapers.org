A microblogging service like Twitter continues to surge in importance as a means of sharing information in social networks. In the medical domain, several works have shown the potential of detecting public health events (i.e., infectious disease outbreaks) using Twitter messages or tweets. Given its real-time nature, Twitter can enhance early outbreak warning for public health authorities in order that a rapid response can take place. Most of previous works on detecting outbreaks in Twitter simply analyze tweets matched disease names and/or locations of interests. However, the effectiveness of such method is limited for two main reasons. First, disease names are highly ambiguous, i.e., referring slangs or non health-related contexts. Second, the characteristics of infectious diseases are highly dynamic in time and place, namely, strongly time-dependent and vary greatly among different regions. In this paper, we propose to analyze the temporal diversity of tweets during the known periods of real-world outbreaks in order to gain insight into a temporary focus on specific events. More precisely, our objective is to understand whether the temporal diversity of tweets can be used as indicators of outbreak events, and to which extent. We employ an efficient algorithm based on sampling to compute the diversity statistics of tweets at particular time. To this end, we conduct experiments by correlating temporal diversity with the estimated event magnitude of 14 real-world outbreak events manually created as ground truth. Our analysis shows that correlation results are diverse among different outbreaks, which can reflect the characteristics (severity and duration) of outbreaks.
