Distributional models of semantics capture word meaning very effectively, and they have been recently extended to account for compositionally-obtained representations of phrases made of content words. We explore whether compositional distributional semantic models can also handle a construction in which grammatical terms play a crucial role, namely determiner phrases (DPs). We introduce a new publicly available dataset to test distributional representations of DPs, and we evaluate state-of-the-art models on this set.
