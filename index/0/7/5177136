Peer-to-peer systems promise inexpensive scalability, adaptability, and robustness. Thus, they are an attractive platform for file sharing, distributed wikis, and search engines. These applications often store weakly structured data, requiring sophisticated search algorithms. To simplify the search problem, most scalable algorithms introduce structure to the network. However, churn or violent disruption may break this structure, compromising search guarantees.
 This paper proposes a simple probabilistic search system, BubbleStorm, built on random multigraphs. Our primary contribution is a flexible and reliable strategy for performing exhaustive search. BubbleStorm also exploits the heterogeneous bandwidth of peers. However, we sacrifice some of this bandwidth for high parallelism and low latency. The provided search guarantees are tunable, with success probability adjustable well into the realm of reliable systems.
 For validation, we simulate a network with one million low-end peers and show BubbleStorm handles up to 90% simultaneous peer departure and 50% simultaneous crash.
