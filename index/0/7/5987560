Electronic Chip-in-Place Test (ECIPT) is a design approach and a test methodology for VLSI packages containing multiple semi-conductor chips. Shift register latches are used in such a way that each chip on a package is accessible for testing from the package pins without in-circuit probing. A means is therefore provided, whereby tests generated for a chip can be reapplied at the package level. The ECIPT methodology additionally provides a mechanism for simplified tests of failures associated with interchip wiring and chip I/O connections.
