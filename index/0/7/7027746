Conjugate Gradient-like methods such as Orthomin(k) have been developed to obtain a good numerical approximation to the solution of <italic>Ax</italic> = <italic>f</italic> when the matrix <italic>A</italic> is large, sparse, and nonsymmetric. In s-step variations of these iterative methods, <italic>s</italic> consecutive steps of the one-step methods are performed simultaneously. The number of inner products required is reduced and the resulting algorithms are more suitable for parallel computations. However, lack of orthogonality between the <italic>s</italic> direction vectors at each iteration leads to instability unless <italic>s</italic> is small (<italic>sâ‰¤5). In this project, the effect of orthogonalizing the <italic>s</italic> direction vectors at each iteration was studied. The <italic>A<supscrpt>T</supscrpt>A</italic>-Orthogonal <italic>s</italic>-Step Orthomin(k) and p-Orthogonal s-Step Orthomin(k) algorithms were developed and shown to be stable for large values of <italic>s</italic> (up to <italic>s</italic>=20). The performance of thesealgorithms on a multiple processor CRAY Y-MP8 computer was analyzed.
