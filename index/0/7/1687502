Since the last IJCAI, the PLANNER problem solving formalism has continued to develop. Our eplstemolgy for the foundations for problem solving has been extended. An overview of the formalism Is given from an Information processing view point. A simple example Is explained using snapshots of the state of the problem solving as the example Is worked, finally, current applications for the formalism are listed.
