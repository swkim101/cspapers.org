As smart mobile devices grow increasingly in popularity, so do the incentives for attackers. Recent surveys on mobile security describe the rapidly increasing number and sophistication of mobile attacks. Newer sources of risks are being introduced or explored in the mobile computing paradigm where traditional security threats are also evolving. The prevalence of mobile devices and the rapid growth of mobile threats have resulted in a shortage of mobile security personnel. Educational activities are needed to promote mobile security education and to meet the emerging industry and education needs. This paper presents our initial effort on exploring a learning approach to mobile security, which aims at taking advantages of the benefits of mobile devices and the best practices in learning information security, promoting students' interests, and improving students' self-efficacy. An Android security labware is designed to implement the environment and materials for the learning approach. We integrated the pilot modules of the labware into two security courses in two semesters. The majority of the students provided positive feedback and enjoyed the Android security practices.
