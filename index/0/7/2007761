This paper investigates the relationship between resolution and tableaux proof system for the satisfiability of general knowledge bases in the description logic ALC. We show that resolution proof systems can polynornially simulate their tableaux counterpart. Our resolution proof system is based on a selection refinement and utilises standard redundancy elimination criteria to ensure termination.
