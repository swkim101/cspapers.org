We are interested in the problem of understanding the connections between human activities and the content of textual information generated in regard to those activities. Firstly, we define and motivate this problem as an important part in making sense of various life events. Secondly, we introduce the domain of massive online collaborative environments, specifically online virtual worlds, where people meet, exchange messages, and perform actions as a rich data source for such an analysis. Finally, we outline three experimental tasks and show how statistical language modeling and text clustering techniques may allow us to explore those connections successfully.
