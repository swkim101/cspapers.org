In a recent paper, Ajtai et al. [1] give a streaming algorithm to count the number of inversions in a stream <i>L</i>ε[<i>m</i>]<sup>n</sup> using two passes and <i>O</i>(ε<sup>−1</sup>-√<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>(log <i>m</i> + log <i>n</i>)) space. Here, we present a simple randomized streaming algorithm for the same problem that uses one pass and <i>O</i>(ε<sup>−3</sup> log<sup>2</sup> <i>n</i> log <i>m</i>) space. Our algorithm is based on estimating quantiles of the items already seen in the stream, and using that to estimate the number of inversions involving each element.
