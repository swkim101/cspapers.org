Rockit is a system for the inference of graphical constraints, embedded within a graphical editor as part of larger project on applications development. The graphical editor allows the application designer to draw application-domain-specific objects and define constraints among them. On the basis of direct manipulation techniques, Rockit can infer the most likely graphical constraints as the designer manipulates the objects. Both graphical and audio feedback are used to guide the designer towards their choices. In this short document, we present our experience in designing and using audio, as a complement to graphical feedback, for this purpose.
