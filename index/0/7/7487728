In this paper we present a new data model for tool integration that extends existing data models by an abstract graph model. We provide a framework service based on this model which generates implementations of graph-based design representations from a conceptual schema. In two case studies we use them for rapid construction of a high-level synthesis tool and for easy fine-grained integration to an existing simulator.
