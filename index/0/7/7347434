We introduce SkinBot; a lightweight robot that moves over the skin surface with a two-legged suction-based locomotion mechanism and that captures a wide range of body parameters with an exchangeable multipurpose sensing module. We believe that robots that live on our skin such as SkinBot will enable a more systematic study of the human body and will offer great opportunities to advance many areas such as telemedicine, human-computer interfaces, body care, and fashion.
