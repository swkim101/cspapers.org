We study the topological simplification of graphs via random embeddings, leading ultimately to a reduction of the Gupta-Newman-Rabinovich-Sinclair (GNRS) L1 embedding conjecture to a pair of manifestly simpler conjectures. The GNRS conjecture characterizes all graphs that have an O(1)-approximate multi-commodity max-flow/min-cut theorem. In particular, its resolution would imply a constant factor approximation for the general Sparsest Cut problem in every family of graphs which forbids some minor. In the course of our study, we prove a number of results of independent interest.
