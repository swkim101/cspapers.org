We consider per-user profile replication as a mechanism for faster location lookup of mobile users in a Personal Communications Service system. We present a minimum-cost maximum-flow based algorithm to compute the set of sites at which a user profile should be replicated given known calling and user mobility patterns. We then present schemes for replication plans that gracefully adapt to changes in the calling and mobility patterns.
