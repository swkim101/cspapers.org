This paper proposes a local information based control law in order to solve the planar manipulation problem of rotating a grasped rigid object to a desired orientation using multiple mobile manipulators. We adopt a multi-agent systems theory approach and assume that: (i) the manipulators (agents) are capable of sensing the relative position to their neighbors at discrete time instances, (ii) neighboring agents may exchange information at discrete time instances, and (iii) the communication topology is connected. Control of the manipulators is carried out at a kinematic level in continuous time and utilizes inverse kinematics. The mobile platforms are assigned trajectory tracking tasks that adjust the positions of the manipulator bases in order to avoid singular arm configurations. Our main result concerns the stability of the proposed control law.
