Type is a kind of widely-used facet and can be easily obtained from knowledge bases, which enables to create filters by selecting at most K types of an entity collection. However, existing approaches often fail to select high-quality type filters due to complex overlap between types. In this paper, we propose a novel type selection approach based upon Budgeted Maximum Coverage (BMC), which can achieve integral optimization for the coverage quality of type filters. Furthermore, we define a new optimization problem called Extended Budgeted Maximum Coverage (EBMC) and propose an EBMC-based approach, which enhances the BMC-based approach by incorporating the relevance between entities and types, so as to create sensible type filters. Our experimental results show that the EBMC-based approach performs best comparing with several representative approaches.
