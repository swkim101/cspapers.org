We have developed a model-based approach to learning from plan failures in which an agent uses a model of itself to determine where in its planning or execution the cause of a failure lies. We believe that such an approach constitutes the most promising basis for developing learning models that are capable of decid ing for themselves what needs to be learned from a given experience. In addit ion, such methods appear capable of learning about planning at a very abstract level, and thus of supporting the transfer of knowledge from experience in one domain or task to other domains or tasks.
