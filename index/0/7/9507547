Sentiment Word Identification (SWI) is a basic technique in many sentiment analysis applications. Most existing researches exploit seed words, and lead to low robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based model for SWI. Unlike previous approaches, our model exploits the sentiment labels of documents instead of seed words. Several experiments on real datasets show that WEED is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with seed words.
