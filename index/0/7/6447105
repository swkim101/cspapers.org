This paper discusses a formation control of a multiple mobile robot system (MMRS) called super Mechano colony (SMC). First, we introduce the SMC system composed of a mother ship and many agents as a prototype of MMRS. We propose a control method for formation control of child robots using multiple coordinate systems, i.e., physical coordinate system and shape coordinate system. The properties of the combined control method are shown by numerical simulations and an experiment.
