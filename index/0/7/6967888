Abstract : This paper reports some experiments that Compare the accuracy and performance of two stochastic parsing systems. The currently popular Collins parser is a shallow parser whose output contains more detailed semantically relevant information than other such parsers. The XLE parser is a deep-parsing system that couples a Lexical Functional Grammar to a log- linear disambiguation component and provides much richer representations theory. We measured the accuracy of both systems against a gold standard of the PARC 700 dependency bank, and also measured their processing times. We found the deep-parsing system to be more accurate than the Collins parser with only a slight reduction in parsing speed.
