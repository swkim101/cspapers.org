This paper presents a demonstration of a temporal reasoning system that addresses three fundamental tasks related to temporal expressions in text: extraction, normalization to time intervals and comparison. Our system makes use of an existing state-of-the-art temporal extraction system, on top of which we add several important novel contributions. In addition, we demonstrate that our system can perform temporal reasoning by comparing normalized temporal expressions with respect to several temporal relations. Experimental study shows that the system achieves excellent performance on all the tasks we address.
