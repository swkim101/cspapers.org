Communication can be more effective when several media (such as text, speech, or graphics) are integrated and coordinated to present information. This changes the nature of media specific generation (e.g., language generation) which must take into account the multimedia context in which it occurs. In this paper, 1 will present work on coordinating and integrating speech, text, static and animated 3D graphics, and stored images, as part of several systems we have developed at Columbia University. A particular focus of our work has been on the generation of presentations that brief a user on information of interest.
