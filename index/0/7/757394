Pecularities of Decision mpicing processes on eeneo-perceptual and speech-thinking levels are described. The productive oharactes of these processes are demonstrated. One of the traditional ways of artificial intellect constructing is an analysis of real decision making processes of man and subsequent formal description of them. Heuristic programming, however, representing to many scientists mind an acme in realising this approach has not approved hopes, pinned on it neither practical* nor theoretical ones (see,for example, 3,4). Prom the psychological point of view the initial position of heuristic model-ing pf thinking (in particular the program of Common Decision Maker Problem by Newell, Simon, Show) contradicts to the principal characteristics of mental processes: a)to their reflective character (they are the reflection of objective world, but not an operating by simbols); b)to active character of this reflection (mental reflection is not a passive reproduction of outer world objects, it is not a reproductional choice, sorting of already acquired knowledge, it is cogai-tion, i.e. It is an active productive "bailing* from objects new and new content by means of including them into new systems of relations / l /. On the present stage the research of man cognitive processes having been significantly realized in connection with de
