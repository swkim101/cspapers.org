We investigate the computational complexity of two global constraints, CUMULATIVE and INTERDISTANCE. These are key constraints in modeling and solving scheduling problems. Enforcing domain consistency on both is NP-hard. However, restricted versions of these constraints are often sufficient in practice. Some examples include scheduling problems with a large number of similar tasks, or tasks sparsely distributed over time. Another example is runway sequencing problems in air-traffic control, where landing periods have a regular pattern. Such cases can be characterized in terms of structural restrictions on the constraints. We identify a number of such structural restrictions and investigate how they impact the computational complexity of propagating these global constraints. In particular, we prove that such restrictions often make propagation tractable.
