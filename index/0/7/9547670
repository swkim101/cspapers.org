This paper proposes a position and stiffness bounding approach (PSBA) for improving “geometry transparency” in time-delayed teleoperations. The proposed method can rapidly update the local model location in master site to the contact location in the slave site. The proposed PSBA can therefore avoid instability problem due to both discrete force controller and sudden contact location changes (so called “model jump effect”). Effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by 1-DOF simple contact experiment in 500ms round trip time delayed virtual environment.
