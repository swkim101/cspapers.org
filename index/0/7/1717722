There is little consensus on a standard experimental design for the compound interpretation task. This paper introduces well-motivated general desiderata for semantic annotation schemes, and describes such a scheme for in-context compound annotation accompanied by detailed publicly available guidelines. Classification experiments on an open-text dataset compare favourably with previously reported results and provide a solid baseline for future research.
