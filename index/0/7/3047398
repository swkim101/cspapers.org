The Indiana Student Software Awards Competition (ISSAC) was created to encourage students in the state of Indiana to improve their software development skills, to potentially consider a career in information technology, and to help stem the flow of graduates out of Indiana - "the brain drain". High school or college students who develop a software project for class, personal enrichment or corporate internships may submit a project. ISSAC 2003 is the third year of the competition. Finalist projects are judged at the annual Indiana Technology Summit, and students are awarded scholarships and plaques based upon the overall quality and functionality of their software.
