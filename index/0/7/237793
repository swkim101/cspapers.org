Event detection is an essential task for wireless sensor networks. In this paper we present the design and implementation of MC-Detect, an efficient scheme for detecting and estimating events in the network. With sparse samples processed at the basestation, our approach reduces the transmission and computation cost of low power sensor nodes. Our demonstration shows the real-time event detection in practice on a small network of TelosB motes.
