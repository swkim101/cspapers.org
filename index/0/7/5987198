This paper proposes an approach for bilingual dictionary extraction from comparable corpora. The proposed approach is based on the observation that a word and its translation share similar dependency relations. Experimental results using 250 randomly selected translation pairs prove that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the traditional context-based approach that uses bag-of-words around translation candidates.
