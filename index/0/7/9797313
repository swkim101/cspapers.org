Ability of fuel cell systems to produce power is limited. So it is necessary to force the system to operate in conditions which correspond to fuel cell maximum power point (MPP). Since fuel cell MIPP is a unique and fixed point of operation, load power requirements are not taken into account and output voltage will vary with variations of load resistance. In this paper, a new configuration for Fuel cell / Battery hybrid power system with required controller is proposed and analyzed. This system works in the way that, fuel cell operates in its MIPP and output voltage is kept constant. The proposed system is simulated and results show acceptable operation of the system under different conditions.
