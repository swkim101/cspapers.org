With regard to keyword search systems for structured data, research during the past decade has largely focused on performance. Researchers have validated their work using ad hoc experiments that may not reflect real-world workloads. We illustrate the wide deviation in existing evaluations and present an evaluation framework designed to validate the next decade of research in this field. Our comparison of 9 state-of-the-art keyword search systems contradicts the retrieval effectiveness purported by existing evaluations and reinforces the need for standardized evaluation. Our results also suggest that there remains considerable room for improvement in this field. We found that many techniques cannot scale to even moderately-sized datasets that contain roughly a million tuples. Given that existing databases are considerably larger than this threshold, our results motivate the creation of new algorithms and indexing techniques that scale to meet both current and future workloads.
