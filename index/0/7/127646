This is a survey on the algorithms which are part ofa program for flat placement of large-scale VLSI processorchips. The basis is a quadratic optimization approachcombined with a new quadrisection algorithm.In contrast to most previous quadratic placement methods,no min-cut objective is used at all. Based on aquadratic placement, a completely new algorithm findsa four-way partitioning meeting capacity constraintsand minimizing the total movement.
