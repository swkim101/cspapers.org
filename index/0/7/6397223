We present a demonstration of an artificial intelligence application, Webly-labeled Learning (WELL) that enables learning of ad-hoc concept detectors over unlimited Internet videos without any manual an-notations. A considerable number of videos on the web are associated with rich but noisy contextual information, such as the title, which provides a type of weak annotations or la-bels of the video content. To leverage this information, our system employs state-of-the-art webly-supervised learning(WELL) (Liang et al. ). WELL considers multi-modal information including deep learning visual, audio and speech features, to automatically learn accurate video detectors based on the user query. The learned detectors from a large number of web videos allow users to search relevant videos over their personal video archives, not requiring any textual metadata,but as convenient as searching on Youtube.
