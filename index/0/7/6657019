Due to the continuous shrinking of technology nodes, the minimum implant area (MIA) constraint has become a critical issue for modern circuit placement. With a fixed cell height, this constraint can be transferred into a minimum cell width constraint, and thus cells of small widths may have MIA violations. To solve such violations, we may shift neighboring cells to preserve whitespace or abut violating cells with the same threshold voltages (VTs). This paper presents an MIA-aware detailed placement algorithm to effectively solve the placement problem with the MIA constraint by clustering violating cells with the same VTs, and then apply cluster-based detailed placement algorithms to solve this problem. To further minimize the design area, an MIA-aware cell flipping algorithm based on linear-time dynamic programming is presented. Experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve high-quality results for this problem and is very robust for different multi-VT designs and MIA constraints.
