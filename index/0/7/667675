Two exploratory studies examined the relationships among web navigation metrics, measures of lostness, and success on web navigation tasks. The web metrics were based on counts of visits to web pages, properties of the web usage graph, and similarity to an optimal path. Metrics based on similarity to an optimal path were good predictors of lostness and task success.
