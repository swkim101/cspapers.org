Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently evinced immense success for various image recognition tasks [11, 27]. However, a question of paramount importance is somewhat unanswered in deep learning research - is the selected CNN optimal for the dataset in terms of accuracy and model size? In this paper, we intend to answer this question and introduce a novel strategy that alters the architecture of a given CNN for a specified dataset, to potentially enhance the original accuracy while possibly reducing the model size. We use two operations for architecture refinement, viz. stretching and symmetrical splitting. Stretching increases the number of hidden units (nodes) in a given CNN layer, while a symmetrical split of say K between two layers separates the input and output channels into K equal groups, and connects only the corresponding input-output channel groups. Our procedure starts with a pre-trained CNN for a given dataset, and optimally decides the stretch and split factors across the network to refine the architecture. We empirically demonstrate the necessity of the two operations. We evaluate our approach on two natural scenes attributes datasets, SUN Attributes [16] and CAMIT-NSAD [20], with architectures of GoogleNet and VGG-11, that are quite contrasting in their construction. We justify our choice of datasets, and show that they are interestingly distinct from each other, and together pose a challenge to our architectural refinement algorithm. Our results substantiate the usefulness of the proposed method.
