Advances in network and processor technology have greatly changed the communication and computational power of local-area workstation clusters. However, operating systems still treat workstation clusters as a collection of loosely-connected processors, where each workstation acts as an autonomous and independent agent. This operating system structure makes it difficult to exploit the characteristics of current clusters, such as low-latency communication, huge primary memories, and high-speed processors, in order to improve the performance of cluster applications. This paper describes the design and implementation of global memory management in a workstation cluster. Our objective is to use a single, unified, but distributed memory management algorithm at the lowest level of the operating system. By managing memory globally at this level, all system- and higher-level software, including VM, file systems, transaction systems, and user applications, can benefit from available cluster memory. We have implemented our algorithm in the OSF/1 operating system running on an ATM-connected cluster of DEC Alpha workstations. Our measurements show that on a suite of memory-intensive programs, our system improves performance by a factor of 1.5 to 3.5. We also show that our algorithm has a performance advantage over others that have been proposed in the past.
