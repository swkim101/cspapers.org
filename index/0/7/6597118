In this paper a knowledge based assembly control system for automobile manufactur ing is presented which has been implemented for the B M W manufac tu r ing facilit ies i n M u n i c h . The system is fu l ly integrated in the process control system. Its main purpose is to support the assembly supervisor in taking appropriate corrective actions in case of abnormal process condit ions. The distinctive feature of the system is its capabil i ty to validate actions proposed by a rule based troubleshooting component through a one to one simulat ion model of the real manufac tur ing process. Thus effectiveness of actions at the first attempt is ensured and predictive process control is supported. The approach proposed in this paper can be generalized to a domain independent scheme for manufac tu r ing process control.
