Virtual Queue-based marking schemes have been recently proposed for AQM (Active Queue Management) in Internet routers. We consider a particular scheme, which we call the Adaptive Virtual Queue (AVQ), and study its following properties: stability in the presence of feedback delays, its ability to maintain small queue lengths and its robustness in the presence of extremely short flows (the so-called web mice). Using a mathematical tool motivated by the earlier work of Hollot et al, we present a simple rule to design the parameters of the AVQ algorithm. We then compare its performance through simulation with several well-known AQM schemes such as RED, REM, PI controller and a non-adaptive virtual queue algorithm. With a view towards implementation, we show that AVQ can be implemented as a simple token bucket using only a few lines of code.
