Today’s embedded systems like printers, cars, satellites orfactory plants are composed of numerous complex, intercon-nected components, yielding a huge number of possible sys-tem states. This makes handling such systems, speciﬁcallydiagnosing and repairing failures, increasingly harder. Thisproblem can be tackled by ﬁtting systems with an increasingdegree of autonomy to, e.g., automatically diagnose faults’causes and plan workaround actions, and to generally reducethe need of human intervention (which is costly and possi-bly dangerous for humans). Autonomous intelligent systemsmight even fulﬁll tasks which humans can’t do, like collect-ing scientiﬁc data on mars.Such autonomy can be achieved through model-basedreasoning: based on a model of the system’s structure andbehaviour, usually a Hidden Markov Model, in each timestep a hypothesis about the current system state, i.e. a prob-ability distribution over all states, is generated from priorstates and sensor data. This is the well known problem of be-lief state update. An existing implementation is Livingstone2 (L2), developed at NASA and employed in the satelliteEO-1 (Hayden, Sweet, and Christa 2004). In my work I aimto integrate diagnosis and planning in a single frameworkemploying constraint-based modeling and optimization, de-velop new methods for a ﬂexible belief state approximationand test these methods on the CoTeSys applications cogni-tive factory and assistive kitchen (Beetz, Buss, and Wollherr2007), building on existing tools like L2.
