"Add to Favorites" is a popular function in online shopping sites which helps users to make a record of potentially interesting items for future purchases. It is usually regarded as a type of explicit feedback signal for item popularity and therefore also adopted as a ranking signal by many shopping search engines. With the increasing usage of crowdsourcing platforms, some malicious online sellers also organize crowdturfing activities to increase the numbers of "Add to Favorites" for their items. By this means, they expect the items to gain higher positions in search ranking lists and therefore boost sales. This kind of newly-appeared malicious activity proposes challenges to traditional search spam detection efforts because it involves the participation of many crowd workers who are normal online shopping users in most of the times, and these activities are composed of a series of behaviors including search, browse, click and add to favorites. To shed light on this research question, we are among the first to investigate this particular spamming activity by looking into both the task organization information in crowdsourcing platforms and the user behavior information from online shopping sites. With a comprehensive analysis of some ground truth spamming activities from the perspective of behavior, user and item, we propose a factor graph based model to identify this kind of spamming activity. Experimental results based on data collected in practical shopping search environment show that our model helps detect malicious "Add to Favorites" activities effectively.
