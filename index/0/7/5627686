Generally, these learning algorithms construct informative graph for each view or fuse different views to one graph, on which the following procedure are based. However, in many real world dataset, original data always contain noise and outlying entries that result in unreliable and inaccurate graphs, which cannot be ameliorated in the previous methods. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view learning model which performs clustering/semi-supervised classification and local structure learning simultaneously. The obtained optimal graph can be partitioned into specific clusters directly. Moreover, our model can allocate ideal weight for each view automatically without additional weight and penalty parameters. An efficient algorithm is proposed to optimize this model. Extensive experimental results on different real-world datasets show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-view algorithms.
