This paper investigates pipelining methodologies for the ultra low voltage regime. Based on an analytical model and simulations, we propose a pipelining technique that provides higher energy efficiency and performance than conventional approaches to ultra low voltage design. Two-phase latch based design and sequential circuit optimizations are also proposed to further improve energy efficiency and performance. Silicon results demonstrate a 16b multiplier using the approaches in 65nm CMOS improve energy efficiency by 30% and performance by 60%.
