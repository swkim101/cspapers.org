Given the recent advancement of microarray technologies, we present a density-based clustering approach for the purpose of co-expressed gene cluster identification. The underlying hypothesis is that a set of co-expressed gene clusters can be used to reveal a common biological function. By addressing the strengths and limitations of previous density-based clustering approaches, we present a novel clustering algorithm that utilizes a neighborhood defined by <i>k</i>-nearest neighbors. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method identifies biologically meaningful and co-expressed gene clusters.
