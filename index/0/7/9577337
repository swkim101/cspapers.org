We study a pricing problem that is motivated by the following examples. A cloud computing platform such as Amazon EC2 sells virtual machines to clients, each of who needs a different number of virtual machine hours. Similarly, cloud storage providers such as Dropbox have customers that require different amounts of storage. Software companies such as Microsoft sell software subscriptions that can have different levels of service. The levels could be the number of different documents you are allowed to create, or the number of hours you are allowed to use the software. Companies like Google and Microsoft sell API calls to artificial intelligence software such as face recognition, to other software developers. Video and mobile games are increasingly designed in such a way that one can pay for better access to certain features. Spotify and iTunes sell music subscription, and different people listen to different number of songs in a month. Cellphone service providers like AT&T and Verizon offer cellular phone call minutes and data. People have widely varying amounts of data consumption.
