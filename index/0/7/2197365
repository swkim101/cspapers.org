Based on a dynamic model of a wheeled mobile robot (WMR), a dynamic control method is developed so that the WMR tracks a desired trajectory. The full nonlinear dynamics and the kinematic constraints are embodied in the controller. The steering and driving torques are chosen as the control inputs. Examples are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and the control methods.
