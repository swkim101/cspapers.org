Jumping has been a prevalent and versatile game mechanic from the early days of games like Donkey Kong to our own sophisticated era of smartphone games like Temple Run and entertainment industry giants like the Call of Duty series. While the physical activity of jumping itself seems simple, a lot can change in the translation of this action to its game counterpart. Jumping must serve to make the game playable and enjoyable, and so realism is sacrificed in order to facilitate the particular "feel" that the game developers desire for the physics of their game. This project is a study of jumping as a game mechanic and its implementation in video games, and includes a playable simulation program that allows for hands-on experience of different jump implementations that were studied.
