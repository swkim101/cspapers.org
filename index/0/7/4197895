Traditional methods for the system-oriented evaluation of Boolean IR system suffer from validity and reliability problems. Laboratory-based research neglects the searcher and studies suboptimal queries. Research on operational systems fails to make a distinction between searcher performance and system performance. This approach is neither capable of measuring performance at standard points of operation (e.g. across R0.0-R1.0).
A new laboratory-based evaluation method for Boolean IR systems is proposed. It is based on a controlled formulation of inclusive query plans, on an automatic conversion of query plans into elementary queries, and on combining elementary queries into optimal queries at standard points of operation. Major results of a large case experiment are reported. The validity, reliability, and efficiency of the method are considered in the light of empirical and analytical test data.
