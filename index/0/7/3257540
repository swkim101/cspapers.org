We present a class of approximate inference algorithms for graphical models of the QMR-DT type. We give convergence rates for these algorithms and for the Jaakkola and Jordan (1999) algorithm, and verify these theoretical predictions empirically. We also present empirical results on the difficult QMR-DT network problem, obtaining performance of the new algorithms roughly comparable to the Jaakkola and Jordan algorithm.
