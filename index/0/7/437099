Supporting groups of individuals exploring large maps and design diagrams on interactive tabletops is still an open research problem. Today's geospatial, mechanical engineering and CAD design applications are mostly single-user, keyboard and mouse-based desktop applications. In this paper, we present the design of and experience with DTLens, a new zoom-in-context, multi-user, two-handed, multi-lens interaction technique that enables group exploration of spatial data with multiple individual lenses on the same direct-touch interactive tabletop. DTLens provides a set of consistent interactions on lens operations, thus minimizes tool switching by users during spatial data exploration.
