In this research, we propose a shoe-shaped I/O interface. The benefits to users of wearable devices are significantly reduced if they are aware of them. Wearable devices should have the ability to be worn without requiring any attention from the user. However, previous wearable systems required users to be careful and be aware of wearing or carrying them. To solve this problem, we propose a shoe-shaped I/O interface. By wearing the shoes throughout the day, users soon cease to be conscious of them. Electromechanical devices are potentially easy to install in shoes. This report describes the concept of a shoe-shaped I/O interface, the development of a prototype system, and possible applications.
