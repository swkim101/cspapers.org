In this paper we present an approach to the disambiguation of capitalized words when they are used in the positions where capitalization is expected, such as the first word in a sentence or after a period, quotes, etc.. Such words can act as proper names or can be just capitalized variants of common words. The main feature of our approach is that it uses a minimum of prebuilt resources and tires to dynamically infer the disambiguation clues from the entire document. The approach was thoroughly tested and achieved about 98.5% accuracy on unseen texts from The New York Times 1996 corpus.
