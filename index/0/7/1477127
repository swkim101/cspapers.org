We study the computational complexity of the parsing problem of a variant of Lambek Categorial Grammar that we call semidirectional. In semidirectional Lambek calculus SDL there is an additional nondirectional abstraction rule allowing the formula abstracted over to appear anywhere in the premise sequent's left-hand side, thus permitting non-peripheral extraction. SDL grammars are able to generate each context-free language and more than that. We show that the parsing problem for semidirectional Lambek Grammar is NP-complete by a reduction of the 3-Partition problem.
