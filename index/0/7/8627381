we consider the problem of constructing a static dictionary that supports access queries for a set of w-bit keys on a wbit RAM with an arithmetic instruction set consisting of addition, subtraction, multiplication, left and right shift, and bitwise boolean operations. We show that a static dictionary for n > 4 keys that occupies O(n) space and allows queries to be processed in O(loglog r-r) time can be constructed deterministically in O(n log n) time. No previous deterministic linear-space solution simultaneously achieved o(c) query time and n’+‘(‘) construction time. The actual result is more general and allows the query time to be lowered at the cost of increasing the construction time. We also apply known dynamization techniques ‘to derive a deterministic dynamic dictionary with a tradeoff between query time and update time.
