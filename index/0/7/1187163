In this paper, we propose SimCC-AT (similarity based on content and citations with automatic parameter tuning) to compute the similarity of scientific papers. As in SimCC, the state-of-the-art method, we exploit a notion of a contribution score in similarity computation. SimCC-AT utilizes an automatic weighting scheme based on SVMrank and thus requires only a smaller number of experiments for parameter tuning than SimCC. Furthermore, our experimental results with a real-world dataset show that the accuracy of SimCC-AT is dramatically higher than that of other existing methods and is comparable to that of SimCC.
