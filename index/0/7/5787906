The last two decades have witnessed an exponential rise in web content from a plethora of domains, which has necessitated the use of domain-specific search engines. Diversity of crawled content is one of the crucial aspects of a domain-specific search engine. To a large extent, diversity is governed by the initial set of seed URLs. Most of the existing approaches rely on manual effort for seed selection. In this work we automate this process using URLs posted on Twitter. We propose an algorithm to get a set of diverse seed URLs from a Twitter URL graph. We compare the performance of our approach against the baseline zero similarity seed selection method and find that our approach beats the baseline by a significant margin.
