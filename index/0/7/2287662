The notion of Kolmogorov-Martin-Lof Random sequences is extended from computable to enumerable distributions. This allows definitions of various other properties, such as mutual information in infinite sequences. Enumerable distributions (as well as distributions faced in some finite multi-party settings) are semi measures, handling those requires care.
