In this paper, we describe a one-week summer computing workshop for teachers to improve computer science education in K-12. Our workshop focuses on using Scratch and Alice, two programs used to make simple games and animations, to introduce computing concepts to teachers in computer, technology, math, and science at all K-12 levels to expose students to computing at an early age and to reach more students. During the workshop the teachers developed curriculum materials for the subjects they will teach in the following semesters with the help of our workshop tutors. We present our workshop strategies, lessons learned, and assessment results in this paper.
