Cost, performance and efficiency of energy usage of a robot system is strongly dependent on its drive chain, i.e. combination of the drive, the motors and the gears. A model is presented that allows accurate simulation of the drive chain in an industrial robot to offer a high degree of optimization in the design process. Simulation results are compared to final data from the developed units and excellent agreements are found.
