Even todayâ€™s most advanced robots perform poorly at simple everyday tasks carried out routinely by humans and animals. This has very early motivated researchers to adopt neurobiological principles of cognition and control in robotics, yielding numerous approaches based on artificial neural networks and machine learning. However, many of the originally proposed methods employ neural networks solely for the purpose of approximating and replicating standard control architectures. At the same time, research focusing more on biological plausibility severely suffered from limitations on size and accuracy of the neural simulations imposed by hardware constraints.
