Holographic optical tweezers (HOT) has ability to trap and manipulate a few hundred of small particles. Previously the manipulation speed is greatly limited to the calculation speed of holograms. But recent progress in parallel computing made it possible to generate the holograms in real-time. Therefore, HOT is thought to play an important role in dexterous micromanipulation. In practical application, the teleoperation of HOT is thought to improve the manipulability. But, the maximum number of objects which can be manipulated at once is limited by the master devices. In this research, we applied a multi-touch user interface for the master. And we designed and constructed the HOT teleoperation system. In the optical system, we implemented a zero-order beam filtering system to avoid the disturbance. In control system, we applied an Apple iPad2 as a master device. The design and the processing of the interface were proposed and discussed in consideration of the manipulability. And, we discuss the manipulation method making the best use of multi-touch user interface. With the constructed system, we demonstrated the parallel teleoperation of 10 particles. And the time response of manipulation shows the potential of smooth manipulation. Based on these discussions, we concluded that the constructed system is effective for micromanipulation.
