Garbage collection (GC) is a technique for automatically reclaiming unused blocks of application memory, thereby relieving the application programmer of this often error-prone task. GC has long been effectively employed in functional and object-oriented languages like ML, Smalltalk and SELF, but it is with the wide-spread adoptance of Java as a platform for large server applications that the performance of GC has become increasingly critical.
