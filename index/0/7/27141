We demonstrate the CLEO mobile sensing platform, including ultra-portable, low-power sensors, phone-based data upload software, and a location resolution and data management web service in the cloud. The sensing platform leverages cloud-offloaded GPS (CO-GPS) for location sensing. A sensor communicates with mobile devices using an audio-port-based connector. The back-end cloud service supports OData protocol to make data accessible to other systems, such as World-Wide Telescope (WWT).
