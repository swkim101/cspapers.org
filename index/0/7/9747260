In this research, we develop ROAD, a system framework for processing location dependent spatial queries (LDSQs) that search for spatial objects of interest on road networks. By exploiting search space pruning, ROAD is very efficient and flexible for various LDSQs on different types of objects over large-scale networks. In ROAD, a large road network is organized as a set of interconnected regional sub-networks (called Rnets) augmented with 1) shortcuts for accelerating search traversals; and 2) object abstracts for guiding object search. In this poster, we outline this framework and explain how it can support efficient location-dependent nearest neighbor search.
