Using a quasi-realistic model of the feedback inhibition ofmotoneurons (MNs) by Renshaw cells, we show that weak inhibition is sufficient to maximally desynchronize MNs, with negligible effects on total MN activity. MN synchrony can produce a 20 - 30 Hz peak in the force power spectrum, which may cause instability in feedback loops.
