This paper describes an efficient algorithm for the geodesic shortest, nath oroblem. i.e. the problem of finding shortest path; bet&n pa& of points on the surface of a 3dimensional polyhedron such that the path is constrained to lie on the surface of the polyhedron. We use the wavefront method and show an O(nlog%) time bound for this problem, when there are O(n) vertices and edges on the polyhedron.
