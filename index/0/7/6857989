Language is given meaning through its correspondence with a world representation. This correspondence can be at multiple levels of granularity or resolutions. In this paper, we introduce an approach to multi-resolution language grounding in the extremely challenging domain of professional soccer commentaries. We define and optimize a factored objective function that allows us to leverage discourse structure and the compositional nature of both language and game events. We show that finer resolution grounding helps coarser resolution grounding, and vice versa. Our method results in an F1 improvement of more than 48% versus the previous state of the art for fine-resolution grounding 1 .
