In this paper, we explore the concept of dual-purpose speech: speech that is socially appropriate in the context of a human-to-human conversation which also provides meaningful input to a computer. We motivate the use of dual-purpose speech and explore issues of privacy and technological challenges related to mobile speech recognition. We present three applications that utilize dual-purpose speech to assist a user in conversational tasks: the Calendar Navigator Agent, DialogTabs, and Speech Courier. The Calendar Navigator Agent navigates a user's calendar based on socially appropriate speech used while scheduling appointments. DialogTabs allows a user to postpone cognitive processing of conversational material by proving short-term capture of transient information. Finally, Speech Courier allows asynchronous delivery of relevant conversational information to a third party.
