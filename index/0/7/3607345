We describe a way of using multiple different types of similarity relationship to learn a low-dimensional embedding of a dataset. Our method chooses different, possibly overlapping representations of similarity by individually reweighting the dimensions of a common underlying latent space. When applied to a single similarity relation that is based on Euclidean distances between the input data points, the method reduces to simple dimensionality reduction. If additional information is available about the dataset or about subsets of it, we can use this information to clean up or otherwise improve the embedding. We demonstrate the potential usefulness of this form of semi-supervised dimensionality reduction on some simple examples.
