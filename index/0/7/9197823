A method of reversible video image regions of interest anonymization for applications in video surveillance systems is described. A short introduction to the anonymization procedures is presented together with the explanation of its relation to visual surveillance. A short review of state of the art of sensitive data protection in media is included. An approach to reversible Region of Interest (ROI) hiding in video is presented, utilizing a new relocation algorithm for hashing and a watermarking technique for extra data embedding. Implemented application is described, and results obtained using it are reported. Future work and possible improvements to introduced algorithms are discussed.
