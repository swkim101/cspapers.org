he prevalence of smart devices has promoted the popular- ity of mobile applications (a.k.a. apps) in recent years. A number of interesting and important questions remain unan- swered, such as why a user likes/dislikes an app, how an app becomes popular or eventually perishes, how a user selects apps to install and interacts with them, how frequently an app is used and how much traffic it generates, etc. This paper presents an empirical analysis of app usage behaviors collected from millions of users of Wandoujia, a leading An- droid app marketplace in China. The dataset covers two types of user behaviors of using over 0.2 million Android apps, including (1) app management activities (i.e., installa- tion, updating, and uninstallation) of over 0.8 million unique users and (2) app network traffic from over 2 million unique users. We explore multiple aspects of such behavior data and present interesting patterns of app usage. The results provide many useful implications to the developers, users, and disseminators of mobile apps.
