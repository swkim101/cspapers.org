We present the best known algorithms for approximating the minimum cardinality undirected k-edge connected spanning subgraph. For simple graphs our approximation ratio is 1 + 1/2k + <i>O</i>(1/k<sup>2</sup>). The more precise version of our bound requires <i>k</i> ≥ 7, and for all such <i>k</i> it improves the longstanding bound of Cheriyan and Thurimella, 1 + 2/(<i>k</i> + 1) [2]. The improvement comes in two steps: First we show that for simple <i>k</i>-edge connected graphs, any laminar family of degree <i>k</i> sets is smaller than the general bound (<i>n</i>(1 + 3/<i>k</i> + O(1/<i>k√k</i>)) versus 2<i>n</i>). This immediately implies that iterated rounding improves the bound of [2]. Our second step improves iterated rounding by finding good edges for rounding. For multigraphs our approximation ratio is 1 + 21/11<i>k</i> < 1 + 1.91/<i>k</i>. This improves the previous bound 1 + 2/k [6]. It is of interest since it is known that for some constant c > 0, an approximation ratio ≤ 1 + <i>c/k</i> implies <i>P = NP</i>. Our approximation ratio extends to the minimum cardinality Steiner network problem, where <i>k</i> denotes the average vertex demand. The algorithm exploits rounding properties of the first two linear programs in iterated rounding.
