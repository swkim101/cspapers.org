Narrative is fundamental to the ways we make sense of texts ofall kinds because it provides structure and coherence, but it isdifficult to see how this works in the context of multimediainteractive learning environments (MILES). We tested our hypothesesabout the form and function of narrative in MILES by developingthree versions of material on CD-ROM which had different narrativestructures and analysed the impact of the different versions onlearner behaviour. We present a theoretical framework in which weexplain the concepts of narrative guidance and narrativeconstruction and their application to the design of MILES.
