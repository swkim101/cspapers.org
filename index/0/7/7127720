In this poster, we present a novel approach to study and reveal network protocol information from radio activities instrumentation in wireless sensor network. Recent studies have analyzed radio activities; however, most of these studies focus on estimating energy consumption, since radio chip usually dominates the energy consumption of nodes. In our work, we analyze radio activities with a different purpose, which aims to reveal network protocols and application workloads by an analysis of fine-grained low level radio activities on the nodes. We design a feature called Radio Awake Length Counter and use it to classify and reveal network activity. Results from experiments on a real world testbed indicate that our approach can achieve up to 97% accuracy to identify the routing protocols, average 85% accuracy to distinguish application workloads.
