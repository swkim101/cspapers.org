As wide area high-speed networks rapidly increase, new applications emerge and require new control mechanisms in data transport services to support them. In this paper, we present UDT/CCC, a data transport library that allows users to make use of a new control algorithm through simple configurations. We aim to provide a tool for fast implementation and deployment, as well as easy evaluation, of new congestion control algorithms. UDT/CCC uses an objected-oriented design. We show that our UDT/CCC library can be used to easily implement a large variety of control algorithms and can simulate the behavior of their native implementations as well. The UDT/CCC library is at the application level and it does not need root privilege to be installed. Meanwhile, it was specially developed to require very few changes to the existing applications. This paper describes its design, implementation, and evaluation.
