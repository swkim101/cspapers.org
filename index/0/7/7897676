Most relational database systems provide a facility for supporting user views. Permitting this level of abstraction has the danger, however, that update requests issued by a user within the context of his view may not translate correctly into equivalent updates on the underlying database. It is the purpose of this paper to formalize the notion of correct translatability, and to derive constraints on view definitions that ensure the existence of correct update mappings. In summary, our theorems show that there are very few situations in which view updates are possible--even fewer, in fact, than intuition might suggest.
