The Institute for Computing Education (ICE) was created in the spring of 2004. ICE is a partnership between the Georgia Department of Education and the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. The goals for this partnership are to increase the number and quality of computer science teachers and increase the number, quality, and diversity of computer science students. One specific goal is to increase the number of students taking the CS-Advanced Placement (AP) course. In this paper we report on both the progress we have made towards these goals and the problems we have encountered. We hope that other states will create similar partnerships and leverage our experience.
