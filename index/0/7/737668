Over the past half decade, we have been exploring the use of logic in the speciﬁcation and analysis of computational economic mechanisms. We believe that this approach has the potential to bring the same beneﬁts to the design and analysis of computational economic mechanisms that the use of temporal logics and model checking have brought to the speciﬁ-cation and analysis of reactive systems. In this paper, we give a survey of our work. We ﬁrst discuss the use of cooperation logics such as Alternating-time Temporal Logic ( ATL ) for the speciﬁcation and veriﬁcation of mechanisms such as social choice procedures. We motivate the approach, and then discuss the work we have done on extensions to ATL to support incomplete information, preferences, and quantiﬁcation over coalitions. We then discuss is the use of ATL -like cooperation logics in the development of social laws.
