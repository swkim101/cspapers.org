We evaluate the performance of an morphological analyser for Inuktitut across a medium-sized corpus, where it produces a useful analysis for two out of every three types. We then compare its segmentation to that of simpler approaches to morphology, and use these as a pre-processing step to a word alignment task. Our observations show that the richer approaches provide little as compared to simply finding the head, which is more in line with the particularities of the task.
