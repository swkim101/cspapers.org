This paper attempts to conduct analysis for one certain type of user reviews; that is, the reviews on a super-entity (e.g., restaurant) involve descriptions for many sub-entities (e.g., dishes). To deal with such analysis, we propose a text embedding framework for ranking sub-entities from user reviews of a given super-entity. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our method outperforms three baselines by a statistically significant amount. Intriguing cases from the experiments are discussed in the paper.
