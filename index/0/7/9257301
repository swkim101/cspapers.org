In this paper, we present a new collection of open-source software libraries that provides command line binary utilities and library classes and functions for compiling regular expression and context-sensitive rewrite rules into finite-state transducers, and for n-gram language modeling. The OpenGrm libraries use the OpenFst library to provide an efficient encoding of grammars and general algorithms for building, modifying and applying models.
