Closely monitoring service performance and detecting anomalies are critical for Internet-based services. However, even though dozens of anomaly detectors have been proposed over the years, deploying them to a given service remains a great challenge, requiring manually and iteratively tuning detector parameters and thresholds. This paper tackles this challenge through a novel approach based on supervised machine learning. With our proposed system, Opprentice (Operators' apprentice), operators' only manual work is to periodically label the anomalies in the performance data with a convenient tool. Multiple existing detectors are applied to the performance data in parallel to extract anomaly features. Then the features and the labels are used to train a random forest classifier to automatically select the appropriate detector-parameter combinations and the thresholds. For three different service KPIs in a top global search engine, Opprentice can automatically satisfy or approximate a reasonable accuracy preference (recall >= 0.66 and precision>= 0.66). More importantly, Opprentice allows operators to label data in only tens of minutes, while operators traditionally have to spend more than ten days selecting and tuning detectors, which may still turn out not to work in the end.
