Understanding concepts in the world remains one of the well-sought endeavours of ML. Whereas ImageNet enabled success in object recognition and various related tasks via transfer learning, the ability to understand physical concepts prevalent in the world still remains an unattained, yet desirable, goal. Video as a vision modality encodes how objects change across time with respect to pose, position, distance of observer, etc.; and has therefore been researched extensively as a data domain and for studying “common sense” physical concepts of objects.
