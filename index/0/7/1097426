Positive Example based learners reduce human annotation effort significantly by removing the burden of labeling the negative examples. Various methods have been proposed in literature for building classifiers using positive and unlabeled examples. However, we empirically observe that classification accuracy of the state of the art methods degrades significantly as the number of labeled positive examples decreases. In this paper, we propose an active learning based method to address this issue. The proposed method learns starting from a handful of positively labeled examples and a large number of unlabeled examples. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method performs better than the state of the art methods when the percentage of labeled positive examples is small.
