The present paper proposes a method by which to translate outputs of a robust HPSG parser into semantic representations of Typed Dynamic Logic (TDL), a dynamic plural semantics defined in typed lambda calculus. With its higher-order representations of contexts, TDL analyzes and describes the inherently inter-sentential nature of quantification and anaphora in a strictly lexicalized and compositional manner. The present study shows that the proposed translation method successfully combines robustness and descriptive adequacy of contemporary semantics. The present implementation achieves high coverage, approximately 90%, for the real text of the Penn Treebank corpus.
