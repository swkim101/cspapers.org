We introduce emph{Normative Temporal Logic} (acro{ntl}), a logic for 
reasoning about normative systems. acro{ntl} is a generalisation of 
the well-known branching-time temporal logic acro{ctl}, in which the 
path quantifiers $Apath$ (``on all pathsldots'') and $Epath$ (``on 
some pathldots'') are replaced by the indexed deontic operators 
$O{ 
s}$ and $P{ 
s}$, where for example $O{ 
s}phi$ means 
``$phi$ is obligatory in the context of normative system $ 
s$''. 
After defining the logic, we give a sound and complete axiomatisation, 
and discuss the logic's relationship to standard deontic logics. We 
present a symbolic representation language for models and normative 
systems, and identify four different model checking problems, 
corresponding to whether or not a model is represented symbolically or 
explicitly, and whether or not we are given an interpretation for the 
normative systems named in formulae to be checked. We show that the 
complexity of model checking varies from acro{p}-complete up to 
acro{exptime}-hard for these variations.
