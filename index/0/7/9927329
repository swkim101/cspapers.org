The goal of our work is to enhance the mitigation capabilities of first responders in the event of a crisis by dramatically transforming their ability to collect, store, analyze, interpret, share and disseminate data. CAMAS specifically is a system designed to allow a variety of users, including the average citizen to report incidents and potentially hazardous situations, analyze and evaluate these reports and notify appropriate personnel for further action. The multidisciplinary approach incorporates a variety of information technologies: networks; distributed systems; databases; image and video processing; GIS; and machine learning, together with subjective information obtained through social science. Besides providing an overview of the CAMAS architecture, we describe the demonstration platform and specific experiments that will illustrate issues of event extraction, ranking, access control and visualization.
