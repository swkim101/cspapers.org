Multi-view tagging has become increasingly popular in the applications where data representations by multiple views exist. A robust multi-view tagging method must have the capability to meet the two challenging requirements: limited labeled training samples and noisy labeled training samples. In this paper, we investigate this challenging problem of learning with limited and noisy tagging and propose a discriminative model, called MSMC, that exploits both labeled and unlabeled data through a semi-parametric regularization and takes advantage of the multi-label space consistency into the optimization. While MSMC is a general method for learning with multi-view, limited, and noisy tagging, in the evaluations we focus on the specific application of noisy image tagging with limited labeled training samples on a benchmark dataset. Extensive evaluations in comparison with state-of-the-art literature demonstrate that MSMC outstands with a superior performance.
