While question answering communities have been gaining popularity for several years, we wonder if the increased popularity actually improves or degrades the user experience. In addition, automatic QA systems, which utilize different sources such as search engines and social media, are emerging rapidly. QA communities have already created abundant resources of millions of questions and hundreds of millions of answers. The question whether they will continue to serve as an effective source is of information for web search and question answering is of vital importance. In this poster, we investigate the temporal evolution of a popular QA community - Yahoo! Answers, with respect to its effectiveness in answering three basic types of questions: factoid, opinion and complex questions. Our experiments show that Yahoo! Answers keeps growing rapidly, while its overall quality as an information source for factoid question-answering degrades. However, instead of answering factoid questions, it might be more effective to answer opinion and complex questions.
