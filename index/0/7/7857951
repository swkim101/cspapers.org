In this paper we introduce the novel task of "word epoch disambiguation," defined as the problem of identifying changes in word usage over time. Through experiments run using word usage examples collected from three major periods of time (1800, 1900, 2000), we show that the task is feasible, and significant differences can be observed between occurrences of words in different periods of time.
