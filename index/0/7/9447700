Many existing methods reduce LP to binary classification. However, the dominance of absent links in real world networks makes misclassification error a poor performance metric. Instead, researchers have argued for using ranking performance measures, like AUC, AP and NDCG, for evaluation. We recast the LP problem as a learning to rank problem and use effective learning to rank techniques directly during training which allows us to deal with the class imbalance problem systematically. As a demonstration of our general approach, we develop an LP method by optimizing the cross-entropy surrogate, originally used in the popular ListNet ranking algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available co-authorship, citation and metabolic networks to demonstrate the merits of our method.
