Decision trees have been applied to a variety of NLP tasks, including language modeling, for their ability to handle a variety of attributes and sparse context space. Moreover, forests (collections of decision trees) have been shown to substantially outperform individual decision trees. In this work, we investigate methods for combining trees in a forest, as well as methods for diversifying trees for the task of syntactic language modeling. We show that our tree interpolation technique outperforms the standard method used in the literature, and that, on this particular task, restricting tree contexts in a principled way produces smaller and better forests, with the best achieving an 8% relative reduction in Word Error Rate over an n-gram baseline.
