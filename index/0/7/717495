Cooper's syntactic transformations for structuring flowcharts are studied. After exhibiting major problems with these transformations, a modified set of transformations are proposed. It is proved that a flowchart G is transformable into a D-chart if and only if for every 3 connected circuits C<subscrpt>1</subscrpt>, C<subscrpt>2</subscrpt> and C<subscrpt>3</subscrpt> in G, there exists a vertex v on C<subscrpt>1</subscrpt>+C<subscrpt>2</subscrpt>+C<subscrpt>3</subscrpt> such that for every i, C<subscrpt>i</subscrpt> passes through v or every path from C<subscrpt>i</subscrpt> to the OUT of the flowchart passes through v.
