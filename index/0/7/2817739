This paper considers adding autonomy to robot hands used in teleoperation systems. Currently, the finger positions of robot hands in teleoperation systems are controlled via a robot master using a Dataglove or exoskeleton. There are several difficulties with this approach: accurate calibration is hard to achieve; robot hands have different capabilities from human hands; and complex force reflection is difficult. In this paper we propose a model of hand teleoperation in which the input device commands the motions of a grasped object rather than the joint displacements of the fingers. To achieve this goal, the hand requires greater autonomy and the capability to perform high-level functions with minimal external input. Therefore, a set of general, primitive manipulation functions that can be performed automatically is defined. These elementary functions control simple rotations and translations of the grasped objects. They are incorporated into a teleoperation system by using a simple input device as a control signal. Preliminary implementations with a Utah/MIT are discussed.<<ETX>>
