Most Spoken Dialog Systems are based on speech grammars and frame/slot semantics. The semantic descriptions of input utterances are usually defined ad-hoc with no ability to generalize beyond the target application domain or to learn from annotated corpora. The approach we propose in this paper exploits machine learning of frame semantics, borrowing its theoretical model from computational linguistics. While traditional automatic Semantic Role Labeling approaches on written texts may not perform as well on spoken dialogs, we show successful experiments on such porting. Hence, we design and evaluate automatic FrameNet-based parsers both for English written texts and for Italian dialog utterances. The results show that disfluencies of dialog data do not severely hurt performance. Also, a small set of FrameNet-like manual annotations is enough for realizing accurate Semantic Role Labeling on the target domains of typical Dialog Systems.
