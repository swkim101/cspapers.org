InteMon is a prototype monitoring and mining system for large clusters. Currently, it monitors over 100 hosts of a prototype data center at CMU. It uses the SNMP protocol and it stores the monitoring data in an mySQL database. Then, it allows for visualization of the time-series data using a JSP web-based frontend interface for users.What sets it apart from other cluster monitoring systems is its ability to automatically analyze the monitoring data in real time and alert the users for potential anomalies. It uses state of the art stream mining methods, it has a sophisticated definition of anomalies (broken correlations among input streams), and it can also pinpoint the reason of the anomaly. InteMon has a user-friendly GUI, it allows the users to perform interactive mining tasks, and it is fully operational.
