In teaching object oriented design, it is important for students to work on projects that use a variety of design patterns, interaction between objects, and provide the opportunity to explore design options in a realistic setting. Originally, object oriented languages have been designed for use in building simulations. We use a familiar simulation of a traffic through an intersection, controlled by a traffic light as a framework for teaching various aspects of object oriented design. We present this project and show how it illustrates a variety of object oriented design problems.
