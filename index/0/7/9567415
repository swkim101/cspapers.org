We describe lmw to evdlmte and analyze tile perfolâ€™lllallce ofclistribtltecl memory NIIMDllypercubes and S11OW tile process in practice on tile Intel iPSC/860 llypercube. Tile perfornlance analysis has been cliviclecl into four levels: tile conlputing performance of a single nocIe. tile communication performance between tile nocles, tile performance in overlapping conlputation with collllllllllicatioll, mlcl tile I>erforlll+lllcc? illcolllplete l>arallelizecl application programs. G%3ndltsions about tile perfornlallce of t,lle iPSC!/8G0 are drawn.
