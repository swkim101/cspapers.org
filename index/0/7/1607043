In this paper, we proposed a unified strategy to combine query log and search results for query suggestion. In this way, we leverage both the users' search intentions for popular queries and the power of search engines for unpopular queries. The suggested queries are also ranked according to their relevance and qualities; and each suggestion is described with a rich snippet including a photo and related description.
