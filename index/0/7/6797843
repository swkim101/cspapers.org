This paper presents and evaluates techniques to improve the execution performance of MATLAB. Previous efforts concentrated on source to source translation and batch compilation; MaJIC provides an interactive frontend that looks like MATLAB and compiles/optimizes code behind the scenes in real time, employing a combination of just-in-time and speculative ahead-of-time compilation. Performance results show that the proper mixture of these two techniques can yield near-zero response time as well as performance gains previously achieved only by batch compilers.
