At the MITRE Corporation-Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD), software engineers work closely with both analyst and domain experts to develop software simulations in the air traffic management domain. In this environment, software simulations are applications that take large amounts of real-world operational information, and through calculations, derivations, and display extends the original information to produce some new insight into the domain. This new insight or knowledge typically comes in the form of a pertinent set of data. Based on this set of information other research groups can further extend this knowledge. The challenge in this environment is a distributed data management system that will allow a distributed set of researchers to share their extended knowledge. This paper presents the motivation and design of such an architecture to support this collaborative knowledge/data sharing environment. This run-time configurable architecture is implemented using web-based technologies such as the Extensible Markup Language (XML), Java Servlets, Extensible Stylesheets (XSL), and a relational database management system (RDBMS).
