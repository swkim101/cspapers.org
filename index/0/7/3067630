The orbit of any one planet depends on the combined motion of all the &nets. not to mention the actions of all these on e&h other. To consider simultaneously all these causes of motion and to define these motions by exact laws allowing of convenient calculation exceeds, unless I am mistaken, the forces of the entire human intellect. -Isaac Newton 1687 Epochal surveys are throwing down the gauntlet for cosmological simulation. We describe three keys to meeting the challenge of N-body simulation: adaptive potential solvers, adaptive integrators and volume renormalization. With these techniques and a dedicated Teraflop facility, simulation can stay-even with observation of the Univer&. We also describe some oroblems in the formation and stability of planetary systems. Here, the challenge is to perform accurate integrations that retain Hamiltonian properties for 1013 timesteps. 1 The Scientific Importance of Cosmological
