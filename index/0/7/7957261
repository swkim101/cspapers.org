Introduction Emerging Semantic Web standards promise the automated discovery, composition and invocation of Web Services. Unfortunately, this vision requires that services describe themselves with large amounts of hand-crafted semantic metadata. We are investigating the use of machine learning techniques for semi-automatically classifying Web Services and their messages into ontologies. From such semanticallyenriched WSDL descriptions, it is straightforward to generate significant parts of a service’s description in OWL-S or a similar language. In this paper, we first introduce an application for annotating Web Services that is currently under development. Our application reads Web Service descriptions from WSDL files and assists the user in annotating them with classes and properties from an ontology written in OWL. Our ultimate goal is a semi-automated approach that makes use of the machine learning algorithms described in this paper to suggest classifications to the user, thereby simplifying the creation of semantic metadata. Second, we describe the application of the well known Naive Bayes and SVM algorithms to the task of Web Service classification. We show that an ensemble approach that treats Web Services as structured objects is more accurate than an unstructured approach. Third, we discuss the dependencies between a Web Service’s category and its operations and input and output messages. We briefly sketch possibilities and challenges for the classification task that arise when considering these depencies. Finally, we describe a probabilistic algorithm for learning to assign semantic labels to input parameters. Because Web Services were not widely available at the time when these experiments were done, we looked at HTML forms instead. However, the described techniques are relevant to Web Services.
