A navigational aid for databases that relies on unsupervised hierarchical classification is presented. The approach to hierarchical classification, based on both functional and topological features, supports the creation of deep hierarchies in which succeeding levels represent increasing degrees of abstraction. This allows the user to quickly evaluate the result of a query and to locate interesting items and classes of items by performing a tree traversal rather than a sequential perusal of a hit list or a series of ad hoc query refinements. In very large databases where classical querying methods are increasingly inadequate such as chemical reaction databases, such a browsing method is required in order to manage the flood of information with which the user is confronted.
