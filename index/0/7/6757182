The UrbanMobSense is a mobility sensing system designed to collect the travel patterns of people for transportation planning purposes. This system makes use of smartphones with various built-in sensors to capture human mobility automatically in a non-intrusive manner. To improve the user experience of smartphone users, the system is designed to be user-centric to address energy conservation and privacy preservation issues. The UrbanMobSense has been deployed in Singapore to support the Land Transport Authority (LTA)'s household travel survey.
