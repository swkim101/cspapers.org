We introduce a family of long-run average properties of Markov chains that are useful for purposes of performance and reliability analysis, and show that these properties can effectively be checked for a subclass of infinite-state Markov chains generated by probabilistic programs with recursive procedures. We also show how to predict these properties by analyzing finite prefixes of runs, and present an efficient prediction algorithm for the mentioned subclass of Markov chains.
