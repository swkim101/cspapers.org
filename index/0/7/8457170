Application and system software architecture can greatly influence the operational statistics of a local network. The implementation of a transparent file system on top of a high bandwidth local network has resulted in generating a high degree of file traffic over the local network whose characteristics are largely fixed and repeatable. These statistics will be presented along with arguments for and against designing mechanisms that optimize specifically for that class of traffic.
