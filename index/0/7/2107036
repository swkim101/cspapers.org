In this paper, we discuss a re-configurable pipeline architecture that is ideally suited for applications in which a user is interactively managing a stream of data. Currently, document service buses allow stand-alone document services (translation, printing, etc.) to be combined for batch processing. Our architecture allows services to be composed and re-configured on the fly in order to support interactive applications. To motivate the need for such an architecture we address the problem of finding and organizing images on the World Wide Web. The resulting tool, PicturePiper, provides a mechanism for allowing users access to images on the web related to a topic of interest.
