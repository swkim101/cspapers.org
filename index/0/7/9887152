In this paper we address the problem of dense depth map estimation from sparse noisy range data to reconstruct large heterogeneous outdoor scenes. We propose a surface inpainting solution through energy minimisation with an adaptive selection of surface regularisers among a set of well known convex and non-convex regularisers. In fact, the selection of norm is pivotal with respect to the intrinsic surface characteristics. Our goal is to show how dense interpolation of sparse range data can be leveraged of more exotic and non-convex regularisers such as the log and logTGV [1] which can better capture the scene geometry. In contrast to state of the art solutions, we do not restrict ourselves to this set of norms, instead we search for the most apt norm for each semantically segmented part of the scene. Our energy model selection use Bayesian optimisation to learn the best choice of free parameters. This results in an adaptive model selection and the generalisation of well studied regularisation norms. We conclude with a detailed experimental analysis of our approach using a basis of four norms over a set of challenging outdoor scenes.
