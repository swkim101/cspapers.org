A method for compressing large dictionaries is proposed, based on transforming words into lexicographically ordered strings of distinct letters, together with permutation indexes. Algorithms to generate such strings are described. Results of applying the method to the dictionaries of two databases, in Hebrew and English, are presented in detail. The main message is a method of partitioning the dictionary such that the "information bearing fraction" is stored in fast memory, and the bulk in auxiliary memory.
