Measuring low-level wireless network properties allows researchers to understand how protocols and applications perform in different environments. In this demo, we present SWAT - a software tool that automates gathering and analysis of network measurements. SWAT provides an interface for configuring experimental parameters in a network. It collects raw packet statistics such as the received signal strength and chip error, and provides modules for calculating and visualizing various metrics derived from these statistics.
