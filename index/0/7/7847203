In this paper an extensive experimental eval uation of an evolutionary approach to con cept learning is presented The experimen tation performed with the system G NET investigates the e ectiveness of the approach along the following dimensions Robustness with respect to parameter setting e ective ness of the MDL criterion coupled with a stochastic search bias impact of coevolution on the quality of the solution and on the com putational e ort required and ability to face problems requiring structured representation languages A discussion of the obtained re sults and a suggestion on when this type of approach might be useful is also provided
