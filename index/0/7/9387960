A method of producing carbon-13 by multiphoton decomposition of C3F6, said material containing carbon-12 and carbon-13 isotopic species, comprising irradiating gaseous C3F6 in a reaction chamber at a pressure below 10 Torr with a laser beam at a frequency in the range of 950 to 1020 wavenumbers and providing a minimum fluence of 1 joules per sq. cm. and passing the material through a physical separation stage to obtain a 13C2F4 product.
