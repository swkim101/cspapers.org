This paper presents demonstration of a real-time full duplex point-to-point link, where transmission and reception occurs in the same spectrum band simultaneously between a pair of full-duplex radios. This demo first builds a full duplex radio by implementing self-interference cancellation technique on top of a traditional half duplex radio architecture. We then establish a point-to-point link using a pair of these radios that can transmit and receive OFDM packets. By changing the environmental conditions around the full-duplex radios we then demonstrate the robustness of the self-interference cancellation to adapt to the changing environment.
