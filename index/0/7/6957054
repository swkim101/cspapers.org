Given a set of client locations, a set of facility locations where each facility has a service capacity, and the assumptions that: (i) a client seeks service from its nearest facility; (ii) a facility provides service to clients in the order of their proximity, we study the problem of selecting all possible locations such that setting up a new facility with a given capacity at these locations will maximize the number of served clients. This problem has wide applications in practice, such as setting up new distribution centers for online sales business and building additional base stations for mobile subscribers. We formulate the problem as location selection query for utility maximization. After applying three pruning rules to a baseline solution,we obtain an efficient algorithm to answer the query. Extensive experiments confirm the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.
