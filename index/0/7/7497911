This work proposes a methodology of knowledge extraction from constrained-random simulation data. Feature-based analysis is employed to extract rules describing the unique properties of novel assembly programs hitting special conditions. The knowledge learned can be reused to guide constrained-random test generation towards uncovered corners. The experiments are conducted based on the verification environment of a commercial processor design, in parallel with the on-going verification efforts. The experimental results show that by leveraging the knowledge extracted from constrained-random simulation, we can improve the test templates to activate the assertions that otherwise are difficult to activate by extensive simulation.
