Because of the important role of product reviews during users' decision process, we propose a novel explanation interface that particularly fuses the feature sentiments as extracted from reviews into explaining recommendations. Besides, it can explain multiple items altogether by revealing their similarity in respect of feature sentiments as well as static specifications, so as to support users' tradeoff making. Relative to existing works, we believe that this interface can be more effective, trustworthy, and persuasive.
