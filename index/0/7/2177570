Sketch recognition systems are currently being developed for many domains, but can be time consuming to build if they are to handle the intricacies of each domain. This paper presents the first translator that takes symbolic shape descriptions (written in the LADDER sketch language) and automatically transforms them into shape recognizers, editing recognizers, and shape exhibitors for use in conjunction with a domain independent sketch recognition system. This transformation allows us to build a single domain independent recognition system that can be customized for multiple domains. We have tested our framework by writing several domain descriptions and automatically created a domain specific sketch recognition system for each domain.
