We present a novel Bayesian topic model for learning discourse-level document structure. Our model leverages insights from discourse theory to constrain latent topic assignments in a way that reflects the underlying organization of document topics. We propose a global model in which both topic selection and ordering are biased to be similar across a collection of related documents. We show that this space of orderings can be elegantly represented using a distribution over permutations called the generalized Mallows model. Our structure-aware approach substantially outperforms alternative approaches for cross-document comparison and single-document segmentation.
