This paper presents WOK, a cased-based planner that makes use of memory structures based on goal interactions. WOK generates original plans, (which take the form of recipes), in the domain of Szechuan cooking, by modifying existing plans that are stored and then retrieved on the basis of the goal interactions that they deal with. The paper suggests an organization and indexing strategy that allows the retrieval and use of plans that overarch sets of goals rather than just individual goal situations. It also demonstrates how episodic knowledge can be used to guide planning and avoid past failures.
