Digital signals in some high speed computers and communication systems are required to have rise and fall times below 5 nanoseconds and pulse widths less than i00 nanoseconds. Designers who design systems which operate with short rise and fall times and narrow pulse widths face the problem that circuit paths whether they are twisted pair cables, printed circuit paths, striplines, microstrip lines, or another realization propagate signals as transmission lines. They have faced the problem that transmission lines introduce when they are not properly terminated or when the transient delay of the line is not included in the overall system time delay. Furthermore, the design of signal distribution circuits has been accomplished without adequate analytical support.
 An approximation of a transmission by a ladder network with a few series RL and shunt RC sections is inaccurate. The accuracy of the approximation can be improved by subdividing the line into more sections at the expense of computing time required for a solution.
