This paper studies charged device model electrostatic discharge (CDM-ESD) events in die stacking process of 3D-ICs and investigates CDM-ESD protection circuits for individual TSVs to prevent high voltage stress on transistor connected to TSV. The models for power, area, delay, and signal integrity of TSVs considering ESD protection are presented. The models are used to drive a methodology to design reliable 3D-ICs considering CDM-ESD while minimizing the overheads. We study the impact of ESD protection on die-to-die asynchronous interface circuit.
