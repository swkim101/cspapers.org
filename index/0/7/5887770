This demonstration presents EasySnap, an application that enables blind and low-vision users to take high-quality photos by providing real-time audio feedback as they point their existing camera phones. Users can readily follow the audio instructions to adjust their framing, zoom level and subject lighting appropriately. Real-time feedback is achieved on current hardware using computer vision in conjunction with use patterns drawn from current blind photographers.
