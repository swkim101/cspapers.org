In order to improve stimulus-response compatibility of touchpad in pen-based user interface, we present the tilt cursor, i.e. a cursor dynamically reshapes itself to providing the 3D orientation cue of pen. We also present two experiments that evaluate the tilt cursor's performance in circular menu selection and specific marking menu selection tasks. Results show that in a specific marking menu selection task, the tilt cursor significantly outperforms the shape-fixed arrow cursor and the live cursor [4]. In addition, results show that by using the tilt cursor, the response latencies for adjusting drawing directions are smaller than that by using the other two kinds of cursors.
