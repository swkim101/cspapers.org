In this paper, we will present an overview of our work that is aimed at integrating gaze into visual communication systems by measuring and guiding eye movements [1]. This requires investigating and modelling how eye movements are determined by the visual input, modelling what is relevant to the user, and new technological developments for better eye tracking and fast gaze-contingent graphics. A number of challenges remain, some of which may be solved by machine-learning techniques, e.g. predicting eye movements and inferring a personâ€™s intent.
