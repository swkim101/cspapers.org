The convergence of Web services and grid computing has promoted SOAP, a widely used Web services protocol, into a prominent protocol for a wide variety of grid applications. These applications differ widely in the characteristics of their respective SOAP messages, and also in their performance requirements. To make the right decisions, an application developer must thus understand the complex dependencies between the SOAP implementation and the application. We propose a standard benchmark suite for quantifying, comparing, and contrasting the performance of SOAP implementations under a wide range of representative use cases. The benchmarks are defined by a set of WSDL documents. To demonstrate the utility of the benchmarks and to provide a snapshot of the current SOAP implementation landscape, we report the performance of many different SOAP implementations (gSOAP, AxisJava, XSUL and bSOAP) on the benchmarks, and draw conclusions about their current performance characteristics.
