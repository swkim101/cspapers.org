1. SUMMARY At SIGCSE 2010 program directors from the National Science Foundation held a panel [1] on the potential for Interdisciplinary Computing. As an outgrowth of that session, via an EAGER grant (OCI-1058623), Toward a Climate for Interdisciplinary Computing, a group of individuals drawn from a range of universities and from industry met in January 2011 and April 2011 to discuss the nature of interdisciplinary computing, its importance both for computing and for other disciplines, obstacles to the further emergence of interdisciplinary computing and ways in which these obstacles might be overcome. This session will provide an opportunity for the SIGCSE community to participate in this discussion.
