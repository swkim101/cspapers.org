Abstract : Active databases emphasize the notion that a body of information is dynamic and should respond intelligently and in non-trivial ways to the user. It provides a paradigm for research and development which combines aspects of both databases and artificial intelligence technologies. A prototype system has shown the viability of this approach. The author focuses on the following database issues : (1) Descriptions are used as semantic templates for associatively accessing and manipulating data objects; (2) Dynamic views minimize the typical distinctions between queries and retrievals, and between views and real data, and thereby increase the perceived immediacy of the user interface; and (3) Constraint Equations are developed as a declarative representation for semantic constraints. The uniform approach they provide for expressing database integrity, consistency, and more general semantics derives its power from the rule-based framework of recent A.I. expert systems. The efficiency of constraint maintenance also is considered. Lastly, (4) The notion of binding time of data associations and reference is discussed relative to both the choice of data model and to the method of data access. (Author)
