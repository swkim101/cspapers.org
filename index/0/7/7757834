This paper describes our experiences in having students build a software engineering tool as a course project in a CS2 course. The tool, which we called JDuck (Java Documenter of Code, oK), was modelled on the javadoc tool that is part of Sun Microsystem's standard Java Development Kit (JDK). That is, a working version of JDuck would be able to read in Java source code and generate HTML files that summarize the basic structure of the provided classes. We discuss how we set up the project, what we think the students learned, what they told us they learned, and what we would do differently next time.
