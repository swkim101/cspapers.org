Existing code designs for display-camera based visual communication all have an all-or-nothing behavior, i.e., they assume the entire code must be decoded. However, diverse operational conditions due to device hardware diversity (in camera resolution and frame rate) and distance range motivate more scalable designs. In this paper, we borrow the notion of hierarchical modulation from traditional RF communication, and design Strata, a layered coding scheme for visual communication. Strata can support a range of frame capture resolutions and rates, and deliver information rates correspondingly. Strata embeds information at multiple granularity into the same code area spatially or the same frame interval temporally. It ensures all layers are decodable independently, by controlling the amount of interference between adjacent layers. Further, our design is recursive and extends readily to generate more layers. Compared with existing codes, it significantly extends the operational range, though at the expense of less capacity than a single-layer code.
