Modeling of physical human-robot collaborations is generally a challenging problem due to the unpredictive nature of human behavior. To address this issue, we present a data-efficient reinforcement learning framework which enables a robot to learn how to collaborate with a human partner. The robot learns the task from its own sensorimotor experiences in an unsupervised manner. The uncertainty in the interaction is modeled using Gaussian processes (GP) to implement a forward model and an action-value function. Optimal action selection given the uncertain GP model is ensured by Bayesian optimization. We apply the framework to a scenario in which a human and a PR2 robot jointly control the ball position on a plank based on vision and force/torque data. Our experimental results show the suitability of the proposed method in terms of fast and data-efficient model learning, optimal action selection under uncertainty and equal role sharing between the partners.
