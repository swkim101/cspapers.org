We show that the reachability problem for recursive state machines (or equivalently, pushdown systems), believed for long to have cubic worst-case complexity, can be solved in slightly subcubic time. All that is necessary for the new bound is a simple adaptation of a known technique. We also show that a better algorithm exists if the input machine does not have infinite recursive loops.
