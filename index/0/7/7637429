In this demo, we present a web application which allows users to interact with two retrieval models, namely the Binary Independence Model (BIM) and the BM25 model, on a standard TREC collection. The goal of this demo is to give students deeper insight into the consequences of modeling assumptions (BIM vs. BM25) and the consequences of tuning parameter values by means of a two-dimensional representation of probabilities. The application was developed in R, and it is accessible at the following link: http://gmdn.shinyapps.io/shinyRF04.
