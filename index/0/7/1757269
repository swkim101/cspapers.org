In a data stream environment, a multi-way join continuous query is employed to monitor a considerable number of source data streams from various remote sites in real-time. One key role of a continuous query is detecting only the invocation of a particular event corresponding to the specifications of the query. The evaluation of such a detection-only query does not require to produce either an intermediate tuple or a final result tuple, which not only shortens the processing time of a query but also reduces the usage of memory space. However, there has been no special effort to deal with a query of this type. This paper proposes a new evaluation framework which efficiently processes a multi-way detection-only query without generating any intermediate result tuple explicitly.
