This paper presents a novel climbing robot called Clothbot which has high maneuverability on flexible clothes. It has a novel gripper consisting of two parallel wheels that can grip continuously and stably on various kinds of clothes. Clothbot also has an omni-directional tail of two DOFs so that it can change its center of gravity to control the moving direction on complex and undeterminate clothes. Consequently, Clothbot is able to access most positions of the clothes by moving straight and turning around with only four motors. It is compact, small and light-weighted but has a load capacity six times its own weight. A series of experiments validate its high performance on flexible clothes.
