Mobile devices will provide improved computing resources to sustain progressively more complicated applications. However, the design concept of fair scheduling and governing borrowed from legacy operating systems cannot be applied seamlessly in mobile systems, thereby degrading user experience or reducing energy efficiency. In this paper, we posit that mobile applications should be treated unfairly. To this end, we exploit the concept of application sensitivity and devise a user-centric scheduler and governor that allocate computing resources to applications according to their sensitivity. Furthermore, we integrate our design into the Android operating system. The results of extensive experiments on a commercial smartphone with real-world mobile apps demonstrate that the proposed design can achieve significant energy efficiency gains while improving the quality of user experience.
