In an effort to serve the needs of both majors and non-majors, the Computer Science Department at Centre College has restructured the CS I course so that it uses the language Python, devotes more attention to the Internet and the World Wide Web, addresses ethical and societal issues, and introduces students to programmable robots and an SQL database. This diverse course has been attractive to the students while still maintaining a strong emphasis on programming.
