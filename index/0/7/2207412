We describe a prototype software tool suite for semantic information integration; it has the following features. First, it can import local metadata as well as a domain ontology. Imported metadata is stored persistently in an ontological format. Second, it provides a semantic query facility that allows users to retrieve information across multiple data sources using the domain ontology directly. Third, it has a GUI for users to define mappings between the local metadata and the domain ontology. Fourth, it incorporates a novel mechanism to improve system reliability by dynamically adapting query execution upon detecting various types of environmental changes. In addition, this tool suite is compatible with W3C Semantic Web specifications such as RDF and OWL. It also uses the query engine of Commercial EII products for low level query processing.
