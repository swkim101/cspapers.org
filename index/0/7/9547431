Lifelogging technologies have the potential to provide memory cues for people who struggle with episodic memory impairment (EMI). These memory cues enable the recollection of significant experiences, which is important for people with EMI to regain a sense of normalcy in their lives. However, lifelogging technologies often collect an overwhelmingly large amount of data to review. The best memory cues need to be extracted and presented in a way that best supports episodic recollection. We describe the design of a new lifelogging system that captures photos, ambient audio, and location information and leverages both automated content/context analysis and the expertise of family caregivers to facilitate the extraction and annotation of a salient summary consisting of good cues from the lifelog. The system presents the selected cues for review in a way that maximizes the opportunities for the person with EMI to think deeply about these cues to trigger memory recollection on his own without burdening the caregiver. We compare our system with another review system that requires the caregiver to repeatedly guide the review process. Our self-guided system resulted in better memory retention and imposed a smaller burden on the caregiver whereas the caregiver-guided approach provided more opportunities for caregiver interaction.
