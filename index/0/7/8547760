This paper describes a program for filling in blank spaces in sentences which are given to elementary school children to test reading comprehension. The paper discusses the knowledge structure needed to represent what is being described In the sentences. As part of the structure, scenarios of classes of events are described. These scenarios contain general information about how the event occurs, who the likely actors are, and when the subparts of the event occur. The description of the scenario includes the use of free variables and the embedding of one scenario within another. Implementation of these characteristics of the scenario is described in some detail.
