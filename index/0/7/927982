We study the computational complexity of several natural problems arising in statistical physics and combinatorics. In particular, we consider the following problems: the mean magnetization and mean energy of the Ising model (both the ferromagnetic and the anti-ferromagnetic settings), the average size of an independent set in the hard core model, and the average size of a matching in the monomer-dimer model. We prove that for all non-trivial values of the underlying model parameters, exactly computing these averages is #P-hard. In contrast to previous results of Sinclair and Srivastava (2013) for the mean magnetization of the ferromagnetic Ising model, our approach does not use any Lee-Yang type theorems about the complex zeros of partition functions. Indeed, it was due to the lack of suitable Lee-Yang theorems for models such as the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model that some of the problems we study here were left open by Sinclair and Srivastava. In this paper, we instead use some relatively simple and well-known ideas from the theory of automatic symbolic integration to complete our hardness reductions.
