In this work, we examine evidence combination mechanisms for classifying multimedia information. In particular, we examine linear and Dempster-Shafer methods of evidence combination in the context of identifying personal images on the World Wide Web. An automatic web search engine named Diogenes1 searches the web for personal images and combines different pieces of evidence for identification. The sources of evidence consist of input from face detection/recognition and text/HTML analysis modules. A degree of uncertainty is involved with both of these sources. Diogenes automatically determines the uncertainty locally for each retrieval and uses this information to set a relative significance for each evidence. To our knowledge, Diogenes is the first image search engine using Dempster-Shafer evidence combination based on automatic object recognition and dynamic local uncertainty assessment. In our experiments Diogenes comfortably outperformed some well known commercial and research prototype image search engines for celebrity image queries.
