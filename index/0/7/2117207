Force-reflecting teleoperators in which the remote environment is kinesthetically coupled to the operator can considerably increase task performance. Wave-variable-based controllers can support the stable operation of force-reflecting teleoperators under arbitrary communication delays. Transparency in such systems is compromised in order to maintain stability. We had previously proposed a modified wave variable controller that implemented additional wave impedance in the wave variable transformations in order to focus more closely on force tracking. In this paper, we present a new controller for bilateral teleoperators based on the modified wave variable control method which provides superior position and force tracking performance compared to the traditional wave-variable-based method. Moreover, the method has high stability. Theoretical investigation and experimental results confirm the performance of this new controller.
