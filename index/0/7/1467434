This paper presents a corpus-based method for automatic evaluation of geometric constraints on projective prepositions. The method is used to find an appropriate model of geometric constraints for a two-dimensional domain. Two simple models are evaluated against the uses of projective prepositions in a corpus of natural language dialogues to find the best parameters of these models. Both models cover more than 96% of the data correctly. An extra treatment of negative uses of projective prepositions (e.g. A is not above B) improves both models getting close to full coverage.
