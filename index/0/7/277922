Active learning techniques are increasingly used in lower-level Computer Science courses. This work explores the use of active learning techniques in a graduate Computer Science course on computer architecture, where the course enrollment is composed of both undergraduates and graduate students. Initial results are presented on how the two groups of students respond differently to the techniques. In particular, the study includes the effect of using POGIL in place of a subset of lectures, measured through both student responses and test scores.
