We construct multi-modal concept representations by concatenating a skip-gram linguistic representation vector with a visual concept representation vector computed using the feature extraction layers of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large labeled object recognition dataset. This transfer learning approach brings a clear performance gain over features based on the traditional bag-of-visual-word approach. Experimental results are reported on the WordSim353 and MEN semantic relatedness evaluation tasks. We use visual features computed using either ImageNet or ESP Game images.
