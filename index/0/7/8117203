Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are widely adopted unsupervised representation learning methods and have powered many data mining tasks such as collaborative filtering and document representation. Recently, linked data that contains both attribute and link information has become ubiquitous in various domains. For example, social media data is inherently linked via social relations and web data is networked via hyperlinks. It is evident from recent work that link information can enhance a number of real-world applications such as clustering and recommendations. Therefore, link information has the potential to advance RBMs for better representation learning. However, the majority of existing RBMs have been designed for independent and identically distributed data and are unequipped for linked data. In this paper, we aim to design a new type of Restricted Boltzmann Machines that takes advantage of linked data. In particular, we propose a paired Restricted Boltzmann Machine (pRBM), which is able to leverage the attribute and link information of linked data for representation learning. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework pRBM.
