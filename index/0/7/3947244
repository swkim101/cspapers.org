We present radial scroll, an interface widget to support scrolling particularly on either small or large scale touch displays. Instead of dragging a elevator in a scroll bar, or using repetitive key presses to page up or down, users gesture anywhere on the document surface such that clockwise gestures advance the document; counter clockwise gestures reverse the document. We describe our prototype implementation and discuss the results of an initial user study.
