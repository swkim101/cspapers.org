This paper presents a framework for unsupervised natural language morphology induction wherein candidate suffixes are grouped into candidate inflection classes, which are then arranged in a lattice structure. With similar candidate inflection classes placed near one another in the lattice, I propose this structure is an ideal search space in which to isolate the true inflection classes of a language. This paper discusses and motivates possible search strategies over the inflection class lattice structure.
