Web search engines cache results of frequent and/or recent queries. Result caching strategies can be evaluated using different metrics, hit rate being the most well-known. Recent works take the processing overhead of queries into account when evaluating the performance of result caching strategies and propose cost-aware caching strategies. In this paper, we propose a financial cost metric that goes one step beyond and takes also the hourly electricity prices into account when computing the cost. We evaluate the most well-known static, dynamic, and hybrid result caching strategies under this new metric. Moreover, we propose a financial-cost-aware version of the well-known LRU strategy and show that it outperforms the original LRU strategy in terms of the financial cost metric.
