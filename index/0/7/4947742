We present here an original approach to test the feasibility of footsteps for a given walking pattern generator. It is based on a new approximation algorithm intended to cope with this specific problem. The result obtained is used on the robot HRP-2, and enables it to guess a step feasibility 40,000 times faster (in 9Âµs) than with the normal verification process. As a consequence some advance is made towards fast online motion (re)planning based on a continuous set of possible steps.
