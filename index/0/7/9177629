Safety of a manipulator designed to be used at home requires different approach than industrial robots, where safety is achieved mainly by decreasing the interaction with humans. Robots for applications at home, however, require frequent interaction with humans. Introducing compliant component gives the answer to the safety issue at the cost of performance degradation. In order to reduce the performance degradation, manipulators equipped with variable stiffness have been studied by many researchers. This paper presents a variable stiffness joint(VSJ) designed for a robot manipulator. The stiffness is generated by leaf springs and two actuators are used to control the position and stiffness of the joint. Changing the effective length of the spring results in change in stiffness. The position of the joint is controlled via rotating two actuators at the same speed in the same direction. The stiffness is controlled when the two actuators rotate in the different speed. Experiments are conducted to show that the position and stiffness are controlled independent with each other and having less stiffness at the joint helps in making unexpected collision with object safer.
