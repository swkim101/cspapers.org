Bayesian network classifiers have been widely used for classification problems. Given a fixed Bayesian network structure, parameters learning can take two different approaches: generative and discriminative learning. While generative parameter learning is more efficient, discriminative parameter learning is more effective. In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient, and effective discriminative parameter learning method, called Discriminative Frequency Estimate (DFE), which learns parameters by discriminatively computing frequencies from data. Empirical studies show that the DFE algorithm integrates the advantages of both generative and discriminative learning: it performs as well as the state-of-the-art discriminative parameter learning method ELR in accuracy, but is significantly more efficient.
