Semantic smoothing, which incorporates synonym and sense information into the language models, is effective and potentially significant to improve retrieval performance. The implemented semantic smoothing models, such as the translation model which statistically maps document terms to query terms, and a number of works that have followed have shown good experimental results. However, these models are unable to incorporate contextual information. Thus, the resulting translation might be mixed and fairly general. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel context-sensitive semantic smoothing method that decomposes a document or a query into a set of weighted context-sensitive topic signatures and then translate those topic signatures into query terms. In detail, we solve this problem through (1) choosing concept pairs as topic signatures and adopting an ontology-based approach to extract concept pairs; (2) estimating the translation model for each topic signature using the EM algorithm; and (3) expanding document and query models based on topic signature translations. The new smoothing method is evaluated on TREC 2004/05 Genomics Track collections and significant improvements are obtained. The MAP (mean average precision) achieves a 33.6% maximal gain over the simple language model, as well as a 7.8% gain over the language model with context-insensitive semantic smoothing.
