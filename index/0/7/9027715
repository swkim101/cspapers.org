The difficulties to be met with the resolution of syntactical ambiguity in MT can be at least partially overcome by means of preserving the syntactical ambiguity of the source language into the target language. An extensive study of the correspondences between the syntactically ambiguous structures in English and Bulgarian has provided a solid empirical basis in favor of such an approach. Similar results could be expected for other sufficiently related languages as well. The paper concentrates on the linguistic grounds for adopting the approach proposed.
