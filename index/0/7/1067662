Leakage power is projected to comprise approximately 50% of the processor's power for sub 65 nm technologies. Much of this power is consumed in the processor's functional units. Accordingly, leakage control techniques are employed to reduce leakage in these functional units. Many of these techniques are dynamic and are based on an input sleep signal to initiate a low leakage mode. However, since most of these leakage control techniques are based on circuit level schemes, such techniques inherently lack information about the operational profile of the functional units they manage. This limitation is usually handled statically by using a fixed length counter that generates the sleep signal when the functional unit is idle for a specified number of cycles. In this paper, the limitations of the static sleep signal generation approach are identified, and the use of a dynamic alternative that is capable of adopting the counter length to the running application is proposed. In order to assess the accuracy of the proposed dynamic sleep signal generator, the length of the sleep period following the sleep signal generation is used as a metric to identify the usefulness of utilizing the dynamic approach. Experimental results for the dynamic alternative shows up to 98% accuracy in predicting the length of the standby period compared to an average of 40-60% in the static case, which translates into increased leakage savings. This is achieved while consuming 360 muW of overhead power at 1 GHz
