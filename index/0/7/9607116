As the use of Ada in commercial programming increases, it becomes more important to make an attempt to introduce it into the curriculum as early as possible. We have taught CS1 successfully using Ada by strictly concentrating on a subset of the language and through the use of a student-oriented package which enables students to begin writing programs in Ada after one lecture. A laboratory of personal computers was found to be adequate for CS1 use and students were able to write up to 2 programs per week in the course.
