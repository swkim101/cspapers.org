This work attempts to integrate the features of two standard s, ODMG’s OQL and SQL2, with the key features of the query language OQL which was implemented for the knowledge base management system OSAM*.KBMS at the University of Florida. It focuses on the incorporation of the following features of OQL and SQL2 into ODMG’s OQL: 1) the specification of linear, tree or network pattern of object associations in the from clause, 2) the inclusion of two types of non-association operators in p attern specifications, 3) the specification of multiple object oper ations to be performed on different objects of multiple classes which sa tisfy the select-from-whereconstruct, 4) the use of ”subdatabase” instead of ”structure” as the query result to preserve object behavi ors and the closure property of the language, and 5) the use of SQL’s storage operations for data manipulations. The above exten sions can be implemented using centralized and parallel pattern-bas ed query processing algorithms reported in the literature. The aim o f this work is not to introduce yet another object-oriented query l anguage, but to point out some useful extensions to the existing stand ard.
