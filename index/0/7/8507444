It is important to correct the errors in the results of speech recognition to increase the performance of a speech translation system. This paper proposes a method for correcting errors using the statistical features of character co-occurrence, and evaluates the method.The proposed method comprises two successive correcting processes. The first process uses pairs of strings: the first string is an erroneous substring of the utterance predicted by speech recognition, the second string is the corresponding section of the actual utterance. Errors are detected and corrected according to the database learned from erroneous-correct utterance pairs. The remaining errors are passed to the posterior process which uses a string in the corpus that is similar to the string including recognition errors.The results of our evaluation show that the use of our proposed method as a post-processor for speech recognition is likely to make a significant contribution to the performance of speech translation systems.
