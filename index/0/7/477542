We analyse the query log of a click-oriented Japanese search engine that utilises the link structures of Wikipedia for encouraging the user to change his information need and to perform repeated, serendipitous, exploratory search. Our results show that users tend to make transitions within the same query type: from person names to person names, from place names to place names, and so on.
