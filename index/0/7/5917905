Most high performance routers today use combined input and output queueing (CIOQ). The CIOQ router is also frequently used as an abstract model for routers: at one extreme is input queueing, at the other extreme is output queueing, and in-between there is a continuum of performance as the speedup is increased from 1 to N (where N is the number of linecards). The model includes architectures in which a switch fabric is sandwiched between two stages of buffering. There is a rich and growing theory for CIOQ routers, including algorithms, throughput results and conditions under which delays can be guaranteed. But there is a broad class of architectures that are not captured by the CIOQ model, including routers with centralized shared memory, and load-balanced routers. In this paper we propose an abstract model called Single-Buffered (SB) routers that includes these architectures. We describe a method called Constraint Sets to analyze a number of SB router architectures. The model helped identify previously unstudied architectures, in particular the Distributed Shared Memory router. Although commercially deployed, its performance is not widely known. We find conditions under which it can emulate an ideal shared memory router, and believe it to be a promising architecture. Questions remain about its complexity, but we find that the memory bandwidth, and potentially the power consumption of the router is lower than for a CIOQ router.
