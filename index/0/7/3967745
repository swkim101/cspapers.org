Supply chains can be seen as cyber-physical networks grounded on object identification and tracking. Conventional trust models featuring centralized information management architectures and simplistic things classification lend two of the most relevant limitations to current solutions. Blockchain introduces novel and a valuable trust approaches while semantic technologies better permit a things description. This paper introduces a semantic-enhanced blockchain platform allowing a flexible object discovery. It is based on validation by consensus of smart contracts and adopt a semantic matchmaking between queries and object annotations expressed w.r.t. ontology models. Early experiments assess the good behaviour of the proposed framework.
