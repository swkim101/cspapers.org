Side Information generation is one of major problems in Distributed Video Coding (DVC). This can be performed by motion compensated temporal interpolation (MCTI) between two closest key frames. However, when temporal distance between the key frames increases, its linear interpolation becomes less effective. This paper introduces a hierarchical side information generation structure applicable to DVC with long Group of Picture (GOP) sizes in mind. Moreover, two quantization parameter control techniques are proposed. Experimental results verify efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
