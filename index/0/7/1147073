We present a novel approach to query reformulation which combines syntactic and semantic information by means of generalized Levenshtein distance algorithms where the substitution operation costs are based on probabilistic term rewrite functions. We investigate unsupervised, compact and efficient models, and provide empirical evidence of their effectiveness. We further explore a generative model of query reformulation and supervised combination methods providing improved performance at variable computational costs. Among other desirable properties, our similarity measures incorporate information-theoretic interpretations of taxonomic relations such as specification and generalization.
