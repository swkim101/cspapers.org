A hierarchical timing verification system is described. It can evaluate all logical paths in a chip without any specific manual input information, using a path tracing algorithm. This hierarchical approach can drastically reduce the number of logical paths to be traced and the corresponding computation time. This system is used for designing master slice (gate array) LSIs and building block LSIs.
