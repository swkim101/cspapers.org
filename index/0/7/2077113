We argue that unintended effects occur when imposing the traditionally employed semantics on the very expressive DLs that underly the OWL 1 and OWL 2 standards. Consequently, we suggest a revised semantics that behaves more intuitively in these cases and coincides with the traditional semantics of less expressive DLs. Moreover, we introduce a way of answering epistemic queries to OWL knowledge bases by a reduction to standard OWL reasoning. We provide an implementation of our approach and present first evaluation results.
