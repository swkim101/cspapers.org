This paper describes a neural network algorithm that (1) performs temporal pattern matching in real-time, (2) is trained on-line, with a single pass, (3) requires only a single template for training of each representative class, (4) is continuously adaptable to changes in background noise, (5) deals with transient signals having low signal-to-noise ratios, (6) works in the presence of non-Gaussian noise, (7) makes use of context dependencies and (8) outputs Bayesian probability estimates. The algorithm has been adapted to the problem of passive sonar signal detection and classification. It runs on a Connection Machine and correctly classifies, within 500 ms of onset, signals embedded in noise and subject to considerable uncertainty.
