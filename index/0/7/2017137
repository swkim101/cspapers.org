Introductory non-major learners face the challenge of mastering programming fundamentals while remaining sufficiently motivated to engage with the computing discipline. In particular, multi-disciplinary students struggle to find relevance in traditional computing curricula that tend to either emphasize abstract concepts, focus on entertainment (e.g., game and animation design), or rely on decontextualized settings. To address these issues, this demo introduces BlockPy, a web-based environment for Python (https://blockpy.com). The most powerful feature of BlockPy is a dual text/block view that beginners can freely move between, using advanced Mutual Language Translation techniques. The environment contextualizes introductory programming with data science by integrating real-world data including weather reports, classic book statistics, and historical crime data. A fusion of Blockly and Skulpt, the entire interface runs locally with no need for server sandboxing. BlockPy is also a platform for interactive, guided practice problems with automatic feedback that scaffolds learners. This demo will walk through the novel features of BlockPy's environment, including the instructor's perspective of creating new problems and how BlockPy can be embedded in modern LTI-compatible learning management systems. BlockPy is available online for free and is open-sourced on GitHub. This material is based on work supported by the NSF under Grants No. DGE-0822220, DUE-1444094, and DUE-1624320.
