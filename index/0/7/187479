We have developed autonomous mobile robots which requires no guide lines. The mobile robot can individually searches for the optimum route to its destination by comparing the builtin map with the measured data obtained from ultrasonic sensors to reach the destination at last. It is equipped with a five-axis vertical articulated type providing the handling accuracy of +1 mm through visual compensation. The autonomous mobile robots, being made clean in the structure basis such as the use of DD motors, are now started to be actually used as transfer robots in clean rooms.
