: We prove a dichotomy theorem for two-party protocols, and show that for every poly-time two-party protocol with single-bit output, at least one of following holds: Namely, if the protocol cannot be used to construct key-agreement, its output distribution (X; Y; T) is trivial: it can be simulated non-interactively by the parties given public randomness (used to sample T). (The precise also has qualifiers of the form: infinitely many choices of the security parameter"). We use the above characterization to prove that (Î±= 24Îµ 2 )-correct differentially private symmetric protocol for computing XOR, implies the existence of key-agreement protocol. The above dependency between Î± and &epsilon is tight since an Î¸( Îµ 2 )-correct "-differentially private protocol for computing XOR is known to exists unconditionally. It also improves, in the ( Îµ,Î±)dependency aspect, upon Goyal et al. [ICALP '16] who showed that, for some constant c > 0, a c-correct "-differentially private protocol for computing XOR implies oblivious transfer. Our result extends to a weaker notion of di erential privacy in which the privacy only requires to hold against external observer.
