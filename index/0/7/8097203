Pair Programming has demonstrated benefits for education, but unique concerns of mobile software design raise questions about the effectiveness of Pair Programming in this evolving field. This paper probes unique challenges for Pair Programming when used in mobile software design classes, focusing on five mobile design topics: dealing with interface and data management, using camera, handling multi-device connectivity, using sensors and collecting GPS data, and using microphones and speakers. The paper highlights successes and challenges for Pair Programming and mobile applications, concluding with recommendations on building assignments, managing student interaction, and implementing Pair Programming for instructors considering using it in their mobile development classes.
