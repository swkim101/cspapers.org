We present a near-quadratic time algorithm that computes a point inside a simple polygon P having approximately the largest visibility polygon inside P, and near-linear time algorithm for finding the point that will have approximately the largest Voronoi region when added to an n-point set. We apply the same technique to find the translation that approximately maximizes the area of intersection of two polygonal regions in near-quadratic time.
