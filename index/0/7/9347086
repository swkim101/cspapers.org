We consider the problem of estimating the time-varying stiffness in real-time of a Variable Stiffness Actuator in an agonistic-antagonistic configuration. The estimation of the stiffness is done in two steps. First, we use operational calculus which provides a relation between the positions/velocities of the motors and the link, the torques of the motors and the stiffness. Second, we combine the obtained relation with a polynomial approximation of the stiffness and a recursive least square algorithm to fit the data. Simulations and experimental results are provided and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
