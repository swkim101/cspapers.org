We present our experience developing and managing new interdisciplinary programs in computer forensics and digital media informatics -- the results of successful collaboration with social science faculty. The computer forensics minor is an interdisciplinary program that integrates criminal justice and computer science and combines both theoretical concepts and practical skills to prepare students for a career in the area of information security and digital forensics. The digital media informatics major is an interdisciplinary program run jointly by the computer science and communication studies departments. The program provides both broad and targeted perspectives on the field of informatics and helps students develop unique skills that can be adapted to the rapidly changing computer and media environment through four specialized concentrations: (1) audio-visual, (2) graphics, mobile, & web development, (3) gaming & artificial intelligence, and (4) digital writing. We describe the various stages in developing the interdisciplinary programs including an analysis of competitive academic programs, evaluation of current resources, qualifications and faculty considerations, the process of developing the program objectives and learning outcomes, and assessment strategies. We focus on common issues that arose during the development process such as the challenge of designing balanced curricula for interdisciplinary programs, the need for designing new courses and renovating existing courses. We also discuss the anticipated costs of the programs, required resources, recruitment strategies, and the administrative approval mechanism.
