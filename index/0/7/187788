This paper examines the use of generic summaries for indexing in information retrieval. Our main observations are that: (1) With or without pseudo-relevance feedback, a summary index may be as effective as the corresponding fulltext index forprecision-oriented search of highly relevant documents. %43 But a reasonably sophisticated summarizer, using a compression ratio of 10-30%, is desirable for this purpose. (2) In pseudo-relevance feedback, using a summary index at initial search and a fulltext index at final search is possibly effective for precision-oriented search, regardless of relevance levels. This strategy is significantly more effective than the one using the summary index only and probably more effective than using summaries as mere term selection filters. %the use of summaries as mere term selection filters. %The summary quality is probably not a critical factor for this strategy, For this strategy, the summary quality is probably not a critical factor, and a compression ratio of 5-10% appears best.
