Formulating and processing phrases and other term dependencies to improve query effectiveness is an important problem in information retrieval. However, accessing these types of statistics using standard inverted indexes requires unreasonable processing time or incurs a substantial space overhead. Establishing a balance between these competing space and time trade-offs can dramatically improve system performance. In this paper, we present and analyze a new index structure designed to improve query efficiency in term dependency retrieval models, with bounded space requirements. By adapting a class of (ε,δ)-approximation algorithms originally proposed for sketch summarization in networking applications, we show how to accurately estimate various statistics important in term dependency models with low, probabilistically bounded error rates. The space requirements of the sketch index structure is largely independent of this size and the number of phrase term dependencies. Empirically, we show that the sketch index can reduce the space requirements of the vocabulary component of an index of all n-grams consisting of between 1 and 5 words extracted from the Clueweb-Part-B collection to less than 0.2% of the requirements of an equivalent full index. We show that n-gram queries of 5 words can be processed more efficiently than in current alternatives, such as next-word indexes. We show retrieval using the sketch index to be up to 400 times faster than with positional indexes, and 15 times faster than next-word indexes.
