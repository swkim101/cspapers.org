We describe the dynamic testing and control results obtained with an exoskeletal robot finger with embedded fiber optical sensors. The finger is inspired by the designs of arthropod limbs, with integral strain sensilla concentrated near the joints. The use of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) allows for embedded sensors with high strain sensitivity and immunity to electromagnetic interference. The embedded sensors are useful for contact detection and for control of forces during fine manipulation. The application to force control requires precise and high-bandwidth measurement of contact forces. We present a nonlinear force control approach that combines signals from an optical interrogator and conventional joint angle sensors to achieve accurate tracking of desired contact forces.
