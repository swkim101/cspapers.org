Teaching networking and operating systems to information systems majors presents many challenges. Operating systems and networking tend to be taught in one of two ways. Either the material is non-technical, directed more toward the business information systems major, or the material is overly technical, equivalent of teaching a traditional computer science course. We have developed a model for teaching networking and operating systems to information systems majors that bridges that gap. The material is taught in the context of network administration, a topic well-suited to information systems majors. This paper describes our model, the curriculum we use, and the experience of students and faculty.
