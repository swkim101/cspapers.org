This paper describes how model checking has been integrated into an industrial hardware design process. We present an application oriented specification language for assumption/commitment style properties and an abstraction algorithm that generates an intuitive and efficient representation of synchronous circuits. These approaches are embedded in our Circuit Verification Environment CVE. They are demonstrated on two industrial applications.
