It means a collection of computer-based facilities to support the activities of programmers, software engineers, system designers, project managers etc, to achieve higher productivity and higher product quality. An environment is something more than merely a collection of tools: for instance, it should be possible to pass information between the tools, it should be possible to share information among the members of a project team, and support should not be confined to a small range of project activities.
