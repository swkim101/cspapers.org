This work explores a method for efficient pre-allocation of circuits in network-on-chip (NoC) to reduce communication latency and improve performance. Circuit pre-allocation eliminates the time cost of circuit establishment by using request messages to reserve the circuits for their anticipated reply messages. Requests reserve circuits in a priority order rather than for a particular time slot, avoiding delays or blocking even if the newly requested circuits conflict with previously reserved ones. Benchmark simulations show speedup in execution time of up to 16%, with an average of 8% for communication sensitive benchmarks, over a leading proposal in pre-configuring circuits.
