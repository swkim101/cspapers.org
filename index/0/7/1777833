Implementing secure code is an important and oft-overlooked non-functional requirement. Secure programming errors are a subset of program errors that result in many common privacy and security breaches in commercial software. We are seeking to provide interactive support for secure programming in the development environment. In this paper, we have evaluated our prototype tool, ASIDE, which provides real-time warnings and code generation to reduce secure programming errors introduced by programmers. We evaluate the potential use and effectiveness of ASIDE on both novice and professional developers in two comparison user studies. Our results demonstrate that the interactive support can help address this important non-functional requirement, and suggest guidelines for such tools to support programmers.
