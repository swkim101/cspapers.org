An open, extendible multi-dictionary system is introduced in the paper. It supports the translator in accessing adequate entries of various bi- and monolingual dictionaries and translation examples from parallel corpora. Simultaneously an unlimited number of dictionaries can be held open, thus by a single interrogation step, all the dictionaries (translations, explanations, synonyms, etc.) can be surveyed. The implemented system (called MoBiDic) knows morphological rules of the dictionaries' languages. Thus, never the actual (inflected) words, but always their lemmas-that is, the right dictionary entries-are looked up. MoBiDic has an open, multimedial architecture, thus it is suitable for handling not only textual, but speaking or picture dictionaries, as well. The same system is also able to find words and expressions in corpora, dynamically providing the translators with examples from their earlier translations or other translators' works. MoBiDic has been designed for translator workgroups, where the translators' own glossaries (built also with the help of the system) may also be disseminated among the members of the group, with different access rights, if needed. The system has a TCP/IP-based client-server implementation for various platforms and available with a gradually increasing number of dictionaries for numerous language pairs.
