In this paper we explore the problem of collecting malicious smartphone advertisements. Most smartphone app contains advertisements and also suffers from vulnerable advertisement libraries. Malicious advertisements exploit the ad library vulnerability and attack victim smartphones. Similar to the traditional honeypots, we need an effective way to capture malicious ads. In this paper, we provide our approach named AdHoneyDroid. We build a crawler to gather apps on the android marketplaces and manually collect ad libraries and their vulnerabilities. Then AdHoneyDroid executes the apps and detects malicious advertisements. In our approach, we adopt the idea of API sandbox and TaintDroid to detect the attack event. We store the malicious advertisements in a database for future analysis. Malicious ads can help security analysts have a better understanding of current mobile attacks and also disclose the attack payloads.
