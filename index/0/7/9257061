As the transistor feature size is continuously scaled down, integrated circuits are more vulnerable to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations, causing infrequent timing errors. Various techniques have been proposed to tackle this problem and circuit-level timing speculation is one of the most promising solutions. However, directly applying such technique can be quite costly in terms of area overhead and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose cost-efficient re-synthesis solutions to tackle this problem. We try to reduce the number of suspicious flip-flops (FFs) that might have timing errors by retiming techniques, which relocate some suspicious FFs without increasing critical path delay. An efficient and effective algorithm is then utilized to pad those short paths linking the remaining suspicious FFs to ensure the functional correctness of timing speculators. Experimental results show that the proposed solution can achieve significant area reduction for timing speculation.
