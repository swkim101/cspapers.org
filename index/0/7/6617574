Non-expert annotation services like Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk (AMT) are cheap and fast ways to evaluate systems and provide categorical annotations for training data. Unfortunately, some annotators choose bad labels in order to maximize their pay. Manual identification is tedious, so we experiment with an item-response model. It learns in an unsupervised fashion to a) identify which annotators are trustworthy and b) predict the correct underlying labels. We match performance of more complex state-of-the-art systems and perform well even under adversarial conditions. We show considerable improvements over standard baselines, both for predicted label accuracy and trustworthiness estimates. The latter can be further improved by introducing a prior on model parameters and using Variational Bayes inference. Additionally, we can achieve even higher accuracy by focusing on the instances our model is most confident in (trading in some recall), and by incorporating annotated control instances. Our system, MACE (Multi-Annotator Competence Estimation), is available for download 1 .
