When software components evolve, they change interfaces, which may break backward compatibility. We present a tool that facilitates checking whether a new version of component is source compatible with a previous version. This tool figures out the component interface and generates the client code that uses the component interface to maximum extent. If the generated client compiles against the new component interface, those two versions are more or less compatible. The tool can be useful for API authors.
