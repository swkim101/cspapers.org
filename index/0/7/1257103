We present a statistical model for predicting how the user of an interactive, situated NLP system resolved a referring expression. The model makes an initial prediction based on the meaning of the utterance, and revises it continuously based on the userâ€™s behavior. The combined model outperforms its components in predicting reference resolution and when to give feedback.
