with continuous distributions of bidders’ values 1 . Very little research has been devoted to auctions with discrete bids and values. We take some important first steps in this direction by computationally investigating when an iterated bestresponse procedure might lead to a BNE. Standard auctions have a special structure that simplifies best-response computation. We present experimental results for single auction settings and symmetrically distributed bidders’ values. Unlike most past research, both bids and values are discrete. Only first- and second-price auctions are considered, but the ultimate goal of this research is to design an iterative procedure capable of finding BNE in more complicated settings (e.g., multiple one-shot simultaneous auctions with valuations over bundles).
