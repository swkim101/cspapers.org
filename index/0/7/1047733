Dataflow computers are an alternative to the von Neumann architectures and are capable of exploiting large amount of parallelism inherent in many computer applications. This paper deals with the performance analysis of the Manchester dataflow computer based on queueing network models. The model of the dataflow computer has been validated by comparing the analytical results with those obtained from the prototype Manchester dataflow computer. The bottleneck centers in the prototype machine have been identified through the model and various architectural modifications have been investigated both from performance and reliability viewpoints.
