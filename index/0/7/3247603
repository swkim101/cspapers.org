We present a purely rotational visual servoing algorithm, which aligns the orientation between two cameras at different locations in space. Specifically, our kinematic controller steers a set of so-called bi-tangent lines to intersect at the epipole using a purely image-based bi-tangent line Jacobian. Bi-tangent lines, i.e. lines joining corresponding features on the superposition of two views of a scene, can be defined for both points and contours, so we apply our controller to both feature types. Simulated experiments demonstrate the parametric robustness of the proposed method.
