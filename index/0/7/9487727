Recent years have witnessed significant growth in the adoption of portable wireless communication and computing devices (e.g., laptops, PDAs, smart phones) and large-scale deployment of wireless networks (e.g., cellular, WLANs). We envision that future usage of mobile devices and services will be highly personalized. Users will incorporate these new technologies into their daily lives, and the way they use new devices and services will reflect their personality and lifestyle. Therefore it is imperative to study and characterize the fundamental structure of wireless user behavior in order to model, manage, leverage and design efficient mobile networks and services. In this study, using our systematic TRACE approach, we analyze wireless users' behavioral patterns by extensively mining wireless network logs from two major university campuses. We represent the data using location-preference vectors, and utilize unsupervised learning (clustering) to classify trends in user behavior using novel similarity metrics. Matrix decomposition techniques are used to identify (and differentiate between) major patterns. We discover multi-modal user behavior and hundreds of distinct groups with unique behavioral patterns in both campuses, and their sizes follow a power-law distribution. Our methods and findings might provide new directions in network management and behavior-aware network protocols and applications, to name a few.
