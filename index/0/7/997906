Sensor networks not only have the potential to change the way we use, interact with, and view computers, but also the way we use, interact with, and view the world around us. In order to maximize the effectiveness of sensor networks, one has to identify, examine, understand, and provide solutions for the fundamental problems related to wireless embedded sensor networks. We believe that one of such problems is to determine how well the sensor network monitors the instrumented area. These problems are usually classified as coverage problems. There already exist several methods that have been proposed to evaluate a sensor network's coverage.We start from one of such method and provide a new approach to complement it. The method of using the minimal exposure path to quantify coverage has been optimally solved using a numerical approximation approach. The minimal exposure path can be thought of as the worst-case coverage of a sensor network. Our first goal is to develop an efficient localized algorithm that enables a sensor network to determine its minimal exposure path. The theoretical highlight of this paper is the closed-form solution for minimal exposure in the presence of a single sensor. This solution is the basis for the new and significantly faster localized approximation algorithm that reduces the theoretical complexity of the previous algorithm. On the other hand, we introduce a new coverage problem - the maximal exposure path - which is in a sense the best-case coverage path for a sensor network. We prove that the maximal exposure path problem is NP-hard, and thus, we provide heuristics to generate approximate solutions.In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms through several simulations. In the case of the minimal single-source minimal exposure path, we use variational calculus to determine exact solutions. For the case of maximal exposure, we use networks with varying numbers of sensors and exposure models.
