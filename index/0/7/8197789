Since the introduction of dynamic dictionary based data compression by Ziv and Lempel two decades ago many dictionary construction schemes have been proposed and implemented This paper considers the following question once a dynamic dictionary construction scheme is selected is there an e cient dynamic parsing method that results with the smallest number of phrases possible for the selected scheme for all input strings It is shown that greedy parsing a method used in almost all dictionary based algorithms including unix compress gif image compression and fax and modem standards can be far from optimal for certain input strings On the positive side a simple parsing method is introduced which for any selected dictionary scheme which has the pre x property this includes virtually all the variations on Lempel Ziv algorithms is optimal with respect to the selected scheme for any input string Also introduced is a simple data structure that enables an e cient dynamic implementation of the parsing method in O time per character and optimal space requirement
