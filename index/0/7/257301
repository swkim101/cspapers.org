A full formal machine-checked verification of a C program: the OpenSSL implementation of SHA-256. This is an interactive proof of functional correctness in the Coq proof assistant, using the Verifiable C program logic. Verifiable C is a separation logic for the C language, proved sound w.r.t. the operational semantics for C, connected to the CompCert verified optimizing C compiler.
