Professional search activities such as patent and legal search are often time sensitive and consist of rich information needs with multiple aspects or subtopics. This paper proposes a 3D water filling model to describe this search process, and derives a new evaluation metric, the Cube Test, to encompass the complex nature of professional search. The new metric is compared against state-of-the-art patent search evaluation metrics as well as Web search evaluation metrics over two distinct patent datasets. The experimental results show that the Cube Test metric effectively captures the characteristics and requirements of professional search.
