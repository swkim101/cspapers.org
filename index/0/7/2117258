Many supervised multi-task learning methods have been proposed, while unsupervised multi-task learning is still a rarely studied problem. In this paper, we propose to learn a kernel for multi-task clustering. Our goal is to learn a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, in which the geometric structure of the data in each task is preserved, while the data distributions of any two tasks are as close as possible. This is formulated as a unified kernel learning framework, under which we study two types of kernel learning: nonparametric kernel learning and spectral kernel design. Both types of kernel learning can be solved by linear programming. Experiments on several cross-domain text data sets demonstrate that kernel k-means on the learned kernel can achieve better clustering results than traditional single-task clustering methods. It also outperforms the newly proposed multi-task clustering method.
