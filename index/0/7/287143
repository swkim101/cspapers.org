In earlier work we have argued that formal process definitions can be useful in improving our understanding and performance of software development processes. There has, however, been considerable sentiment that formalized processes cannot capture the creative process of software design. This paper describes our experimentation with the hypothesis that both design speed and design quality can be improved through the use of formalized process definitions. Our experimentation supports this hypothesis.
