One current explanation of the view independent representation of space by the place-cells of the hippocampus is that they arise out of the summation of view dependent Gaussians. This proposal assumes that visual representations show bounded invariance. Here we investigate whether a recently proposed visual encoding scheme called the temporal population code can provide such representations. Our analysis is based on the behavior of a simulated robot in a virtual environment containing specific visual cues. Our results show that the temporal population code provides a representational substrate that can naturally account for the formation of place fields.
