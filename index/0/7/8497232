We have developed a framework based on relational algebra for compiling efficient sparse matrix code from dense DO-ANY loops and a specification of the representation of the sparse matrix. In this paper, we show how this framework can be used to generate parallel code, and present experimental data that demonstrates that the code generated by our Bernoulli compiler achieves performance competitive with that of hand-written codes for important computational kernels.
