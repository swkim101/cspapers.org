ADOPT and BnB-ADOPT are two optimal DCOP search algorithms that are similar except for their search strategies: the former uses best-first search and the latter uses depth-first branch-and-bound search. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, called ADOPT(k), that generalizes them. Its behavior depends on the k parameter. It behaves like ADOPT when k = 1, like BnB-ADOPT when k = ∞ and like a hybrid of ADOPT and BnB-ADOPT when 1 < k < ∞. We prove that ADOPT(k) is a correct and complete algorithm and experimentally show that ADOPT(k) outperforms ADOPT and BnB-ADOPT on several benchmarks across several metrics.
