Software engineers produce code that has formal syntax and semantics, which establishes its formal meaning. However, the code also includes significant natural language found primarily in identifier names and comments. Furthermore, the code is surrounded by non-source artifacts, predominantly written in natural language. The NaturaLiSE workshop focuses on natural language analysis of software. The workshop brings together researchers and practitioners interested in exploiting natural language information to create improved software engineering tools. Participants will explore natural language analysis applied to software artifacts, combining natural language and traditional program analysis, integration of natural language analyses into client tools, mining natural language data, and empirical studies focused on evaluating the usefulness of natural language analysis.
