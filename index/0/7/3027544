In this paper, we analyze MIPS instruction format¿ instruction data path¿decoder module function and design theory basend on RISC CPUT instruction set. Furthermore, we design instruction fetch(IF) module of 32-bit CPU based on RISC CPU instruction set. Function of IF module mainly includes fetch instruction and latch module¿address arithmetic module¿ check validity of instruction module¿synchronous control module. Function of IF modules are implemented by pipeline and simulated successfully on QuartusII¿
