Due to the magnitude and complexity of design and manufacturing processes, it is unrealistic to expect that models and simulations can predict all aspects of silicon behavior accurately. When unexpected behavior is observed in the post-silicon stage, one desires to identify the causes and consequently identify the fixes. This paper studies one formulation of the design-silicon mismatch problem. To analyze unexpected behavior, silicon behavior is partitioned into two classes, one class containing instances of unexpected behavior and the other with rest of the population. Classification rule learning is applied to extract rules to explain why certain class of behavior occurs. We present a rule learning algorithm that analyzes test measurement data in terms of design features to generate rules, and conduct controlled experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results show that the proposed learning approach can effectively uncover rules responsible for the design-silicon mismatch even when significant noises are associated with both the measurement data and the class partitioning results for capturing the unexpected behavior.
