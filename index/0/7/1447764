The Casemans 2011 workshop opens a platform to researchers of context-aware computing and self-managing systems to investigate the usefulness of context-awareness in emerging applications such as rescue applications, disaster avoidance and overcoming mechanisms, social networking, etc. These applications typically require timely context information to localise people and to share information based on shared interest as well as situations. An interesting research question is how to define and capture mutual context and how to share information in an efficient manner. Hence, the workshop focuses on context acquisition, modelling, reasoning, actuating techniques.
