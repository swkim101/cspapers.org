This paper describes some design refinements on marking menus and shows how these refinements embody interest ing and relevant design principles for HCI. These refinements are based on the design principles OR (1) maintaining visual context, (2) hiding unnecessmy information, and (3) supporting skill development by graphical feedback. The result is a new graphiczit representation and a more effective form of visual feedback and behavior for marking menus.
