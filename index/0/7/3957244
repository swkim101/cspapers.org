Many protocols in low-power wireless networks require a leader to bootstrap and maintain their operation. For example, Chaos and Glossy networks need an initiator to synchronize and initiate the communication rounds. Commonly, these protocols use a fixed, compile-time defined node as the leader. In this work, we tackle the challenge of dynamically bootstrapping the network and electing a leader in low-power wireless scenarios.
