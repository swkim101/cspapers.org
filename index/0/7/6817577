Over the past year, many advances in the Common Object Request Broker (CORBA) have occurred in relation to the World Wide Web (WWW). There have been various implementations of CORBA/Java mappings; Netscape, Oracle and others have decided to integrate CORBA into their products. Through the WWW we will see thousands, even hundreds of thousands, potential clients of distributed systems based on CORBA. Java has also been rapidly developing in this time frame and is becoming widely adopted, and there seems to be a detinite convergence of these technologies.
