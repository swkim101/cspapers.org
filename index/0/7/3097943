This paper is about explanation-based learning for heuristic problem solvers which "build" solutions using schemata (frames like scripts) as both "bricks" and "mortar". The heart of the paper is a description of a generalization method which is designed to extract as much information as possible from examples of successful problem solving behavior. A' related generalizer, (less powerful but more efficient), has been implemented as part of an experimental apprentice.
