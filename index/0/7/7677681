Endowing a computer with an ability to reason with diagrams could be of great benefit in terms of both human-computer interaction and computational efficiency through explicit representation. To date, research in diagrammatic reasoning has dealt with intra-diagrammatic reasoning (reasoning with a single diagram) almost to the exclusion of inter-diagrammatic reasoning (reasoning with related groups of diagrams). We postulate a number of general inter-diagrammatic operators and show how such operators can be useful in various diagrammatic domains. We develop a heuristic in the domain of game notation, derive fingering information in the domain of musical notation, and infer new information from related cartograms.
