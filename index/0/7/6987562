This paper describes an unsupervised algorithm for placing unknown words into a taxonomy and evaluates its accuracy on a large and varied sample of words. The algorithm works by first using a large corpus to find semantic neighbors of the unknown word, which we accomplish by combining latent semantic analysis with part-of-speech information. We then place the unknown word in the part of the taxonomy where these neighbors are most concentrated, using a class-labelling algorithm developed especially for this task. This method is used to reconstruct parts of the existing Word-Net database, obtaining results for common nouns, proper nouns and verbs. We evaluate the contribution made by part-of-speech tagging and show that automatic filtering using the class-labelling algorithm gives a fourfold improvement in accuracy.
