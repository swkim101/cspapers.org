Recommender systems (RS) have become an in-tegral part of our daily life. However, most current RS often repeatedly recommend items to users with similar proﬁles. We argue that recommendation should be diversiﬁed by leveraging session contexts with personalized user proﬁles. For this, current session-based RS (SBRS) often assume a rigidly ordered sequence over data which does not ﬁt in many real-world cases. Moreover, personal-ization is often omitted in current SBRS. Accordingly, a personalized SBRS over relaxedly ordered user-session contexts is more pragmatic. In do-ing so, deep-structured models tend to be too com-plex to serve for online SBRS owing to the large number of users and items. Therefore, we design an efﬁcient SBRS with shallow wide-in-wide-out networks, inspired by the successful experience in modern language modelings. The experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset show the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art methods.
