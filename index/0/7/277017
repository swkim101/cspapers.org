vv hen we wrote this paper, it had been over 20 years since caches had been introduced and they had become a regular feature in most computer systems. As applications were demanding more main memory and as the gap between processor speed and memory access time was widening (a familiar story today), the need for larger caches was clear. Like today though, increasing cache capacity was not a sufficient answer to the problem since as cache sizes grew, so did the cache access time. The need for a hierarchy of caches was apparent. Proposals for on-chip caches were burgeoning but, quite often, these caches were specialpurpose: instruction caches only, top-of-stack caches etc. Shared second level caches for multiprocessor systems had also been proposed and even been implemented in one Japanese machine (Facom). However, the placement of second level caches in shared-bus multiprocessors, the parallel processing architecture of choice in the late 80â€™s, and the impact of the cache hierarchy on snoopy coherence protocols had not been investigated thoroughly.
