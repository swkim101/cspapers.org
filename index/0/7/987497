In this paper we present an approach for building a Wikipedia-based semantic network by integrating Open Information Extraction with Knowledge Acquisition techniques. Our algorithm extracts relation instances from Wikipedia page bodies and ontologizes them by, first, creating sets of synonymous relational phrases, called relation synsets, second, assigning semantic classes to the arguments of these relation synsets and, third, disambiguating the initial relation instances with relation synsets. As a result we obtain WiSeNet, a Wikipedia-based Semantic Network with Wikipedia pages as concepts and labeled, ontologized relations between them.
