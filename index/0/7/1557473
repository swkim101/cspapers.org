In this paper, we discuss two tasks - on-line help and legal argument - that involve use of examples. In the case of on-line HELP, we discuss how to make it more intelligent by embedding custom-tailored examples in the explanations it gives its user. In the case of legal argumentation, we discuss how hypotheticals serve a central role in analyzing the strengths and weakness of a case and describe the generation of hypotheticals, stronger or weaker for one of the parties with respect to a doctrinal aspect, through modification of already existing cases or hypotheticals.
