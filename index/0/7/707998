Subspace clustering is an effective technique for segmenting data drawn from multiple subspaces. However, for time series data (e.g., human motion), exploiting temporal information is still a challenging problem. We propose a novel temporal subspace clustering (TSC) approach in this paper. We improve the subspace clustering technique from two aspects. First, a temporal Laplacian regularization is designed, which encodes the sequential relationships in time series data. Second, to obtain expressive codings, we learn a non-negative dictionary from data. An efficient optimization algorithm is presented to jointly learn the representation codings and dictionary. After constructing an affinity graph using the codings, multiple temporal segments can be grouped via spectral clustering. Experimental results on three action and gesture datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, TSC significantly improves the clustering accuracy, compared to the state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.
