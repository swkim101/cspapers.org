Representation learning (RL) has recently proven to be effective in capturing local item relationships by modeling item co-occurrence in individual user's interaction record. However, the value of RL for recommendation has not reached the full potential due to two major drawbacks: 1) recommendation is modeled as a rating prediction problem but should essentially be a personalized ranking one; 2) multi-level organizations of items are neglected for fine-grained item relationships. We design a unified Bayesian framework MRLR to learn user and item embeddings from a multi-level item organization, thus benefiting from RL as well as achieving the goal of personalized ranking. Extensive validation on real-world datasets shows that MRLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.
