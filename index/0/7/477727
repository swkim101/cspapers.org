Although they are used to expose pictures on the Web, users may not want to have a link between their identity and pictures without being able to modify them or control who accesses them. Photo tagging --- and more broadly face-recognition algorithms --- often escapes to the users' control and creates links between private situations and their public profile. To address this issue, we designed a geo-location aided system to let users declare their tagging preferences directly when the picture is taken. We present Photo-Tagging Preference Enforcement (Photo-TaPE) a system enforcing users tagging preferences without revealing their identity. By improving face-recognition efficiency, Photo-TaPE can guarantee the user tagging preferences in 67% of the cases and significantly reduces the processing time of face-recognition algorithms.
