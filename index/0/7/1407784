Repeated features are common in urban scenes. Many objects, such as clock towers with nearly identical sides, or domes with strong radial symmetries, pose challenges for structure from motion. When similar but distinct features are mistakenly equated, the resulting 3D reconstructions can have errors ranging from phantom walls and superimposed structures to a complete failure to reconstruct. We present a new approach to solving such problems by considering the local visibility structure of such repeated features. Drawing upon network theory, we present a new way of scoring features using a measure of local clustering. Our model leads to a simple, fast, and highly scalable technique for disambiguating repeated features based on an analysis of an underlying visibility graph, without relying on explicit geometric reasoning. We demonstrate our method on several very large datasets drawn from Internet photo collections, and compare it to a more traditional geometry-based disambiguation technique.
