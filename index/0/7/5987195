As robotics evolves towards application fields in which humans cooperate with robots, working closer and closer, the requirements for human robot interactions increase. This paper presents new advances in gesture based guidance and control of a robot in assistant tasks. The work described includes the integration of force and vision for the quantitative and qualitative appreciation of human intention and the robot behaviors to respond in real time to these human orders.
