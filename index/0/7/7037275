Scene classification is a fundamental perception task for environmental understanding in today's robotics. In this paper, we have attempted to exploit the use of popular machine learning technique of deep learning to enhance scene understanding, particularly in robotics applications. As scene images have larger diversity than the iconic object images, it is more challenging for deep learning methods to automatically learn features from scene images with less samples. Inspired by human scene understanding based on object knowledge, we address the problem of scene classification by encouraging deep neural networks to incorporate object-level information. This is implemented with a regularization of semantic segmentation. With only 5 thousand training images, as opposed to 2.5 million images, we show the proposed deep architecture achieves superior scene classification results to the state-of-the-art on a publicly available SUN RGB-D dataset. In addition, performance of semantic segmentation, the regularizer, also reaches a new record with refinement derived from predicted scene labels. Finally, we apply our model trained on SUN RGB-D dataset to a set of images captured in our university using a mobile robot, demonstrating the generalization ability of the proposed algorithm.
