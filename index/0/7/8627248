Traditional models of information retrieval assume documents are independently relevant. But when the goal is retrieving diverse or novel information about a topic, retrieval models need to capture dependencies between documents. Such tasks require alternative evaluation and optimization methods that operate on different types of relevance judgments. We define faceted topic retrieval as a particular novelty-driven task with the goal of finding a set of documents that cover the different facets of an information need. A faceted topic retrieval system must be able to cover as many facets as possible with the smallest number of documents. We introduce two novel models for faceted topic retrieval, one based on pruning a set of retrieved documents and one based on retrieving sets of documents through direct optimization of evaluation measures. We compare the performance of our models to MMR and the probabilistic model due to Zhai et al. on a set of 60 topics annotated with facets, showing that our models are competitive.
