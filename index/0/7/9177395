An intuitive context aware service between two devices is possible using touch with the intrabody communication. Using this technology, users with multimedia devices may simply touch them to establish network connection, transfer data, and provide the required service; hence the name Touch-And-Play (TAP). Using TAP, users can disclose their context by touching the specific device. For instance, a user carrying a digital camera touches the TV to begin a slide show or a printer to print a photo. TAP is expected to enable the provision of intuitive, context-aware service. This paper discusses the feasibility of TAP and its application in user interface.
