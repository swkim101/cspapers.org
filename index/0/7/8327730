A linear-complexity direct matrix solution is developed for the surface-integral based impedance extraction of arbitrarily-shaped 3-D non-ideal conductors embedded in dielectric materials. It outperforms state-of-the-art impedance solvers with fast CPU-time, modest memory-consumption, and without sacrificing accuracy. The inverse of a 2.6-million-unknown matrix arising from the extraction of large-scale 3-D interconnects was obtained in 1.5 GB memory and 1.3 hours on a 3 GHz CPU.
