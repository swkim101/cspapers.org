In this paper, the line-of sight and non line-of sight characteristics of a received signal are exploited to analyze the secrecy performance of the decode-and-forward scheme over Dual-Hop Asymmetric Fading Channels. In this scheme, the first hop from a source to relays is subject to Rician fading, whereas the second hop from relays to a destination experience Nakagami-m fading. The best relay is chosen to help the source to transmit data signals to the destination based on achievable secrecy rate (ASR) following criterions as: best source-relay, best relay-destination and best end-to-end. The secrecy performance is exactly evaluated by the secrecy outage probability of the ASR. The Monte-Carlo results are presented to verify the theoretical analysis.
