Visual Programming Languages from an Object-OrientedPerspectiveAllen L. Ambler, University of KansasMargaret M. Burnett, Michigan Technical University
Visual programming language research has evolved greatly sinceits early days. At first, attempts at visual programming mostlytook the form of flowchart-like diagrams. But in recent years, awide number of innovative approaches have been incorporated intovisual languages, including object-oriented programming, form-basedprogramming, programming by demonstration, and dataflowprogramming. Unfortunately, while many of these systems representimportant ideas, only a few have been successful as complete visualprogramming languages. This tutorial explains why this is true, anddescribes ways in which the problem can be addressed.
This tutorial explores the issues behind the successes andfailures of earlier approaches from a design perspective. Itidentifies characteristics of successful visual programminglanguages, and explains how to design an object-oriented languagethat maintains those characteristics. It shows solutions to anumber of problems by looking at existing visual programminglanguages, including Prograph.
