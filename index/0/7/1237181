In this paper, we propose a novel speeding-up method for biped walking using a swinging-arms motion based on the principle of an up-and-down wobbling mass. We have shown that biped robots with a wobbling mass can achieve fast walking using an active up-and-down motion of the wobbling mass. We have also shown that the active up-and-down motion increases walking speed of biped robots. We apply this principle to a biped robot with two linked arms like humans for achieving high-speed limit cycle walking. We show that the proposed method achieves high-speed limit cycle walking of biped robots with arms.
