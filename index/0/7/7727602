Many search domains are non-deterministic. Although real-time search methods have traditionally been studied in deterministic domains, they are well suited for searching nondeterministic domains since they do not have to plan for every contingency they can react to the actual outcomes of actions. In this paper, we introduce the min-max LRTA* algorithm, a simple extension of Korf's Learning Real-Time A* algorithm (LRTA*) to nondeterministic domains. We describe which nondeterministic domains min-max LRTA* can solve, and analyze its performance for these domains. We also give tight bounds on its worst-case performance and show how this performance depends on properties of both the domains and the heuristic functions used to encode prior information about the domains.
