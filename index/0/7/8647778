In this paper, we present a novel graph theoretic approach to the problem of document-word co-clustering. In our approach, documents and words are modeled as the two vertices of a bipartite graph. We then propose isoperimetric co-clustering algorithm (ICA) - a new method for partitioning the document-word bipartite graph. ICA requires a simple solution to a sparse system of linear equations instead of the eigenvalue or SVD problem in the popular spectral co-clustering approach. Our extensive experiments performed on publicly available datasets demonstrate the advantages of ICA over spectral approach in terms of the quality, efficiency and stability in partitioning the document-word bipartite graph.
