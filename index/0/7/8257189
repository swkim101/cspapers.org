Piaget's Genetic Epistemology and Artificial Intelligence can be of great use to each other, since the strengths of each approach complement the weaknesses of the other. Two ways of bringing the two approaches together are suggested: elaborating the parallels between them (such as the concept of schemata), and building AI models based directly on Piaget's theory. How this might benefit AI is illustrated by examining how Piagetian research on problem solving can suggest new ways of building programs that learn.
