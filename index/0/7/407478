Today, organizations have limited resources available to allocate to the detection of complex cyber-attacks. In order to optimize their resource allocation, organizations must conduct a thorough risk analysis process so as to focus their efforts and resources on the protection of the organization's important assets. In this study we propose a framework that automatically and dynamically derives a misuseability score for every IT component (e.g., PC, laptop, server, router, smartphone, and user). The misuseability score encapsulates the potential damage that can be caused to the organization when its assets are compromised and misused.
