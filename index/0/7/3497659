This workshop will show participants how to host a successful programming competition aimed at high school students, and will also be broadly applicable to collegiate level competitions. These contests encourage high school students to major in computer science and can have a positive effect on the recruitment for the host institution. In addition, our anecdotal evidence has shown a high participation rate from under-represented groups at such contests. Running a successful contest, however, is a challenging endeavor. With potentially hundreds of people attending -- both students and coaches -- there are many logistical issues to address. Beyond that, generating an appropriate problem set and ensuring the contest submission system that runs smoothly are critical to a successful event. A poorly run contest can do more harm than good, as the participants will leave with a negative view of the contest, the institution, and possibly even the field. The workshop will cover problem generation and submission system usage, as well as provide discussions and handouts covering all the logistical aspects for hosting such a high school contest. Documentation covering all aspects of the contest will be provided to participants. The workshop organizers include a faculty advisor, a high school coach, and a former student who both participated in -- and later ran -- the contest. At least one organizer has been in every one of the roles in this type of contest. We have successfully run seven such contests, with the last four having 200 high school contestants.
