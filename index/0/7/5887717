The Department of Computer and Information Science at The Ohio State University was conceptualized in 1967 and actualized one year later in October, 1968. Since that time, the Department has had both graduate and undergraduate degree programs. Originally there were two undergraduate degree programs, one in the College of Engineering and the other in the Colleges of Arts and Sciences. In 1971 a third undergraduate degree program was started in the College of Administrative Science 2 . As of July, 1973, these programs have graduated 426 computer and information science majors.
 This paper deals with a survey that was recently conducted of the above mentioned graduates. The purpose of the survey was threefold: (1) To determine what positions our majors are filling in industry; (2) To determine how effective the different undergraduate curriculums are in preparing our B.S. degree graduates for the Job market; and (3) To obtain an evaluation of these programs by the graduates. Since questionnaires are still being returned, the following represents a partial summary of this survey.
