Since we can 'spin' words and concepts to suit our affective needs, context is a major determinant of the perceived affect of a word or concept. We view this re-profiling as a selective emphasis or de-emphasis of the qualities that underpin our shared stereotype of a concept or a word meaning, and construct our model of the affective lexicon accordingly. We show how a large body of affective stereotypes can be acquired from the web, and also show how these are used to create and interpret affective metaphors.
