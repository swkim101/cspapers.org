EasyTracker is an automated system that assists small public or private transit agencies in deploying bus tracking and arrival time prediction. This demo will showcase how data from GPS sensors embedded in smartphones can be automatically processed in order to accurately estimate routes, bus stop locations, schedules, and make annotated maps with real-time bus tracking and arrival time predictions. We will also demonstrate a website portal which transit agencies can use to further interact with their bus transit systems.
