The Internet of the future will be of things: Large scale IoT systems integrating various technologies (tracking, wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, enhanced communication protocols, distributed intelligence for smart objects) will change the way we live and interact with the environment. Unfortunately, a standardization for IoT systems that allows for integration of sensors, data, services and applications in a smooth way and for interoperability of different technologies was still missing.
 In this work we aim at demonstrating the benefits that an Architecture Reference Model for IoT systems brings: Integration of applications, services, and various sensors in a way that is transparent to the technology. Our demo features a health-monitoring application that runs on top of the reference model. Through the functionality of the application we show how the reference model makes it easy to readily build working systems and how it supports interoperability of system components independently on the underneath hardware technology.
