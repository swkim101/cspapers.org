To establish an automatic conversation system between human and computer is regarded as one of the most hardcore problems in computer science. It requires interdisciplinary techniques in information retrieval, natural language processing, and data management, etc. The challenges lie in how to respond like a human, and to maintain a relevant, meaningful, and continuous conversation. The arrival of big data era reveals the feasibility to create such a system empowered by data-driven approaches. We can now organize the conversational data as a chat companion. In this paper, we introduce a chat companion system, which is a practical conversation system between human and computer as a real application. Given the human utterances as queries, our proposed system will respond with corresponding replies retrieved and highly ranked from a massive conversational data repository. Note that 'practical' here indicates effectiveness and efficiency: both issues are important for a real-time system based on a massive data repository. We have two scenarios of single-turn and multi-turn conversations. In our system, we have a base ranking without conversational context information (for single-turn) and a context-aware ranking (for multi-turn). Both rankings can be conducted either by a shallow learning or deep learning paradigm. We combine these two rankings together in optimization. In the experimental setups, we investigate the performance between effectiveness and efficiency for the proposed methods, and we also compare against a series of baselines to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed framework in terms of p@1, MAP, and nDCG. We present a new angle to launch a practical online conversation system between human and computer.
