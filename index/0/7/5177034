We present a new logical approach to reasoning from inconsistent information. The idea is to restore modelhood of inconsistent formulas by providing a third truth-value tolerating inconsistency. The novelty of our approach stems first from the restriction of entailment to three-valued models as similar as possible to two-valued models and second from an implication connective providing a notion of restricted monotonicity. After developing the semantics, we present a corresponding proof system that relies on a circumscription schema furnishing the syntactic counterpart of model minimization.
