We consider the problem of data collection from a large-scale energy harvesting sensors in smart city. We study a novel scheduling optimisation model for WSN with Wireless Power Transfer (WPT), that maximises the amount of collected data under constraints of radio link quality and WPT efficiency, while ensuring a fair data reception. A WPT-WSN testbed is built and preliminary results show that the WPT efficiency is jointly affected by distance between WPT transmitter and receiver, and their antenna orientation.
