Event variable synchronization is a well known mecha nism for enforcing data dependences in a program that runs in parallel on a shared memory multiprocessor This paper presents compiler algorithms to automati cally generate event variable synchronization code Pre viously published algorithms dealt with single parallel loops in which dependence distances are constant and known by the compiler However loops in real appli cation programs are often arbitrarily nested Moreover compilers are often unable to determine dependence dis tances In contrast our algorithms generate synchro nization code based directly on array subscripts and do not require constant distances in data dependences The algorithms are designed for arbitrarily nested loops in cluding triangular or trapezoidal loops
