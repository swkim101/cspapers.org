We propose a probabilistic generative model for unsupervised semantic role induction, which integrates local role assignment decisions and a global role ordering decision in a unified model. The role sequence is divided into intervals based on the notion of primary roles, and each interval generates a sequence of secondary roles and syntactic constituents using local features. The global role ordering consists of the sequence of primary roles only, thus making it a partial ordering.
