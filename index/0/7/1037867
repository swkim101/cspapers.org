Linguistically annotated treebanks play an essential part in the modern computational linguistics. The more complex the treebanks become, the more sophisticated tools are required for using them, namely for searching in the data. We study linguistic phenomena annotated in the Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0 and create a list of requirements these phenomena set on a search tool, especially on its query language.
