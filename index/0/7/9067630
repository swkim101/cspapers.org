Propagated transitions, represented by probability functions, are very useful for digital design verification of race conditions. The existing simulation system DIGSIM already has features implemented to handle these probabilities. This paper gives some application examples to illustrate the technique. The system has been transfered from UNIVAC 1108 to a DEC-10, and that experience is described. Four years' use of the algorithms has shown good agreement between theory and practice.
