We have developed a new style of semantic definition called <italic>high-level semantics</italic>. In constrast to traditional denotational semantics, high-level semantics is suitable for both <italic>defining</italic> the functional <italic>meaning</italic> of programming languages, as well as <italic>describing</italic> realistic compiler <italic>implementations</italic>. Moreover, high-level specifications are considerably more descriptive and intelligible than traditional specifications.
This paper describes the compiler generator MESS, which embodies the principles of high-level semantics. MESS has been used to generate compilers for nontrivial languages. The compilers are efficient, and produce object programs that are competitive with those generated by hand-written compilers.
