Development of the Next Generation Internet requires the development of revolutionary applications as well as advances in networking technologies. This paper presents experiences in using the NREN testbed to prototype a collaborative medical-imaging application. Technological requirements for this application include high-bandwidth reliable multicast and QoS provisioning. Engineering the network infrastructure for a demonstration in May 1999 was a challenging experience. We achieved high-bandwidth multicast for the demonstration; current efforts focus on satisfying application requirements for reliable multicast and QoS.
