This paper describes the motivation, architecture and performance of a distributed virtual machine (DVM) for networked computers. DVMs rely on a distributed service architecture to meet the manageability, security and uniformity requirements of large, heterogeneous clusters of networked computers. In a DVM, system services, such as verification, security enforcement, compilation and optimization, are factored out of clients and located on powerful network servers. This partitioning of system functionality reduces resource requirements on network clients, improves site security through physical isolation and increases the manageability of a large and heterogeneous network without sacrificing performance. Our DVM implements the Java virtual machine, runs on x86 and DEC Alpha processors and supports existing Java-enabled clients.
