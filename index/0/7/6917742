Voice traffic by nature is high in data volume and sensitive to network impairments. Bandwidth requirement for voice calls is, therefore, higher. An increasingly serious dilemma, as the amount of VoIP traffic increases, is that it will not be fair to give priority to the multimedia traffic and starve its best-effort counter part; yet the voice data delivered might not be perceptible if each voice call is limited to the rate of an average TCP flow. We propose to approach this problem from a user-centric view and adapt the sending rate of the voice calls based on the user satisfaction. Such a
