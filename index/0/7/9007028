In order to effectively access the rapidly increasing range of media content available in the home, new kinds of more natural interfaces are needed. In this paper, we explore the application of multimodal interface technologies to searching and browsing a database of movies. The resulting system allows users to access movies using speech, pen, remote control, and dynamic combinations of these modalities. An experimental evaluation, with more than 40 users, is presented contrasting two variants of the system: one combining speech with traditional remote control input and a second where the user has a tablet display supporting speech and pen input.
