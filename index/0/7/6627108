This paper presents reinforcement learning with a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network: RL-LSTM. Model-free RL-LSTM using Advantage (Î») learning and directed exploration can solve non-Markovian tasks with long-term dependencies between relevant events. This is demonstrated in a T-maze task, as well as in a difficult variation of the pole balancing task.
