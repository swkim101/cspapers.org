We present an assembly-design environment that supports the JavaBeans extensible runtime containment and services protocol. The environment provides: a vehicle for demonstrating the Java component model; a third-party client for testing BeanContext and BeanContextChild components; and a prototype illustrating how a visual builder might unify visual and context nesting during component assembly.
