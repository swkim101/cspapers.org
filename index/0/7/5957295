Considerable effort has been made to increase the scale of Linked Data. However, because of the openness of the Semantic Web and the ease of extracting Linked Data from semi-structured sources (e.g., Wikipedia) and unstructured sources, many Linked Data sources often provide conflicting objects for a certain predicate of a real-world entity. Existing methods cannot be trivially extended to resolve conflicts in Linked Data because Linked Data has a scale-free property. In this demonstration, we present a novel system called TruthDiscover, to identify the truth in Linked Data with a scale-free property. First, TruthDiscover leverages the topological properties of the Source Belief Graph to estimate the priori beliefs of sources, which are utilized to smooth the trustworthiness of sources. Second, the Hidden Markov Random Field is utilized to model interdependencies among objects for estimating the trust values of objects accurately. TruthDiscover can visualize the process of resolving conflicts in Linked Data.
