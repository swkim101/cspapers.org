<italic>We introduce a fundamental propositional logical system for describing correctness, termination and equivalence of programs. We define a formal syntax and semantics for the <underline>propositional modal logic of programs</underline> and give several consequences of the definition. Principal conclusions are that deciding satisfiability requires time</italic> d<supscrpt>n/log n</supscrpt><italic>for some</italic> d > 1 <italic>and that satisfiability, even in an extended system, can be decided in nondeterministic time</italic> c<supscrpt>n</supscrpt><italic>for some</italic> c. <italic>We provide applications of the decision procedure to regular expressions, Ianov schemes, and classical systems of modal logic.</italic>
