This paper discusses a repertoire of well-known and new compiler optimizations that help produce excellent server application performance and investigates their performance contributions. These optimizations combined produce a 40% speed-up in on-line transaction processing (OLTP) performance and have been implemented in the Intel C/C++ Itanium compiler. In particular, the paper presents compiler optimizations that take advantage of the Itanium register stack, proposes an enhanced Linux preemption model and demonstrates their performance potential for server applications.
