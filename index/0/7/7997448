Abstract : The UMBCTAC agent was one of the top ranked agents in the third international Trading Agent Competition (TAC'02). This paper describes and evaluates the key heuristics used by UMBCTAC. including the early bird heuristic, the balance heuristic, and the separation heuristic. We developed a simple gain- risk model to search safe and profitable allocations for hotel rooms and airline tickets. We also used a novel probabilistic approach to dynamically allocate entertainment tickets and bid in entertainment auctions. We conclude with a description of ongoing and planned work.
