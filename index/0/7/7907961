Objective ML is a small practical extension of ML with objects and toplevel classes. It is fully compatible with ML; its type system is based on ML polymorphism, record types with polymorphic access, and a better treatment of type abbreviations. Objective ML allows for most features of object-oriented languages including multiple inheritance, methods returning self and binary methods as well as parametric classes. This demonstrates that objects can be added to strongly typed languages based on ML polymorphism.
