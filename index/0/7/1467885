Recent technology advancements allow for the integration of large memory structures on-die or as a die-stacked DRAM. Such structures provide higher bandwidth and faster access time than off-chip memory. Prior work has investigated using the large integrated memory as a cache, or using it as part of a heterogeneous memory system under management of the OS. Using this memory as a cache would waste a large fraction of total memory space, especially for the systems where stacked memory could be as large as off-chip memory. An OS managed heterogeneous memory system, on the other hand, requires costly usage-monitoring hardware to migrate frequently-used pages, and is often unable to capture pages that are highly utilized for short periods of time. This paper proposes a practical, low-cost architectural solution to efficiently enable using large fast memory as Part-of-Memory (PoM) seamlessly, without the involvement of the OS. Our PoM architecture effectively manages two different types of memory (slow and fast) combined to create a single physical address space. To achieve this, PoM implements the ability to dynamically remap regions of memory based on their access patterns and expected performance benefits. Our proposed PoM architecture improves performance by 18.4% over static mapping and by 10.5% over an ideal OS-based dynamic remapping policy.
