The goal of this work is to support replicated network services that accept updates to numerical records from multiple wide-area locations. Given the high overhead of maintaining strong consistency, many replicated services can tolerate divergence of their shared data, as long as the numerical error is bounded. Target distributed services include replicated stock quotes services, online auctions, distributed sensor systems, wide-area resource accounting and load balancing for replicated servers. We present two algorithms to e ciently bound absolute error using only local information. Split-Weight AE separately bounds increases and decreases, while Compound-Weight AE bounds them together. The two algorithms can be combined to provide good performance and low space overhead. Our Inductive RE algorithm transforms relative error to absolute error solely based on local knowledge, taking advantage of the fact that the divergence was properly bounded prior to each invocation of the algorithm. We also discuss two optimizations that reduce the space and computational overheads in the algorithms. This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation (EIA-99772879).
