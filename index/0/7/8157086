The jGRASP lightweight IDE has been extended to provide object viewers that automatically generate dynamic, state-based visualizations of data structures in Java. These viewers provide multiple synchronized visualizations of data structures as the user steps through the source code in either debug or workbench mode. This tight integration in a lightweight IDE provides a unique and promising environment for learning data structures. Initial classroom use has demonstrated the object viewers' potential as an aid to students who are learning to write and modify classes representing data structures. Recently completed controlled experiments with CS2 students indicate that these viewers can have a significant positive impact on student performance.
