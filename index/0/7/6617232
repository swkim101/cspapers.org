XML is a widely used standard for information storage and exchange in today's IT systems. Therefore, it is essential to protect XML documents from unauthorized access. For this purpose, we present a model for access control for XML documents with three key features. First, we record the effects of the operations on the documents in a history, depending on which we can grant or deny access. Second, we use the history information to define permissions for the operations of our model including the transfer of document parts. Third, since the text content of an element can be composed of parts of text from different sources, we consider units smaller than the XML element as a protection unit. Therefore, we keep track of these parts and allow to define access to them individually.
