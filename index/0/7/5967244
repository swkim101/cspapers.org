Ising mean field is a basic variational inference method for Ising model, which can provide an effective approximate solution for large-scale inference problem. The main idea is to transform a probabilistic inference problem into a functional extremum problem by variational calculus, and solve the functional extremum problem to obtain approximate marginal distributions. The process of solving the functional extremum is an important step and a computational core for variational inference. But the traditional full variational iteration methods make the variable information intercross with each other deeply. From the view of incomplete variational iterations, we propose a message family propagation method for Ising mean field to compute a marginal distribution family of object variable. First we define the concepts of iteration tree and pruning iteration tree to describe the iteration computation process of Ising mean field inference. Then we design the message family propagation method based on the iteration trees. The method propagates mean field message families and belief message families from bottom to top of the iteration tree, and presents a marginal distribution family of variable in root node. Finally we prove the marginal distribution bound theorem, which shows that the marginal distribution family computed by the method in the pruning iteration tree contains the exact marginal stribution. Theoretical and experimental results illustrate that the message family propagation method is valid and the marginal distribution bounds are tight.
