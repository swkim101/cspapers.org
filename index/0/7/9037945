Recently, the problem of opinion spam has been widespread and has attracted a lot of research attention. While the problem has been approached on a variety of dimensions, the temporal dynamics in which opinion spamming operates is unclear. Are there specific spamming policies that spammers employ? What kind of changes happen with respect to the dynamics to the truthful ratings on entities. How do buffered spamming operate for entities that need spamming to retain threshold popularity and reduced spamming for entities making better success? We analyze these questions in the light of time-series analysis on Yelp. Our analyses discover various temporal patterns and their relationships with the rate at which fake reviews are posted. Building on our analyses, we employ vector autoregression to predict the rate of deception across different spamming policies. Next, we explore the effect of filtered reviews on (long-term and imminent) future rating and popularity prediction of entities. Our results discover novel temporal dynamics of spamming which are intuitive, arguable and also render confidence on Yelp's filtering. Lastly, we leverage our discovered temporal patterns in deception detection. Experimental results on large-scale reviews show the effectiveness of our approach that significantly improves the existing approaches.
