The objective of this study was a comparison of the effectiveness in adapting to an environment of populations of structures undergoing modification by four different models: 1) Holland's (2) genetic operator model; 2) a cognitive (statistical predictive) model; 3) a random point mutation model; and 4) a control (non-altered) model.
