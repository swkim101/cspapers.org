In order to efficiently handle the rapid growth of data and reduce the overhead of network transmission, we propose an in-network deduplication for storage-aware Software Defined Network (SDN), called SMIND. Unlike conventional source or destination deduplication schemes, SMIND implements in-network deduplication via SDN. Moreover, to address the performance bottleneck of accessing and indexing SDN controller, we implement an SDN-enabled Flash Translation Layer (FTL) in a real prototype of Solid State Disk (SSD). Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of SMIND.
