A data mining system, DBMiner, has been developed for interactive mining of multiple-level knowledge in large relational databases. The system implements a wide spectrum of data mining functions, including generalization, characterization, association, classification, and prediction. By incorporating several interesting data mining techniques, including attribute-oriented induction, statistical analysis, progressive deepening for mining multiple-level knowledge, and meta-rule guided mining, the system provides a user-friendly, interactive data mining environment with good performance.
