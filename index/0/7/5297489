Coal is an important fossil fuel and will also be for the next decades [1]. The only way to achieve the challenges faced by the coal industry is to reduce production costs by improving productivity. Improvement of productivity has become an important goal for todayâ€™s coal industry in the race to increase price competitiveness. In recent years, underground mining method is becoming popular because of its efficiency and higher productivity. The primary driver behind the research and development effort of longwall coal mining operations is to increase the safety, productivity and efficiency to enhance the mining business [2]. The coal mines work with an aim of obtaining maximum productivity at minimum cost which can be obtained by the incorporation of the longwall mining technique.
