Safe handling of dynamic highway and inner city scenarios with autonomous vehicles involves the problem of generating traffic-adapted trajectories. In order to account for the practical requirements of the holistic autonomous system, we propose a semi-reactive trajectory generation method, which can be tightly integrated into the behavioral layer. The method realizes long-term objectives such as velocity keeping, merging, following, stopping, in combination with a reactive collision avoidance by means of optimal-control strategies within the Fren√©t-Frame [12] of the street. The capabilities of this approach are demonstrated in the simulation of a typical high-speed highway scenario.
