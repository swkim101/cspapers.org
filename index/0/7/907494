Understanding the impact of corporate information publicly distributed on the Web is becoming more and more crucial. In this paper we report the result of a study that involved 130 IBM employees: we explored the correctness and extent of organisational information that can be observed from the online profiles of a company's employees. Our work contributes new insights to the study of social networks by showing that, even by considering a small fraction of the available online data, it is possible to discover accurate information about an organisation, its structure, and the factors that characterise the social reach of their employees.
