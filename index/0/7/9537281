In this paper, we introduce the usage of enhanced Web Components to create web applications with multi-device capabilities by composition. By using the latest developments of the family of W3C standards called "Web Components" that we extent with dedicated communication and synchronization functionality, web developers are enabled to create web applications with ease. We enhance Web Components with an event-based communication channel, which is not limited to a single browser window. With our approach, applications using the extended SmartComponents and an additional synchronization service also support multi-device scenarios. In contrast to other widget-based approaches (W3C Widgets, OpenSocial containers), the usage of SmartComponents does not require a dedicated platform, like Apache Rave. SmartComponents are based on standard web technologies, are natively supported by recent web browsers and loosely coupled using our extension. This ensures a high level of reuse. We show how SmartComponents are structured, can be created and used. Furthermore, we explain how the communication aspect is integrated and multi-device communication is achieved. Finally, we describe our demonstration by outlining two example applications.
