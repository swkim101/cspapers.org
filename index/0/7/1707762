The paper presents an analytic performance model of a multiprogrammed batch and timeshared context swapped system. The model predicts resource utilizations, batch throughput and timesharing response times as functions of the system hardware characteristics, including core size; load characteristics, differing between batch and interactive users; and the numbers of batch and interactive users. Thus, it allows one to study the effects of different hardware configurations and/or load patterns on system performance.
