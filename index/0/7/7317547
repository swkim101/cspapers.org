Wide area networks provide a variety of information sources which can be exploited only by appropriate information retrieval techniques such as repeated automatic query of remote databases and bulletin boards. Distinctive features of the content and access methods of information on wide area nets are discussed from an IR perspective. The development, algorithms, and analysis of a functioning system are also presented.
