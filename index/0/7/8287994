We present the first hot-potato routing algorithm for the n x n mesh whose running time on any "hard" (i.e., f~(n)) "many-to-one" batch routing problem is, with high probability, within a polylogarithmic factor of optimal. For any instance I of a batch routing problem, there exists a wellknown lower bound LBI based on maximum path length and maximum congestion. If LBt is f~(n), our algorithm solves I with high probability in time O(LBI. log ~ n). The algorithm is distributed and greedy, and it makes use of a new routing technique based on multi-bend paths, a departure from paths using a constant number of bends used in prior hot-potato algorithms.
