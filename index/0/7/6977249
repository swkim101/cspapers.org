Mobile Web is characterized by two salient features, ubiquitous access to content and limited resources, like bandwidth and battery. Since most web pages are designed for the wired Internet, it is challenging to adapt the pages seamlessly to ensure a satisfactory mobile web experience. Content heavy web pages lead to longer load time on mobile browsers. Pre-defined load order of items in a page does not adapt to mobile browsing habits, where user looks for different snippets of a page to load under different contexts. Web content adaptation for mobile web has mainly focused on the user to define her preferences for content. We propose a framework where content creator is additionally included in guiding the adaptation. Allowing content creator to specify importance of items in a page also helps in factoring her incentives by pushing revenue generating content. We present mechanisms to enable cooperative content adaptation. Preliminary results show the efficacy of cooperative content adaptation in resource constrained mobile browsing scenario.
