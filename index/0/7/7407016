In XML databases, new schema versions may be released as frequently as once every two weeks. This poster describes a taxonomy of changes for XML schema evolution. It examines the impact of those changes on schema validation and query evaluation. Based on that study, it proposes guidelines for XML schema evolution and for writing queries in such a way that they continue to operate as expected across evolving schemas.
