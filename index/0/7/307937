Given a set of points and a set of prototypes representing them, how to create a graph of the prototypes whose topology accounts for that of the points? This problem had not yet been explored in the framework of statistical learning theory. In this work, we propose a generative model based on the Delaunay graph of the prototypes and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to learn the parameters. This work is a first step towards the construction of a topological model of a set of points grounded on statistics.
