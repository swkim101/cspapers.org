A mask analysis program for MOS/LSI mask layout data has been developed. This program converts all the mask layout data in one chip LSI into the corresponding circuit schema. A partitioning method for the large random logic circuit divides it into small subcircuits. It is shown that this method takes full advantage of the savings both in computer time and computer storage for the circuit simulation and timing verification of the random logic circuit having more than 500 active devices.
