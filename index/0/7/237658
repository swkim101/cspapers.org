Stereo matching is a well researched area using visibleband color cameras. Thermal images are typically lower resolution, have less texture, and are noisier compared to their visible-band counterparts and are more challenging for stereo matching algorithms. Previous benchmarks for stereo matching either focus entirely on visible-band cameras or contain only a single thermal camera. We present the Color And Thermal Stereo (CATS) benchmark, a dataset consisting of stereo thermal, stereo color, and cross-modality image pairs with high accuracy ground truth (
