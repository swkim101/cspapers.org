In early 1977, Southern Bell began to study ways to reduce terminal and leased line costs associated with internal computer communications. Because a large volume of these communications were of an asynchronous, character-mode nature, packet switching emerged as the most attractive solution to reducing these costs. In May, 1979, the first application went on-line with one switch, one host concentrator and three terminal concentrators. Operation of this network was simple, with operations and planning residing in the same work group.
Today, the network consists of twenty tandem switches, 185 local switches and 85 packet assembler/disassemblers, interconnected by 15,928 miles of trunk facilities. The network architecture has evolved to geographically distributed “principle switching points” interconnected through a single major switching center in Atlanta, Georgia. Each “principle switching point” serves an area of company interest by supporting a number of local switches and concentrators.
As the complexity of the network has increased, so has the complexity of network operation. Operations have been both functionally and geographically differentiated to keep up with the evolution of the network, and to stay consistent with changing packet switch architecture. This talk will cover the network operations and maintenance considerations associated with the operation of today's very large network.
