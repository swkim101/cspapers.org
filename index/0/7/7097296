Trajectory tracking control for quadrotors is important for applications ranging from surveying and inspection, to film making. However, designing and tuning classical controllers, such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers, to achieve high tracking precision can be time-consuming and difficult, due to hidden dynamics and other non-idealities. The Deep Neural Network (DNN), with its superior capability of approximating abstract, nonlinear functions, proposes a novel approach for enhancing trajectory tracking control. This paper presents a DNN-based algorithm as an add-on module that improves the tracking performance of a classical feedback controller. Given a desired trajectory, the DNNs provide a tailored reference input to the controller based on their gained experience. The input aims to achieve a unity map between the desired and the output trajectory. The motivation for this work is an interactive “fly-as-you-draw” application, in which a user draws a trajectory on a mobile device, and a quadrotor instantly flies that trajectory with the DNN-enhanced control system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the tracking precision for user-drawn trajectories after the DNNs are trained on selected periodic trajectories, suggesting the method's potential in real-world applications. Tracking errors are reduced by around 40–50% for both training and testing trajectories from users, highlighting the DNNs' capability of generalizing knowledge.
