An experiment intended to determine the influence of the input data on the performance improvements resulting from program restructuring is described. This influence is found to be non-significant for the particular program, memory policy, restructuring procedure and inputs considered in the experiment. It is speculated that such a conclusion is likely to have much more general validity.
