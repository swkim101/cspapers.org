The use of external databases to generate training data, also known as Distant Supervision, has become an effective way to train supervised relation extractors but this approach inherently suffers from noise. In this paper we propose a method for noise reduction in distantly supervised training data, using a discriminative classifier and semantic similarity between the contexts of the training examples. We describe an active learning strategy which exploits hierarchical clustering of the candidate training samples. To further improve the effectiveness of this approach, we study the use of several methods for dimensionality reduction of the training samples. We find that semantic clustering of training data combined with cluster-based active learning allows filtering the training data, hence facilitating the creation of a clean training set for relation extraction, at a reduced manual labeling cost.
