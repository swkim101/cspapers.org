The Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory (HCIL) and the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) have been working together to develop the ProgramFinder, a tool for choosing programs for a troubled youth from drug rehabilitation centers to secure residential facilities. The seemingly straightforward journey of the ProgramFinder from an existing user interface technique to a product design required the development of five different prototypes which involved user interface design, prototype implementation, and selecting search criterion. While HCIL’s effort focused primarily on design and implementation, DJJ’s attribute selection process was the most time consuming and difficult task. We also found that a direct link to DJJ’s workflow was needed in the prototypes to generate the necessary “buy-in”. This paper analyzes the interaction between the efforts of HCIL and DJJ and the amount of “buyin” by DJJ staff and management. Lesson learned are presented for developers.
