Matroid intersection problems are considered in which one of the matroids is a partition matroid specifying that exactly q elements in the solution must be red, and the rest green. A characterization is presented for how the solution changes when one element changes in cost. Data structures are given for maintaining the solutions to several such problems online under the operation of changing an edge cost. Efficient update algorithms are given for maintaining a red-green minimum spanning tree in both a general and a planar graph, and a red-green job schedule for unit-time jobs with integer release times and deadlines.
