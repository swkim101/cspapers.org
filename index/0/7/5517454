The QCS information retrieval (IR) system is presented as a tool for querying, clustering, and summarizing document sets. QCS has been developed as a modular development framework, and thus facilitates the inclusion of new technologies targeting these three IR tasks. Details of the system architecture, the QCS interface, and preliminary results are presented.
