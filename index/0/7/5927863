In this paper, we describe a new algorithm for recovering WH-trace empty nodes. Our approach combines a set of hand-written patterns together with a probabilistic model. Because the patterns heavily utilize regular expressions, the pertinent tree structures are covered using a limited number of patterns. The probabilistic model is essentially a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) approach with the patterns acting as the terminals in production rules. We evaluate the algorithmâ€™s performance on gold trees and parser output using three different metrics. Our method compares favorably with state-of-the-art algorithms that recover WH-traces.
