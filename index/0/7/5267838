Using corpus data of spoken dialogue, we examine the convergence of syntactic complexity levels between interlocutors in natural conversations, as it occurs within spans of topic episodes. The findings of general convergence in the Switchboard and BNC corpora are compatible with an information-theoretic model of dialogue and with Interactive Alignment Theory.
