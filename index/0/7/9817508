This paper describes a framework that allows for reasoning about and verification of concurrent statecharts with real-time constraints subject to semantic variations. The major problems addressed by this paper include the capture of multiple semantic variations of real-time statecharts, and the use of the resulting semantics for further analysis. Our solution is based on a theoretical framework involving a two-dimensional temporal logic that is used to independently capture flow of control through statecharts as well as flow of time. The independence of these dimensions, along with the high-level nature of temporal logic allows for simple adaptation to alternate semantics of statecharts as well as real-time models. The paper defines our logic, shows how the semantics of real-time statecharts can be expressed in this formalism, and describes our tools for capturing and reasoning about these semantics. The underlying goal is the formal analysis of real-time software behavior in a way that captures designer intentions.
