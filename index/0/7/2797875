The current approaches to Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) usually perform role classification for each predicate separately and the interaction among individual predicateâ€™s role labeling is ignored if there is more than one predicate in a sentence. In this paper, we prove that different predicates in a sentence could help each other during SRL. In multi-predicate role labeling, there are mainly two key points: argument identification and role labeling of the arguments shared by multiple predicates. To address these issues, in the stage of argument identification, we propose novel predicate-related features which help remove many argument identification errors; in the stage of argument classification, we adopt a discriminative reranking approach to perform role classification of the shared arguments, in which a large set of global features are proposed. We conducted experiments on two standard benchmarks: Chinese PropBank and English PropBank. The experimental results show that our approach can significantly improve SRL performance, especially in Chinese PropBank.
