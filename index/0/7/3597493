We are now in a time where the 4th industrial revolution has emerged and the way factories work will never be the same. From the development of computation and industrial robots, which was the heart of the 3rd industrial revolution, the 4th industrial revolution has evolved to combine superior processing power with massive real-time data analysis, producing smart machines capable of collaborating with each other and, thus, taking plant automation a step further [1, 2]. The 1st and 2nd industrial revolutions moved production from manual to machine methods, causing an evolution that changed the predominantly agrarian, rural society to an urban, industrial one. The 4th industrial revolution can be viewed as the fusion of a range of new technologies across the digital, physical and biological worlds that will potentially impact our economies and industries to the same extent.
