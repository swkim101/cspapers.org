Diagram manipulation in conventional CAD systems requires frequent mode switching and explicit placement of the pivot for rotation and scaling. In order to simplify this process, we propose an interaction technique called integrated manipulation, where the user can move, rotate, and scale without mode switching. In addition, the pivot for rotation and scaling automatically snaps to a contact point during moving operation. We performed a user study is performed using our prototype system and a commercial CAD system. The results showed that users could perform a diagram manipulation task much more rapidly using our technique.
