This paper presents controllers called motion policies that achieve fast, graceful motions in small, collision-free domains of the position space for balancing mobile robots like the ballbot. The motion policies are designed such that their valid compositions will produce overall graceful motions. An automatic instantiation procedure deploys motion policies on a 2D map of the environment to form a library and the validity of their composition is given by a gracefully prepares graph. Dijsktra's algorithm is used to plan in the space of these motion policies to achieve the desired navigation task. A hybrid controller is used to switch between the motion policies. The results of successful experimental testing of two navigation tasks, namely, point-point and surveillance motions on the ballbot platform are presented.
