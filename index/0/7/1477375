The automated text categorization (TC) has made prominent progress in recent years. However, seldom work is done on automatic classification with library classification systems, the largest and most sophisticated classification systems people ever built, such as the Dewey Decimal classification (DDC). The library classification is a very laborious and time-consuming job that requires qualification and good training.
 The large-scale classification schemes, such as the DDC, impose several obstacles to the state-of-art TC technologies, including very deep hierarchy, data sparseness, and skewed category distribution. These problems characterize large corpora of real-world applications and it is very hard, if not impossible, to obtain satisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to reconstruct classification schemes according to the document density and category distribution, and to transform the category hierarchy into a balanced virtual taxonomy by merging sparse categories, lopping dense branches and flattening the hierarchy. To make the classification performance acceptable to real-world applications, we also propose an interactive classification model that only needs two or three times of user interaction. Extensive experiments are conducted on a 10-year bibliographic data collection of the Library of Congress to verify the proposed methodology.
