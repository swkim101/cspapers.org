Service learning can play an important role in computer science education: it can address declining enrollments and increase current student satisfaction. Although computer science poses some serious problems for effectively implementing service learning, these can be surmounted by reconfiguring a course to include a substantial treatment of accessibility. I describe such a course, explain how it overcomes the problems, and discuss the results of the course from a student perspective.
