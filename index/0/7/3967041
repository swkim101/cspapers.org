Existing localization approaches are divided into two groups: range-based and range-free. The range-free schemes often suffer from poor accuracy and low scalability, while the range-based localization approaches heavily depend on extra hardware capabilities or rely on the absolute RSSI (received signal strength indicator) values, far from practical. In this work, we propose a mobile-assisted localization scheme called perpendicular intersection (PI), setting a dedicate tradeoff between range-free and range-based approaches. Instead of directly mapping RSSI values into physical distances, by contrasting RSSI values from the mobile beacon to a sensor node, PI utilizes the geometric relationship of perpendicular intersection to compute node positions. We have implemented the prototype of PI with 100 TelosBmotes. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that PI achieves high accuracy and low overhead, significantly outperforming the existing range-based and the mobile-assisted localization schemes.
