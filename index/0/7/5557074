In order to sense and analyze disaster information from social media, microblogs as sources of social data have recently attracted attention. In this paper, we attempt to discover geolocation information from microblog messages to assess disasters. Since microblog services are more timely compared to other social media, understanding the geolocation information of each microblog message is useful for quickly responding to a sudden disasters. Some microblog services provide a function for adding geolocation information to messages from mobile device equipped with GPS detectors. However, few users use this function, so most messages do not have geolocation information. Therefore, we attempt to discover the location where a message was generated by using its textual content. The proposed method learns associations between a location and its relevant keywords from past messages, and guesses where a new message came from.
