aiming at the low 1eve1 of automation of case retrieva1 in case— based design the retrieva1 model design used in case— based fixture design was studied in detail. On the analysis of the functional surfaces of work piece, the design requirement is extracted whereby the functional mode of work piece is presented, and the prototype of fixture assembling based on the theory of General—location is constructed. Aim at increasing the accurate rate of retrieval in case-based reasoning, the fixture assembling information of three layers structure is realized. The theory and methodology is lastly exemplified¿ where a new approach of fixture design automation is explored.
