Quotes, or quotations, are well known phrases or sentences that we use for various purposes such as emphasis, elaboration, and humor. In this paper, we introduce a task of recommending quotes which are suitable for given dialogue context and we present a deep learning recommender system which combines recurrent neural network and convolutional neural network in order to learn semantic representation of each utterance and construct a sequence model for the dialog thread. We collected a large set of twitter dialogues with quote occurrences in order to evaluate proposed recommender system. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms not only the other state-of-the-art algorithms in quote recommendation task, but also other neural network based methods built for similar tasks.
