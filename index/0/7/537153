A modular and reconfigurable robot (MRR) with multiple working modes is developed for performing sophisticated tasks in uncontrolled environments. In the proposed MRR design, each joint module can independently work in active modes with position or torque control, or passive modes with friction compensation. Under a federated control system architecture, not only the MRR configuration can be reconfigured to adapt to various tasks, but also the working mode of each module, which can be switched on-line to satisfy the needs to carry out sophisticated tasks. Three joint modules have been developed, and the proposed method of passive working mode implementation with friction compensation has been tested experimentally. Door opening using a mobile manipulator consisting of the developed joint modules is studied as an application case study of the proposed multiple working mode MRR.
