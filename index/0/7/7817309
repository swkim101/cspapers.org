This paper presents a model of the NAP protocol, dedicated to the auto-conﬁguration of IPv6 routers. If hosts auto- conﬁguration is deﬁned by IPv6, IPv6 routers still have to be manually conﬁgured. In order to succeed in new networking domains, a full auto-conﬁguration feature must be oﬀered. NAP oﬀers a fully distributed solution that uses a link state OSPFv3-like approach to perform preﬁx collision detection and avoidance. In this paper, we present a model for NAP and analyze the average and maximum autoconﬁguration delay as a function of the network size and the preﬁx space size.
