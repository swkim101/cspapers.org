Adaptive Programming allows developers to write structure-shy programs. However, in Adaptive Programming, recursive computations are known to require a good deal of boiler plate code to express. This paper describes perobject visitors; a programming construct that allows developers to write recursive adaptive computations at a higher level of abstraction. This paper also describes a prototype implementation for perobject visitors.
