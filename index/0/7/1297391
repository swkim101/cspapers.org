. In this paper we present a new approach for personalized presentation of web-page content. The model is deﬁned as a preference-based conﬁguration process that is based on qualitative decision theory. This conﬁguration process attempts to determine the optimal presentation of a web page while taking into account the preferences of the web author as well as viewer interaction with the browser. The preferences of the web-page author are represented by a CP-network, a graphical model developed in [2]. We present an implementation of our approach in a CPML system and discuss the implementation issues.
