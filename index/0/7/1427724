In this research, a Universal map, which can be converted to individual maps for heterogeneous mobile robots, is proposed. A Universal map can be generated using our developed measurement robot, and it is composed of a textured 3D environment model. Therefore, every robot can use a Universal map as a common map, and it is utilized for various localization technologies such as view-based and LRF-based methods. In LRF-based localization, accurate localization is achieved using a specific map, which is generated from Universal map. In a view-based approach, localization and navigation are achieved using rendered images. The use of a Universal map enables generation of these maps automatically. The effectiveness of this approach is confirmed through experiments.
