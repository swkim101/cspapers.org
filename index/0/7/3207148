Developing regression models for large datasets that are both accurate and easy to interpret is a very important data mining problem. Regression trees with linear models in the leaves satisfy both these requirements, but thus far, no truly scalable regression tree algorithm is known. This paper proposes a novel regression tree construction algorithm (SECRET) that produces trees of high quality and scales to very large datasets. At every node, SECRET uses the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures to find two clusters in the data and to locally transform the regression problem into a classification problem based on closeness to these clusters. Goodness of split measures, like the gini gain, can then be used to determine the split variable and the split point much like in classification tree construction. Scalability of the algorithm can be achieved by employing scalable versions of the EM and classification tree construction algorithms. An experimental evaluation on real and artificial data shows that SECRET has accuracy comparable to other linear regression tree algorithms but takes orders of magnitude less computation time for large datasets.
