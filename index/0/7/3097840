The economics of flash vs. disk storage is driving HPC centers to incorporate faster solid-state burst buffers into the storage hierarchy in exchange for smaller parallel file system (PFS) bandwidth. In systems with an underprovisioned PFS, avoiding I/O contention at the PFS level will become crucial to achieving high computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose novel batch job scheduling techniques that reduce such contention by integrating I/O awareness into scheduling policies such as EASY backfilling. We model the available bandwidth of links between each level of the storage hierarchy (i.e., burst buffers, I/O network, and PFS), and our I/O-aware schedulers use this model to avoid contention at any level in the hierarchy. We integrate our approach into Flux, a next-generation resource and job management framework, and evaluate the effectiveness and computational costs of our I/O-aware scheduling. Our results show that by reducing I/O contention for underprovisioned PFSes, our solution reduces job performance variability by up to 33% and decreases I/O-related utilization losses by up to 21%, which ultimately increases the amount of science performed by scientific workloads.
