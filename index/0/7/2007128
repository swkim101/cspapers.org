We present a new approach to harvesting a large-scale, high quality image-caption corpus that makes a better use of already existing web data with no additional human efforts. The key idea is to focus on Deja Image-Captions: naturally existing image descriptions that are repeated almost verbatim â€“ by more than one individual for different images. The resulting corpus provides association structure between 4 million images with 180K unique captions, capturing a rich spectrum of everyday narratives including figurative and pragmatic language. Exploring the use of the new corpus, we also present new conceptual tasks of visually situated paraphrasing, creative image captioning, and creative visual paraphrasing.
