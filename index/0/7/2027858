Unification of disjunctive feature descriptions is important for efficient unification-based parsing. This paper presents constraint projection, a new method for unification of disjunctive feature structures represented by logical constraints. Constraint projection is a generalization of constraint unification, and is more efficient because constraint projection has a mechanism for abandoning information irrelevant to a goal specified by a list of variables.
