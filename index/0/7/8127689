We propose a simple and powerful predictive interface technique for text editing tasks. With our technique called the dynamic macro creation, when a user types a special “repeat” key after doing repetitive operations in atext editor, an editing sequence corresponding to one iteration is detected, defined as a macro, and executed at the same time. Although being simple, a wide range of repetitive tasks can be performed just by typing the repeat key. When we use another special “pre-dict” key for conventional prediction techniques in addition to the repeat key, wider range of prediction schemes can be performed depending on the order of using these two keys.
