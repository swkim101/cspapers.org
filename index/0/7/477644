Tymnet's public data network has been expanding in size and revenues at about a 35% per year rate since its inception. Maintaining this growth has put strain more on the organization than the technology. I will discuss several dimensions of the problem of managing prolonged rapid growth, including capacity management (bandwidth, switching, interfaces, and floor-space), topological complexity, job specialization, order processing, forecasting, and deploying new versions of code. The topic selection will favor issues that are likely to be common to other operations and the discussion will be biased toward solutions and pro-active management.
