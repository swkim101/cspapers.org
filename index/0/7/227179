Wit,11 rapid increase in the number of applications thal, require access to large amounts of da,ta., it is becoming increasingly important for tla.ta.l~aac syst,ems t,o ha.ndle tert,ia.ry storage dcviccs. The cha.ra.ctcristics of tertia.ry memory devices a.re very differ& from secondary storag;c devices that, conventional database sysletr~ a.re designed for. This requires new approa.ches to ma.naging data, loca.tion and movcmcnt, together with query execution in a unilied framework. In this paper WC present methods of scheduling queries, caching and controlling the order of da.ta, rct,rieva.l for eff~c&1. operation in a tertia.ry rncniory cnvironnienl. Wc show how careful interspersing of queries and informed cache management can achieve rema.rkable reductions in access time compared 1x1 conventional methods. Our algoril(hms use a few model pa.rameters for each tertiary memory device and are thus designed to be portable across a wide variety of tert,ia.ry memory devices and da,tnhase t,ypes. We arc extending the PoS’TGR.ES database system to implements t,he new query processing strategics. Jnit,ial mea.surements on the prototype yield impressive results. *This research was sponsored by NSF Grant, IRI-9107455, AR0 Grant, DAAI,O3-91-Q-0183, and DARPA Contract. DADT63-92-C-0007.
