This paper presents the design of a data base organization for an electronic equipment design automation system. First, the requirement for the data base file will be summarized. Then, the logical structure the authors see to be the solution to this particular problem will be developed and demonstrated. Topics on the physical implementation of the file are presented next. Performance analyses are illustrated, and the limitations of the present state of the art in data base technique will be summarized in the conclusion.
