Incorrect muscle usage and muscle fatigue are a leading cause of many sports injures. As a result, sensing and monitoring muscles, as well as human motion, is important. Toward this end, we present the Muscle Activity Recognition System (MARS) system. MARS utilizes a system of small inertial sensors to deduce body motion and muscle fatigue. In this demo we demonstrate how MARS' sensors, placed on the major muscles of the lower body (hamstrings, quadriceps, calves), are used for motion capture and muscle fatigue determination. The system uses an animated human body model to display the motion of the subject, and highlight using different colors, the fatigue status of the muscles in use.
