The Palette is a digital appliance designed for intuitivecontrol of electronic slide shows. Current interfaces demand toomuch of our attention to permit effective computer use insituations where we can not give the technology our fullestconcentration. The Palette uses index cards that are printed withslide content that is easily identified by both humans andcomputers. The presenter controls the presentation by directlymanipulating the cards. The Palette design is based on ourobservation of presentations given in a real work setting. Ourexperiences using the system are described, including new practices(e.g., collaborative presentation, enhanced notetaking) that arisefrom the affordances of this new approach. This system is anexample of a new interaction paradigm called tacitinteraction that supports users who can spare very littleattention to a computer interface.
