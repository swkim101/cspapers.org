Are "tornado" touchdowns related to "earthquakes"? How about to "floods", or to "hurricanes"? In Informedia [14], using a gazetteer on news video clips, we map news onto points on the globe and find correlations between sets of points. In this paper we show how to find answers to such questions, and how to look for patterns on the geo-spatial relationships of news events. The proposed tool is "GeoPlot", which is fast to compute and gives a lot of useful information which traditional text retrieval can not find.We describe our experiments on 2-year worth of video data (~ 20 Gbytes). There we found that GeoPlot can find unexpected correlations that text retrieval would never find, such as those between "earthquake" and "volcano", and "tourism" and "wine".In addition, GeoPlot provides a good visualization of a data set's characteristics. Characteristics at all scales are shown in one plot and a wealth of information is given, for example, geo-spatial clusters, characteristic scales, and intrinsic (fractal) dimensions of the events' locations.
