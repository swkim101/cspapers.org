Research has shown that the cheat sheet preparation process helps students with performance in exams. However, results have been inconclusive in determining the most effective guiding principles in creating and using cheat sheets. The traditional method of collecting and annotating cheat sheets is time consuming and exhaustive, and fails to capture students' preparation process. This work examines the development and impacts of a new web-based study preparation tool, Study Genie, supporting collaborative note creation, editing, sharing, and cheat sheet organization. This new educational technology enables big-data learning analytics, permitting quantitative data modeling on connecting formal and informal digital learning footprints. Study Genie also systematically automates cheat-sheet quality evaluation, which traditionally could only have been done qualitatively. A classroom study was conducted to measure the technology and learning effects in an introductory computer science programming course. Results suggest that actions associated with editing and organizing cheat sheets are positively correlated with exam performance, and that there is a significant difference between the activity of high-performing and low-performing students. Through these results, Study Genie presents itself as an opportunity for mass data collection, providing insight into the assembly process rather than just the finished product in cheat sheet creation.
