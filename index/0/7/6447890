As servers increase the number of processors and as processors increase the number of cores CPU cycles may be seen as abundant. However, MPI applications such as hurricane predictions are increasing processing demand in step with supply. Efficient use of CPU cycles result in faster application completion time. InfiniBand fabrics, one of the most CPU-efficient interconnects available, support potentially CPU-intensive operations such as network transport offload, asynchronous progress, Remote Direct Memory Attachment, and reliable multicast in hardware. The mechanisms of each of these functions will be described together with proof of the benefits based on the latest academic and industrial research.
