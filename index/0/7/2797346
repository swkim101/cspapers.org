For λ > 0, let π<inf>λ</inf> be the probability measure on the independent sets of the hypercube {0,1}<sup><i>d</i></sup> in which <i>I</i> is chosen with probability proportional to λ<sup>|<i>I</i>|</sup>. We study the Glauber dynamics, or single-site-update Markov chain, whose stationary distribution is π<inf>λ</inf>, and show that for values of λ tending to 0 as <i>d</i> grows, the convergence to stationarity is exponentially slow in the volume of the cube. The proof combines a conductance argument with combinatorial enumeration methods.
