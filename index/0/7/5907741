In this paper, we present a new parsing method for Chinese based on a newly proposed linguistic entity relationship model. In the model, we extract and define the linguistic entity relationship modes to describe the most basic syntactic and semantic structures of Chinese, and use the relationship modes as the foundation to implement the parsing algorithm. Compared with the rule-based and corpus-based methods, we neither manually write a large number of rules as used in traditional rule-based methods nor use the corpus to train the model. We only use the few meta-rules to describe the grammars in the parsing procedure. The system performance of syntactic parsing based on the model outperforms the corpus-based baseline system.
