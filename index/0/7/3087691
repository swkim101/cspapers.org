A great deal of recent work has investigated new programming abstractions and models for sensor networks. However, the complexity of such systems demands a great deal of effort to develop appropriate compilers and runtime platforms to achieve good performance. We will demonstrate Flask [5], a new programming platform for sensor networks that decouples the design of a high-level programming environment from the the low-level details of generating per-node code and an efficient runtime system.
