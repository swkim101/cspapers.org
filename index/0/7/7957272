This paper presents a new three dimensional kinematic and dynamic model for variable length continuum arm robotic structures using a novel shape function-based approach. The model incorporates geometrically constrained structure of the arm to derive its deformation shape function. It is able to simulate spatial bending, pure elongation, and incorporates a new stiffness control feature. The model is validated through numerical simulations, based on a prototype continuum arm, that yields physically accurate results.
