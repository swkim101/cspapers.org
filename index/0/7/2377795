A peg-in-hole insertion task is used as an example to illustrate the utility of direct associative reinforcement learning methods for learning control under real-world conditions of uncertainty and noise. Task complexity due to the use of an unchamfered hole and a clearance of less than 0.2mm is compounded by the presence of positional uncertainty of magnitude exceeding 10 to 50 times the clearance. Despite this extreme degree of uncertainty, our results indicate that direct reinforcement learning can be used to learn a robust reactive control strategy that results in skillful peg-in-hole insertions.
