Given two vertices s, t in a graph, let P be the shortest path (SP) from <i>s</i> to <i>t</i>, and <i>P*</i> a subset of the vertices in <i>P</i>. <i>P*</i> is a <i>k</i>-skip shortest path from <i>s</i> to <i>t</i>, if it includes at least a vertex out of every <i>k</i> consecutive vertices in <i>P</i>. In general, <i>P*</i> succinctly describes <i>P</i> by sampling the vertices in <i>P</i> with a rate of at least 1/k. This makes <i>P*</i> a natural substitute in scenarios where reporting every single vertex of <i>P</i> is unnecessary or even undesired.
 This paper studies <i>k</i>-skip <i>SP</i> computation in the context of <i>spatial network databases (SNDB)</i>. Our technique has two properties crucial for real-time query processing in SNDB. First, our solution is able to answer <i>k</i>-skip queries <i>significantly faster</i> than finding the original <i>SPs</i> in their entirety. Second, the previous objective is achieved with a structure that occupies <i>less space</i> than storing the underlying road network. The proposed algorithms are the outcome of a careful theoretical analysis that reveals valuable insight into the characteristics of the <i>k</i>-skip <i>SP</i> problem. Their efficiency has been confirmed by extensive experiments with real data.
