The idea of an emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is currently captivating both technologists and society at large. Although IoT techniques have their roots in ideas that are decades old, their increasingly widespread deployments have made them a hot topic these days, frequently discussed and hyped. As many as 50B networked devices are envisioned by 2020, and proponents of IoTs see a world where embedded sensing and control techniques help vehicle traffic flow more smoothly, where environmental sensing and data analysis facilitates better use of natural resources like water, and where personalized health monitoring helps individuals improve their quality of life. On the other hand, properly addressing policy concerns around security and privacy may play a role in IoT's adoption and success. My talk will discuss key technology and policy challenges for future IoT applications and devices. Overall, I will be drawing from both technical experiences and trends, as well as from policy perspectives gained during a one year fellowship doing technology policy within the U. S. Department of State.
