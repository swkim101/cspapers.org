Information Systems (GISs) have become an essential tool for efficient handling of our natural and artificial environment. The most important activities in a GIS are querying and spatial analysis of georeferenced data providing decision making and problem solving support. Traditional database query languages and tools are inappropriate for GIS purpose, because of their inability to address spatial properties of the real world entities. This paper presents a spatial query and analysis tool with the strong visual context, called GeoQA. It has been developed as an integral component of the GinisNT, object-oriented GIS framework for GIS applications development. GeoQA provides effective, interactive but user-friendly and ease-of-use mechanisms for performing spatial and non-spatial queries, as well as, spatial, thematic and statistic analysis in specific GIS applications developed on the top of GinisNT.
