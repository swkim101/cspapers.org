This video demonstrates one potential application of RetroSkeleton, which is a system for specifying and applying transformations to Android apps via bytecode rewriting. These transformation policies are app-agnostic and can be applied to Android apps without any manual guidance. In this video, we show how RetroSkeleton can be used to automatically add custom fine-grained network access controls into an existing app, giving users more control over their apps. We also show the use of the RetroSkeleton web interface, available at http://retroskeleton.com.
