The history of the Web is full of attempts to enable micropayments for content and services. All have failed to achieve widespread adoption. This has fueled recurring debates about the merits or fundamental flaws of the concept of asking users to pay small amounts for what they use online. As a result, however, of the Web's lack of native payment infrastructure, the only viable business models concentrate earnings and power in a small group of content and advertising aggregators and increase demand for privacy-infringing technologies. We need to learn from the failures of previous micropayment schemes and we need to create a payment protocol that is of the Web, for the Web. We present a demo browser extension that uses the new Interledger Protocol (ILP) to demonstrate how payments and micropayments can be seamlessly built into the Web. ILP is an open payment protocol for payments across different payment networks that is being developed in the W3C Interledger Community Group. It enables new possibilities for developers and a better experience for users of the Open Web Platform.
