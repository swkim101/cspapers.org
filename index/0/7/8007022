The problem of resource allocation in two-way relay network is considered in this paper. The cognitive radio (CR) context is tackled where a amplify and forward (AF) OFDM-based dual-hop multiple relay system is investigated. The joint allocation of subcarrier pairing, relay selection and power allocation is performed under both interference and individual power constraints where the target is to maximize the achievable data rate of the network. The dual decomposition is adopted to obtain the optimal solution. Two sub-optimal schemes are proposed also to reduce the computational complexity of the optimal scheme. Simulations are presented to compare the performance of the optimal scheme with that of the proposed sub-optimal schemes.
