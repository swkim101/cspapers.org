Typically video projectors display images onto white screens, which can result in a washed out image. Projectibles algorithmically control the display surface color to increase the contrast and resolution. By combining a printed image with projected light, we can create animated, high resolution, high dynamic range visual experiences for video sequences. We present two algorithms for separating an input video sequence into a printed component and projected component, maximizing the combined contrast and resolution while minimizing any visual artifacts introduced from the decomposition. We present empirical measurements of real-world results of six example video sequences, subjective viewer feedback ratings, and we discuss the benefits and limitations of Projectibles. This is the first approach to combine a static display with a dynamic display for the display of video, and the first to optimize surface color for projection of video.
