We present the design and evaluation of a web-based peer review system that uses natu-ral language processing to automatically evaluate and provide instant feedback regarding the presence of solutions in peer reviews. Student reviewers can then choose to either revise their reviews to address the systemâ€™s feedback, or ignore the feedback and submit their original reviews. A system deployment in multiple high school classrooms shows that our so-lution prediction model triggers instant feed-back with high precision, and that the feed-back is successful in increasing the number of peer reviews with solutions.
