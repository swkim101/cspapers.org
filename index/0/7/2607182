We address two open theoretical questions in Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning. The first concerns the efficacy of using function approximation to represent the state action value function, Q. Theory is presented showing that linear function approximation representations of Q can degrade the rate of convergence of performance gradient estimates by a factor of O(ML) relative to when no function approximation of Q is used, where M is the number of possible actions and L is the number of basis functions in the function approximation representation. The second concerns the use of a bias term in estimating the state action value function. Theory is presented showing that a non-zero bias term can improve the rate of convergence of performance gradient estimates by 0(1 (1/M)), where M is the number of possible actions. Experimental evidence is presented showing that these theoretical results lead to significant improvement in the convergence properties of Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
