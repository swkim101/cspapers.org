This paper presents a generative model to event schema induction. Previous methods in the literature only use head words to represent entities. However, elements other than head words contain useful information. For instance, an armed man is more discriminative than man. Our model takes into account this information and precisely represents it using probabilistic topic distributions. We illustrate that such information plays an important role in parameter estimation. Mostly, it makes topic distributions more coherent and more discriminative. Experimental results on benchmark dataset empirically confirm this enhancement.
