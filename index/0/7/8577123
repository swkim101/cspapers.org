WaveScope is a data management and continuous sensor data system that integrates relational database and signal processing operations into a single system. WaveScope is motivated by a large number of signal-oriented streaming sensor applications, such as: preventive maintenance of industrial equipment; detection of fractures and ruptures in various structures; in situ animal behavior studies using acoustic sensing; network traffic analysis; and medical applications such as anomaly detection in EKGs. These target applications use a variety of embedded sensors, each sampling at fine resolution and producing data at high rates ranging from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of samples per second. Though there has been some work on applications in the sensor network community that do this kind of signal processing (for example, shooter localization [5], industrial equipment monitoring [4], and urban infrastructure monitoring [2]), these applications are typically custombuilt and do not provide reusable high-level programming framework suitable for easily building new signal processing applications with similar functionality. This poster shows how WaveScope supports these types of application in a single, unified framework, providing both high run-time performance and easy application development.
