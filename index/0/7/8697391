This paper proposes defining transparency in the time domain and establishes a quantitative measure of how the human operator "feels" the remote system in a teleoperation system. The main advantage of the proposed definition and measure of transparency with respect to the other ones is that they allow analyzing the effect of the time-varying delay and remote nonlinear systems on the system transparency. Some examples are analyzed showing how the transparency can be calculated in different time instants for teleoperation systems.
