The concept of grammar forms [4,5] provides evidence that there seems to be no way to base the definitions of many grammar types used in parsing and compiling solely on the concept of productions. Strict interpretations, as introduced in [3,5], of unambiguous or LR(k) grammar forms generate unambiguous or LR(k) languages, respectively. This is not true in the LL(k) case. It is decidable whether a strict interpretation of an unambiguous grammar form is unambiguous. For any two compatible strict interpretations G1 and G2 of an unambiguous grammar form it is decidable whether L(G1)⊆L(G2), L(G1)∩L(G2)=φ, finite, or infinite. For every grammar form F1 there exists a grammar form F2 such that the grammatical family of F1 under unrestricted interpretations is equal to the grammatical family of F2 under strict interpretations.
