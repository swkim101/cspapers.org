This paper proposes a novel participant selection framework, named CrowdRecruiter, for mobile crowdsensing. CrowdRecruiter operates on top of energy-efficient Piggyback Crowdsensing (PCS) task model and minimizes incentive payments by selecting a small number of participants while still satisfying probabilistic coverage constraint. In order to achieve the objective when piggybacking crowdsensing tasks with phone calls, CrowdRecruiter first predicts the call and coverage probability of each mobile user based on historical records. It then efficiently computes the joint coverage probability of multiple users as a combined set and selects the near-minimal set of participants, which meets coverage ratio requirement in each sensing cycle of the PCS task. We evaluated CrowdRecruiter extensively using a large-scale real-world dataset and the results show that the proposed solution significantly outperforms three baseline algorithms by selecting 10.0% -- 73.5% fewer participants on average under the same probabilistic coverage constraint.
