In this paper we discuss cascaded Memory-Based grammatical relations assignment. In the first stages of the cascade, we find chunks of several types (NP,VP,ADJP,ADVP,PP) and label them with their adverbial function (e.g. local, temporal). In the last stage, we assign grammatical relations to pairs of chunks. We studied the effect of adding several levels to this cascaded classifier and we found that even the less performing chunkers enhanced the performance of the relation finder.
