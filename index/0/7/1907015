The inefficient use of complex computer systems has been widelyreported. These studies show the persistence of inefficient methodsdespite many years of experience and formal training. To counteractthis phenomenon, we present the design of a new course, called theStrategic Use of CAD. The course aims at teaching studentsefficient strategies to use a computer-aided drafting systemthrough a two-pronged approach. Learning to See teaches students torecognize opportunities to use efficient strategies by studying thenature of the task, and Learning to Do teaches students toimplement the strategies. Results from a pilot experiment show thatthis approach had a positive effect on the strategic behavior ofstudents who did not exhibit knowledge of efficient strategiesbefore the class, and had no effect on the strategic behavior ofthose who did. Strategic training can thus assist users inrecognizing opportunities to use efficient strategies. We presentthe ramifications of these results on the design of training andfuture experiments.
