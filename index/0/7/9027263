A computer software package is described, whose function is to provide an interface from a solid geometric modeler to a more conventional 3D wireframe system. Specifically, the conversion of a SynthaVision solid model to an edge-vertex data structure is discussed. The paper describes, qualitatively, the approach to solid modeling used in SynthaVision, a geometry translator that outputs an "edge file" containing the bounding edges of the model, and a view generator that processes the edge file to produce line drawings.
