By extending assemble thoery, we obtain a mathematical foundation for representing and reasoning about dynamic systems with continuous object, such as liquids and continuous programs, such as chemical reactions. This facility is embedded into the DREAM representation framework that, using object-oriented mechanisms, integrates a varity of representation approaches.
