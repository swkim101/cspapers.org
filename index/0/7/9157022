The division of floor plans or navigation maps into single rooms or similarly meaningful semantic units is central to numerous tasks in robotics such as topological mapping, semantic mapping, place categorization, human-robot-interaction, or automatized professional cleaning. Although many map partitioning algorithms have been proposed for various applications there is a lack of comparative studies on these different algorithms. This paper surveys the literature on room segmentation and provides four publicly available implementations of popular methods, which target the semantic mapping domain and are tuned to yield segmentations into complete rooms. In an attempt to provide new users of such technologies guidance in the choice of map segmentation algorithm, those methods are compared qualitatively and quantitatively using several criteria. The evaluation is based on a novel compilation of 20 challenging floor plans.
