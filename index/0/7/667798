Privacy is an important issue in data mining and knowledge discovery. In this paper, we propose to use the randomized response techniques to conduct the data mining computation. Specially, we present a method to build decision tree classifiers from the disguised data. We conduct experiments to compare the accuracy of our decision tree with the one built from the original undisguised data. Our results show that although the data are disguised, our method can still achieve fairly high accuracy. We also show how the parameter used in the randomized response techniques affects the accuracy of the results.
