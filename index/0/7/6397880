For many computer vision applications, the data sets distribute on certain low-dimensional subspaces. Subspace clustering is to find such underlying subspaces and cluster the data points correctly. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view subspace clustering method. The proposed method performs clustering on the subspace representation of each view simultaneously. Meanwhile, we propose to use a common cluster structure to guarantee the consistence among different views. In addition, an efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Experiments on four benchmark data sets have been performed to validate our proposed method. The promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
