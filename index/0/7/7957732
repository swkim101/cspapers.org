Decision making is particularly important for emergency managers as they often need to make quick and high quality decisions under stress based on scratch and inadequate information; and to follow expert knowledge or past experience. The potential release of radioactive material from the Guangdong Nuclear Power Station (GNPS) at Daya Bay, though is highly unlikely, could perhaps be the most dreaded disaster which would cause drastic damages to lives and properties. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSAR) has therefore in 1990 completed the Daya Bay Contingency Plan (DBCP) to prepare for such disasters. To supplement the experts in assisting disaster managers with a useful tool to make better quality decisions based on well-structured, accurate, sufficient expert knowledge, a prototype expert system has been developed to cover two major areas of the plan, namely: (A) Determination of activation level of the DBCP and provision of an action checklist and (B) recommendation on counter-measures.
