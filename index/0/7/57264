System Overview PAUL solves the cellular congestion problem via leveraging the usersâ€™ predictable behaviors, which have tremendous impact on the traffic load. Moreover, it significantly enhances the user experience via eliminated download delays and reduced cost. PAUL proceeds through three major steps towards retrieving content before demand. First, it logs the behavior of the mobile users throughout the day, namely content consumption, Wi-Fi data rate and battery usage. Second, the logged traces are used to build probabilistic user behavioral models (profiles). These user profiles capture the resource-side (Wi-Fi data rate and battery conditions) and the demand-side (content consumption). Third, we propose a greedy, low-complexity, proactive scheduling algorithm. It utilizes the built profiles to create a schedule for retrieving content before demand over Wi-Fi connectivity opportunities throughout the day, resides on the cloud and constitutes the centerpiece of PAUL.
