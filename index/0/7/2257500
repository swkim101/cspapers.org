This paper describes an integrated method for processing grammatically ill formed inputs. We use partial parses of the input for recovering from parsing failure. In order to select partial parses appropriate for error recovery, cost and reward are assigned to them Cost and reward represent the badness and goodness of a partial parse, respectively. The most appropriate partial parse is selected on the basis of cost and reward trade off. The system contains three modules Module A handles local ill-formedness such as constraint violations Module B handles non-local ill formedness such as word order violations, and Module C handles non-local ill-formedness such as contextual ellipses. These three modules work in a uniform framework based on the notions of cost and reward.
