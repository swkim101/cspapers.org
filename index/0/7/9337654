Mobile devices are becoming the dominant mode of information access despite being cumbersome to input text using small keyboards and browsing web pages on small screens. We present Qme!, a speech-based question-answering system that allows for spoken queries and retrieves answers to the questions instead of web pages. We present bootstrap methods to distinguish dynamic questions from static questions and we show the benefits of tight coupling of speech recognition and retrieval components of the system.
