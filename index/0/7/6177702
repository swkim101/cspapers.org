Exploitation of deep-submicron technology will dependcritically on the availability of global system engineers ableto bridge the gap between software-centric system thinkingand hardware-software implementation of it in novel siliconarchitectures. This requires a rethinking of presentengineering schools which are not well equipped to tackleglobal system engineering aspects. The concept of designinstitute is introduced where, based on visionary systemdesign demonstrators, new methodologies, tools, librariesand courses are created and distributed over the globalnetwork. Design institutes provide a learning school fornew design paradigms and form the ideal environment forthe education of global system designers.
