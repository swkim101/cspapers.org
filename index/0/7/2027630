Two typical situations in whic hit is of practical interest to determine the similarities of text documents to a query due to a search engine are: (1) a global search engine, constructed on top of a group of local search engines, wishes to retrieve the set of local documents globally most similar to a given query; and (2) an organization wan ts to compare the retrieval performance of search engines. The dot-product function is a widely used similarity function. For a searc h engine using such a function, we can determine its similarity computations if how the search engine sets the weights of terms is known, which is usually not the case. In this paper, techniques are presented to disco vercertain mathematical expressions of these formulas and the values of embedded constan ts when the dot-product similarit y function is used. Preliminary results from experiments on the WebCrawler search engine are given to illustrate our techniques.
