This paper reports empirical results from a study into the useof 2D widgets in 3D immersive virtual environments. Severalresearchers have proposed the use of 2D interaction techniques in3D environments, however little empirical work has been done totest the usability of such approaches. We present the results oftwo experiments conducted on low-level 2D manipulation tasks withinan immersive virtual environment. We empirically show that theaddition of passive-haptic feedback for use in precise UImanipulation tasks can significantly increase user performance.Furthermore, users prefer interfaces that provide a physicalsurface, and that allow them to work with interface widgets in thesame visual field of view as the objects they are modifying.
