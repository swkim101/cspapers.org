In this paper, we present LiveLabs, a first-of-its-kind testbed that is deployed across a university campus, convention centre, and resort island and collects real-time attributes such as location, group context etc., from hundreds of opt-in participants. These venues, data, and participants are then made available for running rich human-centric behavioural experiments that could test new mobile sensing infrastructure, applications, analytics, or more social-science type hypotheses that influence and then observe actual user behaviour. We share case studies of how researchers from around the world have and are using LiveLabs, and our experiences and lessons learned from building, maintaining, and expanding Live-Labs over the last three years.
