This paper investigates haptic interaction with virtual environments composed of objects with diverse dynamic properties. Passivity is often used for stability analysis of haptic systems. We demonstrate that when the dynamics of the virtual environment during the interaction changes, the approaches using traditional notion of passivity for hybrid systems can be used to design stable interaction strategies for such systems.
