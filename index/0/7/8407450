In this paper, a new control algorithm is presented for implementing hopping and balancing motions on a planar hopping machine with a single actuated revolute joint. Starting with a simple control algorithm for balancing, it is extended to perform trajectory-tracking maneuvers, which enables it to perform the crouching, lift-off and flight phases of a single hop, as well as re-balancing after landing. Simulation results are presented showing that the control system works well, and that it is not significantly affected by small amounts of slipping between the foot and the ground.
