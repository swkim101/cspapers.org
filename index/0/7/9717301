As a result of the Linked Data Basic Profile submission, made by several organizations including IBM, EMC, and Oracle, the W3C launched in June 2012 the Linked Data Platform (LDP) Working Group (WG). The LDP WG is chartered to produce a W3C Recommendation for HTTP-based (RESTful) application integration patterns using read/write Linked Data. This work will benefit both small-scale in-browser applications (WebApps) and large-scale Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) efforts. It will complement SPARQL and will be compatible with standards for publishing Linked Data, bringing the data integration features of RDF to RESTful, data-oriented software development. This presentation introduces developers to the Linked Data Platform, explains its origins in the Open Services Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) initiative, describes how it fits with other existing Semantic Web technologies and the problems developers will be able to address using LDP, based on use cases such as the integration challenge the industry faces in the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) space. By attending this presentation developers will get an understanding of this upcoming W3C Recommendation which is posed to become a major stepping stone in enabling broader adoption of Linked Data in the industry, not only for publishing data but also for integrating applications.
