User generated Web content includes large amounts of procedural knowledge (also called how to knowledge). This paper is on a comparison of two extraction methods for procedural knowledge from the Web. Both methods create workflow representations automatically from text with the aim to reuse the Web experience by reasoning methods. Two variants of the workflow extraction process are introduced and evaluated by experiments with cooking recipes as a sample domain. The first variant is a term-based approach that integrates standard information extraction methods from the GATE system. The second variant is a frame-based approach that is implemented by means of the SUNDANCE system. The expert assessment of the extraction results clearly shows that the more sophisticated frame-based approach outperforms the term-based approach of automated workflow extraction.
