We present a novel rotation based method for detecting where a mobile device is worn on a user's body that utilizes the fusion of the data from accelerometer and gyroscope. Detecting the position of a mobile device could improve the performance of on-body sensor based human activity recognition and the adaptability of many mobile applications. In our method, the radius and angular velocity for a position is calculated based on the data read from the sensors integrated in a mobile device. We have evaluated our method with an experiment to detect four commonly used positions: breast pocket, trouser pocket, hip pocket and hand.
