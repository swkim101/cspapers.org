Radio frequency identiï¬‚cation(RFID) technology uses radio-frequency waves to transfer data between readers and mov-able tagged objects without line of sight. RFID holds thepromise of real-time identifying, locating, tracking and mon-itoring physical objects, and can be used for a wide range ofpervasive computing applications. To achieve these goals,RFID data have to be collected, transformed and expres-sively modeled as their virtual counterparts in the virtualworld. RFID data, however, have their own unique char-acteristics { including aggregation, location, temporal andhistory-oriented { which have to be fully considered and inte-grated into the data model. The diversity of RFID applica-tions pose further challenges to a generalized framework forRFID data modeling. In this paper, we explore the funda-mental characteristics of RFID data and classify RFID ap-plications into a set of typical scenarios. We then propose ageneralized RFID data modeling framework with constructsfor each typical scenario. These constructs can be combinedto model most RFID applications in real world.
