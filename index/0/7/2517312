In this study, we propose an optimization strategy to promote a better integration of the parallel I/O middleware and parallel file systems. We illustrate that a layout-aware optimization strategy can improve the performance of current collective I/O in parallel I/O system. We present the motivation, prototype design and initial verification of the proposed layout-aware optimization strategy. The analytical and initial experimental testing results demonstrate that the proposed strategy has a potential in improving the parallel I/O system performance.
