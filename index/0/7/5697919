The development of reconfigurable devices that could make themselves domain-specialized at run time is becoming more and more common. Future reconfigurable architecture will have these computing devices as basic blocks, and reconfigurable architecture could make assemblies of these devices, on the fly, to execute concurrent applications. The migration from completely generic lookup tables and highly connected routing fabrics to self adaptive specialized coarse-grain reconfigurable devices and very structured communication resources presents designers with the problem of how to best customize the system based upon anticipated usage. Then there is a need of not only exploiting parallelism from applications at micro-thread level, dynamically, but system also starves for a dynamic and self adaptive middleware to schedule these micro-threads on thousands of such computing devices. This paper focuses at the problem of dynamic allocation and scheduling of resources to numbers of applications on such architecture.
