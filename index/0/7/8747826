Cellular networks have witnessed tremendous traffic growth recently, fueled by smartphones, tablets and new high speed broadband cellular access technologies. A key application driving that growth is video streaming. Yet very little is known about the characteristics of this traffic class. In this paper, we examine video traffic generated by three million users across one of the world's largest 3G cellular networks. This first deep dive into cellular video streaming shows that HLS, an adaptive bitrate streaming protocol, accounts for one third of the streaming video traffic and that it is common to see changes in encoding bitrates within a session. We also observe that most of the content is streamed at less than 255 Kbps and that only 40% of the videos are fully downloaded. Another key finding is that there exists significant potential for caching to deliver this content.
