One approach to leverage scalable systems for RDF management is partitioning large datasets across distributed servers. In this paper we consider workload data, given in the form of query patterns and their frequencies, for determining how to partition RDF datasets. Our experimental study shows that our workload-aware method is an effective way to cluster related data and provides better query response times compared to an elementary fragmentation method.
