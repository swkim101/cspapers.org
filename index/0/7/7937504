Semantic visualization integrates topic modeling and visualization, such that every document is associated with a topic distribution as well as visualization coordinates on a low-dimensional Euclidean space. We address the problem of semantic visualization for short texts. Such documents are increasingly common, including tweets, search snip-pets, news headlines, or status updates. Due to their short lengths, it is difÔ¨Åcult to model semantics as the word co-occurrences in such a corpus are very sparse. Our approach is to incorporate auxiliary information, such as word embeddings from a larger corpus, to supplement the lack of co-occurrences. This requires the development of a novel semantic visualization model that seamlessly integrates visualization coordinates, topic distributions, and word vectors. We propose a model called GaussianSV, which outperforms pipelined baselines that derive topic models and visualization coordinates as disjoint steps, as well as semantic visualization base-lines that do not consider word embeddings.
