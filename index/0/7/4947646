We review here our work on using machine learning in the Ecoute, Quaero and BeeMusic projects to perform automatic labelling into music-tags (genre, mood and instrumentation). We discuss the evolution over times of audio feature design ranging from manually designed audio features to automatically designed audio features. We also discuss the way we deal with scalability issues in these projects.
