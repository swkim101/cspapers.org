The paper proposes a method to assess the feasible torque bandwidth for electrically driven torque controllable actuators over its entire torque amplitude range. The method solely relies on the knowledge of hardware parameters and thereby determines the physically feasible torque control bandwidth at a given torque amplitude, independent of a controller. The method yields torque-frequency diagrams that are suitable to benchmark torque controllers, formulate actuator design specifications and compare as well as select actuators for a specific torque control application. The paper exemplifies the method on a WALK-MAN leg actuator with locked actuator output and the more practical case of a varying load inertia.
