In this paper, the design and experimental evaluation of a cable driven robotic gripper for underwater applications is presented. The gripper has three fingers and is characterised by a large workspace if compared with other similar devices reported in literature. Its kinematic configuration allows to execute both parallel and precision grasps on objects with very different dimensions. The gripper has 8 degrees of freedom actuated by only three motors by means of a suitable coupling of the joints obtained through the cable transmission. Moreover, in order to facilitate the execution of complex tasks, special force/torque sensors are mounted on the fingertips. The paper reports the main specifications deriving from the particular tasks in which the gripper is involved, and illustrates the proposed design solutions. Results obtained from real underwater experiments are provided as well, in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the gripper.
