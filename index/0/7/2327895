A stored query is a pair <query,response>, where "respons&' is the-query meaning for the current database state. When a collection of stored queries is available responses to sane queries may be obtained easily. Stored queries give a possibility of improvement of database sys tern response time regardless of the complexity of user request and the data model assumed. The method is a generalization of methods based on indices. Its main properties and problems are outlined, particularly the problem of updating stored queries. The presented solutions are based on detecting whether the response associated with a query is influenced by a database update, and on correcting the response after an update. The methods concern NETUL, a user-friendly query language, with the power of programming languages, for network/semantic data models.
