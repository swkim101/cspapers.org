In the Marr-Poggio model of human stereopsis, eye vergence movement is tightly coupled to the matching process. Any local area of any spatial frequency tuned channel can initiate a vergence movement designed to bring zero crossings within that local area into their range of correspondence. Since, in the human system, the resource of eye movement is limited, the control problem inherent in such a strategy seems intractable. This paper, in contrast, proposes that by requiring spectral continuity of disparity, global disambiguation can occur during the course of any reasonable sequence of vergence movements. The matching process is thus only loosely coupled to the vergence mechanism. A computer implementation has been tested successfully on both a random dot stereogram and a stereo pair of a natural scene.
