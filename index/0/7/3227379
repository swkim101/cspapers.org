We propose a new class of wireless transmission schemes decoupling synchronization headers from payloads to create new transmission primitives involving a second sender. By transmitting a synchronization header only we can let nearby nodes receive fragments of a packet without having to receive that packet's synchronization header, and by using the capture effect we can overwrite portions of the payload of longer ongoing packets. We explore two scenarios potentially benefiting from such schemes. A) First, we consider crossing a network chasm over which all links are of poor quality: by broadcasting a fabricated packet header on the receiving side of the chasm all receiving nodes are informed to record the packet to the best of their ability. B) Second, we investigate the insertion of short high-priority packets into longer lower-priority transmissions from a different sender. This has the advantage that high-priority senders do not need to wait for the medium to become free but can begin sending at once, while receivers lose only the affected portion of their already incoming low-priority packets. Further, we examine two techniques to reduce the amount of symbol decoding errors caused by using a mismatching synchronization header: 1) careful transmission timing and 2) correction of deterministic symbol decoding errors. In scenario A) these techniques improve the chance of every part of a packet being received successfully by some node on the receiving side of the chasm from 5% to up to 30%. In scenario B) we reach successful decoding of the injected packet in up to 70% of cases. In proof of concept implementations on a testbed of TelosB nodes we confirm the soundness of our methods.
