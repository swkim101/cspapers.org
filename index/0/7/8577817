The increased power densities of multi-core processors and the variations within and across workloads lead to runtime thermal hot spots locations of which change across time and space. Thermal hot spots increase leakage, deteriorate timing, and reduce the mean time to failure. To manage runtime thermal variations, circuit designers embed within-die thermal sensors that acquire temperatures at few selected locations. The acquired temperatures are then used to guide runtime thermal management techniques. The capabilities of these techniques are essentially bounded by the spatial thermal resolution of the sensor measurements. In this paper we characterize temperature signals of real processors and demonstrate that on-chip thermal gradients lead to sparse signals in the frequency domain. We exploit this observation to (1) devise thermal sensor allocation techniques, and (2) devise signal reconstruction techniques that fully characterize the thermal status of the processor using the limited number of measurements from the thermal sensors. To verify the accuracy of our methods, we compare our temperature characterization results against thermal measurements acquired from a state-of-the-art infrared camera that captures the mid-band infrared emissions from the back of the die of a 45 nm dual-core processor. Our results show that our techniques are capable of accurately characterizing the temperatures of real processors.
