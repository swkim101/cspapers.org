Program comprehension is an essential process in programming and many researchers report that it tends to take up to a half of a programmers' time during their work with a source code. Integrated development environments (IDEs) facilitate this process but there still are only restricted possibilities for narrowing the gap between concerns of a problem domain and a source code that implements them. In our work we utilize projectional properties of modern IDEs to make them able to process concern-related metadata and to provide customizable code projections. These projections preserve the original code structure while they show it from an alternative perspective regarding the contained concerns. We plan to evaluate the effect such code projections will have on program comprehension tasks.
