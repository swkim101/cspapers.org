In this paper, we explore the computational potential and limitations of the multi-layered connectionist models [Minsky and Papert, 1968]. We found that the number of layers and the width are two crucial parameters for the multi-layered connectionist models. If each layer has the same size n and we increment the number of layers by 1, then the number of problems solved will increase O(n3) times. On the other hand, suppose the number of layers is equal to 2. If we increment the width by 1, then the number of problem solved will increase <D(nn) times, where n is the input size. Hence, we can extend a 2-layered connectionist model by adding layers or increasing width. Our conclusion is that increasing width is better than adding layers.
