In this paper, we present the AnimalScript visualization language. This scripting language uses the flexibility of the Animal system and provides many additional new graphic primitives and animation effects that go beyond the traditional Animal GUI features.AnimalScript can easily be configured by changing the content of a registration file. Users may also have multiple registration files, as AnimalScript will always use the first registration file it finds. AnimalScript can easily be extended with additional features without needing to read, let alone change, any existing code.
