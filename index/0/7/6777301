Recent research in the field of user interface (UI) mashups has focused on so-called choreographed compositions, where communication between components is not pre-defined by a mashup designer, but rather emerges from the components' messaging capabilities. Though the mashup development process gets simplified, such solutions bear several problems related to awareness and control of the emerging message flow. This paper presents an approach to systematically extend choreographed mashups with visualization and tailoring facilities. A first user study demonstrates that usability of the resulting solutions increases if proposed awareness and control facilities are integrated.
