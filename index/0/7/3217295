Marmoset is a framework for storing and testing student submissions to programming assignments. It gives students a limited ability to release test their code using an instructor's private suite of test cases. This encourages them to start early and implement their own test cases. It also provides facilities for instructors to manage the grading process and gives researchers access to fine-grained snapshots of the student development process.
