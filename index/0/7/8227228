Degrees of belief are formed using observed evidence and statistical background information. In this paper we examine the process of how prior degrees of belief derived from the evidence are combined with statistical data to form more specific degrees of belief. A statistical model for this process then is shown to vindicate the cross-entropy minimization principle as a rule for probabilistic default-inference.
