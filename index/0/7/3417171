Simultaneously realizing device authentication and fast secret key extraction is a challenging issue in wireless networks. Most existing works solve this problem by utilizing either advanced hardware or out-of-band channel, which is not always available for commercial-off-the-shelf wireless devices. In this work, we solve this challenging issue under the setting of Wireless Body Area Network (BAN) and propose a lightweight authenticated secret key extraction scheme, namely ASK-BAN. The proposed scheme is just based on wireless channel measurement and does not introduce any advanced hardware or rely on any out-of-band channel. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme can offer a high secret key extraction rate while providing effective device authentication simultaneously.
