Wikis are popular collaborative hypertext authoring environments, but they neither support structured access nor information reuse. Adding semantic annotations helps to address these limitations. We present an architecture for Semantic Wikis and discuss design decisions including structured access, views, and annotation language. We present our prototype SemperWiki that implements this architecture.
