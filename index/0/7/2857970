JAWAA is a simple command language for creating animations of data structures and displaying them with a Web browser. Commands are stored in a script file that is retrieved and run by the JAWAA applet when the applet's Web page is accessed through the Web. JAWAA commands allow for creation and movement of primitive objects (circles, lines, text, rectangles) and data structure objects (arrays, stacks, queues, lists, trees and graphs). A JAWAA script can be generated as the output of a program written in any language.
