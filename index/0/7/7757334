The ViewPoints framework for distributed and concurrent software engineering provides an alternative approach to traditional centralised software development environments. We investigate the use of decentralised process models to drive consistency checking and conflict resolution in this framework. Our process models use pattern matching on local development histories to determine the particular situation (state) of the development process, and employ rules to trigger situation-dependent assistance to the user. We describe how communication between such process models facilitates the decentralised management of explicitly defined consistency constraints in the ViewPoints framework.
