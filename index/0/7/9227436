In previous work we have established the design of an information system intended to provide efficient information retrieval services over a wide-area network. In this paper we show that throughput increases nearly as fast w the number of sites for most topologies, analyze response time in more detail, and show that natural update propagation is sufficient to eliminate obsolete data from the system in most cases.
