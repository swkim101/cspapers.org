TimesTen Performance Software's Front-Tier product is an application-tier data cache that in-ter-operates with disk-based relational database management systems (RDBMSs) to achieve breakthrough response time and throughput, scalability in transaction load, high availability, and ease of administration and deployment. Front-Tier caches frequently used subsets of the corporate database on multiple servers in the application tier and supports SQL queries and updates to the caches. The caches may or may not be overlapping, are kept synchronized with the corporate database and with each other, and may be dynamically reconfigured to contain different subsets of the corporate database. Front-Tier provides the fundamental bridge between the corporate database and high-performance, scalable application servers. It eliminates the main barrier to application server scalability and high performance, namely the sole reliance on a centralized corporate database server for data management.
