With increasing use of embedded systems in safety critical systems, architectures and design processes for safety have become a primary objective in systems design. Most such systems are also time critical leading to safety and time critical systems. Safety standards impose strong requirements on such systems challenging system performance and cost. Very often, however, only part of the functions is safety and time critical calling for a design approach that both meets the safety requirements and provides efficiency and flexibility for less critical functions. These conflicting requirements have given rise to the new research area of mixed critical system design with enormous practical relevance. The tutorial addresses key aspects of mixed critical system design.
 The tutorial starts with a short introduction to the topic summarizing requirements and challenges of mixed critical system design. The first lecture by Alan Burns gives an overview of scheduling issues in mixed critical systems and explains first solutions. The second lecture by Lothar Thiele addresses the lack of multicore timing predictability which challenges mixed critical systems integration and proposes a solution based on reducing timing variation. The third lecture by Rolf Ernst and Jimmy Le Rhun explains integration solutions based on switched networks and presents a scalable manycore architecture for mixed critical systems integration.
