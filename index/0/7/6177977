Problems associated with classroom presentation of dynamic events and associated concepts are developed. The use of Hypertext as a tool for enhancing the learning process with respect to such dynamic events is introduced. The in-class application of this tool is illustrated in two different areas of Computer Science, Introduction to Problem Solving and Data Structures. The advantages of instructor use of the Hypertext tool is summarized and areas of additional work are delineated.
