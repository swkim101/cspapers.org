In this paper, we propose a web search retrieval approach which automatically detects recency sensitive queries and increases the freshness of the ordinary document ranking by a degree proportional to the probability of the need in recent content. We propose to solve the recency ranking problem by using result diversification principles and deal with the query's non-topical ambiguity appearing when the need in recent content can be detected only with uncertainty. Our offine and online experiments with millions of queries from real search engine users demonstrate the significant increase in satisfaction of users presented with a search result generated by our approach.
