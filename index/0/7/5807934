In a linguistically-motivated syntax-based translation system, the entire translation process is normally carried out in two steps, translation rule matching and target sentence decoding using the matched rules. Both steps are very time-consuming due to the tremendous number of translation rules, the exhaustive search in translation rule matching and the complex nature of the translation task itself. In this paper, we propose a hyper-tree-based fast algorithm for translation rule matching. Experimental results on the NIST MT-2003 Chinese-English translation task show that our algorithm is at least 19 times faster in rule matching and is able to help to save 57% of overall translation time over previous methods when using large fragment translation rules.
