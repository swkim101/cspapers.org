A recommendation system tracks past purchases of a group of users to make product recommendations to individual members of the group. In this paper we present a notion of competitive recommendation systems, building on recent theoretical work on this subject. We reduce the problem of achieving competitiveness to a problem in matrix reconstruction. We then present a matrix reconstruction scheme that is competitive: it requires a small overhead in the number of users and products to be sampled, delivering in the process a net utility that closely approximates the best possible with full knowledge of all user-product preferences.
