The spatial join operation with spatial output is benchmarked using the R-tree, W-tree, R+-tree, and the PMR quadtree. The studied quantities are the time to build the data structure and the time to do the spatial join in an application domain consisting of planar line segment data. Experiments reveal that spatial data structures based on a disjoint decomposition of space and bounding boxes (i.e., the R+tree and the PMR quadtree with bounding boxes) outperform the other structures that are based upon a non-disjoint decomposition (i.e., the R-tree and R*-tree). As the size of the output of the spatial join increases with respect to the larger of the two inputs, methods based on a disjoint regular decomposition (i.e., the PMR quadtree regardless of the presence of bounding boxes) perform significantly better. *This work was supportedin part by the National Science Foundation under Grant IRI-92-16970 and ASC-93-18183, and by a grant from the Computer Research and Applications Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. tAuthorâ€™s current address is Graphic Data Systems Corp., 6200 South Syracuse Way, Englewood CO 80111 Permission to copy without fee all OT part of this material is granted pToviaea that the copies are not made OT ai5tTihtd jOT diTeCt commercial advantage, the VLDB copyright notice and the title of the publication and its date appear, and notice is given that copying is by permission of the Very Large Data Base Endowment.
