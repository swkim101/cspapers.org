On April 23, 1993 a panel discussion was held at the IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering in Vienna, Austria, at which five members of the data base research community discussed future research topics in the DBMS area. This paper summarizes the discussion which took place. The panel followed a similar format to that used at Laguna Beach four years earlier, and four of the five panelists attended the earlier conference. As such, we contrast the recommendations of the Laguna Beach participants with those obtained four years later by a similar group.
