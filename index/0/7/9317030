This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a massive open online course (MOOC) as a professional development tool in higher education. The transition from the MOOC's initial intended use as a low cost way for students to access education and aid their studies has evolved to facilitate continuing professional development (CPD), particularly within the commercial sector [1]. Findings from this study indicate there is an increase in participation and satisfaction amongst higher education staff who undertook a MOOC compared to attending traditional staff development days. Recommendations from this study?s findings highlight that staff were keen to engage with the MOOC format, but felt they needed face-to-face meetings as well to reinforce, contextualize and discuss the key messages of the MOOC. In addition to this, time allocation within workloads should be considered for any future inclusion of MOOCs for staff development.
