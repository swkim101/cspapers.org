StackMap leverages the best aspects of kernel-bypass networking into a new low-latency Linux network service based on the full-featured TCP kernel implementation, by dedicating network interfaces to applications and offering an extended version of the netmap API as a zero-copy, low-overhead data path while retaining the socket API for the control path. For small-message, transactional workloads, StackMap outperforms baseline Linux by 4 to 80% in latency and 4 to 391% in throughput. It also achieves comparable performance with Seastar, a highly-optimized user-level TCP/IP stack for DPDK.
