rakefet@tx.technion.ac.il Kin is an asynchronous processor architecture designed for future technologies enabling one or more billion transistors per chip and extremely fast processing (e.g., as predicted for 2012). This huge resource is exploited for aggressive avid execution, where a large number of instructions (hundreds per cycle) are prefetched and executed speculatively, in order to reduce the penalty of stalls due to branch mispredictions and dependencies, and to yield a very aggressive rate of successfully completed instructions (tens of instructions every cycle). Unneeded instructions are removed efficiently and nonpreemptively, under control of apruning mechanism. A multi-ported, wide bandwidth decoded instruction cache, wherein each line is a program basic block, is employed to feed this voracious machine, and a multi-path prcfetch unit generates multiple cache accesses each cycle. Instructions are fully identified with Dynamic Instance Tags and move about the processor as independent entities. Kin supports multiexecution, where multiple paths, threads and processes are all executed simultaneously out of order. The processor has been designed using statecharts, and has been simulated running the SpecInt95 benchmark. We conclude that such complexity, which seems necessary for very high performance computing, is best achieved with an asynchronous architecture.
