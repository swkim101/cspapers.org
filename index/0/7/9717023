The paper motivates the facilities provided by Description Logics in an object-oriented programming scenario. It presents a unification approach of Description Logics and object-oriented programming that allows both views to be conveniently used for different subproblems in a modern software-engineering environment. The main thesis of this paper is that in order to use Description Logics in practical applications, a seamless integration with object-oriented system development methodologies must be realized.
