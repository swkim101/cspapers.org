Translation validation consists of transforming a program and a posteriori validating it in order to detect a modification of itssemantics. This approach can be used in a verified compiler, provided that validation is formally proved to be correct. We present two such validators and their Coq proofs of correctness. The validators are designed for two instruction scheduling optimizations: list scheduling and trace scheduling.
