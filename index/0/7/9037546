In this paper, we propose a method for referring to the real world to improve named entity recognition (NER) specialized for a domain. Our method adds a stacked autoencoder to a text-based deep neural network for NER. We first train the stacked auto-encoder only from the real world information, then the entire deep neural network from sentences annotated with NEs and accompanied by real world information. In our experiments, we took Japanese chess as the example. The dataset consists of pairs of a game state and commentary sentences about it annotated with gamespecific NE tags. We conducted NER experiments and showed that referring to the real world improves the NER accuracy.
