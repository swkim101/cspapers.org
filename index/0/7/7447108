This paper proposes a new framework of online hybrid control for virtual characters, which combines multi-objective control and motion capture techniques. At each time step, the motions of the operator are captured and sent to the character. These captured motions help the character understand what task the operator wants it to perform. Then, the character decides by itself how to execute proper actions while maintaining its balance, in a virtual environment which is different from the real world. Given a manipulation task, the desired virtual task wrench is computed thanks to a force control approach. The control system takes these task wrenches into consideration and solves a constrained quadratic problem for joint torques, which are then used to drive the virtual character. The whole control problem is solved online so that the virtual character can interact in real-time with the virtual environment as well as the operator. Examples using this control framework are presented as results from simulation.
