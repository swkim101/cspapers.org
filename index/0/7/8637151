This video introduces the demonstration of skillful manipulation using a high-speed robot system. The system consists of visual and tactile sensors at a rate of 1 kHz and a high-speed hand-arm manipulator. The high-speed sensory-motor fusion improves not just the speed of existing robot manipulations, but robotic skills by introducing the features peculiar to high-speed motion. Based on such a concept, new variations of skillful manipulation were achieved.
