Flexible display devices allow users to interact with the device by deforming the surface of the display to trigger a command. When these devices become mainstream, for example as smart phones, e-readers, or tablets, they will require a means of authenticating legitimate users. In this poster, we present an authentication scheme for flexible display devices, its implementation on a flexible display prototype and an ongoing user study evaluating the usability and security of our system.
