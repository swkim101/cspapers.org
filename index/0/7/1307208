To facilitate the creation and usage of custom SMT systems we have created a cloud-based platform for do-it-yourself MT. The platform is developed in the EU collaboration project LetsMT!. This system demonstration paper presents the motivation in developing the LetsMT! platform, its main features, architecture, and an evaluation in a practical use case.
