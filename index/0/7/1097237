Eager is a Programming by Example system for automating repetitive activities. It is connected to the HyperCard program, which runs on Apple@ computers. It enables users to get some of the benefits of programming without having to learn how to write programs. This video presents two repetitive tasks that are automated by the Eager system. The first task is to list the subject headings in a stack of mail messages. The second task extends a stack by duplicating its cards in reverse order. A conference paper in this proceedings entitled “Eager: Programming Repetitive Tasks by Example” provides a more detailed description of this system.
