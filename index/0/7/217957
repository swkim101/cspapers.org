Many people know that Lego Mindstorms are great for teaching a wide range of different computer concepts to students. Some use them to teach programming, engineering, and of course robotics. In September of 2013, Lego released the latest generation of Mindstorms called EV3. This workshop focused on introducing participants on how to use Mindstorms EV3 and what many of the new features of the system are. At the workshop it was mentioned how some people are using this generation of Mindstorms for architecture classes, assembler coding projects, CS0 or CS1 courses, and conducting kids camps for k-12 students. This BOF is designed for people currently using any generation of Mindstorms and for those who are interested in finding out how they might start using Mindstorms in the classroom. The focus of this session will be to encourage people to use Mindstorms EV3 in a variety of different settings. During the BOF, people will have an opportunity to brainstorm new ways to use these tools to help students learn important CS concepts.
