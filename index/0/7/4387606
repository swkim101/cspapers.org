The UniSQL/X unified relational and object--cmented database system is designed to support application development in either a convenuonal host programming Ianguagc (such as C), or an Object-aiented programming language (such as C++ or Smalltalk). In particular, C++ programmers can take advantage of all the capabilities of UniSQL/X in C++ programming style by using the UniSQL/X C++ Interfi~ce. C programmers can access the UniSQL/X database by using the Embedded SQL/X (objectaiented SQL) Preprocessor and/or the UniSQL/X AH (call levcl interface).
