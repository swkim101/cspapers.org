We propose a novel measure of visual similarity for image retrieval that incorporates both structural and aesthetic (style) constraints. Our algorithm accepts a query as sketched shape, and a set of one or more contextual images specifying the desired visual aesthetic. A triplet network is used to learn a feature embedding capable of measuring style similarity independent of structure, delivering significant gains over previous networks for style discrimination. We incorporate this model within a hierarchical triplet network to unify and learn a joint space from two discriminatively trained streams for style and structure. We demonstrate that this space enables, for the first time, styleconstrained sketch search over a diverse domain of digital artwork comprising graphics, paintings and drawings. We also briefly explore alternative query modalities.
