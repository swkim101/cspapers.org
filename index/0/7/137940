From the computer science educators point of view, each of these transitions should be made as rapidly and completely as possible. Here again rises the eternal trade-off: time vs storage. A complete transition requires time, which the student might be reluctant to invest; and a quick transition requires cramming so much information into a short time span that the student cannot absorb it. This paper focuses on this problem as it currently faces us who are “transforming” undergraduate business majors into the ways of computer science. The business major is no slouch that has to be re-tooled, but rather a practically oriented person whose approach to problem analysis has to be reoriented to include a more rigorous approach.
