Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) are computergenerated characters whose purpose is to exhibit the same properties as humans in face-to-face conversation. The general goal of researchers in the field of ECAs is to create agents that can be more natural, believable and easy to use. In this paper, we are interested in increasing believability of ECAs. Specifically, we are interested in making the intentionality of the agent believable regarding actions and reactions that create the impression of an independent entity with goals and, specially, feelings.
