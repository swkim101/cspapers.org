Gene Myers* We describe a multiple-sequence alignment algorithm for determining the highest-scoring alignment that can be obtained by chaining together non-overlapping subalignments selected from a given collection of such ‘Yragments”. For a given set of K sequences, a problem instance consists of a set of F precomputed fragments, an alignment score for each fragment, and a “gap” penalty function that assigns a cost for chaining two fragments together. When interpreted as a maximum weight path problem in a directed acyclic graph, it is computable in 0(F2) time. Here we instead interpret the problem as “K-dimensional sparse dynamic programming” and take advantage of its underlying geometric nature. Assuming K < log F, our algorithm runs in time O(F logK F) and space O(KF logKV1 F), making it the first sub-quadratic sparse dynamic programming algo rithm for the case K > 2.
