This paper describes a combination mechanism of a wheeground a paddle to realize an effective movement on the border of ground and water. For the conventional mobile mechanisms on water or on ground the combination of the mechanism to the body of the robot separately, and each one can be the interruption to the other in each field. In this research, we propose a hybrid mechanism of a wheeground a paddle as drive mechanism itself to realize an effective movement on the border such as a coast with debris after a disaster like a seismic sea wave or a tanker grounding accident. A prototype robot has been built and basic experiments on its motion have been conducted.
