The ARM Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) is a widely used interconnection standard for SoC design. In order to support high-speed pipelined data transfers, AMBA supports a rich set of bus signals, making the analysis of AMBA-based embedded systems a challenging proposition. This paper makes two main contributions to the analysis and evaluation of AMBA-based SoC designs. The first contribution is to provide a method for the performance analysis and evaluation of AMBA-based SoC designs using formal models. This method provides a way to obtain the end-to-end execution bounds of AMBA-based SoC designs, and guarantees the correctness of the results. The second contribution is to use these formal models to prove the functional correctness of the SoC designs. Using our formal models, we were able to uncover an ambiguous case in the AMBA specification that can lead to deadlocks. This case has not been previously documented by methods focused on AMBA protocol verification. Finally, we validate the proposed performance analysis approach by comparing results with a SystemC implementation of a digital camera case study.
