We present a software scheme for protecting the integrity of computing platforms using Timed Executable Agent Systems (TEAS). A trusted challenger issues an authenticated challenge to a perhaps corrupt responder. New is that the issued challenge is an executable program that can potentially compute any function on the responder. The responder must compute not only the correct value implied by the agent, but also must complete this computation within time bounds prescribed by the challenger. Software-based attestation schemes have been proposed before---new capabilities introduced in TEAS provide means to mitigate the existing shortcomings of such proposed techniques. TEAS are general and can be adapted to many applications for which system integrity is to be tested.
