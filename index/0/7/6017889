Ship Design is an iterative process which involves much graphical information and a sizeable amount of computation. Present computer aided design methods fall short of desired effectiveness due to the difficulty of handling graphical input and output. Some work has been done toward exploiting the use of computer driven plotters, CRT's, and digitizers as design aids. Graphic peripherals are relatively expensive, however, and a lack of available resources prompted the author to explore the utilization of the standard line printer in creating various graphical outputs which would be helpful in the design process. A general set of plotting subroutines was developed and these were then incorporated into a system of ship design programs. Applications to date have been found extremely useful.
