This paper presents a theoretical framework for mapping from structure to function in engineering domains. We argue that a generative approach grounded in Qualitative Process Theory produces useful functional explanations. These explanations are articulate, in that they enable the user to explore their theoretical justifications and perform counterfactual reasoning. These explanations stem from a teleological representation based on goals, plans, roles, and views. We show that an ontology based on aggregated processes facilitates the recognition of recurring thermodynamic structures. We describe an implementation of this theory, a system called CARNOT that explains steady-flow thermodynamic cycles ranging in complexity from four to 24 components.
