In this paper, we explore the efficacy of curb-side acoustic sensing to estimate road traffic conditions. We formulated a set of hypotheses which attempted to correlate traffic conditions with the ambient traffic noise. We present the evaluation of our hypotheses under various traffic conditions. Our threshold-based-classification yields 70-90% accuracy in distinguishing congested from free-flowing traffic.
