This paper presents a detailed study of the integration of knowledge from both dependency parses and hierarchical word ontologies into a maximum-entropy-based tagging model that simultaneously labels words with both syntax and semantics. Our findings show that information from both these sources can lead to strong improvements in overall system accuracy: dependency knowledge improved performance over all classes of word, and knowledge of the position of a word in an on-tological hierarchy increased accuracy for words not seen in the training data. The resulting tagger offers the highest reported tagging accuracy on this tagset to date.
