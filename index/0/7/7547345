Realistic robot problems involve navigating the robot through time as well as space. The obstacles that a robot must avoid and the pathways on which it travels are subject to changes throughout time. These changes can occur in a predictable or unpredictable fashion. This paper presents an integrated route planning and spatial representation system that allows paths to be calculated in dynamic domains. The path planner finds the "best route" through a given n-dimensional space. The "best route" is defined as the path through space-time with the best score as determined by a set of user-defined evaluation functions. The algorithm takes into account the following: Capabilities of the robot executing generated plans, traversability of space, and interactions with both predictable and unpredictable dynamic objects. The route planning algorithm is highly parallel and can be run on an SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) machine in 0(p) time, where p is the length of a path. In domains with unpredictable processes, this system may be run in an incremental fashion, allowing the robot to create real-time routes along the optimal path as described by its current information. This paper will discuss: Spatial representation, an SIMD algorithm for route planning in a dynamic domain, and results from an implementation on a traditional computer architecture.
