In this demonstration, we show-case a database management system extended with a new type of component that we call a Data Use Manager (DUM). The DUM enables DBAs to attach policies to data loaded into the DBMS. It then monitors how users query the data, flags potential policy violations, recommends possible fixes, and supports offline analysis of user activities related to data policies. The demonstration uses real healthcare data.
