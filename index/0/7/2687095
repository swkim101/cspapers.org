With the advent of globalisation, automotive companies have turned to increased usage of HPC in all aspects of the vehicle design process, to enable speed-up to market and thus gain an edge. No longer a forensic tool, it is today a "must-have" tool and no area of the engineering process is immune from being subject to HPC simulations. Indeed with greater brute force methods now being adopted, several new challenges are now bubbling up in the HPC arena, such as the flood of simulation data, far-flung enterprises being "connected", dusting off previously shelved computationally expensive algorithms, etc. This BoF will discuss a whole spectrum of issues not being dealt with anywhere in any forum. The BoF will also build upon the success of previous such BoFs by actively encouraging impromptou ideas, unconventional proposals and out-of-the-box solutions being done today by various OEMs.
