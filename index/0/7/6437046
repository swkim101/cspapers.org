In a multi-label text classiﬁcation task, in which multiple labels can be assigned to one text, label co-occurrence itself is informative. We propose a novel neural network initialization method to treat some of the neurons in the ﬁnal hidden layer as dedicated neurons for each pattern of label co-occurrence. These dedicated neurons are initialized to connect to the corresponding co-occurring labels with stronger weights than to others. In experiments with a natural language query classiﬁ-cation task, which requires multi-label clas-siﬁcation, our initialization method improved classiﬁcation accuracy without any computational overhead in training and evaluation.
