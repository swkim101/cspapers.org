In this poster, we describe a personalized search approach, which involves a graph based user profile issued from ontology and a session boundary recognition mechanism. The user profile refers to the short term user interest and is used for re-ranking the search results of queries in the same search session. The session boundary recognition is based on tracking changes in the dominant concepts held by the query and the user profile. Experimental evaluation was carried out using the HARD 2003 TREC collection and shows that our approach is effective.
