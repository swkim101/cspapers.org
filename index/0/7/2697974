Recent years have witnessed increased adoption of hosted hypervisors in virtualized computer systems. By non-intrusively extending commodity OSs, hosted hypervisors can effectively take advantage of a variety of mature and stable features as well as the existing broad user base of commodity OSs. However, virtualizing a computer system is still a rather complex task. As a result, existing hosted hypervisors typically have a large code base (e.g., 33.6K SLOC for KVM), which inevitably introduces exploitable software bugs. Unfortunately, any compromised hosted hypervisor can immediately jeopardize the host system and subsequently affect all running guests in the same physical machine. In this paper, we present a system that aims to dramatically reduce the exposed attack surface of a hosted hypervisor by deprivileging its execution to user mode. In essence, by decoupling the hypervisor code from the host OS and deprivileging its execution, our system demotes the hypervisor mostly as a user-level library, which not only substantially reduces the attack surface (with a much smaller TCB), but also brings additional benefits in allowing for better development and debugging as well as concurrent execution of multiple hypervisors in the same physical machine. To evaluate its effectiveness, we have developed a proof-ofconcept prototype that successfully deprivileges âˆ¼ 93.2% of the loadable KVM module code base in user mode while only adding a small TCB (2.3K SLOC) to the host OS kernel. Additional evaluation results with a number of benchmark programs further demonstrate its practicality and efficiency.
