Inconsistency is a problem with first order predicate calculus theories in which ideas are treated as objects. This paper presents general results on inconsistency, including an interesting restriction on the relation of knowing. A theory having a uniform method of expressing ideas, ideas of ideas, and so on, is sketched. It is shown how to restrict some of the axioms of this theory in order to obtain consistency. The method of obtaining consistency seems to have some generality.
