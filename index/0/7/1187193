In a graph <i>G</i> with non-negative edge lengths, let <i>P</i> be a shortest path from a vertex <i>s</i> to a vertex <i>t</i>. We consider the problem of computing, for each edge <i>e</i> on <i>P</i>, the length of a shortest path in <i>G</i> from <i>s</i> to <i>t</i> that avoids <i>e</i>. This is known as the <i>replacement paths problem</i>. We give a linear-space algorithm with <i>O(n</i> log <i>n</i>) running time for <i>n</i>-vertex planar directed graphs. The previous best time bound was <i>O(n</i> log<sup>2</sup> <i>n</i>).
