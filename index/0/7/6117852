A system of programs has been constructed to process the television image of a hybrid circuit* This system is capable of "inspecting" the circuit image regarding defects. To achieve this a procedural model of the circuit is developed. The computer "sees" the image and interprets what It sees with the procedures in the model. In this manner it is able to determine certain Important characteristics of the image in its view. It appears that this procedural approach can be useful to many domains of visual image processing and object recognition.
