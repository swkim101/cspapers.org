Most of the previous sparse coding (SC) based super resolution (SR) methods partition the image into overlapped patches, and process each patch separately. These methods, however, ignore the consistency of pixels in overlapped patches, which is a strong constraint for image reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a convolutional sparse coding (CSC) based SR (CSC-SR) method to address the consistency issue. Our CSC-SR involves three groups of parameters to be learned: (i) a set of filters to decompose the low resolution (LR) image into LR sparse feature maps, (ii) a mapping function to predict the high resolution (HR) feature maps from the LR ones, and (iii) a set of filters to reconstruct the HR images from the predicted HR feature maps via simple convolution operations. By working directly on the whole image, the proposed CSC-SR algorithm does not need to divide the image into overlapped patches, and can exploit the image global correlation to produce more robust reconstruction of image local structures. Experimental results clearly validate the advantages of CSC over patch based SC in SR application. Compared with state-of-the-art SR methods, the proposed CSC-SR method achieves highly competitive PSNR results, while demonstrating better edge and texture preservation performance.
