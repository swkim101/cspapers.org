A large part of Web resources consists of unstructuredtextual content. Processing and retrieving relevant contentfor a particular information need is challenging for both ma-chines as well as humans. While information retrieval tech-niques provide methods for detecting suitable resources fora particular query, information extraction (IE) techniquesenable the extraction of structured data [2, 3] and text sum-marization allows the detection of important sentences [1,5]. However, neither IE nor summarization techniques doconsider user interests when generating text summaries au-tomatically.This work presents an approach to extract focused knowl-edge, i.e. query-based and structured summaries accordingto particular user queries. In our case, summaries consistof structured data describing entities and their appearancecontexts.For identifying relevant statements and entities, we exploita novel approach based on POS pattern analysis and entityrecognition techniques.
