This work introduces a walking pattern generator suitable for humanoids with inherent joint compliance. The proposed walking pattern generator computes the desired center of mass (COM) references on-line based on the COM state feedback. The position and velocity of the COM are the feedback variables, and the constraint ground reaction force (GRF), which is limited by the support polygon, is the control effort to drive the COM states to track the desired ones. The zero moment point (ZMP) is obtained naturally as a result of GRF interaction with robot feet. The proposed COM tracking scheme demands a lower bandwidth from the controller compared to the ZMP tracking schemes. Experimental data of the real compliant humanoid, such as ZMP, COM motion, and GRF are presented to demonstrate the validation of the proposed gait generation method.
