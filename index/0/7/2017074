Grasping systems that build upon meticulously planned hand postures rely on precise knowledge of object geometry, mass and frictional properties - assumptions which are often violated in practice. In this work, we propose an alternative solution to the problem of grasp acquisition in simple autonomous pick and place scenarios, by utilizing the concept of grasp envelopes: sets of constraints on gripper postures. We propose a fast method for extracting grasp envelopes for objects that fit within a known shape category, placed in an unknown environment. Our approach is based on grasp envelope primitives, which encode knowledge of human grasping strategies. We use environment models, reconstructed from noisy sensor observations, to refine the grasp envelope primitives and extract bounded envelopes of collision-free gripper postures. Also, we evaluate the envelope extraction procedure both in a stand alone fashion, as well as an integrated component of an autonomous picking system.
