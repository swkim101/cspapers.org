As a promising formulation to represent and reason about agents' dynamic behavious, logic program updates have been considerably studied recently. While similarities and differences between various approaches were discussed and evaluated by researchers, there is a lack of method to represent different logic program update approaches under a common framework. In this paper, we continue our study on a general framework for logic program conflict solving based on notions of strong and weak forgettings (Zhang, Foo, & Wang 2005). We show that all major logic program update approaches can be transformed into our framework, under which each update approach becomes a specific conflict solving case with certain constraints. We also investigate related computational properties for these transformations.
