Service order provisioning is an important telecommunication application that automates the process of providing telephone services in response to the customer requests. It is an example of a multi-system application that requires access to multiple, independently developed application systems and their databases. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a prototype system1 that supports the execution of the Flexible Transactions and its use to develop the service order provisioning application. We argue that such approach may be used to support the development of multi-system, flow-through processing applications in a systematic and organized manner. Its advantages include fast and easy specification of new services, support for testing of the declaratively specified work-flows, and the specification of potential concurrency among the tasks constituting an application.
