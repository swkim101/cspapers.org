An exciting outcome of research at the inter-section of language and vision is that of zero-shot learning (ZSL). ZSL promises to scale visual recognition by borrowing distributed semantic models learned from linguistic corpora and turning them into visual recognition models. However the popular word-vector DSM embeddings are relatively impoverished in their expressivity as they model each word as a single vector point. In this paper we explore word-distribution embeddings for ZSL. We present a visual-linguistic mapping for ZSL in the case where words and visual categories are both represented by distributions. Experiments show improved results on ZSL benchmarks due to this better exploiting of intra-concept variability in each modality
