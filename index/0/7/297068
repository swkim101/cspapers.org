Effectively exploring and analyzing large text corpora requires visualizations that provide a high level summary. Past work has relied on faceted browsing of document metadata or on natural language processing of document text. In this paper, we present a new web-based tool that integrates topics learned from an unsupervised topic model in a faceted browsing experience. The user can manage topics, filter documents by topic and summarize views with metadata and topic graphs. We report a user study of the usefulness of topics in our tool.
