In this paper, we propose a novel walking method for torque controlled robots. The method is able to produce a wide range of speeds without requiring off-line optimizations and re-tuning of parameters. We use a quadratic whole-body optimization method running online which generates joint torques, given desired Cartesian accelerations of center of mass and feet. Using a dynamics model of the robot inside this optimizer, we ensure both compliance and tracking, required for fast locomotion. We have designed a foot-step planner that uses a linear inverted pendulum as simplified robot internal model. This planner is formulated as a quadratic convex problem which optimizes future steps of the robot. Fast libraries help us performing these calculations online. With very few parameters to tune and no perception, our method shows notable robustness against strong external pushes, relatively large terrain variations, internal noises, model errors and also delayed communication.
