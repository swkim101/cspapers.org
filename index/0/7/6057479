We consider the problem of determining the maximum number N(m, k, r) of columns of a O-l-matrix with m rows and exactly r ones in each column such that every k columns are linearly independent over Zs. For fixed integers k>4 and r>2 where k is even and gcd(k-1, r) = 1, we prove the probabilistic lower bound N(m, k, r) = R(m* . (In m) A). This improves on earlier results from [13] by the factor O((lnm)k--l). Moreover, we describe a polynomial time algorithm achieving this new lower bound.
