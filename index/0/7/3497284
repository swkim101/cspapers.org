Despite software engineering's inherently collaborative nature, collaboration with others hasn't been the primary way for students to learn how to program. Although various collaboration frameworks, such as Git, are widely used in software engineering, they've been treated as separate skills to acquire in addition to learning programming languages, rather than ways of learning, working, and thinking while learning to program. One collaborative software development task that students often want to engage in is building websites. However, the complexity of web syntax and architecture has been a hurdle in teaching and learning web design and development, especially for beginners without sufficient technical background. Specifically, syntactic barriers in several different languages for a webpage, inherent coupling of content and design in HTML, difficulty in understanding server-client model, and need for hosting resources for deployment contribute to a steep learning curve in building websites "from scratch". This work aims to address these issues by developing GLIDE (Git-Learning Integrated Development Environment) - a set of tools and curriculum that support in-class collaborative development in web engineering courses. GLIDE structures the website development process as a teacher-guided Git workflow for a team of students collaborating in groups in a Git repository. The application also provides a web programming model that separates content, from design, from implementation, allowing students to take on different roles and responsibilities during the development process. This demo presents a tutorial on how a group of students can build websites collaboratively with teacher's assistance based on the GLIDE software platform and curriculum.
