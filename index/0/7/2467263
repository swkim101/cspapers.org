We address the problem of reachability analysis for large finite state systems. Symbolic techniques have revolutionized reachability analysis but still have limitations in traversing large systems. We present techniques to improve the symbolic breadth-first traversal and compute a lower bound on the reachable states. We identify the problem as one of density during traversal and our techniques seek to improve the same. Our results show a marked improvement on the existing breadth-first traversal methods.
