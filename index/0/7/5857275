A key characteristic of a successful online market is the large participation of agents (producers and consumers) on both sides of the market. While there has been a long line of impressive work on understanding such markets in terms of revenue maximizing (also called max-sum) objectives, particularly in the context of allocating online impressions to interested advertisers, fairness considerations have surprisingly not received much attention in online allocation algorithms. Allocations that are inherently fair to participating entities, we believe, will contribute significantly to retaining current participants and attracting new ones in the long run, thereby enhancing the performance of online markets. We give two generic online allocation algorithms to address this problem. In the first algorithm, we address the max-min fairness objective which is defined as the minimum ratio among all advertisers of the actual revenue obtained by the allocation to given target revenues. The second algorithm considers a hybrid objective of max-sum with a revenue penalty for each advertiser who misses her revenue target. We consider a penalty that is linear in the difference between the target and the actual revenue. For both these objectives, we give online algorithms that achieve a competitive ratio of $(1-\epsilon)$ for any $\epsilon > 0$ assuming an IID input.
