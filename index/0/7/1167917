A Location Based Service (LBS) is a service where knowledge of the location of an object or individual is used to personalise the service. Typical examples include the E911 emergency location service in the US and 'Where is the nearest xx' type of services. However, since these services often may be implemented in a way that exposes sensitive personal information, there are several privacy issues to consider. A key question is: "Who should have access to what location information under which circumstances?It is our view that individuals should be equipped with tools to become in the position to formulate their own personal location privacy policies, subject to applicable rules and regulations.This paper identifies concepts that may be useful when formulating such policies. The key concept is that of an observation of a located object. An observation typically includes the location, the identity of the object, the time the observation was made and the speed of the object. The idea is that the individual should be able to adjust the accuracy at which these observations are released depending on parameters such as the intended use and the identity of the recipient.We provide fragments of a language for formulating personal location privacy policies and give some small examples illustrating the kind of policies that we have in mind.
