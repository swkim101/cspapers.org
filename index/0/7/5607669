We define a method to estimate the random and systematic errors resulting from incomplete relevance assessments.Mean Average Precision (MAP) computed over a large number of topics with a shallow assessment pool substantially outperforms -- for the same adjudication effort MAP computed over fewer topics with deeper pools, and P@k computed with pools of the same depth. Move-to-front pooling,previously reported to yield substantially better rank correlation, yields similar power, and lower bias, compared tofixed-depth pooling.
