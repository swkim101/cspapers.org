To highlight a potential threat to hardware security, we propose a methodology to derive a trigger signal from the behavior of Verilog simulation models of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) primitives that behave X-optimistic. We demonstrate our methodology with an example trigger that is implemented using Xilinx 7 Series FPGAs. Experimental results show that it is easily possible to create a trigger signal that is ‘0’ in simulation (pre- and post-synthesis), and ‘1’ in hardware. We show that this kind of trigger is neither detectable by formal equivalence checks, nor by recent Trojan detection techniques. As a countermeasure, we propose to carefully reconsider the utilization of X-optimism in FPGA simulation models.
