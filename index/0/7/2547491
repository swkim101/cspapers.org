This paper introduces CPE, the CIRCE Plugin for Eclipse. The CPE adds to the open-source development environment Eclipse the ability of writing and analysing software requirements written in natural language. Models of the software described by the requirements can be examined on-line during the requirements writing process. Initial UML models and skeleton Java code can be generated from the requirements, and imported into Eclipse for further editing and analysis.
