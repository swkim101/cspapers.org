This work focuses on creating a framework for objectively evaluating the performance of range image segmentation algorithms. The algorithms are evaluated in terms of correct segmentation, over- and under-segmentation, missed and noise regions. A set of images with ground truth was created for this work. The images were captured using a structured light scanner. Images used in the evaluation contain planar, spherical, cylindrical, toroidal and conical surface patches. The different surface patches in each image were manually identified to establish ground truth for performance evaluation. Two segmentation algorithms from the literature are compared.
