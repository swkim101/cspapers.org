Broadly speaking, my research concerns combining logic of action and POMDP theory in a coherent, theoretically sound language for agent programming. We have already developed a logic for specifying partially observable stochastic domains. A logic for reasoning with the models specified must still be developed. An agent programming language will then be developed and used to design controllers for robots.
