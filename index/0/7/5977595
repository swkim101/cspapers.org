For the standardization of Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) 2.0, we proposed the functions specific to i-mode HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to the WAP Forum. As a result, we were able to assure the functional compatibility between the WAP 2.0 markup language and i-mode HTML. In order to technically verify the functional compatibility of the WAP 2.0 with i-mode HTML, we conducted the experiment on an automatic content transformation between both markup languages, using XSLT. This paper discusses the experiment results.
