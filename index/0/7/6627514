Network community detection--the problem of dividing a network of interest into clusters for intelligent analysis--has recently attracted significant attention in diverse fields of research. To discover intrinsic community structure a quantitative measure called modularity has been widely adopted as an optimization objective. Unfortunately, modularity is inherently NP-hard to optimize and approximate solutions must be sought if tractability is to be ensured. In practice, a spectral relaxationmethod is most often adopted, after which a community partition is recovered from relaxed fractional values by a rounding process. In this paper, we propose an iterative rounding strategy for identifying the partition decisions that is coupled with a fast constrained power method that sequentially achieves tighter spectral relaxations. Extensive evaluation with this coupled relaxation-rounding method demonstrates consistent and sometimes dramatic improvements in the modularity of the communities discovered.
