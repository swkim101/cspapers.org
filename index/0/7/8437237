The parietal cortex is thought to represent the egocentric positions of objects in particular coordinate systems. We propose an alternative approach to spatial perception of objects in the parietal cortex from the perspective of sensorimotor transformations. The responses of single parietal neurons can be modeled as a gaussian function of retinal position multiplied by a sigmoid function of eye position, which form a set of basis functions. We show here how these basis functions can be used to generate receptive fields in either retinotopic or head-centered coordinates by simple linear transformations. This raises the possibility that the parietal cortex does not attempt to compute the positions of objects in a particular frame of reference but instead computes a general purpose representation of the retinal location and eye position from which any transformation can be synthesized by direct projection. This representation predicts that hemineglect, a neurological syndrome produced by parietal lesions, should not be confined to egocentric coordinates, but should be observed in multiple frames of reference in single patients, a prediction supported by several experiments.
