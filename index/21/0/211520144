Many SIGCSE attendees bring what they learn at SIGCSE back to their colleagues. In our well attended Special Sessions at SIGCSE in 2018 and 2019, attendees learned to respond to bias, which might be more difficult to bring back to their colleagues. This workshop will prepare attendees to lead interactive-sessions about responding to bias at their institution or at other conferences. The workshop will begin by modeling an interactive-session with updated materials from SIGCSE 2019. The workshop attendees will then explore facilitation strategies, ways of managing difficult conversations, and all attendee concerns. All attendees will receive printed copies of the game (csteachingtips.org/cards) to use at their institution or to local conferences.
