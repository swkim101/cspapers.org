Have you been asked to teach online and don't know how to get started? Have you delivered your course online to mixed reviews? Have you been teaching online for years? As more and more courses are begin offered online in an effort to deliver a quality education to a larger, more diverse group of students, one things is clear -- many of the pedagogical practices that we have come to rely on in our on ground courses do not translate to an online course. How do the on best practices in online education adapt to CS? This BOF will provide a platform for discussion of what it means to teach an instructor-led, asynchronous online course in CS. We will discuss methodologies used by online faculty that were particularly successful in helping students learn. Topics may include designing courses for distance learning, using media and technology tools effectively, engaging the online learner, building community among students, motivating student persistence and success, and/or building an online presence.
