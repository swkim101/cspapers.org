We present the results of a course on privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) given by undergraduate students in the group we coordinate to a group of non-technical population, focusing on the attitude changes observed in the participants. This work was done as part of the UNAM/DGAPA/PAPIME PE102718 project, where we aim at explaining in a clear, simple language the need for PETs, dispelling the overwhelming perception that privacy and anonymity are unattainable for theregular user. The presented study is based on three applications of the survey completed by our first cohort.
