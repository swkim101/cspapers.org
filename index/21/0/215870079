Online Social Network (OSN) Users’ demand to increase their account popularity has driven the creation of an underground ecosystem that provides services or techniques to help users manipulate content curation algorithms. One method of subversion that has recently emerged occurs when users form groups, called pods, to facilitate reciprocity abuse, where each member reciprocally interacts with content posted by other members of the group. We collect 1.8 million Instagram posts that were posted in pods hosted on Telegram. We first summarize the properties of these pods and how they are used, uncovering that they are easily discoverable by Google search and have a low barrier to entry. We then create two machine learning models for detecting Instagram posts that have gained interaction through two different kinds of pods, achieving 0.91 and 0.94 AUC, respectively. Finally, we find that pods are effective tools for increasing users’ Instagram popularity, we estimate that pod utilization leads to a significantly increased level of likely organic comment interaction on users’ subsequent posts.
