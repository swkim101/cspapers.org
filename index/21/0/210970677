This study is designed to validate the feasibility of generating identifiable moving patterns using electro-tactile stimulation. An electro-tactile display is built using an array of 16 contacts to deliver the electrical signal to the fingertip skin. This signal can have varying voltages, frequencies or duty cycles to form the most comfortable sensation.Moving patterns can be generated by individually or collectively switching on or off the contacts on the display. This is done to stimulate a moving pattern. In this case, a moving pattern is comparable to a group of frame-by-frame pictures constructing a movie. Similarly, by toggling the contacts in a specific order, a moving pattern can be achieved.A program on a single-board computer (Raspberry Pi) was used to control and generate 6 different patterns. These patterns are delivered to the display and consequently to the fingertip skin of the participants. A total of 8 subjects participated in this study. They filled a questionnaire to indicate the corresponding movement.The results of these experiments were analyzed and a conclusion regarding the direction of the movement was drawn. It became clear that the direction of the movement had a significant impact on the recognition of the patterns.
