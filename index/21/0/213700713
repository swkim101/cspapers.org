Received Apr 23, 2019 Revised Jul 5, 2019 Accepted Oct 6, 2019 In this paper, an identification method is proposed to determine the nonlinear systems parameters. The proposed nonlinear systems can be described by Wiener systems. This structure of models consists of series of linear dynamic element and a nonlinearity block. Both the linear and nonlinear parts are nonparametric. In particular, the linear subsystem of structure entirely unknown. The considered nonlinearity function is of hard type. This latter can have a dead zone or with preload. These nonlinear systems have been confirmed by several practical applications. The suggested approach involves easily generated excitation signals.
