We propose CAP’NN, a framework for Class-Aware Personalized Neural Network Inference. CAP’NN prunes an already-trained neural network model based on the preferences of individual users. Specifically, by adapting to the subset of output classes that each user is expected to encounter, CAP’NN is able to prune not only ineffectual neurons but also miseffectual neurons that confuse classification, without the need to retrain the network. CAP’NN achieves up to 50% model size reduction while actually improving the top-l(5) classification accuracy by up to 2.3%(3.2%) when the user only encounters a subset of VGG-16 classes.
