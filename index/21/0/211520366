In anticipation of an ABET accreditation visit, our computer science department contracted with an independent external testing organization to perform an assessment of our students' proficiency in computer science. We used this external assessment to supplement our own internal assessment. The exam was easy to administer and covered multiple student outcomes. In addition, our analysis of the exam results showed high correlation between course performance and exam performance.
