What students are supposed to learn from computing education is a fundamental question for curriculum design. Based on 1,462 articles we extracted from Web of Science, Eric, and Jstor, we performed a keyword analysis and case analysis so as to answer this question. The findings indicate that problem-solving, collaboration skills, and creativity are the common goals identified in computing education, while students' improvements of abstraction, inclusiveness, and self-efficacy are rarely studied by educators. By comparing this result to the learning objectives defined by curriculum standards, we identified a gap between the current common practices in school and the visions provided by the standards. We also summarized some best practices of improving students' multiple competences through computing education.
