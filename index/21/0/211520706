The model curriculum used to develop, update, and assess IS programs (IS2010) is now nearly a decade old, and an assessment of the curriculum itself indicates that its value is decreasing due to the changing technological and skills demands in the information systems environment. Therefore, the ACM and AIS established an Exploratory Task Force that assessed IS2010 and recommended a taskforce be created to update the content and structure for a new model curriculum. One recurring theme is that current graduates' technical skills do not appear to meet industry needs. The IS discipline must express its core in terms of a standard curriculum to provide a foundation upon which to develop and offer undergraduate IS programs that meet stakeholder demands. A taskforce on the Information Systems Model Curriculum (IS2020) was created following the report and recommendation of the Exploratory Taskforce. This panel seeks to introduce the work of this taskforce as well as engage the IS education community in this effort. Panelists will introduce key components of this process and seek input and feedback. This session should be of interest to all attendees, especially faculty developing college-level curricula in Information Systems.
