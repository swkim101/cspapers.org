Research-practice partnerships (RPPs) are a promising strategy for tackling persistent problems of practice and building knowledge about practices that may promote equity in computer science. Education Development Center (EDC) and New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) are engaged in an RPP to enhance and study the implementation of high school Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles (CSP) courses in low-performing NYC schools. The objectives of this partnership are: sustained implementation of AP CSP courses in low-performing NYC high schools; greater participation of female students and students from racial and ethnic groups (URG) typically underrepresented in CS; and the integration of findings across NYCDOE's K-12 CS4All initiative. The partnership is studying and iteratively refining teacher and school supports, such as professional development (PD) and curriculum resources, school-based supports, and resources for school leaders, developed for and with low-performing schools. We hope to contribute knowledge of the curriculum, PD, and school supports that promote success for all students. The impact of the proposed work has implications for low-performing NYC high schools, and for schools nationwide that offer AP CSP. Administrators, teachers, developers, and policymakers can use these findings to promote AP CSP implementation supports for teachers and schools that show promise for improving student outcomes.
