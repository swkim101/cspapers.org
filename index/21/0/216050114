Nowadays, rapid urbanization leads to severe urban challenges, e.g., congestion and energy consumption, related to human mobility. To address them, it is essential to (i) measure and predict human mobility based on data from urban infrastructure, and (ii) intervene and alter human mobility with novel services on urban infrastructure, i.e., a Cyber-Physical System approach. However, both existing mobility models and resultant services are built upon the interaction of residents with single infrastructure (e.g., taxis) or multiple infrastructures from single domains (e.g., transportation), which are limited by their homogeneous nature. Fortunately, cross-domain infrastructures and their data from the latest infrastructure expansion enable us to explore real-time interactions between residents and infrastructures across domains. In this talk, we will introduce some of our recent work under cross-domain interactions.
