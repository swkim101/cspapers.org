Broadening participation in computing ensures that a diversity of perspectives are involved in creating new technologies. Yet despite initiatives aimed at bringing more diverse groups into computer science as a discipline, underrepresented groups are still under threat to be crowded out of formal computing spaces. However, there are informal spaces where these populations engage in computational projects, learning computing skills outside of traditional academic or industry computing spaces. One such space is transformative fandom. We propose exploring how people in transformative fandom innovate and transform technologies, with an emphasis on their involvement in computational projects by and for marginalized communities.
