The lack of effective guidelines for assessing students' computer science (CS) competencies is creating significant demand by K-12 teachers for CS assessments to evaluate students' learning. We propose a conceptual assessment framework that guides teachers through designing appropriate assessments for computer science (CS) activities in their classrooms. The framework addresses the critical problem of incorporating CS into K-12 curricula without corresponding assessments. We illustrate its use with the design of a rubric for a bubble sort algorithm situated in a game-based learning environment for middle-grade students. We also apply a preliminary and a revised version of this assessment on two datasets collected from students' interactions with the learning environment. We found consistency among results identified through applying the preliminary and the revised rubric. The results reveal distinctive patterns in students' approaches to CS problem solving and coherency with respect to different aspects of the rubric.*
