With the rapid rise in variety of available smartphones today and their rich sensing capabilities, there is an increasing interest in using mobile sensing in large-scale experiments and commercial applications. Motivated by the lack of a universal, multi-platform library, in this paper we present SensingKit, an efficient, open-source, client-server system that supports both iOS and Android mobile devices. SensingKit is capable of continuous sensing the device's motion (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer), location (GPS) and proximity to other smartphones (Bluetooth Smart). The data are temporarily saved to the device's memory and transmitted to a server for further analysis over any Internet connection. We believe that this platform will be beneficial to all researchers and developers who need to perform mobile sensing in their applications and experiments.
