Current perception systems mostly require direct line of sight to anticipate and ultimately prevent potential collisions at intersections with other road users. We present a fully integrated autonomous system capable of detecting shadows or weak illumination changes on the ground caused by a dynamic obstacle in NLoS scenarios. This additional virtual sensor “ShadowCam” extends the signal range utilized so far by computer-vision ADASs. We show that (1) our algorithm maintains the mean classification accuracy of around 70% even when it doesn’t rely on infrastructure – such as AprilTags - as an image registration method. We validate (2) in real-world experiments that our autonomous car driving in night time conditions detects a hidden approaching car earlier with our virtual sensor than with the front facing 2-D LiDAR.
