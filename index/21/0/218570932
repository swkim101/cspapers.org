The relational width of a finite structure, if bounded, is always (1, 1) or (2, 3). In this paper we study the relational width of first-order expansions of finitely bounded homogeneous binary cores where binary cores are structures with equality and some anti-reflexive binary relations such that for any two different elements a, b in the domain there is exactly one binary relation R with (a, b) Ïµ R. Our main result is that first-order expansions of liberal finitely bounded homogeneous binary cores with bounded strict width have relational width (2, MaxBound) where MaxBound is the size of the largest forbidden substructure, but is not less than 3, and liberal stands for structures that do not forbid certain finite structures of small size. This result is built on a new approach and concerns a broad class of structures including reducts of homogeneous digraphs for which the CSP complexity classification has not yet been obtained.
