There are many different driver assistance systems that help the driver controlling their vehicle. These systems do not have full control of the car; however, there are more and more systems in development that take over individual driving functions completely. We are working towards a fully autonomous future. The goal is not only to transport people to their desired destination, but to make commuting on roads safer. Navigation is one of the essential tasks of autonomous driving. The software must independently calculate a route from its current location to the destination. If the vehicle is not guided precisely through the road network, it can never reach that destination. To cope with the problem, the data of the road network must be available to the vehicle. Based on this data, the vehicle must be able to calculate a route to its destination. This paper deals with the development of a navigation algorithm, for optimal path planning, within the framework of an industrial project. The various requirements for the realization of a navigation system are listed. Solution strategies of such systems are identified and compared. Based on this, approaches for solving the task are developed and implemented.
