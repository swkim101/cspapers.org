Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) is emerging as a sub-field of AI to support the automation of long-tail processes which requires the coordination of tasks across different systems. So far, the field of IPA has been largely driven by systems and use cases, lacking a more formal definition of the task and its assessment. This paper aims to address this gap by providing a formalisation of IPA and by proposing specific metrics to support the empirical evaluation of IPA systems. This work also compares and contrasts IPA against related tasks such as end-user programming and program synthesis.
