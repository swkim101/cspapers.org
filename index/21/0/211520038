In the race to teach programming to large, diverse audiences, low-level topics have received short shrift. We address this gap by presenting two ("10") games we have designed - one a card game, the other an online game - to help students learn both binary manipulation and operations. These two games stand out from existing computer science 'edutainment' through their novel presentation and unique take on topics that are relatively unexplored in games.
