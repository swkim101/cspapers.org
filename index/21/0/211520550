Program2Play is a web-based initiative that teaches learners to program through gameplay. Program2Play games generally have two versions for each game. One game can be played by using a mouse or arrow keys, depending on the type of user interaction required. This version demonstrates the desired functionality of the game. The second game is identical to the first game except there are programming instructions missing from the first which the user must supply for the game to function correctly. The user can then test the programming instructions by playing the second version of the game and observing the results of the inserted instructions. Because learners code a small portion of a game, they can see the result of their efforts quickly in an exciting context. Also, by coding a subset of the game the sources of error are greatly reduced, enhancing the likelihood of a successful learning experience. The initial games target relatively simple, yet powerful instructions. For example, learners are asked to code the instruction that moves a bee in the game so that it avoids a dragonfly and reaches the honeycomb. The simplicity and power of an instruction like, bee.x += value, can be experienced in the context of an animation loop. This pedagogical approach encourages experimentation with programming instructions. Program2Play is suited for beginning programmers and programmers who may need additional learning experiences or motivation. Program2Play can be used in high schools or to help remediate deficient programming skills for first-year students.
