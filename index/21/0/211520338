In 2017 the Advanced Placement CS Principles course had the most successful launch of any AP course in history. In its first three years more than 220,000 students have sat for the exam and the course has successfully increased participation among women and other traditionally underrepresented groups in AP computer science. Like any breadth-first CS course the AP CSP curriculum requires regular updating and in this panel we will discuss changes coming for the 2020 academic year. We will share perspectives from the College Board and higher education faculty with the goal of providing audience members a better understanding of the nature of the course's first round of updates and the motivation behind them.
