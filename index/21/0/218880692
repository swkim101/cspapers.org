Search applications such as image search, app search and product search are crucial parts of web search, which we denote as vertical search services. This tutorial will introduce the research and applications of user behavior modeling for vertical search. The bulk of the tutorial is devoted to covering research into behavior patterns, user behavior models and applications of user behavior data to refine evaluation metrics and ranking models for web-based vertical search.
