This panel will provide practical advice on what and how to teach accessibility in a variety of settings. In this context, teaching accessibility means teaching about computer technologies that people with various disabilities can use and be productive with. At the undergraduate level it could mean teaching about how to design and build accessible web sites and applications. At the graduate level it could be teaching about building applications that can help people with disabilities with specific tasks. An entire course could focus on accessibility or it could be just part of an existing course. It is also important to learn about the diversity of consumers of technologies: what their abilities are and what access infrastructures they use every day. All the panelists have extensive experience in teaching accessibility. They will provide the audience of the panel deep insights into what they might do to teach accessibility in their own courses.
