In dynamic systems, liveness properties concern whether something good will eventually happen. Examples of liveness properties are termination of programs and goal achievability. In this paper, we consider the following theorem-proving problem: given an action theory and a goal, check whether the goal is achievable in every model of the action theory. We make the assumption that there are finitely many non-number objects. We propose to use mathematical induction to address this problem: we identify a natural number feature and prove by mathematical induction that for any values of the feature, the goal is achievable. Both the basis and induction steps are verified using first-order theorem provers. We propose a simple method to identify potential features which are the number of objects satisfying a certain formula by generating small models of the action theory and calling a classical planner to achieve the goal. We also propose to regress the goal via different actions and then verify whether the resulting goals are achievable. We implemented the proposed method and experimented with the blocks world domain and a number of other domains from the literature. Experimental results showed that most goals can be verified within a reasonable amount of time.
