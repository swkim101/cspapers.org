This work aims to enable persistent, event-driven sensing and decision capabilities for energy-harvesting (EH)-powered devices by deploying lightweight DNNs onto EH-powered devices. However, harvested energy is usually weak and unpredictable and even lightweight DNNs take multiple power cycles to finish one inference. To eliminate the indefinite long wait to accumulate energy for one inference and to optimize the accuracy, we developed a power trace-aware and exit-guided network compression algorithm to compress and deploy multi-exit neural networks to EH-powered microcontrollers (MCUs) and select exits during execution according to available energy. The experimental results show superior accuracy and latency compared with state-of-the-art techniques.
