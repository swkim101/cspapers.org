The DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) standard allows clients and servers to establish a TLS connection without relying on trusted third parties like CAs by publishing TLSA records. DANE uses the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) PKI to achieve integrity and authenticity. However, DANE can only work correctly if each principal in its PKI properly performs its duty: through their DNSSEC-aware DNS servers, DANE servers (e.g., SMTP servers) must publish their TLSA records, which are consistent with their certiﬁcates. Similarly, DANE clients (e.g., SMTP clients) must verify the DANE servers’ TLSA records, which are also used to validate the fetched certiﬁcates. DANE is rapidly gaining popularity in the email ecosystem, to help improve transport security between mail servers. Yet its security beneﬁts hinge on deploying DANE correctly. In this paper we perform a large-scale, longitudinal, and comprehensive measurement study on how well the DANE standard and its relevant protocols are deployed and managed. We collect data for all second-level domains under the .com , .net , .org , .nl , and .se TLDs over a period of 24 months to analyze server-side deployment and management. To analyse the client-side deployment and management, we investigate 29 popular email service providers, and four popular MTA and eleven DNS software programs. Our study reveals pervasive mismanagement in the DANE ecosystem. For instance, we found that 35% of TLSA records cannot be validated due to missing or incorrect DNSSEC records, and 3.68% of them are inconsistent with their certiﬁcates. We also found that only four email service providers support DANE for both outgoing and
