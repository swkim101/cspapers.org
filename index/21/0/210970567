We develop a novel cube-shaped finger-wearable haptic interface named as HaptiCube. With the aim of implementing the tactile device with improved functionality and wearability, we focus on designing the device to have two characteristics: multi-DOF force feedback displayability and large force capability with compact and lightweight structure. In designing the device, we mainly consider the type and configuration of actuator and driving mechanism, since both have a great effect on the size, weight, and output force of the device. As the actuator, we select the shape memory alloy exhibiting high energy density. And, as the driving mechanism, two different types of compliant mechanism are designed for two important functions: to convert contraction of the SMA to the desired motion as a motion guide and to apply bias-force to the SMA as a bias-spring. The device is designed as the miniature interface that can display 3-DOF pressure and 2-DOF shearing force to userâ€™s fingerpad. And, it is implemented as the functional prototype with the total weight of 26 g including actuators and all mechanical components. The experimental results on working performances (e.g. stroke, output force, and bandwidth) demonstrate that the device has superiority in terms of multi-DOF displayability, compact-sizability and wearability.
