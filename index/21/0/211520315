The Structured Query Language (SQL) is powerful, prevalent across many problem domains, and challenging to master. Sophisticated information requests require programmers to set aside familiar procedural and functional modes of thought. Instead, programmers must learn how to apply unfamiliar set-based relational manipulation rules. This paper analyzes the student learning process in an introductory database course. We do this using detailed analysis of problem-solving attempts by 114 students related to 116 SQL lab exercises assigned over a five-week period. We measure student success rates in mastering these SQL concepts, as well as effort expended by students in solving information retrieval problems.
