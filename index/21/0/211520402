Pair Programming is often employed in educational settings as a means of promoting collaboration and scaffolding the assignment difficulty for teams. While much research supports its inclusion as a pedagogical practice at the university level, some research has demonstrated in K-12 contexts, it can potentially lead to inequitable learning enviroments and create dynamics between partners that might negatively effect novice learners. New block-based programming environments like Netsblox have attempted to address this by creating ways for both partners to program simultaneously, but this feature has yet to be examined in detail. In this paper, we introduce several modes of Collaboration afforded by Netsblox. This includes Pair-Separate, Pair-Together, and Partner Puzzles - a mode that Splits the necessary blocks to build the assignment between team members. From an initial pilot study involving 25 pairs of middle and high school students, we find that most pairs preferred working on assignments in the Partner Puzzle mode as it presented a fun challenge to teams. We end on recommendations for building assignments using this methodology and future research directions investigating the role of collaboration in programming
