In this paper, we address the visibility-based target tracking problem in which a mobile observer moving along a p-route, which we define as a fixed path for target tracking, tries to keep a mobile target in its field-of-view. By drawing a connection to the watchmanâ€™s route problem, we find a set of conditions that must be satisfied by the p-route. Then we propose a metric for tracking to estimate a sufficient speed for the observer given the geometry of the environment. We show that the problem of finding the p-route on which the observer requires minimum speed is computationally intractable. We present a technique to find a p-route on which the observer needs at most twice the minimum speed to track the intruder and a reactive motion strategy for the observer.
