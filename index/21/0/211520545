Many undergraduates who pursue a major in Computer Science (CS) at rural universities identify themselves as first-generation students. There is a large body of research that confirms first-generation students are more likely to switch from CS to a different major, or leave their university completely within the first year. In response, this study explored the challenges that first-generation students from rural backgrounds face, and factors that might increase their chances of retention and success within the major. Additionally, the study identified thematic differences between first-generation students and non-first-generation students that highlight potential setbacks, such as their previous exposure and preparation for CS concepts, and their confidence in their ability to succeed in the courses and major. The poster provides details of the survey and other evaluative protocols as well as the analysis results and recommendations for program interventions.
