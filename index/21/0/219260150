Koopman operator theory, a powerful framework for discovering the underlying dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems, was recently shown to be intimately connected with neural network training. In this work, we take the first steps in making use of this connection. As Koopman operator theory is a linear theory, a successful implementation of it in evolving network weights and biases offers the promise of accelerated training, especially in the context of deep networks, where optimization is inherently a non-convex problem. We show that Koopman operator theory methods allow for accurate predictions of the weights and biases of a feedforward, fully connected deep network over a non-trivial range of training time. During this time window, we find that our approach is at least 10x faster than gradient descent based methods, in line with the results expected from our complexity analysis. We highlight additional methods by which our results can be expanded to broader classes of networks and larger time intervals, which shall be the focus of future work in this novel intersection between dynamical systems and neural network theory.
