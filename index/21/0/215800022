Autonomous mobile robot is a mobile robot that can move without human supervision. The use of autonomous mobile robots has increased in various fields such as in the industrial, agricultural, and military sectors. This paper presents the design and implementation of fuzzy control for nonholonomic unicycle mobile robot. In the experiment presented herewith, the controller was designed with 35 Fuzzy Logic rules and three types of membership functions to allow mobile robot to track different desired trajectories. The proposed controller is designed on Matlab/Simulink environment. Simulations are presented to show the performance of the fuzzy logic controller.
