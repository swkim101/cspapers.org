The paper starts with a survey over history and present-day situation of educational concepts and design methods in computer architecture. Complexity problems, bad design habits, cooperation problems between specialists, as well as their changing range of responsibility are covered, and the consequences of the developmental trends are discussed: now it is time for switching over to an integrated teaching of hardware/software design methods. The HIM scheme ( h ierarchy of i nterpretive m odules) is suggested as a conceptual machine organization framework for modelling the implementation of language hierarchies. The application of the HIM scheme for better understanding of semantics, and for a derivation of designing guidelines is discussed.
