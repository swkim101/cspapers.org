CSEd graduate students face a variety of unique issues. First, within a CS or information science program, this research area is not considered to be highly popular with respect to the quantity of CSEd faculty, graduate courses, and professionals immersed in this research area. Already, this presents a disadvantage compared to other peers in popular areas who have resources and/or a research community at their institutions to support them. Further, graduate students in this field are frequently one of the few, if not the only, CSEd researchers at their institutions. As a result, many graduate students have limited avenues to get consistent, relevant, critical feedback on their work, especially research-in-progress, i.e. research that has not already been published. In this Birds of a Feather (BoF) session, we aim to create and foster a safe and open environment that allows participants to get feedback on research-in-progress and share experiences and issues with being a graduate student in CSEd research. We invite genuine and honest conversations about the challenges facing rising academics and professionals in this area. Though the focus will be on CSEd research graduate students, any attendee who would like to hear about our experiences is welcome. We have two goals: (1) to cultivate mentorship relationships among participants to send them off with potential collaborators, supporters and advocates, and (2) to brainstorm ways to sustain these discussions in the ACM CSEd community.
