Computer Science now has a number of validated instruments available for measuring student knowledge or interest in computing (SCS1, BDSI, CAS, Digital Logic CI, etc.). But when and how should instructors and researchers use these instruments? In this BOF, we will begin by discussing the available instruments, their purpose, and how to obtain them. Then we will open the discussion to the group on what they would like to measure, how these instruments might work for them, and how to best employ them with their students.
