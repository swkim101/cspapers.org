As more Internet of Things (IoT) devices become increasingly ubiquitous, dynamic resource allocation for edge computing environments becomes extremely time consuming and challenging task. To overcome these challenges, edge computing environments need to dynamically scale based on the availability of accessible edge clouds within existing IoT infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce Edgify: a dynamic resource provisioning model that can efficiently allocate resources across a distributed edge computing environment. We evaluate Edgify through a number of experiments that demonstrate usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
