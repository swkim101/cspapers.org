As part of the national Computer Science for All initiative, there is a growing presence of computer science (CS) in K-8 classrooms. This poster presents findings from a survey of 130 K-8 teachers from Chicago Public Schools (CPS) about the state of computer science in their schools and their experiences teaching it. Results from the survey highlight the plurality of ways CS is being implemented in the classroom. The survey also reveals challenges instructors face in teaching CS. Finally, the survey reports on teachers' own experiences in the classroom, finding that teachers enjoy teaching CS and think their students also enjoy CS.
