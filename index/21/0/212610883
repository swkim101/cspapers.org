Over the years, enterprises are confronting an increasingly competitive market in price and quality of products with the quickening of the economic globalization contemporarily. Only by producing highquality and low-cost products, can a manufacturing enterprise obtain an advantageous position under this situation. Therefore, production and fabrication, which directly determine the cost and quality of the products, are the key focus areas. A reasonable production schedule not only makes benefits to saving time and reducing unit cost, but also raises the production and energy efficiency. However, even if the products are processed according to an ideal optimal schedule, the machines could malfunction, which brings about quality defects. To lessen the failures occurring, preventive maintenance is introduced during the production processing.
