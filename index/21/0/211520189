Virginia Tech's Introduction to Computational Thinking course is designed for non-majors to learn key concepts in computer science. In an effort to support student reports of struggling with iteration, interactive visualizations have been developed and initial research into their effectiveness is currently under review. While the preliminary data was promising, we are currently conducting interviews with students under IRB to better understand the shorter term gains in student learning. We will be recording these interviews and formally analyzing responses. This poster will present our findings from this analysis and better define the common pitfalls students are experiencing when learning iteration.
