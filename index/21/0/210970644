Hydrocephalus in the pediatric population is often treated with endoscopic procedures, in which a rigid endoscope provides a working channel and needed visualization for brain manipulation. The lack of flexible and steerable endoscopic tools limits the ability of the surgeon to conduct complex operations. In this paper, we propose the design of a novel tool for such procedures that uses the compliance of a bending flexural joint to build a compact steerable multi-joint tool. These joints are machined into a tube made of a super-elastic material to create two joints near the tip of the tool. The directional stiffness properties of the flexural joint are exploited to minimize inter-joint coupling. We perform a static analysis of each joint and a kinematic analysis of the entire robot. We follow this with the design of a hand-held controller for this robot, and analyze its ability to control multiple degrees-of-freedom of the robot while minimizing the coupling between joints.
