—An Unrestricted File Upload (UFU) vulnerability is a critical security threat that enables an adversary to upload her choice of a forged ﬁle to a target web server. This bug evolves into an Unrestricted Executable File Upload (UEFU) vulnerability when the adversary is able to conduct remote code execution of the uploaded ﬁle via triggering its URL. We design and implement FUSE, a penetration testing tool designed to discover UFU and UEFU vulnerabilities in server-side PHP web applications. The goal of FUSE is to generate upload requests; each request becomes an exploit payload that triggers a UFU or UEFU vulnerability. However, this approach entails two technical challenges: (1) it should generate an upload request that bypasses all content-ﬁltering checks present in a target web application; and (2) it should preserve the execution semantic of the resulting uploaded ﬁle. We address these technical challenges by mutating standard upload requests with carefully designed mutations that enable the bypassing of content-ﬁltering checks and do not tamper with the execution of uploaded ﬁles. FUSE discovered 30 previously unreported UEFU vulnerabilities, including 15 CVEs from 33 real-world web applications, thereby demonstrating its efﬁcacy in ﬁnding code execution bugs via ﬁle uploads.
