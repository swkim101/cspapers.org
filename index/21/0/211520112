Diagrams in textbooks are essential tools in explaining concepts. An effective diagram helps a novice learner build a runnable mental model, increase recall and improve problem-solving skills. Richard Mayer suggests that for a diagram to be effective, it must beexplanative and, thus, document two major features: \textitsystem topology andcomponent behaviour. We surveyed diagrams of variables, arrays and objects in 15 commonly used introductory Java textbooks to investigate if the diagrams are explanative. This abstract presents the analysis of arrays.
