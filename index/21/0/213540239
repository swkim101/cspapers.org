This paper assesses the potential for mechanised assistance in the formulation of schedulability tests. The novel idea is to use evolutionary algorithms to semi-automate the process of deriving response time analysis equations. The proof of concept presented in this paper focuses on the synthesis of mathematical expressions for the schedulability analysis of messages on Controller Area Network (CAN). This problem is of particular interest, since the original analysis developed in the early 1990s was later found to be flawed. Further, as well as known exact tests that have been formally proven, there are a number of useful sufficient tests of pseudo-polynomial complexity and closed-form polynomial-time upper bounds on response times that provide useful comparisons.
