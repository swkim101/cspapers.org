Knowledge extraction and representation aims to identify information and to transform it into a machine-readable format. Knowledge representations support Information Retrieval tasks such as searching for single statements, documents, or metadata. Requirements specifications of complex systems such as automotive software systems are usually divided into different subsystem specifications. Nevertheless, there are semantic relations between individual documents of the separated subsystems, which have to be considered in further processes (e.g. dependencies). If requirements engineers or other developers are not aware of these relations, this can lead to inconsistencies or malfunctions of the overall system. Therefore, there is a strong need for tool support in order to detects semantic relations in a set of large natural language requirements specifications. In this work we present a knowledge extraction approach based on an explicit knowledge representation of the content of natural language requirements as a semantic relation graph. Our approach is fully automated and includes an NLP pipeline to transform unrestricted natural language requirements into a graph. We split the natural language into different parts and relate them to each other based on their semantic relation. In addition to semantic relations, other relationships can also be included in the graph. We envision to use a semantic search algorithm like spreading activation to allow users to search different semantic relations in the graph.
