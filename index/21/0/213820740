We study the problem of verifying multi-agent systems under the assumption of bounded recall. We introduce the logic CTLKBR, a bounded-recall variant of the temporal-epistemic logic CTLK. We define and study the model checking problem against CTLK specifications under incomplete information and bounded recall and present complexity upper bounds. We present an extension of the BDD-based model checker MCMAS implementing model checking under bounded recall semantics and discuss the experimental results obtained.
