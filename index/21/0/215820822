Over-centralisation of data leads to tampering and sharing user information without the consent of the owners. This problem has been studied extensively in recent times providing separate solutions involving distributed storage, Blockchain technology and Solid Pods. Individually these solutions are not sufficient to build realistic applications in a decentralised environment; however, a combination of them can effectively provide more powerful and useful use-cases. In this paper, we propose the methods of combining Solid Pods and distributed ledgers in introducing complete decentralisation of data with total user-control, keeping the integrity of the stored information intact through Blockchain-based verification. We demonstrated multiple configurations of our solutions, offering several new use-cases in various sectors. These configurations introduce new dimensions on the Web and mobile applicationsâ€™ data storage that developers can benefit from building Distributed Applications (DApps) in a complete decentralised environment.
