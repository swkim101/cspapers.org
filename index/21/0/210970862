Robotic origami design allows creating meso-scale robotic systems and mechanisms not limited by degrees of freedom, miniaturization and assembly downsides of conventional transmission mechanisms. However, unlike the traditional rigid approaches, robotic origami application has been limited by the complex deformation and kinematics of the compliant joints and actuation based on active materials or conventional electric motors. To generalize their application at meso-scale requires a combination of the predictability of traditional rigid kinematics and the manufacturing flexibility of robotic origami. Here we present a study of conventional transmission mechanisms, including a slider-crank and cam-follower, made in quasi-2D form by selective machining and stacking of multiple layers of composite material with minimal assembly. Owing to a compliant design powered by low-profile piezoelectric motors, our 5.3 mm thick and lightweight mechanisms transmit rotational motion to translational movements in and out-of-plane. We develop analytic models that we validate in terms of force and motion output on our prototypes.
