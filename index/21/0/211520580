Teaching interdisciplinary courses is an exciting way to build collaborations between different departments and to make students aware of the potential impact of their work. Students in these courses can develop skills in synthesis and complex problem solving by learning to draw parallels between different fields of study and application areas. The goal of this BoF is to bring together a community of educators who are teaching interdisciplinary and/or data science courses with the goal of expanding a support network of data science faculty and developing educational standards for undergraduate data science curricula. We would like to leverage the SIGCSE community to bring together people from different disciplines, institutions, and organizations. The session will include a chance for participants to discuss their experience with and challenges with interdisciplinary course teaching. The second half of the hour will be spent trying to identify common themes to be addressed in follow up discussions and meetings. These materials will be posted on the Data Science Pedagogy repository: https://github.com/data-science-pedagogy
