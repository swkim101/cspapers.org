There are many cluster similarity indices used to evaluate clustering algorithms, and choosing the best one for a particular task is usually an open problem. In this paper, we perform a thorough analysis of this problem: we develop a list of desirable properties (requirements) and theoretically verify which indices satisfy them. In particular, we investigate dozens of pair-counting indices and prove that none of them meet all the requirements. Based on our analysis, we propose using the arccosine of the correlation coefficient as a similarity measure and show that it satisfies almost all the requirements (except for one, which is still satisfied asymptotically). We illustrate the practical importance of our analysis via an online experiment within a major news aggregator system.
