Actively exploring and mapping an unknown environment requires integration of both simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and path planning methods. Path planning relies on a map that contains free and occupied space information and is efficient to query, while the role of SLAM is to keep the map consistent as new measurements are continuously added. A key challenge, however, lies in ensuring a map representation compatible with both these objectives: that is, a map that maintains free space information for planning but can also adapt efficiently to dynamically changing pose estimates from a graph-based SLAM system.In this paper, we propose an online global occupancy map that can be corrected for accumulated drift efficiently based on incremental solutions from a sparse graph-based SLAM optimization. Our map maintains free space information for real-time path planning while undergoing a bounded number of updates in each loop closure iteration. We evaluate performance for both simulated and real-world datasets for an application involving underwater exploration and mapping.
