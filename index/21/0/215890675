A* is the algorithm of finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. When the planning problem is constituted of a set of linked graphs, A* searches solution like if it is face of one graph formed by linked graphs. While researchers have developed solutions to reduce the execution time of A* in multiple cases by multiples techniques, we develop a new algorithm: DEC-A* which is a decentralized version of A*. A* uses a distance-plus-cost heuristic function to determine the order in which the search visits nodes in the tree. Our algorithm DEC-A* extends the evaluation of the distance-plus-cost heuristic be the sum of two functions : local distance, which evaluates the cost to reach the nearest neighbor node s to the goal, and global distance which evaluates the cost from s to the goal through other graphs. DEC-A* accelerates finding the shortest path by reducing the time and space complexity, while ensuring the privacy of graphs.
