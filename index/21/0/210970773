This paper presents an approach to show global controllability of a class of underactuated mechanical systems. This class of systems include gymnastic robots and the classic cart-pole system. For this class of systems, we can define a connection point, and design a damping controller $u(t)$ with the Lyapunov method to drive all states to the connection point. Further by exploiting the time reversal symmetry of the system and spline interpolation, a controller $u(-t)$ can be obtained to drive the system from the connection point to any other state. The system is thus shown completely controllable, i.e., there exists an admissible trajectory from any given state to any given final state. Swing-up control designs for a pendubot, cart-pole system and triple pendulum are given as illustrative examples.
