This lightning talk describes a proof of concept research project funded by a Google CS Education (CS-ER) Research grant. The project focuses on pedagogical interventions aimed at improving the outcomes of English Language Learners (ELLs) in Advanced Placement Computer Science. The research underway examines the use of Sheltered Instruction (SI), a model from English as a Second Language (ESL) and bilingual education, used in mainstream classrooms across other content areas, in the AP CSA and AP CSP classroom. Strategies and pedagogy from the Sheltered Instruction model are being infused into AP Computer Science curriculum and used in classrooms in participating districts. The districts have been selected to include a range of ELLs and native English speakers. The impact of this approach will be measured by comparing the AP CS exam scores of students in the participating districts with the national and state AP CS exam scores. This lightning talk will focus on the pedagogy development which has taken place and preliminary findings from two cohorts of AP CS and AP CSA teachers, in particular the impact and changes to the teacher's development of CS education lessons and in-class lesson delivery. The project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between faculty from the School of Computer Science and the School of Curriculum and Teaching.
