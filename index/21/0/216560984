Affective analysis of textual data is instrumental in understanding human communication in the modern era of social media. A number of resources have been proposed in attempts to characterize the emotions tied to words in a text. In this work, we show that we can obtain a database that goes beyond the common binary scores for emotion classification provided by past work. Instead, we harness the power of Big Data by using neural vector space models trained with large-scale supervision from co-occurrence patterns. We modify the vector space to better account for emotional associations, which then enables us to induce AffectVec, a new emotion database providing graded emotion intensity scores for English language words with regard to a fine-grained inventory of over 200 different emotion categories. Our experiments show that AffectVec outperforms existing emotion lexicons by substantial margins in intrinsic evaluations as well as for affective text classification.
