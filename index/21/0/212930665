 Lattice Heat Transfer (LHT) structures provide superior structural support while improving the heat transfer coefficient through their high surface-to-volume ratios. By using current Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, LHT with highly complex structures is possible. In this study, the design concept of LHT is further improved by implementing a thermomechanical topology optimization method. With utilization of design-dependent heat source, the method can be applied to generate stiffer LHT structures under mechanical and thermomechanical loads, without decreasing their thermal performance; relative to a design made of a uniform LHT having the same mass fraction. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate how to use the proposed approach to design LHT sections. The results show that the mechanical performance can be improved more than 50% compared to a uniform LHT with the same mass fraction, without decreasing the thermal performance. The method does not require a fluid mechanics model, thus it is computational effective and particularly suitable for the conceptual design stage. The resulting optimized lattice is made possible by utilizing additive manufacturing technologies.
