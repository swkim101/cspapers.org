Cross-modal retrieval between videos and texts has attracted growing attentions due to the rapid emergence of videos on the web. The current dominant approach is to learn a joint embedding space to measure cross-modal similarities. However, simple embeddings are insufficient to represent complicated visual and textual details, such as scenes, objects, actions and their compositions. To improve fine-grained video-text retrieval, we propose a Hierarchical Graph Reasoning (HGR) model, which decomposes video-text matching into global-to-local levels. The model disentangles text into a hierarchical semantic graph including three levels of events, actions, entities, and generates hierarchical textual embeddings via attention-based graph reasoning. Different levels of texts can guide the learning of diverse and hierarchical video representations for cross-modal matching to capture both global and local details. Experimental results on three video-text datasets demonstrate the advantages of our model. Such hierarchical decomposition also enables better generalization across datasets and improves the ability to distinguish fine-grained semantic differences.
