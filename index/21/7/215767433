In this paper, we propose an accurate non-contact pose estimation method for the pose of a remote target in the earth coordinate frame using a mobile phone equipped with a camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Under the Manhattan world assumption, we first estimate the relative pose between the target and the camera using an existing line-based pose estimation method and then seek the targetâ€™s pose in the earth frame by combining the visual pose and the IMU orientation. To improve the overall estimation accuracy, we propose a new camera-IMU relative pose calibration method, where we take the different stochastic nature the accelerometer and magnetometer measurements into consideration, and propose a new a consistency measure defined on elevation and azimuth angles. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, it demonstrates strong advantage on both elevation and azimuth estimation accuracy while featuring convenient calibration setting-up. We also report the improved overall pose estimation accuracy based on evaluations on a real-world dataset using our method, in contrast to an uncalibrated phone.
