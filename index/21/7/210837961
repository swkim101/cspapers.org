We present a novel data structure for SIMD optimized simultaneous bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) traversals like they appear for instance in collision detection tasks. In contrast to all previous approaches, we consider both the traversal algorithm and the construction of the BVH. The main idea is to increase the branching factor of the BVH according to the available SIMD registers and parallelize the simultaneous BVH traversal using SIMD operations. This requires a novel BVH construction method because traditional BVHs for collision detection usually are simple binary trees. To do that, we present a new BVH construction method based on a clustering algorithm, Batch Neural Gas, that is able to build efficient n-ary tree structures along with SIMD optimized simultaneous BVH traversal. Our results show that our new data structure outperforms binary trees significantly.
