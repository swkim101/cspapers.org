This paper presents PMExec, a tool that supports the execution of partial UML-RT models. To this end, the tool implements the following steps: static analysis, automatic refinement, and input-driven execution. The static analysis that respects the execution semantics of UML-RT models is used to detect problematic model elements, i.e., elements that cause problems during execution due to the partiality. Then, the models are refined automatically using model transformation techniques, which mostly add decision points where missing information can be supplied. Third, the refined models are executed, and when the execution reaches the decision points, input required to continue the execution is obtained either interactively or from a script that captures how to deal with partial elements. We have evaluated PMExec using several use-cases that show that the static analysis, refinement, and application of user input can be carried out with reasonable performance, and that the overhead of approach is manageable. https://youtu.be/BRKsselcMnc Note: Interested readers can refer to [1] for a thorough discussion and evaluation of this work.
