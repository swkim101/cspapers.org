It is of vital importance to efficiently process large graphs for many data-intensive applications. As a result, a large collection of graph analytic frameworks has been proposed to improve the per-iteration performance on a single kind of computation resource. However, heavy coordination and synchronization overhead make it hard to scale out graph analytic frameworks from single platform to heterogeneous platforms. Furthermore, increasing the convergence rate, i.e. reducing the number of iterations, which is equally vital for improving the overall performance of iterative graph algorithms, receives much less attention.In this paper, we introduce the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) view of graph algorithms and propose an asynchronous heterogeneous graph analytic framework, GraphABCD, using the BCD view. The BCD view offers key insights and trade-offs on achieving high convergence rate of iterative graph algorithms. GraphABCD features fast convergence under the algorithm design options suggested by BCD. GraphABCD offers algorithm and architectural supports for asynchronous execution, without undermining its fast convergence properties. With minimum synchronization overhead, GraphABCD is able to scale out to heterogeneous and distributed accelerators efficiently. To demonstrate GraphABCD, we prototype its whole system on Intel HARPv2 CPU-FPGA heterogeneous platform. Evaluations on HARPv2 show that GraphABCD achieves geo-mean speedups of 4.8x and 2.0x over GraphMat, a state-of-the-art framework in terms of convergence rate and execution time, respectively.
