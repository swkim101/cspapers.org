The \textit{transition matrix}, denoting the transition relationship from clean labels to noisy labels, is essential to build \textit{statistically consistent} classifiers in label-noise learning. Existing methods for estimating the transition matrix rely heavily on estimating the noisy class posterior. However, the estimation error for \textit{noisy class posterior} could be large due to the randomness of label noise. The estimation error would lead the transition matrix to be poorly estimated. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to solve this problem by exploiting the divide-and-conquer paradigm. Specifically, we introduce an \textit{intermediate class} to avoid directly estimating the noisy class posterior. By this intermediate class, the original transition matrix can then be factorized into the product of two easy-to-estimate transition matrices. We term the proposed method the \textit{dual $T$-estimator}. Both theoretical analyses and empirical results illustrate the effectiveness of the dual $T$-estimator for estimating transition matrices, leading to better classification performances.
