Object serialization and deserialization (S/D) is an essential feature for efficient communication between distributed computing nodes with potentially non-uniform execution environments. S/D operations are widely used in big data analytics frameworks for remote procedure calls and massive data transfers like shuffles. However, frequent S/D operations incur significant performance and energy overheads as they must traverse and process a large object graph. Prior approaches improve S/D throughput by effectively hiding disk or network I/O latency with computation, increasing compression ratio, and/or application-specific customization. However, inherent dependencies in the existing (de)serialization formats and algorithms eventually become the major performance bottleneck. Thus, we propose Cereal, a specialized hardware accelerator for memory object serialization. By co-designing the serialization format with hardware architecture, Cereal effectively utilizes abundant parallelism in the S/D process to deliver high throughput. Cereal also employs an efficient object packing scheme to compress metadata such as object reference offsets and a space-efficient bitmap representation for the object layout. Our evaluation of Cereal using both a cycle-level simulator and synthesizable Chisel RTL demonstrates that Cereal delivers 43.4× higher average S/D throughput than 88 other S/D libraries on Java Serialization Benchmark Suite. For six Spark applications Cereal achieves 7.97× and 4.81× speedups on average for S/D operations over Java built-in serializer and Kryo, respectively, while saving S/D energy by 227.75× and 136.28×.
