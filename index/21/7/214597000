In this paper we propose a new robust sliding mode control for the uncertain systems with delay on the input.. The Control law is function of the estimated upper bound and is based on a choice of Lyapunov function. This new approach is carried out in two steps; the first consists on the determination of a state predictor in discrete time for the uncertain systems. The second is the synthesis of a first order sliding mode control. Simulation results prove the efficiency of the proposed resulting methodology.
