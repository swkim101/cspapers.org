Semantic human matting aims to estimate the per-pixel opacity of the foreground human regions. It is quite challenging that usually requires user interactive trimaps and plenty of high quality annotated data. Annotating such kind of data is labor intensive and requires great skills beyond normal users, especially considering the very detailed hair part of humans. In contrast, coarse annotated human dataset is much easier to acquire and collect from the public dataset. In this paper, we propose to leverage coarse annotated data coupled with fine annotated data to boost end-to-end semantic human matting without trimaps as extra input. Specifically, We train a mask prediction network to estimate the coarse semantic mask using the hybrid data, and then propose a quality unification network to unify the quality of the previous coarse mask outputs. A matting refinement network takes the unified mask and the input image to predict the final alpha matte. The collected coarse annotated dataset enriches our dataset significantly, allows generating high quality alpha matte for real images. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs comparably against state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed method can be used for refining coarse annotated public dataset, as well as semantic segmentation methods, which reduces the cost of annotating high quality human data to a great extent.
