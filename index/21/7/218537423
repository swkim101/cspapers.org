We present an end-to-end trainable Neural Network architecture for stereo imaging that jointly locates and estimates human body poses in 3D. Our method defines a 2D pose for each human in a stereo pair of images and uses a correlation layer with a composite field to associate each left-right pair of joints. In absence of a stereo pose dataset, we show that we can train our method with synthetic data only and test it on real-world images (i.e., our training stage is domain invariant). Our method is particularly suitable for autonomous vehicles. We achieve state-of-the-art results for the 3D localization task on the challenging real-world KITTI dataset while running four times faster.
