. The Faculty of Architecture and Design is one of the faculties at UPN “Veteran” Jawa Timur, which consists of the Architecture Study Program and the Visual Communication Design (VCD) Study Program. Various teaching, research and service activities have been carried out by lecturers and students who are members of the laboratory. There are 4 laboratories incorporated in the VCD program, one of which is the Print and Illustration laboratory. Many products have been produced by this laboratory, including Visual Design and Souvenir Products, popup books, profile books, sign systems, illustration book, etc. However, there are few obstacles faced by print and illustration laboratories and several other laboratories, namely the lack of tools, facilities and infrastructure. There are currently several tools that are damaged and cannot function optimally. The tools needed are digital press machines, A3 printers, cameras, and display cabinets. With these tools, it can produce souvenir products as a promotional media, as well as a reminder (memento), which has artistic value in introducing the campus UPN "Veteran" Jawa Timur on a wider area. Among them were the cup package and profile book of UPN "Veteran" Jawa Timur. This research method outlines through two stages, namely: (1) the preparation phase; (2) the stage of creation. The preparation phase includes data collection, observation, and analysis. While the stages of creation include preproduction, production and post-production. With the existence of these production support tools, it is expected that laboratory performance will be more optimal and the products produced can be better and can be commercialized.
