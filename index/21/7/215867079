METU Object-Oriented DBMS1 includes the implementation of a database kernel, an object-oriented SQL-like language and a graphical user interface. Kernel functions are divided between a SQL Interpreter and a C++ compiler. Thus the interpretation of functions are avoided increasing the efficiency of the system. The compiled by C++ functions are used by the system through the Function Manager. The system is realized on Exodus Storage Manager (ESM), thus exploiting some of the kernel functions readily provided by ESM. The additional functions provided by the MOOD kernel are the optimization and interpretation of SQL statements, dynamic linking of functions, and catalog management.
