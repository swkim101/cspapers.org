Warm water cooling has been regarded as a promising method to improve the energy efficiency of water-cooled datacenters. In warm water-cooling systems, hot spots occur as a common problem where the hybrid cooling architecture integrating thermoelectric coolers (TECs) emerges as a new remedy. Equipped with this architecture, the inlet water temperature can be raised higher, which provides more opportunities for heat recycling. However, currently, the heat absorbed from the server components is ejected directly into the water without being recycled, which leads to energy wasting. In order to further improve the energy efficiency, we propose Heat to Power (H2P), an economical and energy-recycling warm water cooling architecture, where thermoelectric generators (TEGs) harvest thermal energy from the “used” warm water and generate electricity for reusing in datacenters. Specifically, we propose some efficient optimization methods, including an economical water circulation design, fine-grained adjustments of the cooling setting and dynamic workload scheduling for increasing the power generated by TEGs. We evaluate H2P based on a real hardware prototype and cluster traces from Google and Alibaba. Experiment results show that TEGs equipped with our optimization methods can averagely generate 4.349 W, 4.203 W, and 3.979 W (4.177 W averagely) electricity on one CPU under the drastic, irregular and common workload traces, respectively. The power reusing efficiency (PRE) can reach 12.8%∼16.2% (14.23% averagely) and the total cost of ownership (TCO) of datacenters can be reduced by up to 0.57%.
