The paper presents an experimental-based study of abrasive jet machining (AJM) considering the effect of changing process parameters. A series of drilling tests were carried out on glass work pieces using sand as the abrasive powder. The influence of each process parameter; applied air pressure, standoff distance, nozzle diameter, particle grain size and impact angle on the machining performance was determined in terms of the resultant material removal rate (MRR). The experimental results revealed that MRR was highly dependent on the kinetic energy of the abrasive particles, with the applied pressure the dominant parameter. The experimental results were compared with an erosion rate model previously published by Jafar et al. Though correct trends were predicted, there was a large discrepancy between model and measured values.
