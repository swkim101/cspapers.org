. E-catalogue is an optional way to facilitate the process of marketing in a company and increase its revenue. Its digital form allows a company to perform regular updates quickly and easily at zero cost, ensuring the accuracy of product data when it is presented to customer. Unlike conventional catalogs, e-catalogs facilitate a direct relationship between the company and its customers. The benefit of the e-catalog should be felt by both company and customers. Unfortunately, designing an ideal e-catalog that can give mutual benefit for company and customers is relatively tricky. It’s easy for e-catalog product data to become messy and inconsistent. It’s tedious and time-consuming to continuously update and manage the data. This study aims to design a standardized web-based catalog using task-centered design to give more benefits for the company and customers. By using a well-structured questionnaire, data were obtained from both company and customers. The questionnaire was developed using a modified-Nielsen’s usability testing model. This model considers several factors that influence the usability of a system namely learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. Of the overall indicators, the average number of user satisfaction is 86.72% (minimum threshold = 80%) which means the web-based catalog is very feasible. Therefore, it can be concluded that the e-catalog can be well-received by the company and its customers.
