 This research demonstrates how the Decision Based Design (DBD) approach can be used for determining a system’s lifecycle value when including excess. Prior research has shown that excess (the degree to which a component or attribute is sized beyond the minimum required to support the initially fielded system) can reduce the cost of changing a system. Theoretically, excess inhibits change propagation within a system and could be strategically added to increase the value of that system. Including excess, however, also adds cost and potentially impacts system performance. Prior research has not quantitatively linked excess as a means of limiting change propagation to system lifecycle value. This work advances the existing literature by considering how excess is imbedded in a system and what impact excess has on the system’s total value. After being introduced, the method is demonstrated on a desktop computer example. Results from the study are used to show how decisions about power supply capacity can be optimized by incorporating excess to achieve flexibility.
