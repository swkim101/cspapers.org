A fast and reliable verification of an initial concept is an important need in the field of mechatronics. Usually, the steps for a successful design require multiple iterations involving a sequence of design phases-the initial one and several improvements-and the tests of the resulting prototypes, in a trial and error scheme. Now a dayâ€™s software and hardware tools allow for a faster approach, in which the iterations between design and prototyping are by far reduced, even to just one in favorable situation. This work presents the design, manufacturing and testing of a robotic end effector for space applications, realized through virtual prototyping, followed by rapid prototyping realization.
