As researchers seek to apply their machine learning algorithms to new problems, corpus annotation is increasingly gaining importance in the NLP community. But since the community currently has no general paradigm, no textbook that covers all the issues (though Wilcockâ€™s book published in Dec 2009 covers some basic ones very well), and no accepted standards, setting up and performing small-, medium-, and large-scale annotation projects remains something of an art.
