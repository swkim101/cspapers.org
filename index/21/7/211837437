Database-backed web applications manipulate large amounts of persistent data, and such applications often contain constraints that restrict data length, data value, and other data properties. Such constraints are critical in ensuring the reliability and usability of these applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on where data constraints are expressed, what they are about, how often they evolve, and how their violations are handled. The results show that developers struggle with maintaining consistent data constraints and checking them across different components and versions of their web applications, leading to various problems. Guided by our study, we developed checking tools and API enhancements that can automatically detect such problems and improve the quality of such applications.
