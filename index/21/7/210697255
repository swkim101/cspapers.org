Continuous Integration (CI) is a widely-adopted software engineering practice. Despite its undisputed benefits, like higher software quality and improved developer productivity, mastering CI is not easy. Among the several barriers when transitioning to CI, developers need to face a new type of software failures (i.e., build failures) that requires them to understand complex build logs. Even when a team has successfully introduced a CI culture, living up to its principles and improving the CI practice are also challenging. In my research, I want to provide developers with the right support for establishing CI and the proper recommendations for continuously improving their CI process.
