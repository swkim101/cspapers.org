Occluded person re-identification (ReID) aims to match occluded person images to holistic ones across dis-joint cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel framework by learning high-order relation and topology information for discriminative features and robust alignment. At first, we use a CNN backbone to learn feature maps and key-points estimation model to extract semantic local features. Even so, occluded images still suffer from occlusion and outliers. Then, we view the extracted local features of an image as nodes of a graph and propose an adaptive direction graph convolutional (ADGC) layer to pass relation information between nodes. The proposed ADGC layer can automatically suppress the message passing of meaningless features by dynamically learning direction and degree of linkage. When aligning two groups of local features, we view it as a graph matching problem and propose a cross-graph embedded-alignment (CGEA) layer to joint learn and embed topology information to local features, and straightly predict similarity score. The proposed CGEA layer can both take full use of alignment learned by graph matching and replace sensitive one-to-one alignment with a robust soft one. Finally, extensive experiments on occluded, partial, and holistic ReID tasks show the effectiveness of our proposed method. Specifically, our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art by $6.5\%$ mAP scores on Occluded-Duke dataset.
