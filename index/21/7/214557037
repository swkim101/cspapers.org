 Parametric Optimization is used to solve problems that have certain design variables as implicit functions of some independent input parameters. The optimal solutions and optimal objective function values are provided as functions of the input parameters for the entire parameter space of interest. Since exact solutions are available merely for parametric optimization problems that are linear or convex-quadratic, general non-convex non-linear problems require approximations.
 In the present work, we apply three parametric optimization algorithms to solve a case study of a benchmark structural design problem. The algorithms first approximate the nonlinear constraint(s) and then solve the optimization problem. The accuracy of their results and their computational performance are then compared to identify a suitable algorithm for structural design applications. Using the identified method, sizing optimization of a truss structure for varying load conditions such as a varying load direction is considered and solved as a parametric optimization problem to evaluate the performance of the identified algorithm. The results are also compared with non-parametric optimization to assess the accuracy of the solution and computational performance of the two methods.
