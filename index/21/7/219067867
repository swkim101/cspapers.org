Prior work in cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER) with no/little labeled data falls into two primary categories: model transfer- and data transfer-based methods. In this paper, we find that both method types can complement each other, in the sense that, the former can exploit context information via language-independent features but sees no task-specific information in the target language; while the latter generally generates pseudo target-language training data via translation but its exploitation of context information is weakened by inaccurate translations. Moreover, prior work rarely leverages unlabeled data in the target language, which can be effortlessly collected and potentially contains valuable information for improved results. To handle both problems, we propose a novel approach termed UniTrans to Unify both model and data Transfer for cross-lingual NER, and furthermore, leverage the available information from unlabeled target-language data via enhanced knowledge distillation. We evaluate our proposed UniTrans over 4 target languages on benchmark datasets. Our experimental results show that it substantially outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.
