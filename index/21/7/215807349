We prove that the equivalence of two fundamental problems in the theory of computing. For every polynomial $t(n)\geq(1+\varepsilon)n,\ \varepsilon > 0$, the following are equivalent: •One-way functions exists (which in turn is equivalent to the existence of secure private-key encryption schemes, digital signatures, pseudorandom generators, pseudorandom functions, commitment schemes, and more); •$t$-time bounded Kolmogorov Complexity, $K^{t}$, is mildly hard-on-average (i.e., there exists a polynomial $p(n) > 0$ such that no PPT algorithm can compute $K^{t}$, for more than a $1-\frac{1}{p(n)}$ fraction of $n$-bit strings). In doing so, we present the first natural, and well-studied, computational problem characterizing the feasibility of the central private-key primitives and protocols in Cryptography.
