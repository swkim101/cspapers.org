This paper introduces the concept of Neural Weight Virtualization - which enables fast and scalable in-memory multitask deep learning on memory-constrained embedded systems. The goal of neural weight virtualization is two-fold: (1) packing multiple DNNs into a fixed-sized main memory whose combined memory requirement is larger than the main memory, and (2) enabling fast in-memory execution of the DNNs. To this end, we propose a two-phase approach: (1) virtualization of weight parameters for fine-grained parameter sharing at the level of weights that scales up to multiple heterogeneous DNNs of arbitrary network architectures, and (2) in-memory data structure and run-time execution framework for in-memory execution and context-switching of DNN tasks. We implement two multitask learning systems: (1) an embedded GPU-based mobile robot, and (2) a microcontroller-based IoT device. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed algorithms as well as the two systems that involve ten state-of-the-art DNNs. Our evaluation shows that weight virtualization improves memory efficiency, execution time, and energy efficiency of the multitask learning systems by 4.1x, 36.9x, and 4.2x, respectively.
