Ontology-mediated query answering is concerned with the problem of answering queries over knowledge bases consisting of a database instance and an ontology. While most work in the area fo-cuses on conjunctive queries (CQs), navigational queries are gaining increasing attention. In this paper, we investigate the complexity of answering two-way conjunctive regular path queries (CRPQs) over knowledge bases whose ontology is given by a set of guarded existential rules. We first consider the subclass of linear existential rules and show that CRPQ answering is EXPTIME-complete in combined complexity and NL-complete in data complexity , matching the recently established bounds for answering non-conjunctive RPQs. For guarded rules, we provide a non-trivial reduction to the linear case, which allows us to show that the complexity of CRPQ answering is the same as for CQs, namely 2EXPTIME-complete in combined complexity and PTIME-complete in data complexity.
