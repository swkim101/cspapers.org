Abstract : The object of our research is the codification of programming knowledge for the synthesis of concurrent programs. This final report presents the derivation of two concurrent algorithms: dynamic programming (for the class of problems that run in polynomial time on sequential machines) and array multiplication. Both derived concurrent versions run in linear time. The concurrent versions are significant and complex algorithms, though they are not new and already have been reported in the literature. The synthesis knowledge for these derivations is embodied in seven synthesis rules, preliminary versions of which are presented in this report. The rules will probably generalize to other classes of algorithms but we have not explored that issue yet. We have also discovered a pair of techniques called virtualization and aggregation. This pair of techniques (plus the other seven rules) is shown to be powerful enough to synthesize Kung's systolic array architecture (Kung-76) from a specification of matrix multiplication.
