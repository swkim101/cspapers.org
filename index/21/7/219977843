Property-based testing is a structured method for automated testing using program specifications. We report on the design and implementation of what is to our knowledge the first property-based framework for quantum programs. We review various aspects of our design concerning property-specification, test-case generation, and test result analysis. We also provide an overview of the implementation and its way of working. Finally, we present the result of applying our framework to some examples.
