The smart contract cannot be modified when it has been deployed on a blockchain. Therefore, it must be given thorough test before its being deployed. Mutation testing is considered as a practical test methodology to evaluate the adequacy of software testing. In this paper, we introduce MuSC, a mutation testing tool for Ethereum Smart Contract (ESC). It can generate numerous mutants at a fast speed and supports the automatic operations such as creating test nets, deploying and executing tests. Specially, MuSC implements a set of novel mutation operators w.r.t ESC programming language, Solidity. Therefore, it can expose the defects of smart contracts to a certain degree. The demonstration video of MuSC is available at https: //youtu.be/3KBKXJPVjbQ, and the source code can be downloaded at https://github.com/belikout/MuSC-Tool-Demo-repo.
