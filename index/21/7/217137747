Block-based programming environments such as Scratch are designed to make programming easier to learn for both children and adults. Unfortunately, these environments rely so heavily on visual features that they are inaccessible to people who are blind and use screen readers. To address this problem, we created Blocks4All, a block-based environment for the Apple iPad, which uses the touchscreen and VoiceOver, the built-in screen reader for iOS, to help make the environment accessible. Blocks4All differs from existing block-based environments in three main ways: (1) it uses select, select, drop instead of drag and drop to move blocks, (2) the blocks are placed on the bottom of the screen and are a fixed size so that they can easily be found by touch even without sight, and (3) it uses both audio and spatial cues to convey information about statements nested inside repeat loops and conditionals. In our presentation, we will show the features we developed and demonstrate how to write code that uses both conditional statements and repeat loops. We anticipate the demo will be useful both for instructors with students with visual impairments and developers of block-based environments. Handouts will be provided that describe Blocks4All and information about how to download a beta version.
