In the Philippines, several projects had been implemented which gives people living in remote areas access to the internet. Some of these projects face geographic problems like remote coastal areas separated by mountains, which leads to the use of expensive Very Small Aperture Terminal. One possible solution is using an ocean long-range wireless communication link buoy as a relay station. However, this faces challenges such as high fading due to the reflection of sea surface and the effects of ocean activities. To address this, a mechanical antenna stabilizer for an omnidirectional antenna is used to compensates the angular movement of the buoy.
