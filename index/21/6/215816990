Large-scale data centers run latency-critical jobs with quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, and throughput-oriented background jobs, which need to achieve high perfor-mance. Previous works have proposed methods which cannot co-locate multiple latency-critical jobs with multiple back-grounds jobs while: (1) meeting the QoS requirements of all latency-critical jobs, and (2) maximizing the performance of the background jobs. This paper proposes CLITE, a Bayesian Optimization-based, multi-resource partitioning technique which achieves these goals.
