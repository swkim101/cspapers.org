The move to multicore systems requires methods and tools to support the designer in the partitioning of functions among the available cores and the definition of the task model. In this paper we present the formulation of a functional partitioning for real-time systems and we provide an optimization method for an efficient implementation of the Logical Execution Time (LET) paradigm, to enforce causality and determinism in the development of time-and safety-critical applications. A novel schedulability analysis for partitioned tasks executing according to the LET paradigm is also provided. Our methods are applied to the industry-size model of the WATERS challenge and compute solutions that easily outperform the initial solution provided.
