Recent years have witnessed novel designs of battery-free IoT tags using RF backscatter. Traditionally, they require a dedicated transmitter to excite the tag. However, such a deployment is infeasible at large scale. To counter this problem, researchers have proposed using ambient RF energy to power up the battery-free tag. In this poster, we evaluate if this ambient RF energy is sufficient to meet the power requirements of a battery-free tag in today's urban and rural areas. We also compare available ambient RF energy across different frequencies. Finally, we discuss open challenges in realising ambient backscatter systems in real-world.
