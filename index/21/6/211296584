Legged robots have great potential to perform complex loco-manipulation tasks, yet it is challenging to keep the robot balanced while it interacts with the environment. In this paper we investigated the use of additional contact points for maximising the robustness of loco-manipulation motions. Specifically, body-ground contact was studied for its ability to enhance robustness and manipulation capabilities of quadrupedal robots. We proposed equipping the robot with prongs: small legs rigidly attached to the body which create body-ground contact at controllable point-contacts. The effect of these prongs on robustness was quantified by computing the Smallest Unrejectable Force (SUF), a measure of robustness related to Feasible Wrench Polytopes. We applied the SUF to evaluate the robustness of the system, and proposed an effective approximation of the SUF that can be computed at near-real-time speed. We developed a hierarchical quadratic programming based whole-body controller that can control stable interaction when the prongs are in contact with the ground. This novel prong concept and complementary control framework were implemented on hardware to validate their effectiveness by showing increased robustness and newly enabled loco-manipulation tasks, such as obstacle clearance and manipulation of a large object.
