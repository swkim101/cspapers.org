The navigation of autonomous mobile robots has in recent times gained interest from many researchers in different areas such as in the industrial, agricultural, and military sectors. This paper presents the development of fuzzy logic controller (FLC) motion for guiding a nonholonomic mobile robot to navigate in an environment area cluttered with static obstacles. The controller was programmed with 3 inputs distance from a pioneer p3dx robot that is equipped with 16 ultrasonic sensors, 2 outputs and 27 fuzzy rules that allow robot to move and avoid static obstacles. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model we used V-REP and MATLAB softwares. The simulations results showed that the mobile robot could navigate successfully into labyrinth environment thanks to the performance of our intelligent controller.
