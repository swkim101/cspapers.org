In this paper, we present YAM, a schema matcher factory. YAM (Yet Another Matcher) is not (yet) another schema matching system as it enables the generation of a la carte schema matchers according to user requirements. These requirements include a preference for recall or precision, a training data set (schemas already matched) and provided expert correspondences. YAM uses a knowledge base that includes a (possibly large) set of similarity measures and classifiers. Based on the user requirements, YAM learns how to best apply these tools (similarity measures and classifiers) in concert to achieve the best matching quality. In our demonstration, we will let users apply YAM to build the best schema matcher for different user requirements.
