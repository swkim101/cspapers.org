This paper describes an optimization technique of neural networks radial basis function multi-model identification of nonlinear system. Indeed, this paper treats the multi-model approach based on parametric identification. The used architecture of the neural multi-model is radial basis function. We have used the descent gradient and the genetic algorithm technique and we have compared the found results. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown through a numerical simulation of a nonlinear system and we have confirmed that the genetic algorithm give a very good results.
