We study the problem of learning opinions in social networks. The learner observes the states of some sample nodes from a social network, and tries to infer the states of other nodes, based on the structure of the network. We show that sample-efﬁcient learning is impossible when the network exhibits strong noise, and give a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem with nearly optimal sample complexity when the network is sufﬁ-ciently stable.
