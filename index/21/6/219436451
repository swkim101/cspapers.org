One of the key elements of their success, is the way that in very practical and creative ways materialise their own societal imaginaries in the form of democratically run and collectively owned (digital) cooperatives, self-organised and informal social clinics, or fair trade no-middlemen initiatives. Such examples of prefigurative social movements [2] have a lot in common (at least in terms of a shared value system and societal goals) with politically-motivated HCI research, while also offering HCI researchers very practical examples of socio-technical infrastructures able to transform (public or common) services.
