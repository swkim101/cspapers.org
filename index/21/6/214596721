The high reliable flight control system is important to the solar-powered High-Altitude-Long-Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (HALE UAV), which has nonlinear characteristic of strong coupling and less control effectors. A non-linear fault tolerant control approach was presented for the solution of the control problem for the solar-powered HALE UAV in failures. The fault tolerant control problem could be cast as a nonlinear control allocation by the piecewise linear assumption for the control effectors efficiency data. In order to solve the control allocation program, it was re-presented as a mixed-integer linear program simply. The approach was implemented in a nonlinear flight simulation of a solar-powered HALE UAV with control effectors failures. The results indicate that the tracking performance of the non-linear fault tolerant control approach is significantly better than the traditional linear control allocation approach.
