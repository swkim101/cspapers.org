In this work, the problem of checking diagnosability on Discrete Event System (DES) is considered especially in centralized architecture. Many approaches in literature deals with diagnosability using one or more intermediate models. In this paper, we present a new model based diagnosability algorithms in the framework of set theory for deciding diagnosability, without any intermediate constructions or models and considering several faults at the same time.
