To extract knowledge from general web text, it requires to build a domain-independent extractor that scales to the entire web corpus. This task is known as Open Information Extraction (OIE). This paper proposes to apply Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to accomplish OIE. To achieve this goal, we define a Markov Decision Process for OIE and build a simulator to learn the reward signals, which provides a complete reinforcement learning framework for MCTS. Using this framework, MCTS explores candidate words (and symbols) under the guidance of a pre-trained Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) predictor and generates abundant exploration samples during training. We apply the exploration samples to update the reward simulator and the predictor, based on which we implement another MCTS to search the optimal predictions during inference. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the MCTS inference substantially improves the accuracy of prediction (more than 10%) and achieves a leading performance over other state-of-the-art comparison models.
