Recent studies have shown that Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal commonly measured through skin contacting sensors can be recorded in a contactless manner. The PPG signal results from the optical damping of the skin that varies with the changes in blood volumes. In this study, we propose a robust method to remotely measure heart activity using a low-cost webcam by low software complexity and reduced computational time. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is an effective method. The obtained results with video PPG (vPPG) show high correlation with those obtained by an approved contact sensor.
