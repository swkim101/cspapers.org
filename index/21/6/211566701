Lack of incentives makes most P2P users unwilling to cooperate and lead to free-riding behavior. One way to encourage cooperation is through service differentiation based on each peer’s contributions. This paper presents FuzRep, a reputation system for P2P networks. FuzRep uses fuzzy logic method which uses requester’s reputation and provider’s inbound bandwidth as input information to create incentives for sharing and to avoid overloading problems for primary file providers. Reputation sharing in FuzRep is implemented by interest-based selective polling, which can significantly decrease overheads for reputation communication
