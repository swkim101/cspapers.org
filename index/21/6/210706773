Learning-based methods are growing prominence for planning purposes. However, there are very few approaches for learning-assisted constrained path-planning on graphs, while there are multiple downstream practical applications. This is the case for constrained path-planning for Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicles (AUGV), typically deployed in disaster relief or search and rescue applications. In off-road environments, the AUGV must dynamically optimize a source-destination path under various operational constraints, out of which several are difficult to predict in advance and need to be addressed on-line. We propose a hybrid solving planner that combines machine learning models and an optimal solver. More specifically, a graph convolutional network(GCN) is used to assist a branch and bound(B&B) algorithm in handling the constraints. We conduct experiments on realistic scenarios and show that GCN support enables substantial speedup and smoother scaling to harder problems.
