We introduce Detection and Recognition of Airplane GOals with Navigational Visualization (DRAGON-V), a visualization system that uses probabilistic goal recognition to infer and display the most probable airport runway that a pilot is approaching. DRAGON-V is especially useful in cases of miscommunication, low visibility, or lack of airport familiarity which may result in a pilot deviating from the assigned taxiing route. The visualization system conveys relevant information, and updates according to the airplane's current geolocation. DRAGON-V aims to assist air traffic controllers in reducing incidents of runway incursions at airports.
