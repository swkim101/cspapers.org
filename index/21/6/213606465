In this paper, the fault detection and isolation problem regarding actuation and sensing of a 4-mecanum wheeled mobile robot (4-MWMR) is studied. The challenge with respect to the current state of the art lies in detecting and distinguishing wheel sensor from wheel actuator additive faults for this kind of robots. An approach based on generating residuals is proposed. Sensor faults isolation is based on simply analyzing residual signatures which are different under each sensor fault. Due to omni-move properties, actuator faults are, however, more difficult to be isolated. More residual characteristics must be taken into consideration to achieve the isolation.
