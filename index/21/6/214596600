Network reconfiguration and Distributed generation (DG) integration in distribution systems has become one of the major challenging tasks for power utilities. Despite their prospective solutions for distribution system operation in terms of losses minimization and voltage profile enhancement, the inappropriate choice of DG parameters might lead to undesirable effects such as power losses increase and voltage collapse. This paper presents a combined particle swarm optimization (CPSO) based method for optimal multi-type DG integration and network reconfiguration, considering active power loss minimization as an objective function. The DG penetration level is considered in the range of 20% to 50% of total system load. The efficiency of the proposed technique has been tested on the standard IEEE 33-bus distribution system. Numerical results have proven that the proposed CPSO algorithm can efficiently find optimal solutions compared to other competitive methods in the literature.
