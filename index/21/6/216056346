Resource balancing has been effectively used to mitigate the long-term aging effects of Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) in multi-core and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architectures. In this work, we investigate this strategy in Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) with a novel application-to-CGRA allocation approach. By introducing important extensions to the reconfiguration logic and the datapath, we enable the dynamic movement of configurations throughout the fabric and allow overutilized Functional Units (FUs) to recover from stress-induced NBTI aging. Implementing the approach in a resource-constrained state-of-the-art CGRA reveals 2.2Ã— lifetime improvement with negligible performance overheads and less than 10% increase in area.
