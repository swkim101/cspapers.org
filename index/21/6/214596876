With increasing complex systems, low production costs, and changing technologies, for this reason, the automatic fault diagnosis using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques is more in more applied. In addition, with the emergence of the use of reconfigurable systems, AI can assist in self-maintenance of complex systems. The purpose of this article is to summarize the diagnosis research of systems using AI approaches and examine their application particularly in the field of diagnosis of complex systems. It covers articles published from 2002 to 2018 using Machine Learning tools for fault diagnosis in industrial systems.
