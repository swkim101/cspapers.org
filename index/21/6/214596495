Several methods have been developed in automatic speech recognition systems with high acccuracy in noisy environments. Previous studies have divided speech recognition into three main categories that are: Denoising the signal, adapting the system to the environment or audiovisual recognition by considering the movement of the lips.In fact, the spoken message is more intelligible when it is accompanied by the vision of the speakerâ€™s face, and particularly when the transmission medium is noisy.In this paper, we present an automatic algorithm of lip segmentation used for video sequences. This system has a static module. After locating the face and calculating a bounding box of the mouth, we apply a static algorithm automatically to extract the full contour of the lips by combining active contours and parametric models. Level set method allows finding key points on the contours to position a parametric model composed of cubic curves appropriate to the possible deformations of the lips.Finally, the experiments show that our algorithm allows following the characteristic points with a precision comparable to that of a manual input.
