Sequential data such as time series, video, or text can be challenging to analyse as the ordered structure gives rise to complex dependencies. At the heart of this is non-commutativity, in the sense that reordering the elements of a sequence can completely change its meaning. We use a classical mathematical object -- the tensor algebra -- to capture such dependencies. To address the innate computational complexity of high degree tensors, we use compositions of low-rank tensor projections. This yields modular and scalable building blocks for neural networks that give state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks such as multivariate time series classification and generative models for video.
