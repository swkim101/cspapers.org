Functionality is a fundamental attribute of an object which indicates the capability to be used to perform specific actions. It is critical to empower robots the functionality knowledge in discovering appropriate objects for a task e.g. cut cake using knife. Existing research works have focused on understanding object functionality through human-object-interaction from extensively annotated image or video data and are hard to scale up. In this paper, we (1) mine object-functionality knowledge through pattern-based and model-based methods from text, (2) introduce a novel task on physical object-functionality prediction, which consumes an image and an action query to predict whether the object in the image can perform the action, and (3) propose a method to leverage the mined functionality knowledge for the new task. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our methods.
