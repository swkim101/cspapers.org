More than a billion people still lack access to clean and safe electricity. One of the main obstacles to Energy Access by these populations is the lack of a low-cost and ultra-flexible power electronics technology. This technology should not only evolve with the needs of the user but also adapt its operation to changes in the parameters of the sources or loads it is connected to.In this work a method is proposed to use a modular power electronics module to diagnose the parameters of its input and output. The power converter used in this work is a synchronous buck for its current bi-directionality and voltage flexibility. The model of the synchronous buck is revisited and an equation describing its average inductor current calculated.From the average inductor current, a set of three diagnosis parameters are proposed. These parameters allows the diagnosis of variations in the voltage and resistance of the Thevenin model of either the low-voltage or high-voltage side of the power module. A theoretical study of these parameters is proposed and validated through measurements for one of the three diagnosis parameters. Future work will focus on validating these findings in experimental conditions and defining the impact of the converter parameters in the diagnosis process.
