In this paper, we propose a new metric to address the long-standing problem of center bias in saliency evaluation. We first show that distribution-based metrics cannot measure saliency performance across datasets due to ambiguity in the choice of standard deviation, especially for Convolutional Neural Networks. Therefore, our proposed metric is AUC-based because ROC curves are relatively robust to the standard deviation problem. However, this requires sufficient unique values in the saliency prediction to compute AUC scores. Secondly, we propose a global smoothing function for the problem of few value degrees in predicted saliency output. Compared with random noise, our smoothing function can create unique values without losing the existing relative saliency relationship. Finally, we show our proposed AUC-based metric can generate a more directional negative set for evaluation, denoted as Farthest-Neighbor AUC (FN-AUC). Our experiments show FN-AUC can measure spatial biases, central and peripheral, more effectively than S-AUC without penalizing the fixation locations.
