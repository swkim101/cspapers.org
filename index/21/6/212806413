With the proliferation of mobile device users, the Device-to-Device (D2D) communication has ascended to the spotlight in social network for users to share and exchange enormous data. Different from classic online social network (OSN) like Twitter and Facebook, each single data file to be shared in the D2D social network is often very large in data size, e.g., video, image or document. Sometimes, a small number of interesting data files may dominate the network traffic, and lead to heavy network congestion. To reduce the traffic congestion and design effective caching strategy, it is highly desirable to investigate how the data files are propagated in offline D2D social network and derive the diffusion model that fits to the new form of social network. However, existing works mainly concern about link prediction, which cannot predict the overall diffusion path when network topology is unknown. In this article, we propose D2D-LSTM based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which aims to predict complete content propagation paths in D2D social network. Taking the current user's time, geography and category preference into account, historical features of the previous path can be captured as well. It utilizes prototype users for prediction so as to achieve a better generalization ability. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to use real world large-scale dataset of mobile social network (MSN) to predict propagation path trees in a top-down order. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior prediction performance than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, D2D-LSTM can achieve 95% average precision for terminal class and 17% accuracy for tree path hit.
