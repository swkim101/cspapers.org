Due to the advantages of feasibility, efficiency, and flexibility, carrying out the anti-radar applications by using a heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) team owes more and more attention. During the anti-radar application, the cooperative task assignment is essential and plays a key influence on the final result. Specially, one of the characters of multi-UAV task assignment is the strong temporal relationship. To solve the time-critical task assignment of heterogeneous UAV team, a multi-layer coding genetic algorithm is proposed, which maintains the ability of global search and parallel computing. Eventually, detailed analysis and simulation test show the effectiveness of the algorithm.
