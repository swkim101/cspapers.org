Ensure the correctness of safety critical systems play a key role in the worldwide software engineering. Over the past years we have been helping CASCO Signal Ltd which is the Chinese biggest high speed railway company to develop high speed railway safety critical software. We have also contributed specific methods for developing better safety critical software, including a search-based model-driven software development approach which uses SysML diagram refinement method to construct SysML model and SAT solver to check the model. This talk aims at sharing the challenge of developing high speed railway safety critical system, what we learn from develop a safety critical software with a Chinese high speed railway company, and we use ZC subsystem as a case study to show the systematic model-driven safety critical software development method.
