Pioneer's talk. This talk address the long-term (several decades of R&D) societal and technological challenge of Human Mobility and of Autonomous Driving. Firstly, a brief history of the evolution of the initial revolutionary concept of “automobile” of the last century, towards the exciting new concept of “Automated Driving” developed since the 80’s will be presented. Then, the main addressed challenges as well as the related achievements will be discussed. Emphasis will be placed on scientific and technological challenges related to embedded perception, complex dynamic scenes understanding, and real-time driving decision-making using artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches. The talk will be illustrated using results obtained by INRIA Grenoble Rhone-Alpes (France) in the scope of several R&D projects conducted in collaboration with IRT Nanoelec (French Technological Research Institute) and with several industrial companies such as Toyota or Renault.
