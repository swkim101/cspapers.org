Many applications rely on the integration of geospatial data but very little eﬀort has been made to consolidate the outputs, in particular to share the resulting mappings with the community and make them reusable. Mappings are extremely valuable assets as they can serve as guide to enrich data with other information residing in other datasets. Geographic data are characterized by diﬀerent formats and diﬀerent representation. In this paper we present an ongoing project addressing the need for a ﬂexible and scalable platform of services handling the reconciliation of geospatial data. The platform oﬀers utilities to load, create and maintain mappings between several most know geospatial datasets. On the one hand, this platform allows developers to easily create and manipulate all the mappings required for their application. On the other hand the sets of mappings are also exposed by services, to facilitate integration into applications working with heterogeneous data. Moreover in this paper we discuss several types of real world representation of geospatial data and present a literature review along with a discussion in favor of some interpretations with the aim of deﬁning a shared vision about the problem of geospatial reconciliation that will support further advancements in development of the Semantic Web applications.
