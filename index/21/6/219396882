Cache side-channel attacks abuse microarchitectural designs meant to optimize memory access to infer information about victim processes, threatening data privacy and security. Recently, the ARM architecture has come into the spotlight of cache side-channel attacks with its unprecedented growth in the market. We propose SmokeBomb, a novel cache side-channel mitigation that functions by explicitly ensuring a private space for each process to safely access sensitive data. The heart of the idea is to use the L1 cache of the CPU core as a private space by which SmokeBomb can give consistent results against cache attacks on the sensitive data, and thus, an attacker cannot distinguish specific data used by the victim. Our experimental results show that SmokeBomb can effectively prevent currently formalized cache attack methods.
