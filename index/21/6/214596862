Beside the universe which enhances the interaction of its different components and the alive world which boots its inner interactions with a certain intelligence related to reproduction and communication, it is obvious that the art of invention, manipulation and interpretation are the main features of human intelligence. How is the cooperative dialogue playing a key role in all of that? And precisely between, in one hand, a dominated sense environment conceived with a huge sophisticated concepts, in other hand, a billions of bits reaching, within any executive task, two possible states, in order to rich at the end an amazing interpretable responses. In this paper we are going to stress on those dialogue mechanisms which are based essentially on a philosophical, logical and scientific concept of induction which is tied to deduction or also inference but which in all case lead to action. We will therefore present a general model of dialogue between any type of participants (humans, machines or other) that guarantees both the structural coherence of the conversations and the cognitive coherence of the dialogical acts.
