This paper describes an efficient parallel system for processing Typed Feature Structures (TFSs) on shared-memory parallel machines. We call the system Parallel Substrate for TFS (PSTFS). PSTFS is designed for parallel computing environments where a large number of agents are working and communicating with each other. Such agents use PSTFS as their low-level module for solving constraints on TFSs and sending/receiving TFSs to/from other agents in an efficient manner. From a programmers' point of view, PSTFS provides a simple and unified mechanism for building high-level parallel NLP systems. The performance and the flexibility of our PSTFS are shown through the experiments on two different types of parallel HPSG parsers. The speed-up was more than 10 times on both parsers.
