The paper investigates application of linear-quadratic $(LQ)$ optimal control in the distribution systems with multiple transportation options. In the considered class, the distribution center governs the stock replenishment process of subordinate depots whose stock is depleted according to the market demand. The supply channels have different characteristics with respect to delay and reliability, e.g., train vs. truck delivery. The received goods are inspected for quality defects and rejected as appropriate. Thus, the system faces two major uncertainties: one related to unpredictable demand variations, and another concerning imperfect input channels. A multi-variable LQ optimal control law is synthesized in a closed form and subjected to detailed analytical and numerical treatment. It is formally shown that despite uncertainties the controller establishes a non-negative and upper-bounded replenishment signal and the stock level does not cross the reference value. Conditions for warehouse capacity selection and obtaining full demand satisfaction at the depots are specified and demonstrated analytically.
