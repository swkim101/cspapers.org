In this position paper, through my previous research project (as part of my dissertation for Open Lab in Newcastle University), I will brieﬂy comment on the methodology employed to engage with ‘expert participants’ in future-oriented discussions about Mixed Reality (MR) technology and discuss (i) perceptions on how the current technological status quo including socio-political issues of diversity, inequality and political activism are projected and reproduced in the future; (ii) how the future of work and labour might be affected; and (iii) possible effects of MR in exacerbating phenomena of individualisation and isolation and social tribal-ism. In my research project I engaged with communities and ‘expert participants’ active in critical discussions and development of emerging technologies in Athens, Greece, in a workshop, through the use of the Sci-Fi Prototyping approach, to unpack ideas around the future of MR in the context of civic action and participation. I proposed a methodology for the engagement of experts in discussions around the role of emerging technologies and, through the analysis of the collected data, I contributed a deeper understanding of the socio-technical implications of MR use in the future.
