We consider the classic problem of scheduling jobs with precedence constraints on identical machines to minimize makespan, in the presence of communication delays. In this setting, denoted by $\mathrm{P}\ \vert\ \text{prec}, c\ \vert\ C_{\max}$, if two dependent jobs are scheduled on different machines, then at least $c$ units of time must pass between their executions. Despite its relevance to many applications, this model remains one of the most poorly understood in scheduling theory. Even for a special case where an unlimited number of machines is available, the best known approximation ratio is $2/3\cdot(c+1)$, whereas Graham's greedy list scheduling algorithm already gives a ($c+1$) -approximation in that setting. An outstanding open problem in the top-10 list by Schuurman and Woeginger and its recent update by Bansal asks whether there exists a constant-factor approximation algorithm. In this work we give a polynomial-time $O(\log c\cdot\log m)$-approximation algorithm for this problem, where $m$ is the number of machines and $c$ is the communication delay. Our approach is based on a Sherali-Adams lift of a linear programming relaxation and a randomized clustering of the semimetric space induced by this lift.
