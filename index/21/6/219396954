Intelligent irrigation based on measurements of soil moisture levels in every pot in a greenhouse can not only improve plant productivity and quality but also save water. However, existing soil moisture sensors are too expensive to deploy in every pot. We therefore introduce GreenTag, a low-cost RFID-based soil moisture sensing system whose accuracy is comparable to that of an expensive soil moisture sensor. Our key idea is to attach two RFID tags to a plant's container so that changes in soil moisture content are reflected in their Differential Minimum Response Threshold (DMRT) metric at the reader. We show that a low-pass filtered DMRT metric is robust to changes both in the RF environment (e.g., from human movement) and in pot locations. In a realistic setting, GreenTag achieves a 90-percentile moisture estimation errors of 5%, which is comparable to the 4% errors using expensive soil moisture sensors. Moreover, this accuracy is maintained despite changes in the RF environment and container locations. We also show the effectiveness of GreenTag in a real greenhouse.
