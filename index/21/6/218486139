Many researches have shown that concurrent transmission (CT) helps to improve the energy efficiency and latency of 2.4GHz IEEE-802.15.4-based multi-hop networks. However, it has been shown that the success of CT in IEEE 802.15.4 is mainly due to the DSSS. In view of the great potential of long range sub-GHz technologies for future smart meter applications, we assess the feasibility of applying CT to nonDSSS sub-GHz receivers. In this work, we evaluate the FSKbased receiver performance in the critical case the scenario that concurrent transmitted signals are received with the same power such so the mutual interference become worst. Our evaluations are based on the 2-FSK mode of TI CC1120 chips. The results show that the basic 2-FSK mode is vulnerable to CT. On the other hand, if the FEC and the interleaver are adopted, the receiver can survive in the heavy interfering region as long as the timing offset is smaller than 1 Î¼s and the CFO is larger than 5 KHz.
