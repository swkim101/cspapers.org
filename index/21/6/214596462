Finding faces in the images or in real time situation is a challenging image processing problem. Hence, new approaches have achieved accurate real time detection. This paper aims to find the best face detector and specifically proper for real time detection for further work. Different face detection algorithms are analyzed and compared namely: (1) Haar-like features, (2) Local Binary Pattern and (3) Histogram of oriented object. For this aim, the multimodal RECOLA database is used. The test is implemented using the python language with Opencv and the dlib libraries. After applying and evaluating the face detectors on each video, the obtained experimental results proved that the Histogram of oriented object algorithm has the efficient detection rate of 62.16% out of the three methods while the LBP algorithm has the fastest frame rates of 33.79 frames per second.
