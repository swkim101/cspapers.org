Urban population grows constantly. By 2050 two thirds of the world population will reside in urban areas. This growth is faster and more complex than the ability of cities to measure and plan for their sustainability. To understand what makes a city inclusive for all, we define a methodology to identify and characterize spatial subdivisions: areas with over- and under-representation of specific population groups, named hot and cold spots respectively. Using aggregated mobile phone data, we apply this methodology to the city of Barcelona to assess the mobility of three groups of people: women, elders, and tourists. We find that, within the three groups, cold spots have a lower diversity of amenities and services than hot spots. Also, cold spots of women and tourists tend to have lower population income. These insights apply to the floating population of Barcelona, thus augmenting the scope of how inclusiveness can be analyzed in the city.
