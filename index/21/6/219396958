Volumetric videos allow viewers to exercise 6-DoF (degrees of freedom) movement when watching them. Due to their true 3D nature, streaming volumetric videos is highly bandwidth demanding. In this work, we present to our knowledge a first volumetric video streaming system that leverages deep super resolution (SR) to boost the video quality on commodity mobile devices. We propose a series of judicious optimizations to make SR efficient on mobile devices.
