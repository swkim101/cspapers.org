In the paper the new approach to the automated generation of the industrial robot tool trajectory was developed. This approach is based on the use of the operator interface implemented in the virtual reality environment. This interface displays a three-dimensional model of the industrial robot working area, obtained by means of the computer vision system. This model is used to specify the tool trajectory. The proposed interface allows to simplify and accelerate the industrial robots programming for perform technological operations in a working environment.
