Trajectory prediction has always been a challenging problem for autonomous driving, since it needs to infer the latent intention from the behaviors and interactions from traffic participants. This problem is intrinsically hard, because each participant may behave differently under different environments and interactions. This key is to effectively model the interlaced influence from both spatial context and temporal context. Existing work usually encodes these two types of context separately, which would lead to inferior modeling of the scenarios. In this paper, we first propose a unified approach to treat time and space dimensions equally for modeling spatio-temporal context. The proposed module is simple and easy to implement within several lines of codes. In contrast to existing methods which heavily rely on recurrent neural network for temporal context and hand-crafted structure for spatial context, our method could automatically partition the spatio-temporal space to adapt to the data. Lastly, we test our proposed framework on two recently proposed trajectory prediction dataset ApolloScape and Argoverse. We show that the proposed method substantially outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods while maintaining its simplicity. These encouraging results further validate the superiority of our approach.
