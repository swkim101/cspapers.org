The ability to execute and analyze code makes many security tasks such as exploit development, reverse engineering, and vulnerability detection much easier. However, on embedded devices such as Android smartphones, executing code in-vivo, on the device, for analysis is limited by the need to acquire such devices, the speed of the device, and in some cases the need to flash custom code onto the devices. The other option is to execute the code ex-vivo, off the device, but this approach either requires porting or complex hardware emulation.In this paper, we take advantage of the observation that many execution paths in drivers are only superficially dependent on both the hardware and kernel on which the driver executes, to create an ex-vivo dynamic driver analysis framework for Android devices that requires neither porting nor emulation. We achieve this by developing a generic evasion framework that enables driver initialization by evading hardware and kernel dependencies instead of precisely emulating them, and then developing a novel Ex-vivo AnalySIs framEwoRk (EASIER) that enables off-device analysis with the initialized driver state. Compared to on-device analysis, our approach enables the use of userspace tools and scales with the number of available commodity CPUâ€™s, not the number of smartphones.We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework by targeting privilege escalation vulnerabilities in system call handlers in platform device drivers. We find it can load 48/62 (77%) drivers from three different Android kernels: MSM, Xiaomi, and Huawei. We then confirm that it is able to reach and detect 21 known vulnerabilities. Finally, we have discovered 12 new bugs which we have reported and confirmed.
