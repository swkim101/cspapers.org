This paper presents a 3-DOF linkage-driven underactuated finger for achieving several different grasp modes. This finger mechanism is constructed by stacking one five-bar mechanism over one double parallelogram. This special architecture allows for installing all of the actuators on the base. A 2-finger robotic gripper having three actuators is developed for performing self-adaptive power grasping, parallel precision grasping, grasping during contact with the environment, and other grasping tasks through changing the orientation of the distal phalanx actively. The performance of the gripper is confirmed through both simulation and practical grasping experiment.
