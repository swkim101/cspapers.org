The CTAR All-Star is a system consisting of a rubber ball, a pressure sensor, and a bluetooth transmitter paired with a cross-platform mobile application. The device is used as a rehabilitation tool for people with dysphagia in a similar fashion to the traditional chin tuck against resistance (CTAR) exercise by squeezing a ball between the chin and upper chest. The mobile device monitors and displays the pressure inside the ball on a real-time graph allowing the patient to follow exercise routines set by Speech-Language Pathologists. Additionally, the application stores exercise data that can be used to both monitor the patientâ€™s progress over time and provide objective data for future research purposes. keywords: chin tuck against resistance, dysphagia, rehabilitation.
