The Coupled-Tank (CT) system remains an important tool for research by process control engineers. In this paper, we have addressed the issue of performance analysis of three control schemes, PI (based on pole placement, ZN and Ciancone correlation tuning methods), PI-plus-feedforward and MPC which have not been done in the present literatures. However, effective control of a system depends largely on the accuracy of the mathematical model that predicts its dynamic behaviour.
