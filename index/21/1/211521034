This lightning talk describes three different styles of beginning of semester review and a study designed to show which styles are more or less effective. An initial study comparing traditional review and traditional review with the addition of an educational video game was completed with 33 subjects in three classes. The study found that students showed more confidence on specific tasks, such as recursion, and improved their answers for questions on those topics after playing the game during their review. However, the students who played the game were less confident, compared to their peers, in their overall ability in computer science. For more reliable results a second study should be run with more participants. While the initial research focused on review with and without game play incorporated into the review, a second study would split the first condition in two, review with and without additional practice problems. Faculty who might be interested in participating this research by collecting data in their classes or collaborating with the proposer to develop the second study should email the proposer.
