One of the main challenges in the vision-based grasping is the selection of feasible grasp regions while interacting with novel objects. Recent approaches exploit the power of convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve accurate grasping at the cost of high computational power and time. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised learning based algorithm for the selection of feasible grasp regions. Unsupervised learning infers the pattern in dataset without any external labels. We applied k-means clustering at every sampling stage in image plane to identify the grasp regions, followed by axes assignment method. We define a novel concept of Grasp Decide Index (GDI) to select the best grasp pose in the image plane. We have conducted several experiments in clutter or isolated environment on standard objects of Amazon Robotics Challenge 2017 and Amazon Picking Challenge 2016. We compared the results with prior learning based approaches to validate the robustness and adaptive nature of our algorithm for a variety of novel objects in different domains.
