This work introduces a novel 12-motor paired-cable actuation scheme to achieve rolling locomotion with a spherical tensegrity structure. Using a new point mass tensegrity dynamic formulation which we present, we utilize Model Predictive Control to generate optimal state-action trajectories for benchmark evaluation. In particular, locomotive performance is assessed based on the practical criteria of rolling speed, energy efficiency, and directional trajectory-tracking accuracy. Through simulation of 6-motor, 12-motor paired cable, and 24-motor fully-actuated policies, we demonstrate that the 12-motor schema is superior to the 6-motor policy in all benchmark categories, comparable to the 24-motor policy in rolling speed, and is over five times more energy efficient than the fully-actuated 24-motor configuration.
