GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovations) has been used in network research and education for more than one decade. However, very few institutions utilize the virtual machines (VM) deployed on GENI for generalized computer education. One major reason is the limited user interface offered by GENI VMs. In this poster, we introduce the desktop environment to GENI VMs, thereby widening the student base in computer education. Specifically, as the demand of Cybersecurity education increases, we show that by introducing the desktop environment to the existing flexible network topology, GENI becomes more inclusive in offering cybersecurity education to a wide range of students, ranging from entry level students, who are unfamiliar with command line interface, to the advanced students, who are interested in sophisticated network attacks and preventions. The preliminary student survey result shows that most students have no problem using GUI lab environment.
