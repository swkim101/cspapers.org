We developed a 3D serious game that teaches and reinforces programming concepts. An innovative feature allows instructors to create customized challenges that students solve in the context of the game, allowing instructors to use the game to effectively target course topics or skills. A web-based portal gives instructors access to data about student performance in the game.
