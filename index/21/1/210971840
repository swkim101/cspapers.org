We present the ANBOT, an intelligent robotic coworker for physical human-robot collaboration. The ANBOT system assists workers performing industrial abrasive blasting, shielding them from the large forces experienced during this physically demanding task. The co-operative robotic system combines the strength and endurance of robots with the decision making of skilled workers. The inherent challenges in human-robot collaboration, combined with the difficult blasting environment required novel design decisions to be made and new solutions to be developed. These include an approach for handling kinematic singularities in a manner suitable for human-robot co-operation, estimating worker pose under poor visibility conditions, and an intuitive control scheme that adapts the robotic assistance based on the estimated strength of the worker. In this work we summarise the ANBOT system and present findings from preliminary site trials. The trials included several real industrial blasting tasks under the control of a skilled abrasive blasting worker who had no experience working alongside a robot. Results demonstrate the suitability of the ANBOT for practical industrial applications.
