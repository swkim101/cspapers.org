In this paper, we present a multi-camera sensor system along with its control algorithm for automated visual inspection from a moving vehicle. To accomplish this task, we propose a unique hardware configuration consisting of a frontal stereo vision system, six lateral cameras motorized to tilt, and a GPS/IMU sensor mounted on the roof of a car. From the frontal stereo system, we detect electric poles and estimate their corresponding 3D positions. Based on this 3D estimation, the tilt angles of the motorized lateral cameras are controlled in real-time to capture high resolution images of the equipment - typically installed a few meters above the road surface. In addition, inertial odometry information from the GPS/IMU module is utilized for pose estimation, object localization, and re-identification among cameras. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our system for automated electric equipment maintenance, which can reduce human effort significantly.
