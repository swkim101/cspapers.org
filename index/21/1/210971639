A novel compact parallel gripper with wide stroke is proposed in this paper. Conventional parallel grippers with linear guide mechanisms have been widely utilized as end effectors of robots, especially in industrial fields, because of its simple mechanism and low cost nature. However, the width of the gripper is larger than the stroke due to the mechanical structure of its linear guide mechanism. When objects with various dimensions need to be grasped by a gripper, the width of the gripper is determined by the largest distance between fingers necessary for grasping all of the objects. This makes the collision avoidance of robot difficult even when handling a small object compared to the width of the gripper. The novel compact gripper proposed in this article has three features: long finger stroke with compact dimensions, fingersâ€™ parallel motion along a single linear trajectory, and driven by a single actuator. The finger backlash and the gripping force of the proposed mechanism are analyzed, and the parallel gripper with the mechanism is designed based on the analyses. A prototype gripper with minimum width 64 mm, whose maximum fingers stroke is 121 mm, is developed, and experimental results illustrate the performance of the developed gripper.
