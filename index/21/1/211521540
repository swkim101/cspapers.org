Software engineers must be able to manage complex projects, so that skills such as teamwork, leadership or initiative are critical to their successful development. Because of this, it is fundamental that the learning of software engineering as an academic discipline provides solid links between theory and practice. Educational frameworks such as those derived from the European Higher Education Area state that student-centered approaches are a useful tool for achieving these objectives. In this context, we present a project-based learning (PBL) experience report in a software engineering program of a Spanish university. The experience is based on the formation of small heterogeneous teams, which face the initial phases of a software methodology during the development of a project close to a real one. Through a strategy of role rotation and documentation transfer, all students perform different tasks and face different challenges throughout the project. Summative assessment is also adopted, considering not only teacher ratings but also students' peer assessment. The results prove the positive effect of using PBL to improve the training of students in acquiring different skills as future software engineers.
