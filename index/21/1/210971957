Pneumatic rotational stepper motors can be used to actuate MR (magnetic resonance) safe robotic systems. This paper describes novel techniques to minimize the volumetric size and/or step size of such motors in order to cope with the limited space requirements while still delivering high precision. Three designs are presented: the R-10 measures 1.0 cm3, has step size 12.9° and torque 1.2 N mm. The R-40 measures 25.6 cm3, has step size 1.01° and torque 470 N mm. The R-54 measures 46.7 cm3, has step size 1.01 m° and torque 240 N mm. The particularly small step size in the R-54 motor is achieved by using a high-reduction planetary gear.These three motors demonstrate that small-scale rotational stepper motors with a wide range of step sizes and good torque characteristics can be constructed that surpass state-of-art designs by a considerable margin. This allows the advancement of MR safe robotics towards more compact and versatile designs, and also overcome certain existing limitations by combining multiple motors with different specifications.
