Traditional monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms have been extensively studied and proven to reliably recover a sparse structure and camera motion. Nevertheless, the sparse structure is still insufficient for scene interaction, e.g., visual navigation and augmented reality applications. To densify the scene reconstruction, the use of single-image absolute depth prediction from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for filling in the missing structure has been proposed. However, the prediction accuracy tends to not generalize well on scenes that are different from the training datasets.In this paper, we propose a dense monocular SLAM system, named DeepRelativeFusion, that is capable to recover a globally consistent 3D structure. To this end, we use a visual SLAM algorithm to reliably recover the camera poses and semi-dense depth maps of the keyframes, and then use relative depth prediction to densify the semi-dense depth maps and refine the keyframe pose-graph. To improve the semi-dense depth maps, we propose an adaptive filtering scheme, which is a structure- preserving weighted average smoothing filter that takes into account the pixel intensity and depth of the neighbouring pixels, yielding substantial reconstruction accuracy gain in densification. To perform densification, we introduce two incremental improvements upon the energy minimization framework proposed by DeepFusion: (1) an improved cost function, and(2) the use of single-image relative depth prediction. After densification, we update the keyframes with two-view consistent optimized semi-dense and dense depth maps to improve pose- graph optimization, providing a feedback loop to refine the keyframe poses for accurate scene reconstruction. Our system outperforms the state-of-the-art dense SLAM systems quantitatively in dense reconstruction accuracy by a large margin.For more information, see the demo video and supplementary material.
