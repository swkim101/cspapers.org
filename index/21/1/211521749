To address the challenging issues presented to a technology-driven generation, we have been designing and testing 15-20 minute modules with conversations surrounding ethical issues in computing and data science. The goal is to meet the needs of current students by incorporating engaging activities, including demonstrations, debates, and interactive quizzes, to maintain their interest and promote critical thinking. The short length of the modules allows them to fit with packed courses and short attention spans. The curriculum is designed to lay the groundwork in the first year, giving a basic understanding of four ethical frameworks. In years two through four, students gain practice in recognizing course material-related dilemmas and in applying these frameworks to find ethical solutions. Additionally, we are developing comprehensive background materials so that professors with limited experience in ethics can easily implement the modules in their classrooms, and students who do not experience the foundational modules will not feel lost. Through workshops, focus groups, and in-class testing of the materials, teachers and students have shown excitement and support for the curriculum, and students not typically engaged in class have found their voice. Verbal and written feedback have shown that the module activities have been successful in helping students evaluate the ethicality of challenging computing-related situations and in effectively articulating their conclusions. To date, twelve modules have been tested, modified, and in some cases re-tested. We are looking forward to sharing our results. Many of the materials created will be available for examination.
