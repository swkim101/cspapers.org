Creation is important process in learning programming for chil-dren. It is said that children can learn well by actually creatingprograms. In a programming workshop for children, an exampleprogram is illustrated to children prior to the creation activities. Itis assumed that children can create programs using the illustratedprogram. However, there are many cases in which it is difficultfor children to use the example programs, and they can not createprograms. This paper proposes a system that supports creationactivities by exemplifying programs from search by visual queries.Visual queries composed of sprites and emoji were applied in thissystem as children are familiar with visual environment.
