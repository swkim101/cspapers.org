Robotic arms can perform grasping actions thanks to their “dexteorus” part, i.e. the gripper. Among the various categories, nowadays pneumatic grippers became the most employed in industry, as they have low cost and little bulkiness. Despite their simplicity, controlling the force applied by these grippers is not straightforward due to the dependence of such a force on the air pressure in the gripper chambers. As a result, it is still tricky to implement closed-loop force control for pneumatic grippers. This paper intends to deliver a control scheme relying on the force measurement to control pneumatic grippers. The force might be measured through a commercial sensor (e.g. a load cell) and fed back to close the control loop. This includes a calibration which maps the force-pressure relation taking into account both desired force and length of the gripper fingers. The control scheme exploits two different pressure regulators to precisely adjust the air pressure inside the gripper chambers (i.e. opening and closing chambers). To this aim, a quadratic programming algorithm is employed. The control scheme performance revealed to be good: results will be shown in terms of gripper response to sinusoidal and step inputs, along with the pressure-force characterization.
