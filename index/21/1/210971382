In this paper, a novel method to construct a versatile gripper which can grasp various sizes and shapes of objects is proposed. The design and construction of this gripper is based on a paper folding technique called ‘modular origami’ This particular type of origami is constructed from multiple modules which can transform its shape by rotation. The gripper is actuated by a single motor using a linkage mechanism. The grasping part of this gripper is made of paper, thus it provides sufficient compliance to bend itself and create multiple contact points around objects with different shapes. This gripper can be used in two modes: force grasping and cage grasping. The proposed gripper was tested on objects with various shapes, weights and sizes. Furthermore, how the property of the paper affects the performance of the gripper was also tested. The thickness of the gripper material affects the compliance of the gripper and the range of sizes of objects which can be successfully gripped.
