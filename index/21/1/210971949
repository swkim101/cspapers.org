Imitation learning offers a general framework where robots can efficiently acquire novel motor skills from demonstrations of a human teacher. While many promising achievements have been shown, the majority of them are only focused on single-stroke movements, without taking into account the problem of multi-tasks sequencing. Conceivably, sequencing different atomic tasks can further augment the robotâ€™s capabilities as well as avoid repetitive demonstrations. In this paper, we propose to address the issue of multi-tasks sequencing with emphasis on handling the so-called competing constraints, which emerge due to the existence of the concurrent constraints from Cartesian and joint trajectories. Specifically, we explore the null space of the robot from an information-theoretic perspective in order to maintain imitation fidelity during transition between consecutive tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulated and real experiments on the iCub humanoid robot.
