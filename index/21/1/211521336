Using the same assessment questions for all students is problematic, especially in large classes. In exams, it incentivizes students to glean answers from neighbours or memorize answers to past questions. In homework, it encourages copying and the use of cheating websites. Individualized assessments remove these incentives and encourage concept-oriented discussions among students rather than mere memorization and exchange of answers. They render copying ineffective, and make posts on cheating websites traceable, effectively mitigating collusion and plagiarism. However, individualized assessments are traditionally expensive to create and grade for all but small classes. Dividni (www.dividni.com), our free framework for creating individualized assessments, reduces this expense and creates a unique assessment for each student in classes of any size. It also enables auto-grading. We use Dividni at the University of Auckland for printable homework, online assessments and examinations, all individualized, for some of our largest classes in computer systems, programming, networking, and cybersecurity, ranging from CS1 to CS3. This demo is a tutorial introduction to using Dividni for creating individualized assessments. We will demonstrate three individualized assessment contexts: printable homework, online assessments, and examinations. The audience will have the opportunity to create their own printable homework and multiple-choice assessments. Bring a laptop with the latest .NET framework or Mono installed. Basic knowledge of HTML and C# will be useful.
