The execution of modern web applications is affected by distribution, mobility, and heterogeneity. The design-time assumptions of web applications rarely correspond to their runtime conditions. As a result, the efficiency, performance, and reliability of web app execution can suffer. This dissertation research addresses this problem by introducing novel automated reengineering techniques. In particular, we put forward a series of novel domain-specific refactorings, semantics-preserving program transformations, that behind-the-scenes improve the efficiency, performance, and reliability of extant web applications. To that end, we apply state-of-the-art program analysis and transformation techniques, extending and adapting them for the domain of web applications. Our ultimate objective is to enhance the execution of real-world web apps to meet the requirements of modern users, so the web can remain the most versatile computing application deployment and delivery infrastructure. The intermediate results of this dissertation research have been accepted for publication as a full research paper in the proceedings of the Web Conference 2020 [3].
