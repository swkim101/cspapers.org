As departments search for meaningful ways to incorporate material on ethics into the computer science curriculum, effective assessment is critical. Motivated by a framework proposed by the ImpactCS project, we describe simple open-ended questions that could provide insight into learners' progress from awareness through evaluation to responsible behavior. In a study of 22 graduating seniors at a liberal arts college we found more complete answers to our open-ended questions tended to correlate with students' perception of personal growth in ethical awareness since arriving at college.
