Accurate object 6D pose estimation is a core task for robot bin-picking applications, especially when objects are randomly stacked with heavy occlusion. To address this problem, this paper proposes a simple but novel Point-wise Pose Regression Network (PPR-Net). For each point in the point cloud, the network regresses a 6D pose of the object instance that the point belongs to. We argue that the regressed poses of points from the same object instance should be located closely in pose space. Thus, these points can be clustered into different instances and their corresponding objects’ 6D poses can be estimated simultaneously. In our experiments, PPR-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by 15% - 41% in average precision when evaluated on the benchmark Siléane dataset. In addition, it also works well in real world robot bin-picking tasks.
