Recently, diverse research has actively been conducted to control the posture of jumping robots using an inertial tail mechanism. However, the inertial tail mechanism has a high probability of collision with obstacles. In this study, a momentum wheel mechanism is proposed to achieve the same attitude control performance while reducing the volume occupied by the inertial tail mechanism. To verify the performance of the momentum wheel mechanism, we proposed a jumping robot with a momentum wheel mechanism and performed a dynamic analysis, simulation, and experiments on a jumping robot with a momentum wheel mechanism. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the momentum wheel mechanism can contribute to control of the body angle of the jumping robot. As a result, the momentum wheel mechanism can enhance the stability of the jumping robot more than the tail mechanism, and the momentum wheel mechanism contributes to the attitude control of the body angle, which allows the jumping robot to perform continuous jumping.
