Recent development of electronic voting (e-voting) systems has been focusing on blockchain-based design [4]. Despite blockchain’s advantages in public verifiability, existing blockchain-based voting systems are impractical due to the high block time and transaction costs of the underlying blockchain. To achieve verifiability and efficiency simultaneously, we propose Hybrid-Voting, a hybrid structured e-voting system that combines an untrusted centralized server with smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain. In addition, voter anonymity and privacy are guaranteed by using short linkable ring signature and ElGamal encryption. Our evaluation shows that Hybrid-Voting can support 10k voters by using one commodity computer, and the cost per voter is less than one US dollar, much lower than the cost per voter in today’s elections [1].
