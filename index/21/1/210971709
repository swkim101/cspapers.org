This paper presents a novel strategy for autonomous graph-based exploration path planning in subterranean environments. Attuned to the fact that subterranean settings, such as underground mines, are often large-scale networks of narrow tunnel-like and multi-branched topologies, the proposed planner is structured around a bifurcated local-and global-planner architecture. The local planner employs a rapidly-exploring random graph to reliably and efficiently identify collision-free paths that optimize an exploration gain within a local subspace. Accounting for the robot endurance limitations and the possibility that the local planner reaches a dead-end (e.g. a mine heading), the global planner is engaged when a return-to-home path must be derived or when the robot should be re-positioned towards an edge of the exploration space. The proposed planner is field evaluated in a collection of deployments inside both active and abandoned underground mines in the U.S. and in Switzerland.
