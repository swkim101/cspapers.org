In this poster, we describe our experiences with improving student preparedness in a junior-level course, Introduction to Operating Systems and Networking, that is taught in multiple modalities. The course is designed around the use of Active Learning techniques and the face-to-face version uses the Flipped Classroom model. Course content, termed 'preparatory work', is delivered to students via lecture videos and online readings/tutorials. Students then engage with the course material via hands-on, application-oriented activities. One of the challenges we faced when we first 'flipped' this class is that students would not perform the necessary preparatory work before class. To address this issue, we explored the use of forcing functions, i.e., course design elements that help ensure the completion of preparatory work by students. We discuss the different forms of forcing functions that we used and present preliminary results on their effectiveness in improving preparedness.
