With the increased popularity of cameras, more and more people are interested in learning photography. People are willing to invest in expensive cameras as a medium for their artistic expression, but few have access to in-person classes. Inspired by critique sessions common in in-person art practice classes, we propose design principles for creative learning. My dissertation research focuses on designing new interfaces and interactions that provide contextual in-camera feedback to aid users in learning visual elements of photography. We interactively visualize results of image processing algorithms as additional information for the user to make more informed and intentional decisions during capture. In this paper, we describe our design principles, and apply these principles in the design of two guided photography interfaces: one to explore lighting options for a portrait, and one to refine contents and composition of a photo.
