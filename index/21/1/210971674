For underactuated bipedal robots, it is important to compensate disturbances which affects the zero dynamics to realize a stable locomotion when we use output zeroing controllers. In order to deal with such disturbances, this paper presents a framework of a periodic trajectory planning and a robust output zeroing controller using a disturbance model learned by Gaussian process regression (GPR). In particular, we propose a control method considering the modeling uncertainty of the disturbance model by using a variance information of GPR model. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method through a numerical simulation of walking control of an underactuated robot model affected by an external force.
