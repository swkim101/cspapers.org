The recent years have seen a surge of interest in methods for imaging beyond the direct line of sight. The most prominent techniques rely on time-resolved optical impulse responses, obtained by illuminating a diffuse wall with an ultrashort light pulse and observing multi-bounce indirect reflections with an ultrafast time-resolved imager. Reconstruction of geometry from such data, however, is a complex non-linear inverse problem that comes with substantial computational demands. In this paper, we employ convolutional feed-forward networks for solving the reconstruction problem efficiently while maintaining good reconstruction quality. Specifically, we devise a tailored autoencoder architecture, trained end-to-end, that maps transient images directly to a depth-map representation. Training is done using a recent, very efficient transient renderer for three-bounce indirect light transport that enables the quick generation of large amounts of training data for the network. We examine the performance of our method on a variety of synthetic and experimental datasets and its dependency on the choice of training data and augmentation strategies, as well as architectural features. We demonstrate that our feed-forward network, even if trained solely on synthetic data, is able to obtain results competitive with previous, model-based optimization methods, while being orders of magnitude faster.
