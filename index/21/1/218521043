Networks evolve continuously over time not only with the addition and deletion of links and nodes but also with changes in the importance of edges. Even though many networks contain this type of temporal weightings, vast majority of research in network representation learning and classification has focused on static snapshots of the graph, while largely ignoring the temporal dynamics. In this work, we describe two approaches for incorporating weighted temporal information into network embedding methods such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). While the first approach aggregates time-weighted edges and nodes, the second approach uses temporal random walks to find relevant convolution nodes. With experiments on public and proprietary datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TimeSage for link prediction tasks. By applying these predictions, we show improvements in our task of identifying fraudulent actors on a large e-commerce website selling software as subscriptions.
