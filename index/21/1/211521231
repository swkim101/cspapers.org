Computational thinking (CT) is a problem solving approach that is becoming prominent in educational settings. To help ease students into the world of programming, visual programming tools such as Scratch are used. Researchers are also developing various tools in an attempt to assess students' proficiency in thought processes that make up CT. However, current existing tools mainly utilize students' final code products when evaluating their demonstration of CT, losing their opportunity to understand students' actual learning and programming procedures. This work presents a logging methodology that records programming actions of students in the Scratch block coding environment to enable an in-depth analysis of students' programming process. With this logging methodology, we conducted a case study with introductory programmers to study how the logs of students' programming processes can provide insight into how they practice CT during programming.
