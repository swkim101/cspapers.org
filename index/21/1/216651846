The ability to reverse engineer a hardware netlist in order to detect malicious logic has become an important problem in recent years. Much work has been done on algorithmically identifying structure and state in circuits; the first step of which is to separate control signals from data signals. The most current tools rely on topological comparisons of logic in order to identify signals which are uniquely structured in the netlist, as these signals are likely control signals. However, topological comparisons become less effective when a netlist has been resynthesized and optimized. We present a new tool, RELIC-FUN, based on netlist slicing and functional comparison of logic. Experimental results show that depending on netlist size, optimization, and control logic density, the proposed algorithm can be more accurate, and faster, than existing topological algorithms in many cases.
