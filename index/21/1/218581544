This paper considers the problem of estimating the information leakage of a system in the black-box scenario, i.e. when the system's internals are unknown to the learner, or too complicated to analyze, and the only available information are pairs of input-output data samples, obtained by submitting queries to the system or provided by a third party. The frequentist approach relies on counting the frequencies to estimate the input-output conditional probabilities, however this method is not accurate when the domain of possible outputs is large. To overcome this difficulty, the estimation of the Bayes error of the ideal classifier was recently investigated using Machine Learning (ML) models, and it has been shown to be more accurate thanks to the ability of those models to learn the input-output correspondence. However, the Bayes vulnerability is only suitable to describe one-try attacks. A more general and flexible measure of leakage is the g-vulnerability, which encompasses several different types of adversaries, with different goals and capabilities. We propose a novel approach to perform black-box estimation of the g-vulnerability using ML which does not require to estimate the conditional probabilities and is suitable for a large class of ML algorithms. First, we formally show the learnability for all data distributions. Then, we evaluate the performance via various experiments using k-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Networks. Our approach outperform the frequentist one when the observables domain is large.
