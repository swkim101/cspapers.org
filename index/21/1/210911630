We propose and demonstrate a framework called perception as prediction for autonomous driving that uses general value functions (GVFs) to learn predictions. Perception as prediction learns data-driven predictions relating to the impact of actions on the agent’s perception of the world. It also provides a data-driven approach to predict the impact of the anticipated behavior of other agents on the world without explicitly learning their policy or intentions. We demonstrate perception as prediction by learning to predict an agent’s front safety and rear safety with GVFs, which encapsulate anticipation of the behavior of the vehicle in front and in the rear, respectively. The safety predictions are learned through random interactions in a simulated environment containing other agents. We show that these predictions can be used to produce similar control behavior to an LQR-based controller in an adaptive cruise control problem as well as provide advanced warning when the vehicle behind is approaching dangerously. The predictions are compact policy-based predictions that support prediction of the long term impact on safety when following a given policy. We analyze two controllers that use the learned predictions in a racing simulator to understand the value of the predictions and demonstrate their use in the real-world on a Clearpath Jackal robot and an autonomous vehicle platform.
