Recent developments in virtual reality and robotic technologies have allowed investigating the behavioural and brain mechanisms that grounds self-consciousness in the multi-sensory (e.g. vision and touch) and sensorimotor processing of bodily signals. Yet, previous technological solutions to apply tactile stimuli for body illusion induction limit participants movements, do not allow for stimulations in dynamic environments (e.g., the subject walking), and can hardly be integrated into real-life settings and complex, interactive, virtual reality environments. Here, we present the development and first validation of a new semi-wearable haptic system, based on vibration technology, to induce a range of bodily illusions that are of relevance for research in psychiatry. This is a first step towards the development of wearable haptic systems able to administer touch and induce specific bodily illusions under dynamic conditions and in real-life settings.
