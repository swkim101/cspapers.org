Currently, there is a big concern on governments and research institutes on assessing the population awareness about the scientific innovations, such as new food production technologies and the development of drugs against emerging and neglected diseases. There is an unmet demand for new ways to show the impact of scientific research on social media (populationâ€™s main communication vehicles) and assess the social outreach of the scientific output. This article presents a novel web tool to map research impacts via Altmetrics, wich are alternative metrics based on the exchange of scientific knowledge on social media and online environments.
