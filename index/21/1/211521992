This poster will present a novel experimental case-study that focuses on the merits of teaching software-security to CS0 and CS1 learners by demonstration of how vulnerable programming of the Cozmo robot can lead to unexpected robot-behavior. It will introduce our unique Cozmo secure-coding lesson-plan, as a new experiential-learning model, which combines learning of software-security concepts with educational-robotics (ER) in the form of hands-on, interactive coding. It will compare a conventional approach of teaching software-security via secure-coding lessons with our unconventional technique of teaching secure-coding using Cozmo. It will present student-survey based learning-assessment data collected from our experiment of offering secure-coding lessons to a diverse group of CS0 and CS1 learners through traditional secure-coding training-modules, which involve no ER. It will, then, compare these data with the student-survey based learning-assessment data gathered from our Cozmo secure-coding sessions. It will analyze these comparative-results in an effort to show preliminary evidence of the effectiveness and potential of our approach for more enhanced and engaging learning of software-security via defensive programming of Cozmo. Prior research in ER indicates that a social-robot can be an effective platform for teaching coding and cyber concepts. However, there is very limited work on the efficacy of teaching secure-coding using social-robots. Hence, our fresh, non-traditional approach of making CS0 and CS1 learners explore hands-on secure-coding through Cozmo is a first-of-its-kind research case-study in an attempt to fill this gap.
