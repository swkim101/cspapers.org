Enhancing social popularity of a post (i.e., the number of views or likes) on social network services is important for both ordinary users and companies who want to promote themselves. In this paper, we have implemented an online tagging support system to achieve this using an algorithm that recommends appropriate hashtags considering not only content popularity but also user popularity. The effectiveness of this technology has been verified by actually uploading photos with recommended hashtags on a real social network service.
