New consent management platforms (CMPs) have been introduced to the web to conform with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, particularly its stronger requirements for consent when companies collect and process users personal data. This work analyses the most prevalent CMP designs and measures their effect on people’s consent choices. First, we scraped the designs of the ﬁve most popular CMPs on the top 10,000 websites in the UK (n=680). We found that dark patterns and implied consent are ubiquitous; only 11.7% meet the minimal requirements we set based on European law. Second, we conducted a ﬁeld experiment with 40 participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent rates. We found that notiﬁcation style (banner or barrier) has no effect; removing the opt-out button from the ﬁrst page increases consent by 22-23 percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the ﬁrst page decreases consent by 8–20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an efﬁcient way to increase compliance.
