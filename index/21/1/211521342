Many computer science departments have chosen to hire faculty to teach in teaching-track positions that parallel the standard tenure-track position, providing the possibility of promotion, longer-term contracts, and higher pay for excellence in teaching and service. This birds-of-a-feather is designed to gather educators, both experienced and new to teaching track positions, who are currently in such a position to share their experiences as members of the faculty of their departments and schools, and to provide opportunities for schools considering such positions to gather information. This year, we plan on discussing teaching load, particularly as it relates to expanding class sizes and limited budgets for teaching staff support (e.g., TAs, graders, etc.). We will also discuss office hours strategies for both faculty and TAs in light of the same large class-size concerns.
