Linguistic computation is the fundamental and primitive branch of the art of cumputatlon~ as I have remarked off and on. The insight of yon Neumann~ that operations and data can be represented in the same storage device, is the linguistic insight that anything can have a name in any language. (Whether anything can have a definition is a different question.) I recall surprising a couple of colleagues with this r~ark early in the 1960s, when I had to point out the obvious fact that compillng and interpreting are linguistic procedures and therefore that only in rare instances does a computer spend more time on mathematics than on linguistics. By now we all take the central position of our subject matter for granted. I express this overly familiar truth only for the pragmatic reason that some familiar truths are more helpful than others in preparing for a given discourse.
