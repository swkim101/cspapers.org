Relational databases have dominated both industry usage and academic database courses for decades. More recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of NoSQL database systems, especially in data science. Bringing NoSQL databases to the classroom is important not only to prepare our students for the technology that they will face, but also because the underlying paradigm introduces new ideas that are not typically emphasized in a relational-only database course alone. However, NoSQL systems seem to receive dramatically less coverage in undergraduate database curricula than relational systems do. This panel discusses examples of how NoSQL can be introduced into undergraduate education, and the possible challenges faced in doing so. Questions from the audience will be invited.
