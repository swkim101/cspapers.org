RDF question/answering(Q/A) system allows users to ask questions in natural language on a knowledge base represented by RDF and retrieve answers. A common problem in RDF Q/A is that existing works tend to translate a natural language question into an incomplete SPARQL query, which means that SPARQL queries may not fully understand userâ€™s ideas. For example, some triple patterns may be missing in the question translation stage. In this poster, we first present a siamese adaptation of the Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) network to detect whether the SPARQL query generated by the RDF Q/A system is complete. Then, for incomplete queries, we propose a Markov-based method to supplement SPARQL queries. Finally, we compare our approach with some state-of-the-art RDF Q/A systems in the benchmark dataset. Extensive experiments confirm that our method improves the precision significantly.
