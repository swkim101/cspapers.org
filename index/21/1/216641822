We discuss the synergetic connection between quantum computing and artificial intelligence. After surveying current approaches to quantum artificial intelligence and relating them to a formal model for machine learning processes, we deduce four major challenges for the future of quantum artificial intelligence: (i) Replace iterative training with faster quantum algorithms, (ii) distill the experience of larger amounts of data into the training process, (iii) allow quantum and classical components to be easily combined and exchanged, and (iv) build tools to thoroughly analyze whether observed benefits really stem from quantum properties of the algorithm.
