In this paper, we propose a two-view fusion based convolutional neural network to estimate road areas in urban environments with LiDAR point clouds as input only. The proposed network takes two transformed LiDAR data representations, the LiDAR imageries and the camera-perspective maps, as inputs. It outputs pixel-wise road detection results in both the LiDAR’s imagery view and the camera’s perspective view simultaneously, in an end-to-end manner. To make better use of the data associations between two representations, we construct a novel mapping layer to transform features from the LiDAR’s imagery view to the camera’s perspective view in order to strengthen the road detection performance in the camera’s perspective view. Experiments on the KITTI-Road dataset show that the proposed network can achieve the state-of-the-art performance among all LiDAR-only methods in real time.
