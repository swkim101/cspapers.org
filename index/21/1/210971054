Robot Dynamic Simulators offer convenient implementation and testing of physical robots, thus accelerating research and development. While existing simulators support most real-world robots with serially linked kinematic and dynamic chains, they offer limited or conditional support for complex closed-loop robots. On the other hand, many of the underlying physics computation libraries that these simulators employ support closed-loop kinematic chains and redundant mechanisms. Such mechanisms are often utilized in surgical robots to achieve constrained motions (e.g., the remote center of motion (RCM)). To deal with such robots, we propose a new simulation framework based on a front-end description format and a robust real-time dynamic simulator. Although this study focuses on surgical robots, the proposed format and simulator are applicable to any type of robot. In this manuscript, we describe the philosophy and implementation of the front-end description format and demonstrate its performance and the simulatorâ€™s capabilities using simulated models of real-world surgical robots.
