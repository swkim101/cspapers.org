In this paper, we describe the use of calibration techniques to help improving prediction accuracy of models for soft actuators. A finite-difference model considering anisotropy of soft actuator flexible chamber is combined with experimental identification to assess actuator motion. Identifiability conditions are exploited to determine suitable experimental conditions, taking into account the manufacturing process capabilities, multimaterial additive manufacturing in this context. As a second contribution, a soft actuator with Wren mechanism for reinforcement is being developed. It is considered for rotary actuation, with the description of a proof of concept. The interest of the calibration technique and the actuator design are finally discussed.
