With the increasing popularity of e-commerce, the number of product-related queries generated by customers is growing. Answering these queries manually in real time is infeasible, and so automatic question-answering systems can be immensely helpful. Product queries are, however, very different from open-domain questions: they tend to be product-specific and the answers they demand can be very subjective. Previous research suggests that reviews are a valuable resource for answering product queries, but a key challenge is the language mismatch between user queries and reviews. To address this, we propose two neural models that discover relevant reviews for answering product queries. We demonstrate that our best model produces strong performance, outperforming state-of-the-art systems by consistently finding the most relevant reviews for product queries.
