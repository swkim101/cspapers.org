SASIL is a domain-specific language to describe and execute the specification of scheduling systems. The language interpreter operates on time-dependent behaviors and reactive events to simulate the described system. Furthermore, the interpreter is capable of selecting the appropriate actions needed to automatically schedule necessary components of the system to resolve requests. The DSL was tested by implementing an elevator control system, which is defined as a series of button requests and the requirements needed to complete each request. A multi-elevator system described using the language allowed the interpreter to complete requests 1.04 times faster on average than the traditional elevator algorithm.
