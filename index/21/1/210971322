Learning by imitation is a powerful way that can reduce the complexly in searching space. It could help the mobile robot to acquire new skills from interaction with a human-being in natural way. In this paper, the dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) is utilized to imitate the trajectory from human walking. DMPs is a modified formulation of virtual spring-dampers (VSD) system that enjoys better fitting performance in learning. Further, while dealing with the trajectory tracking problem of mobile robots, a novel nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) approach is proposed for motion control. The nonlinear MPC scheme applies a new neural network named Varying-parameter Lagrangian Neural Network (VP-LNN) to solve a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem by iterating over a finite receding horizon. The new network of VP-LNN can converge to the global optimal solution. Thus, a new human-robot interaction (HRI) scheme for mobile robot is proposed, which can reduce the complexity in motion planning in various applications.
