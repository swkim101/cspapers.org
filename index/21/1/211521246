This poster describes an effort to design labs for teaching algorithms through gamification and visualization. In order to make the labs doable and enjoyable, games are crafted under four simple rules. Visualization code is provided for each lab, so that students only need to focus on developing solutions to implement algorithms. Students work in pairs and demonstrate solutions of labs visually using pictures or animations at the end. This experience helps students to engage in the learning process.
