Targeting global EDF scheduling, this paper proposes a conditionally optimal algorithm for parallelizing tasks with parallelization freedom. For this, we extend the interference-based sufficient schedulability analysis and derive monotonic increasing properties of both tolerance and interference for the schedulability. Leveraging those properties, we propose a one-way search based conditionally optimal algorithm with polynomial time complexity. Our extensive experiments through both simulation and actual implementation show that our proposed approach can significantly improve the schedulability up to 60 percent.
