There are a great number of resources to introduce CS in the K-8 space, most notably Scratch and code.org. There are two AP CS courses at the High School level, but there are not nearly as many resources to bridge the gap between the engaging, fun, K-8 resources and those AP courses. And what is available tends to lack continuity and rigor. It is generally accepted that coding and creativity go hand-in-hand. This is apparent in the learning opportunities in the K-8 space but as programming courses get more challenging, they tend to lose the creative aspect. In this demo, attendees will be able to unpack how students can learn to code as they learn to create, They will also discover resources that support creativity while introducing students to text-based programming through coding in Python with CMU Graphics. The goal of this session is to provide teachers with an opportunity to learn how they can bridge the gap from block-based coding experiences to the AP courses with a text-based, year-long, introduction to programming course whose only recommended prerequisite is algebra readiness. We will be using CMU CS Academy which teaches students to code in Python through a browser-based graphics and animation framework that provides instant, automated feedback and has a strong focus on creativity and problem-solving.
