PT Indonesia Power UP Semarang committed to helping Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to continue to increase their potential to create works that have a positive impact on the economy and other aspects so that the fostered partners can be independent. CSR as a form of corporate goodwill in developing good relations with the community will be a priority on positive companies. This study uses explanatory research methods that can be accepted between variables with the Pearson test of 30 respondents who receive CSR benefits and live around the company site. Based on hypothesis testing conducted using Pearson analysis, it shows the relationship between CSR quality variables and those recognized by the company. It is evidenced by the high Pearson conversion coefficient with a value of 0.470 and a significance value of 0.009. This value represents the difference between CSR quality and company awards. It is contrary to the theory of Griffin (2008), which stated that corporate social responsibility is one of the factors forming corporate or management trust.
