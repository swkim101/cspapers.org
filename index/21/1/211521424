This study investigated school-wide integration of computational thinking (CT) in elementary schools of: 1) systems-level approaches to integration; 2) teachers' understanding and implementation of CT integration, and 3) challenges to integration. Data sources include interviews with teachers, professional development (PD) providers, principals as well as implementation observations. Findings revealed three distinct approaches: (a) Lone STEM teacher implementer, (b) PD scaffolded approach, and (c) Whole school coach-in-residence approach. Teachers generally viewed CT in the context of problem-solving. Although struggles and challenges existed in all three schools, administrators, PD providers, and teachers all had a high commitment to CT integration.
