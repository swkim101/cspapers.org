Superior operation skills for hydraulic excavators are learned over time. Therefore, it is difficult to improve the skills of non-expert operators quickly, and their work needs to be supported. This paper presents a control system, which realizes smooth digging (similar to that performed by expert operators), based on the Center of Mass velocity of the attachment as an index. In addition, corresponding to the system switching caused by the digging reaction force, a controller gain tuning method that uses the Fictitious Exogenous Signal is proposed. The proposed method is applied to a hydraulic excavator, and its effect is verified.
