Numerous studies have shown that Game-Based Learning positively impacts educational effectiveness and student motivation. However, according to Amabile's Componential Model of Creativity, motivation is only one aspect of creativity, next to expertise and creative skills. Therefore, we looked beyond motivational aspects in order to amplify all dimensions of creativity. In a 'Software Design in C++' course at our local faculty of Engineering Technology, students learn to apply high-level object-oriented software development techniques on low-level embedded hardware. By introducing the Game Boy Advance (GBA), a 32-bit handheld released by Nintendo in 2001, students not only need the domain-specific technical expertise and motivation to succeed, but also the right creative skills to cope with the limitations of this embedded system that has only 96kb of VRAM. We focused the labs on stimulating these creative problem-solving techniques. Results are promising: students were highly motivated and creative output was distinctly increased; but technical expertise was still lacking during examination. Further work involves investigating the impact of peer-assessment on all aspects of creativity.
