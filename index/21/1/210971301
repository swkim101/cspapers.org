Doffing robot is an important part of the spinning process in the textile production. This paper analyzes the doffing process of spinning machines and points out the requirements of the structure and functions of the doffer. The locking two-finger gripper, the three-dimensional circulating operation mechanism, the collaborating locating mechanism with the toothed disc and the pre-loosening mechanism by rotating spindles are designed. On this basis the continuous vertical-pulling automatic doffing robot, named CVP doffing robot, for the ring spinning is developed. The kinematics and dynamics analysis of the CVP doffing robot are carried out. The structural parameters of the CVP doffing robot are optimized by establishing kinematics and dynamics models. The forces of pulling out cops before and after the pre-loosing operation are tested. On this basis, the strength of the key components is designed and checked. Finally, the performance of the CVP doffing robot is verified by the doffing experiment.
