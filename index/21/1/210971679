Mobile multi-robot construction systems offer new ways to optimise the on-site construction process. In this paper we begin to investigate the functionality requirements for controlling a team of robots to build structures much greater than their individual workspace. To achieve these aims, we present a mobile extruder robot called YouWasp. We also begin to explore methods for collision aware printing and construction task decomposition and allocation. These are deployed via YouWasp and enable it to deposit material autonomously. In doing so, we are able to evaluate the potential for parallelization of tasks and printing autonomy in simulation as well as physical team of robots. Altogether, these results provide a foundation for future work that enable fleets of mobile construction systems to cooperate and help us shape our built environment in new ways.
