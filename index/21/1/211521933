Over the past decade, active learning pedagogical approaches have increased in popularity among multiple STEM disciplines, including Computer Science (CS). The purpose of this experience report is to reflect on the efforts taken to incorporate active learning into some of the undergraduate CS courses at the University of Georgia. This report describes the implementation details of two courses, CS2 and Discrete Mathematics, as taught during the Spring semester in 2019 with a total initial enrollment count of 551, and it summarizes the results of a common set of anonymous exit survey responses collected by the instructors on a subset of that population. In these courses, active learning was implemented using a flipped classroom model with undergraduate peer learning assistants. The surveyed population consisted of 163 CS2 students and 125 Discrete Mathematics students. The responses suggest that students either understand or believe that the active learning activities they participated in helped with their learning, especially regarding confidence and question formation. However, 67.36% of responses reported a high degree of state anxiety when receiving new assignments. Additionally, while 89.58% of responses expressed a desire to take a class with peer learning assistants in the future, only 40.63% indicated a preference for active learning when compared to traditional lecture. The course instructors discuss how they will use the insights ascertained via the exit surveys as evidence when deciding changes for future iterations of the courses.
