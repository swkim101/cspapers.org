In this paper, we address the makeup transfer task, which aims to transfer the makeup from a reference image to a source image. Existing methods have achieved promising progress in constrained scenarios, but transferring between images with large pose and expression differences is still challenging. Besides, they cannot realize customizable transfer that allows a controllable shade of makeup or specifies the part to transfer, which limits their applications. To address these issues, we propose Pose and expression robust Spatial-aware GAN (PSGAN). It first utilizes Makeup Distill Network to disentangle the makeup of the reference image as two spatial-aware makeup matrices. Then, Attentive Makeup Morphing module is introduced to specify how the makeup of a pixel in the source image is morphed from the reference image. With the makeup matrices and the source image, Makeup Apply Network is used to perform makeup transfer. Our PSGAN not only achieves state-of-the-art results even when large pose and expression differences exist but also is able to perform partial and shade-controllable makeup transfer. Both the code and a newly collected dataset containing facial images with various poses and expressions will be available at https://github.com/wtjiang98/PSGAN.
