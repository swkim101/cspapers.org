Wheeled robots operating in the field are faced with mobility challenges such as drop-offs, slippery slopes, and cluttered environments. In these situations, it is desirable to have agile and highly mobile platforms. This paper explores the utilization of multiple rotors to enhance the mobility of ground vehicles. A strategy based on downward thrust generation is developed to increase traction and surmount otherwise non-traversable slippery inclines. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed solution.
