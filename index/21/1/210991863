Splitting criteria have played an important role in the construction of decision trees, and various trees have been developed based on different criteria. This work presents a unified framework on various splitting criteria from the perspective of loss functions, and most classical splitting criteria can be viewed essentially as the optimizations of loss functions in this framework. We further introduce a new splitting criterion, named pairwise gain, which is motivated from a lower bound on the mutual coupling of pairwise loss. Theoretically, we prove that this new criterion is robust to symmetric and asymmetric label noises simultaneously. Based on this new criterion, we develop another variant of random forests, and extensive experiments are provided to verify its robustness.
