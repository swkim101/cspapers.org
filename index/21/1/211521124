For many years, summer computing camps have been offered as a means to attract girls and underrepresented groups to computing. This lightning talk describes the current effort to assess the return on investment for a girls only summer computing camp program offered for ten years at a Midwestern university in the U.S. In the 9th year of the program, the sponsoring college observed changing trends that suggested a need to evaluate the program's short and long term impacts and either discontinue the program or develop a new approach for the future. In this, the 11th year since the program started, a review team has been formed to 1) evaluate enrollment and retention numbers from years one through 10, 2) evaluate demographic trends among the girls who participated in the program, 3) review annual pre- and post-camp camper surveys to assess interim impacts, and 4) track campers' current school and/or career status (through a combination of alumni surveys and university enrollment records) to identify long term impacts. Following this initial assessment, the review team will compare program recruitment and retention processes to similar programs and organizations and more recent research-based developments in diversity-focused programs and outreach. The ultimate goal of this project is to move beyond summer computing camps to a more effective approach to recruiting more women and underrepresented groups to the computing field. We will share our 10-year results, lessons learned and suggestions for future efforts in this area and gather audience feedback.
