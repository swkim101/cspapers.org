Torque controlled robots have the capability of implementing compliant behavior with back-drivability. In practice, however, joint elasticity often prevents an accurate position tracking performance of a robot. In particular, humanoid robots are influenced more by elasticity because of a long kinematic chain between the feet and hands. In this paper, we present a new inverse dynamics based control approach for torque controlled humanoid robots with joint elasticity. When formulating the operational space control framework, feedback control consists of only motor-related parts with measured motor angle values, and the link dynamics is compensated by the feedforward terms. The experiment results of the proposed approach show a noticeable improvement in the position tracking performance in 6-DoF manipulator. Finally, the proposed method was applied to a torque controlled biped robot for walking. Both stiff motion control of the CoM and compliant motion control of the foot were simultaneously achieved, demonstrating the advantage of the torque controlled robot.
