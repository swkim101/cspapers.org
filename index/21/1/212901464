Many real-world data sets are represented as graphs, such as citation links, social media, and biological interaction. The volatile graph structure makes it non-trivial to employ convolutional neural networks (CNN's) for graph data processing. Recently, graph attention network (GAT) has proven a promising attempt by combining graph neural networks with attention mechanism, so as to achieve massage passing in graphs with arbitrary structures. However, the attention in GAT is computed mainly based on the similarity between the node content, while the structures of the graph remains largely unemployed (except in masking the attention out of one-hop neighbors). In this paper, we propose an `````````````````````````````"ADaptive Structural Fingerprint" (ADSF) model to fully exploit both topological details of the graph and content features of the nodes. The key idea is to contextualize each node with a weighted, learnable receptive field encoding rich and diverse local graph structures. By doing this, structural interactions between the nodes can be inferred accurately, thus improving subsequent attention layer as well as the convergence of learning. Furthermore, our model provides a useful platform for different subspaces of node features and various scales of graph structures to ``cross-talk'' with each other through the learning of multi-head attention, being particularly useful in handling complex real-world data. Encouraging performance is observed on a number of benchmark data sets in node classification.
