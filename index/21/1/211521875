Formal education often relies on the students' ability to make connections among different subjects, as they navigate through a curriculum packed with different topics. In order to facilitate the preparation to the workforce, we created a course in "Sustainability and Technology" that was cross-listed in the degrees of Applied Information Technology and Environmental Sustainability. This manuscript documents our efforts in creating an indoor farm by letting students from different majors collaborate on this shared project. The results of our survey support the benefits of letting students collaborate as they approach the end of their undergraduate studies.
