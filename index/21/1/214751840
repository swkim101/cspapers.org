The software quality index, SPQL (Software Product Quality Level), is proposed. The index indicates the software quality based on program test results and consists of two subindices: the test accuracy index and the test coverage index. The test accuracy index can be measured by applying the capture-recapture method . Pseudo defects called control defects are seeded prior to the test and their capture ratio is measured as the ratio of the number of detected defects to the estimated number of detectable defects (estimated by applying the software reliability growth model ). Two experimental results are presented and the SPQL is compared with both the ordinary capture-recapture method and the software reliability growth prediction based method. The result indicates that the SPQL is practical.
