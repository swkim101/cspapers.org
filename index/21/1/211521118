The Blackbox project collects programming activity data from users of BlueJ, a Java IDE aimed at novices. The Blackbox data set has grown very large, with several terabytes of source code data. This is a double-edged sword; it provides large amounts of data for analysis, but it can be difficult for newcomer researchers to get started with analysis. In this workshop we will introduce attendees to analysing the data by using Blackbox Mini: a new curated subset of the Blackbox data set, designed to help researchers try out their source code analyses on a smaller data set. The workshop will be run by the designers and maintainers of the Blackbox (and Blackbox Mini) data sets. Attendees at the workshop will learn how to work with the Blackbox Mini data set, including basic source code analysis. The Blackbox Mini data set can provide useful publishable research results itself, or the analyses can be carried over and run on larger subsets of the full Blackbox data set.
