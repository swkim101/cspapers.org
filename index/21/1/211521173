There has been extensive research about the CS1 course. Much less has been written about the CS2 course, which is often a gateway course for CS majors. CS2 classes often reflect a second semester course in programming, yet when studying this course many universities have different purposes for this course. This poster shows the programming languages used in CS2 courses by the CS programs on the 28th Reid List of First Programing Languages. The languages used in CS1 and CS2 courses are discussed and the transitions between languages as students progress from their first course to their second. The analysis will then be discussed.
