The instructors in conventional classes play a crucial role in motivating students to participate in class activities. However, in asynchronous online courses, such a relationship where the instructor act as the observer and the motivator is missing. In this paper, we performed an experiment on an online introductory course in computer science to understand how personalized feedback emails can address this limitation. For this purpose, we designed a forecasting system to analyze the progress of students towards the end of the semester and predict their final grades. Our quantitative and qualitative data analysis shows how such a feedback system can improve both the performance and the level of satisfaction of students in the online classes. More than ~42% of students ended up getting grades better than their expected scores, and ~78% of students confirmed that the feedback emails motivated them to enhance their engagement in the class discussions.
