As the task of predicting a personalized ranking on a set of items, item recommendation has become an important way to address information overload. Optimizing ranking loss aligns better with the ultimate goal of item recommendation, so many ranking-based methods were proposed for item recommendation, such as collaborative filtering with Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss, and Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise (WARP) loss. However, the ranking-based methods can not consistently beat regression-based models with the gravity regularizer. The key challenge in ranking-based optimization is difficult to fully use the limited number of negative samples, particularly when they are not so informative. To this end, we propose a new ranking loss based on importance sampling so that more informative negative samples can be better used. We then design a series of negative samplers from simple to complex, whose informativeness of negative samples is from less to more. With these samplers, the loss function is easy to use and can be optimized by popular solvers. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with five real-world datasets of varying size and difficulty. The results show that they consistently outperform the state-of-the-art item recommendation algorithms, and the relative improvements with respect to NDCG@50 are more than 19.2% on average. Moreover, the loss function is verified to make better use of negative samples and to require fewer negative samples when they are more informative.
