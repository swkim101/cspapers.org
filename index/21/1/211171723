The research interest in specialized hardware accelerators for deep neural networks (DNN) spikes recently owing to their superior performance and efficiency. However, todayâ€™s DNN accelerators primarily focus on accelerating specific "kernels" such as convolution and matrix multiplication, which are vital but only part of an end-to-end DNN-enabled application. Meaningful speedups over the entire application often require supporting computations that are, while massively parallel, ill-suited to DNN accelerators. Integrating a general-purpose processor such as a CPU or a GPU incurs significant data movement overhead and leads to resource under-utilization on the DNN accelerators.We propose Simultaneous Multi-mode Architecture (SMA), a novel architecture design and execution model that offers general-purpose programmability on DNN accelerators in order to accelerate end-to-end applications. The key to SMA is the temporal integration of the systolic execution model with the GPU-like SIMD execution model. The SMA exploits the common components shared between the systolic-array accelerator and the GPU, and provides lightweight reconfiguration capability to switch between the two modes in-situ. The SMA achieves up to 63% performance improvement while consuming 23% less energy than the baseline Volta architecture with TensorCore.
