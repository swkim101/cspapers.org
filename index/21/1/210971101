This paper presents an approach for modeling new soft robotic materials which possess the ability to control directional stiffness. These materials are inspired by biological systems where movements are enabled by variable stiffness tissue and contraction of localized muscle groups. Here a low-melting-point (LMP) material lattice embedded in an elastomer serves as a rigid skeleton that may be locally melted to allow bending at selectable joint locations. The forward kinematics of the lattice has been modeled using the product of exponentials method with the incorporation of bending axis selectivity. In this paper, we develop this model to account for torques imposed by tendons, and we model the elastomerâ€™s resistance to bending as a torsional spring at the selected joints. Thus we obtain a two-way relationship between tendon forces and joint angles/axes. The concept of applying traditional robot modeling strategies to selectively compliant robotic structures could enable precise control of dexterous soft robots that satisfy stringent safety criteria.
