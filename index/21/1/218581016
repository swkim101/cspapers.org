Session-based recommendation aims to predict a user's actions at the next timestamp based on anonymous sessions. Previous work mainly focuses on the transition relationship between items that the user interacted with during an ongoing session. They generally fail to pay enough attention to the importance of the items involved in these interactions in terms of their relevance to user's main intent. In this paper, we propose a Session-based Recommendation approach with an Importance Extraction Module, i.e., SR-IEM, that considers both a user's long-term and recent behavior in an ongoing session. We employ a modified self-attention mechanism to estimate item importance in a session, which is then used to predict user's long-term preference. Item recommendations are produced by combining the user's long-term preference and their current interest as conveyed by the last item they interacted with. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two publicly available benchmark datasets. The proposed SR-IEM model outperforms start-of-the-art baselines in terms of Recall and MRR for the task of session-based recommendation. In addition, compared to state-of-the-art models, SR-IEM has a reduced computational complexity.
