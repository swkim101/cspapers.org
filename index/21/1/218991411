This paper presents a fuzzing framework for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) BIOS with the Simics virtual platform. Firmware has increasingly become an attack target as operating systems are getting more and more secure. Due to its special execution environment and the extensive interaction with hardware, UEFI firmware is difficult to test compared to user-level applications running on operating systems. Fortunately, virtual platforms are widely used to enable early software and firmware development by modeling the target hardware platform in its virtual environment before silicon arrives. Virtual platforms play a critical role in left shifting UEFI firmware validation to pre-silicon phase. We integrated the fuzzing capability into Simics virtual platform to allow users to fuzz UEFI firmware code with high-fidelity hardware models provided by Simics. We demonstrated the ability to automatically detect previously unknown bugs, and issues found only by human experts.
