Master manipulators represent a key component of Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RAMIS). In this paper, an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is used to construct an effective workspace analysis framework, which can assist the configuration selection and design evaluation of a portable master manipulator for surgical robot control and training. The proposed framework is designed based on three criteria: 1) compactness, 2) workspace quality, and 3) mapping efficiency. A hardware prototype, called the Hamlyn Compact Robotic Master (Hamlyn CRM), is constructed following the proposed framework. Experimental verification of the platform is conducted on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) with which a da Vinci robot is controlled as a slave. The proposed Hamlyn CRM is compared with Phantom Omni, a commercial portable master device, with results demonstrating the relative merits of the new platform in terms of task completion time, average control speed and number of clutching.
