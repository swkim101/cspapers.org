The enrichment of the application scenarios of rotorcrafts presents new challenges for the study of their aerodynamic characteristics, such as operating above a building surface of finite size. In this paper, the ground effect is divided into infinite ground effect and finite ground effect, and three types of finite ground effects with different blocked area are studied. Through numerical simulations, the rotor thrust data and flow field figures in ground effect are obtained. Based on the rotor thrust data, mathematical models are established to describe the rotor thrust alteration caused by infinite and finite ground effect. The analysis of the flow field reveals the mechanism of the finite ground effect.
