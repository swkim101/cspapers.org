Scholar profiling is usually invited to provide junior researchers with domain-specific concepts systematically, but the organization of domain literatures is usually time-consuming. Then, an automatic scholar profiling method is preferred. Firstly, to extract some properties of a given scholar, structured data, like infobox in Wikipedia, are often used as training datasets. But it may lead to serious mis-labeling problems, such as institutions and alma maters, and a Fine-Grained Entity Typing method is expected. Thus, a novel Relation Embedding method based on local context is proposed to enhance the typing performance. Also, to highlight critical concepts in selective bibliographies of scholars, a novel Keyword Extraction method based on Learning to Rank is proposed to bridge the gap that conventional supervised methods fail to provide junior scholars with relative importance of keywords. Categories of experiments were conducted to evaluate the Relation Embedding method and the Keyword Extraction method, which show that the proposed approaches outperform existing baseline methods notably.
