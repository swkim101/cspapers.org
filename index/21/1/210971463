While rehabilitation of upper-limb motor function with human-interactive robots has been met with success, robot-aided locomotor rehabilitation has proven challenging. To inform more effective approaches to robotic gait therapy, it is important to understand neuro-mechanical dynamics and control of unimpaired locomotion. Our previous studies reported that human gait entrained to periodic mechanical perturbations at the ankle when the perturbation period was close to preferred walking cadence. Moreover, entrainment was accompanied by synchronizing the perturbations to a constant gait phase, the same for all subjects, where they provided mechanical assistance. To test the generality of entrainment-based assistance, the present study evaluated the behavior of five unimpaired subjects who walked overground while wearing a hip exoskeleton robot. Periodic torque pulses were applied to the subjectsâ€™ hips, with a period different from, but close to, their preferred stride cadence. Results indicated that unimpaired subjects entrained their gait to periodic mechanical perturbations at the hip. Convergence of relative phase between gait and perturbations was observed, but clustered around two distinct gait phases, in contrast to the single converged phase observed in entrainment to periodic ankle torques. These entrainment studies quantify important aspects of the nonlinear neuro-mechanical dynamics underlying the control of walking, which will inform the development of effective approaches to robotic walking therapy.
