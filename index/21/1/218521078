In my doctoral research, I focus on inferring personal information from conversational texts. Such unstructured input does not provide sufficient explicit assertions, hence, personal facts have to be inferred from latent cues or speech style. In my work I investigate what salient attributes can be extracted from dialogues and which tools may be applicable for that.
