Remote inspection of a complex environment is a difficult, time consuming task for human operators to perform. The need to manually avoid obstacles whilst considering other performance factors i.e. time taken, joint effort and information gained represents significant challenges to continuous operation. This paper proposes an autonomous robotic solution for exploration of an unknown, complex environment using a high DoF robot arm with an eye in hand depth sensor. The main contribution of this work is a new strategy to find the next best view by evaluating frontier regions of the map to maximise coverage, in contrast to many current approaches which densely sample joint or workspace configurations of the robot. Multiple utility functions were evaluated that showed different behaviours. Our results indicated that the presented algorithm can explore an arbitrary environment efficiently while optimising various performance criteria based on the utility function chosen, application constraints and the desires of the user.
