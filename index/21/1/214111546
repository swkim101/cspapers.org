 Watertightness is an important property for CAD models, yet it is not generally available in commercial systems. This paper introduces watertight hybrid B-spline based B-reps that maintain the original parameterization and representation except in narrow regions around trimming curves, where BÃ©zier triangle type regions seal the model. The new representation matches the model space trimming curve exactly. It can be discretized for analysis and fabrication in a straightforward manner without requiring any post modeling repair operations. We apply this representation to mechanical models and more sculptured models to demonstrate small parametric distortion and arbitrarily small geometric error.
