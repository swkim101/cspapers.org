Continuum robots composed of elastic backbones have a broad application prospect in the narrow and restricted environment because they overcome the disadvantages of traditional articulated robots, such as being bulky and inflexible. Statics plays an important role in the planning and control of the continuum robot composed of the elastic backbone. Pseudo-Rigid Body (PRB) theory has shown great potential in the description of flexible body statics. The PRB 3R model accurately describes the large deformation of the flexible body and has high computational efficiency. However, PRB 3R models mostly focus on the planar static modeling, and there are few applications in three-dimensional (3D) statics. In this paper, a 3D static modeling method of cable-driven continuum robot based on PRB 3R theory is proposed. By introducing the equilibrium constraint equations of resultant force/moment and bending plane normal of the elastic backbone, the state of the continuum robot is determined. The 3D static equations established by the proposed method take into account the comprehensive effects of the elastic force, external force, gravity and friction. A static verification experiment system of the cable-driven continuum robot is designed to verify the proposed method. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified by comparison with experimental data. The maximum position error between simulation and experimental results is 7.6%.
