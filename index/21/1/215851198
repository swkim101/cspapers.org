As considerable amounts of POI check-in data have been accumulated, successive point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is increasingly popular. Existing successive POI recommendation methods only predict where user will go next, ignoring when this behavior will occur. In this work, we focus on predicting POIs that will be visited by users in the next 24 hours. As check-in data is very sparse, it is challenging to accurately capture user preferences in temporal patterns. To this end, we propose a category-aware deep model CatDM that incorporates POI category and geographical influence to reduce search space to overcome data sparsity. We design two deep encoders based on LSTM to model the time series data. The first encoder captures user preferences in POI categories, whereas the second exploits user preferences in POIs. Considering clock influence in the second encoder, we divide each userâ€™s check-in history into several different time windows and develop a personalized attention mechanism for each window to facilitate CatDM to exploit temporal patterns. Moreover, to sort the candidate set, we consider four specific dependencies: user-POI, user-category, POI-time and POI-user current preferences. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large real datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our CatDM outperforms the state-of-the-art models for successive POI recommendation on sparse check-in data.
