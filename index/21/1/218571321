We study active preference learning as a frame-work for intuitively specifying the behaviour of autonomous robots. A user chooses the preferred behaviour from a set of alternatives, from which the robot learns the userâ€™s preferences, modeled as a parameterized cost function. Previous approaches present users with alternatives that minimize the uncertainty over the parameters of the cost function. However, different parameters might lead to the same optimal behaviour; as a consequence the solution space is more structured than the parameter space. We exploit this by proposing a query selection that greedily reduces the maximum error ratio over the solution space. In simulations we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other state of the art techniques in both learning efficiency and ease of queries for the user. Finally, we show that evaluating the learning based on the similarities of solutions instead of the similarities of weights allows for better predictions for different scenarios.
