We introduced the disturbance degree of ground and proposed an evaluation method to measure the mobile performance of a crawler on soft ground during direction switching. First, we developed a planar omnidirectional crawler, which had a configuration with two left and right unit crawlers for performing turning motion, as the target for evaluation. Second, by utilizing the proposed disturbance degree of ground evaluation method, we investigated how the turning and translational motions of the crawler mechanism affected soft ground by measuring the flow of sand on a horizontal surface. It was quantitatively shown that translational motion switched the travel direction with lesser disturbance to the road surface compared to turning motion. We confirmed that ground disturbance could be evaluated during direction switching using the proposed method.
