Smart cities have emerged significantly since their initial appearance in 1990s, more and more cities around the world are striving to gain intelligence and in this regard the need for standardization and performance measurement grows. Given the current challenges in the field of smart cities, this work revisits the proposed “cityDNA” framework which has been designed to detect the interrelations between smart city dimensions and form city profile. This work contribute to further enable benchmarking and measuring the maturity of smart cities through the exploitation of international standards and civil engagement. The proposed framework along with the design of a web application will handle urban data effectively. “cityDNA” that will be advanced to receive and utilize urban data and visualize cities’ health and maturity metrics is presented, while potential constraints on its implementation are highlighted.
