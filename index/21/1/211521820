Instructors are increasingly flipping their classrooms, where students are required to study on their own prior to in-class time with the instructor. We present preliminary results on identifying student online behavior patterns in a CS1 flipped course that correlate with students' test scores covering the material explained in the online videos. We found that clustering students based on how much of the online lecture videos they watched allows us to find significant differences in the average test scores of each cluster.
