This lightning-talk will discuss our novel work towards making undergraduate research a required part of our CS freshmen classes as a High-Impact-Practice (HIP) activity. We have developed a nifty undergrad-scholarly-creative-activity (URSCA) as a mandatory assignment for CS freshmen in this pilot experiment. We are investigating whether undergrad research can be included in an equitable and inclusive manner at the freshmen level so that it is accessible to all students for enhanced learning, better experience and more impactful professional development. Thus, this project is an initiative towards bringing URSCA to CS freshmen in a user-friendly and accessible form, so that the opportunity to taste URSCA is not limited to a few i.e. only the talented, self-motivated and selected CS students. The goal of this project is to discover a user-friendly and an equity-focused way for exposing CS freshmen to the essence of URSCA, which includes understanding the notion of a research-question, how to read and analyze research-articles, how to identify research-questions and think out-of-the-box, and how to develop writing-skills. Our innovative URSCA-HIP assignment has been designed as a team project for CS freshmen, with each team being assigned a senior CS student as a peer research mentor. We are collecting survey-data from the freshmen research-mentees and their corresponding senior research-mentors in order to evaluate our unique URSCA-HIP experiential-learning model, and gauge its overall efficacy. To our knowledge, this is a first-of-its-kind initiative of engaging CS freshmen in an inclusive, equity-focused URSCA-HIP experience through a user-friendly but required class project.
