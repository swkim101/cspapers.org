This lightning talk describes a pair of on-campus events and their possible effects on student retention and graduate employment rate. The Physics Department at St. Mary's College of Maryland has built a program to help its students prepare for the job market. This fall I replicated one part of this program in the computer science department with a two-hour networking event at which alumni answered questions as part of a panel and then participated in a speed dating type meet and greet with current students. In the future I would like to hold similar events while collecting data on how student's understanding of career opportunities change as a result of the event, and in the long term the difference in career type and employment rate. I would also like to test the effect of these events on student perception of diversity in the field of computer science. Faculty who might be interested in holding similar events and collecting data on their campus' or collaborating with the proposer to develop the study should email the proposer
