We present two proofs of coherence for cartesian closed bicategories. Precisely, we show that in the free cartesian closed bicategory on a set of objects there is at most one structural 2-cell between any parallel pair of 1-cells. We thereby reduce the difficulty of constructing structure in arbitrary cartesian closed bicategories to the level of 1-dimensional category theory. Our first proof follows a traditional approach using the Yoneda lemma. For the second proof, we adapt Fiore's categorical analysis of normalisation-by-evaluation for the simply-typed lambda calculus. Modulo the construction of suitable bicategorical structures, the argument is not significantly more complex than its 1-categorical counterpart. It also opens the way for further proofs of coherence using (adaptations of) tools from categorical semantics.
