In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the depth perception and an approaching motion toward an object. We propose the depth perception dependency test, which is the combination of tests of a motion and depth perception based on the situation that an object is placed on the humanâ€™s pathway. Firstly, as the motion test, we set the ball approach motion and asked elderly participants to approach and contact a ball by their foot, because this motion is easy to measure and requires localization skill and motion planning skill. The swing/support legs positions at the toeoff time of the swing leg just before contacting the ball was analyzed. Secondly, as the depth perception test, the pseudo3D image test was proposed. The coordinate transformation model for the calculation of the depth perception ability was also proposed. Through the proposed test and the proposed model, it was clarified that the participants who are regarded as perceiving the strong visual illusion perceive the objects closer than its real position, and their swing leg toe off positions in the ball approaching motion were significantly farther than other participants. Thus, it can be concluded that there was a relationship between the depth perception and the approaching motion that is thought to be a higher risk of stumbles.
