Haptic simulators are used in many education domains to improve hands-on training performance. Many of these simulators are used in the medical domain, where it is particularly important to be trained, guided by an expert. However, the majority of haptic hands-on training devices are usable by only one user at the same time, either the trainer or the trainee. Dual-user approaches have enhanced this situation by allowing both trainer and trainee to use the same simulator to introduce guided training into the simulation. In this paper, we introduce a multi-trainee architecture that expands further a former dual-user hands-on haptic training solution designed according to an energetic approach. This system will permit several trainees to be involved in the same simulation at the same time, guided by a single trainer. It paves the way to the multi-trainee hands-on training on haptic simulators.
