The ACM Data Science Taskforce was established by the ACM Education Council and tasked with articulating the role of computing discipline-specific contributions to this emerging field. This special session seeks to provide an update of the work of the ACM Data Science Taskforce as well as to engage the SIGCSE community in this effort. Members of the taskforce will report on version 2 of a draft report released Fall 2019, and the activities to-date, including a summary of data science curricular efforts to date, as well as the current articulation of computing competencies. This session should be of interest to all SIGCSE attendees, but especially faculty developing college-level curricula in Data Science.
