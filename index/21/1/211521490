In the past several years, there has been an increase in web-based compilers that allow students to learn how to code using a browser. Many Universities use online code editors for their large Computer Science (CS) courses. For example, the CS200 course at UC Berkeley uses Jupyter Notebooks to teach Python for data science to 800+ students. All the students in the course must write and submit their code assignments in the web-browser. These online code editors for large CS courses presents several benefits. One benefit is that it becomes easier to monitor the steps that a student takes to solve a coding problem since keystrokes can be tracked using Javascript. Another benefit is that the code written by students can be stored in one central database, creating less barriers for code analysis. The CodeKey project aims to take advantage of analyzing code patterns of students in a CS course in order to find key insights. CodeKey aims to find these insights by monitoring the interactions (i.e. clicks and keystrokes) of students as each student attempts to solve a coding problem. The goal is to study the code patterns of students in a CS course in order to understand similarities and differences between students who perform well on a problem and students who do not. We also aim to study how revealing these coding patterns to a student can increase his understanding of how to solve a difficult coding problem by showing common mistakes, and by showing simple steps that lead to the correct solution.
