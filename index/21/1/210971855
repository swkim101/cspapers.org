It has been widely considered that a distinctive feature of musculoskeletal structures is that both the joint angle and stiffness can be changed by exploiting the agonistantagonist driving of the joint. However, musculoskeletal systems in animals and humans are typically highly complex, and the simple agonist-antagonist driving is rarely found. Therefore, in accordance with the increasing complexity of musculoskeletal robots, the feature that causes the robot to assume a posture with different stiffness values becomes difficult to achieve, owing to the difficulty in modeling the kinematics. Although datadriven approaches such as the neural network are regarded as suitable for modeling complex relationships, the training data are difficult to obtain because measuring joint stiffness is typically extremely difficult in contrast to measuring an actuator's state and posture. Hence, we herein propose the common dimensional autoencoder where the encoded feature exhibits identical dimensions to the original input vector. In the proposed network, in parallel with the original unsupervised training using the data of the actuatorsâ€™ states, supervised training at part of the encoded features is performed using posture data. Consequently, features expressing the redundancy of inverse kinematics appear at the remaining part of the encoded features without using data such as joint stiffness. The validity of the proposed method was confirmed successfully through an experiment using a 10 degrees-of-freedom complex musculoskeletal robot arm driven by pneumatic artificial muscles.
