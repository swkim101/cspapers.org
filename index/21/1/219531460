Privacy preservation is a big concern for various sectors. To protect individual user data, one emerging technology is differential privacy. However, it still has limitations for datasets with frequent queries, such as the fast accumulation of privacy cost. To tackle this limitation, this paper explores the integration of a secured decentralised ledger, blockchain. Blockchain will be able to keep track of all noisy responses generated with differential privacy algorithm and allow for certain queries to reuse old responses. In this paper, a demo of a proposed blockchain-based privacy management system is designed as an interactive decentralised web application (DApp). The demo created illustrates that leveraging on blockchain will allow the total privacy cost accumulated to decrease significantly.
