This paper presents a novel design of four permanent magnet based actuator for magnetic drug targeting of therapeutic microrobots. Drugs are transported through therapeutic magnetic boluses composed of magnetic particles controlled by magnetic gradients. In this study, to maximize the effect of the treatment and minimize adverse effects on the patient, a magnetic actuator have been developed to wirelessly control microrobots in a fluidic environment using four external magnets. Experimental validation is carried using the robotic arm Fanuc LR Mate 200iD to demonstrate the steerability of the magnetic microrobots under different trajectory constraints in viscous fluidic environment.
