—Biological neural systems even of simple animals solve many tasks that are relevant for robotics with an unprecedented efﬁciency and ﬂexibility. Drawing inspiration from these neural systems, neuromorphic engineers develop a new generation of neurally inspired hardware that realises spiking neural networks that run in real time, on compact (a few mm2) computing devices that consume just a few mW of power. In our work, we develop neuronal computing architectures for neuromorphic hardware that solve different robotic tasks. Here we present one such architecture that enables estimation of the pose of an agent based on the external cues, the learned map, and integration of self-motion signals. We demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, online adaptation and error correction of the pose estimation realised fully in a spiking neural network, running on a neuromorphic research chip Loihi, interfaced to a robotic vehicle.
