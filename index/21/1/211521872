At Girls Who Code, we believe that all girls are capable of making a positive impact on the world through computer science. That is why we are leading the movement to close the gender gap in technology and change the image of what a programmer looks like and does. Join us to learn more about how to encourage girls in your community to connect their new coding skills and confidence with real world problems they care about. During this presentation, we will be featuring our Girls Who Code Clubs, which are completely free after-school programs for 3rd-12th grade girls to join a sisterhood of supportive peers and role models and use computer science to change the world. Through fun and interactive curricula, Club girls not only learn about how to positively impact their community through code, but they also are taught to be brave and resilient -- which has an enormous impact on how they approach challenges and whether they stick with coding in the years to come. Anyone can start a Girls Who Code Club - computer science experience is NOT required - and our curriculum is designed to allow the facilitator to learn alongside the girls.
