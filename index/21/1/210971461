Brain-computer interface is a framework which provides a communicating pathway between the human brain and neuroprosthetic devices. In this work, we have performed signal smoothing to fix unregulated electroencephalogram (EEG) fluctuations and to effectively collect hidden patterns in corresponding EEG spectra. To do it, we have applied a Savitzky Golay function because of its ability to preserve spectral properties without distorting it much. For feature selection, we have applied the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm with the Principle Component Analysis (PCA). FBCSP creates 11352 features from EEG signals and PCA gradually reduces the features to 185 most significant features. These features are utilized in the classification process by the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm with suitable node split criteria to manage optimal tree height. A five-fold cross-validation approach concludes the superior performance of XGBoost in terms of minimizing execution time (3.7 times faster in the training phase) and providing improved accuracy as compared to existing results. Our approach enhances classification accuracy (88.80%) by approximately 10% over regularized common spatial patterns (78.01% accuracy), 15% over shift variance approximation (73.84% accuracy) and 15% over Riemannian approach (74.77% accuracy). It also concludes that the pre-consideration of the noise level in EEG spectra provides a better approximation.
