Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now a regular feature of modern society which are highly needed for the rescue mission and collecting information at unreachable places. But while the current generation of UAVs are undoubtedly useful, people around the world are increasingly talking of the need for smaller, more agile systems that can be easily transported and operated in narrow places. This leads to the development of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). However, miniaturizing MAVs is very challenging because various problems still remain unsolved. Among those, miniaturizing actuator and rotor blade are the most common. Hence, in this paper, we describe the development and trial production of micro ultrasonic actuator and micro rotor blade for the development of the smallest MAV in the world.
