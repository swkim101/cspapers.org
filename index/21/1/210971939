3D printing in medical technology is mainly used to produce customized devices for surgical planning or surgical guides and templates. However, for laparoscopic systems, 3D printing is hardly used. A challenge is the transmission of the necessary forces required in laparoscopic surgery.We designed and manufactured a 3D printed customizable manipulator system for Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS), fulfilling the force-related requirements in laparoscopic surgery.The Single Incision Laparoscopic Manipulator System can apply forces at its tip up to 5.6 N with acceptable operating forces not exceeding 30 N. We showed the functionality of the manipulator system in a manipulation experiment in comparison to standard SILS instruments.
