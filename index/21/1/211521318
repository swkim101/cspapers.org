The SQL File Evaluation (SQLFE) tool is a GUI-based, flexible, and extendible software system for evaluating the correctness of files of student SQL queries as compared to specified SQL query answers. SQLFE can be configured per question to weight any of over 30 different tests in judging correctness of a submitted answer for a particular question. These tests include successful DBMS interpretation of the query, same result set (as specified answer), the use count of particular keywords, simple formatting style, and partial credit based on simple structural format. SQLFE currently works for databases constructed under Oracle and MySQL database management systems (DBMSs), and can be extended to more DBMSs. SQLFE is available from GitHub.
