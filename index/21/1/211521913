Computer Science Curriculum 2013 and Software Engineering Curriculum 2014 recommend eight and ten hours of human-computer interaction (HCI) concepts, respectively. SE2014 notes that human factors and usability are areas where motivation is needed within SE pedagogy, "Students will often not appreciate the need for attention to those areas unless they actually experience usability differences or watch users having difficulty using software." However, while HCI topics include user-centered design, basic human principles, evaluation and understanding of links to technological and societal issues, many contemporary industry settings require broader skills in support of the user experience (UX), defined by Neilsen and Norman as "all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company." As industry demands for people with skills in UX grow, it is useful for educators to share their best ideas and practices in the teaching of these concepts. For educators currently teaching HCI and for those planning to teach HCI and UX, we hope to discuss strategies for including broader UX topics in their classes. Additionally, we hope to include faculty who might be integrating UX topics into curricula from psychology, human factors, Advanced Placement CS Principles courses and others. We anticipate discussion of the following: UX research methods, approaches to UX design and validation, UX requirements analysis, specification and UX business case development. We will discuss these concepts in the context of computer science and software engineering education and application as well as other settings of interest to participants.
