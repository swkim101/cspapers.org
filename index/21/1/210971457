End-to-end deep learning has gained considerable interests in autonomous driving vehicles in both academic and industrial fields, especially in decision making process. One critical issue in decision making process of autonomous driving vehicles is steering control. Researchers has already trained different artificial neural networks to predict steering angle with front-facing camera data stream. However, existing end-to-end methods only consider the spatiotemporal relation on a single layer and lack the ability of extracting future spatiotemporal information. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end driving model based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) neural network with a Multi-scale Spatiotemporal Integration (MSI) module, which aiming to encode the spatiotemporal information from different scales for steering angle prediction. Moreover, we employ future sequential information to enhance spatiotemporal features of the end-to-end driving model. We demonstrate the efficiency of proposed end-to-end driving model on the public Udacity dataset with comparison of some existing methods. Experimental results show that the proposed model has better performances than other existing methods, especially in some complex scenarios. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed driving model on a real-time autonomous vehicle, and results show that the proposed driving model is able to predict the steering angle with high accuracy compared to skilled human driver.
