Human-robot shared control (SC) has largely been studied in two complementary forms, namely divisible shared control (DSC) and interactive shared control (ISC). DSC enables clean division of the human and the robot subtasks, thus enabling them to work independently, while ISC allows for flexible intervention to improve the collaborative performance or experience. This paper presents a unified scheme that combines both forms of SCs to attain the benefits of flexibility as well as ease of use when human and robot jointly work on a task together. Based on the idea that flexibility should be embedded in every task constraint that the robot is controlling, we connect ISC into the robot subtask providing a soft boundary between the divided orthogonal subspaces allowing human to access the robot subtask and intervene whenever necessary. We also propose a new simple yet effective Cartesian stiffness adaptation law that enables the robot to modify its endpoint stiffness in the robot’s control subspace in the presence of disagreement from the human. Simulations and real robot studies for a teleoperated path-following scenario were performed to demonstrate the flexibility of the unified shared control (USC), which allows the robot to dynamically adapt its task based on the operator’s intentions.
