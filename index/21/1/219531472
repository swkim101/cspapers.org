Online action detection in untrimmed videos aims to identify an action as it happens, which makes it very important for real-time applications. Previous methods rely on tedious annotations of temporal action boundaries for training, which hinders the scalability of online action detection systems. We propose WOAD, a weakly supervised framework that can be trained using only video-class labels. WOAD contains two jointly-trained modules, i.e., temporal proposal generator (TPG) and online action recognizer (OAR). Supervised by video-class labels, TPG works offline and targets at accurately mining pseudo frame-level labels for OAR. With the supervisory signals from TPG, OAR learns to conduct action detection in an online fashion. Experimental results on THUMOSâ€™14, ActivityNet1.2 and ActivityNet1.3 show that our weakly-supervised method largely outperforms weakly-supervised baselines and achieves comparable performance to the previous strongly-supervised methods. Beyond that, WOAD is flexible to leverage strong supervision when it is available. When strongly supervised, our method obtains the state-of-the-art results in the tasks of both online per-frame action recognition and online detection of action start.
