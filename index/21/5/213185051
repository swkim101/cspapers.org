Human-robot interaction is one of the keys of assistive robots. Robots are expected to be compliant with people but at the same time correctly perform the tasks. In such applications, Cartesian impedance control is preferred over joint control, as the desired interaction and environmental feedback can be described more naturally, and the force to be exerted by the robot can be readily adjusted.This paper addresses the problem of controlling a robot arm in the operational space with variable stiffness so as to continuously adapt the force exerted in each phase of motion according to the precision requirements. Moreover, performing dimensionality reduction we can separate the degrees of freedom (DoF) relevant for the task from the redundant ones. The stiffness of the former can be adjusted constantly to achieve the required accuracy, while task-redundant DoF can be used to achieve other goals such as avoiding obstacles by moving in the directions where accuracy is not critical. The designed method is tested teaching the robot to give water to drink to a model of human head. Our empirical results demonstrate that the robot can learn precision requirements from demonstration. Furthermore, dimensionality reduction is proved to be useful to avoid obstacles.
