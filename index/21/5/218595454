A key real-time task in autonomous systems is simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Although prior work has proposed hardware accelerators to process SLAM in real time, they paid less attention to power consumption. To be more power-efficient, we propose Pisces, which co-optimizes power consumption and latency by exploiting sparsity, a key characteristic of SLAM missed in prior work. By orchestrating sparse data, Pisces aligns correlated data and enables deterministic, one-time, and parallel accesses to the on-chip memory. Therefore, Pisces (i) eliminates unnecessary memory accesses and (ii) enables pipelined and parallel processing. Our FPGA implementation shows that Pisces consumes 2.5× less power and executes SLAM 7.4× faster than the state of the art.
