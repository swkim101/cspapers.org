Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to localize object with only weak supervision like image-level labels. However, a long-standing problem for available techniques based on the classification network is that they often result in highlighting the most discriminative parts rather than the entire extent of object. Nevertheless, trying to explore the integral extent of the object could degrade the performance of image classification on the contrary. To remedy this, we propose a simple yet powerful approach by introducing a novel adversarial erasing technique, erasing integrated learning (EIL). By integrating discriminative region mining and adversarial erasing in a single forward-backward propagation in a vanilla CNN, the proposed EIL explores the high response class-specific area and the less discriminative region simultaneously, thus could maintain high performance in classification and jointly discover the full extent of the object. Furthermore, we apply multiple EIL (MEIL) modules at different levels of the network in a sequential manner, which for the first time integrates semantic features of multiple levels and multiple scales through adversarial erasing learning. In particular, the proposed EIL and advanced MEIL both achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC 2016 benchmark, making significant improvement in localization while advancing high performance in image classification.
