Recently, the application of deep reinforcement learning into the field of session-based interactive recommendation has attracted great attention from researchers. However, despite that some interactive recommendation models based on deep reinforcement learning have been proposed, they still suffer to the following limitations: (1) these works ignore the skip behaviors of sequential patterns in users' clicking behavior; (2) these works fail to incorporate positive feedback and negative feedback into the proposed deep reinforcement recommender system when the positive feedback is sparse. Therefore, to solve the problems mentioned above, a novel Deep Q-Network based recommendation framework incorporating CNN and GAN-based models is proposed to acquire robust performance, named DRCGR. Specifically, in DRCGR, a CNN model is used to capture the sequential features for positive feedback. Then, an adversarial training is adopted to learn optimal negative feedback representations Then, positive/negative representations are fed into DQN simultaneously, which are conducive to generating better action-value function The experimental results based on real-world e-commerce data demonstrate our framework's superiority over some state-of-the-art recommendation models.
