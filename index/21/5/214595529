Bayesian diagnosis is a probabilistic diagnostic framework for control loop monitoring. It can integrate multiple monitor technologies to construct a diagnostic system and make optimal decisions. However, it is difficult to collect enough fault samples in the actual industrial process control loop diagnosis, which seriously restricts the performance of Bayesian diagnosis. A novel diagnostic method which integrates Bayesian method and independent component analysis (ICA) for efficient multimode fault diagnosis is presented in this paper. The independent components of the samples are extracted by ICA, and then kernel density estimation is implemented to calculate likelihood probability in order to enhance the accuracy of likelihood estimation. Finally, Tennessee Eastman (TE) benchmark process verifies the performance of ICA Bayesian with small sample size. The comparison results prove that the diagnosis is improved through the proposed method.
