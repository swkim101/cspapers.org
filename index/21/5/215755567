Geo-located social media provide a wealth of information that describes urban areas based on user descriptions and comments. Such data makes possible to identify meaningful city neighborhoods on the basis of the footprints left by a large and diverse population that uses this type of media. In this paper, we present some methods to exhibit the predominantactivities and their associated urban areas to automatically describe a whole city. Based on a suitable attributed graph model, our approach identifies neighborhoods with homogeneous and exceptional characteristics. We introduce the novel problem of exceptional sub-graph mining in attributed graphs and propose a complete algorithm that takes benefits from new upper bounds and pruning properties. We also propose an approach to sample the space of exceptional sub-graphs within a given time-budget. Experiments performed on 10 real datasets are reported and demonstrate the relevancy and the limits of both approaches.
