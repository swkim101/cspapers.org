In this paper, an optimal fuzzy adaptive backstepping controller (OFABC) for a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) quadrotor unmanned helicopter is proposed in the presence of unknown nonlinear dynamics, parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. The control objective is to track the desired trajectory of the helicopter attitude, i.e. roll, pitch and yaw angles. In order to achieve this goal, a fuzzy adaptive controller based on backstepping design optimized by the flower pollination algorithm is developed. Lyapunov theory is used to prove the stability and robustness of the closed loop system. The simulation results for regulation and tracking problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
