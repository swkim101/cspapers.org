The aim of visual relation detection is to provide a comprehensive understanding of an image by describing all the objects within the scene, and how they relate to each other, in < object-predicate-object > form; for example, < person-lean on-wall > . This ability is vital for image captioning, visual question answering, and many other applications. However, visual relationships have long-tailed distributions and, thus, the limited availability of training samples is hampering the practicability of conventional detection approaches. With this in mind, we designed a novel model for visual relation detection that works in one-shot settings. The embeddings of objects and predicates are extracted through a network that includes a feature-level attention mechanism. Attention alleviates some of the problems with feature sparsity, and the resulting representations capture more discriminative latent features. The core of our model is a dual graph neural network that passes and aggregates the context information of predicates and objects in an episodic training scheme to improve recognition of the one-shot predicates and then generate the triplets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to center on the viability of one-shot learning for visual relation detection. Extensive experiments on two newly-constructed datasets show that our model significantly improved the performance of two tasks PredCls and SGCls from 2.8% to 12.2% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.
