A package tracking number (PTN) is widely used to monitor and track a shipment. Through the lenses of security and privacy, however, a package tracking number can possibly reveal certain personal information, leading to security and privacy breaches. In this work, we examine the privacy issues associated with online package tracking systems used in the top three most popular package delivery service providers (FedEx, DHL, and UPS) in the world and found that those websites inadvertently leak users’ personal data with a PTN. Moreover, we discovered that PTNs are highly structured and predictable. Therefore, customers’ personal data can be massively collected via PTN enumeration attacks. We analyzed more than one million package tracking records obtained from Fedex, DHL, and UPS, and showed that within 5 attempts, an attacker can efficiently guess more than 90% of PTNs for FedEx and DHL, and close to 50% of PTNs for UPS. In addition, we present two practical attack scenarios: 1) to infer business transactions information and 2) to uniquely identify recipients. Also, we found that more than 109 recipients can be uniquely identified with less than 10 comparisons by linking the PTN information with the online people search service, Whitepages.
