The aim of this work is to study, analyze and design a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) of an horizontal axis wind turbine emulator based on DC motor to improve the output profile quality and to overcome the conventional PI regulator limitations. The performance of the proposed control strategy is evaluated through digital simulation using Xilinx System Generator (XSG) toolbox which ensures a rapid prototyping of the implemented architectures on FPGA device. Despite the applied wind profile fluctuations, simulation results show that the XSG modeled-FLC provides a better accuracy and an acceptable execution time thanks to the parallel processing of the used board. A Hardware Co-simulation was performed to test the system response on the chip in real time, to validate the optimized architectures and to visualize the DC/DC converter switching signal. Results have shown a good agreement with theoretical prediction and have proved the efficiency of the proposed control strategy by reducing the armature current and electromagnetic torque ripples and the error between the reference turbine speed and the DCM emulated one.
