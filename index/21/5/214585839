Android devices ship with pre-installed privileged apps in their ﬁrmware — some of which are essential system components, others deliver a unique user experience — that users cannot disable. These pre-installed apps are assumed to be secure as they are handpicked or developed by the device vendors themselves rather than third parties. Unfortunately, we have identiﬁed an alarming number of Android ﬁrmware that contain privilege-escalation vulnerabilities in pre-installed apps, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions such as executing arbitrary commands, recording the device audio and screen, and accessing personal data to name a few. To uncover these vulnerabilities, we built F IRM S COPE , a novel static analysis system that analyzes Android ﬁrmware to expose unwanted functionality in pre-installed apps using an efﬁcient and practical context-sensitive, ﬂow-sensitive, ﬁeld-sensitive, and partially object-sensitive taint analysis. Our experimental results demonstrate that F IRM S COPE signiﬁ-cantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Android taint analysis solutions both in terms of detection power and runtime performance. We used F IRM S COPE to scan 331 , 342 pre-installed apps in 2 , 017 Android ﬁrmware images from v4.0 to v9.0 from more than 100 Android vendors. Among them, F IRM - S COPE uncovered 850 unique privilege-escalation vulnerabilities, many of which
