Grabbing users' attention is a fundamental aspect of interactive systems. However, there is a disconnect between the ways our devices notify us and how our bodies do so naturally. In this paper, we explore the body's modality of itching as a way to provide such natural feedback. We create itching sensations via low-current electric stimulation, which allows us to quickly generate this sensation on demand. In a first study we explore the design space around itching and how changes in stimulation parameters influence the resulting sensation. In a second study we compare vibration feedback and itching integrated in a smartwatch form factor. We find that we can consistently induce itching sensations and that these are perceived as more activating and interrupting than vibrotactile stimuli.
