This paper tackles the problem of motion deblurring of dynamic scenes. Although end-to-end fully convolutional designs have recently advanced the state-of-the-art in non-uniform motion deblurring, their performance-complexity trade-off is still sub-optimal. Existing approaches achieve a large receptive field by increasing the number of generic convolution layers and kernel-size, but this comesat the expense of of the increase in model size and inference speed. In this work, we propose an efficient pixel adaptive and feature attentive design for handling large blur variations across different spatial locations and process each test image adaptively. We also propose an effective content-aware global-local filtering module that significantly improves performance by considering not only global dependencies but also by dynamically exploiting neighboring pixel information. We use a patch-hierarchical attentive architecture composed of the above module that implicitly discovers the spatial variations in the blur present in the input image and in turn, performs local and global modulation of intermediate features. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons with prior art on deblurring benchmarks demonstrate that our design offers significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in accuracy as well as speed.
