In this paper, a new PSO algorithm called the duplicate particles swarm optimization (D-PSO) is used to find the optimal proportional integral (PI) controllerâ€™s gains for the control of a wind energy conversion system (WECS) based on a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). The control objective is the extraction of the maximum power available from the wind with zero stator reactive power regulation. Finding the optimal PI parameters consists of minimizing a cost function quantifying the mean square error between the desired output and the system output. Conducted simulation results using Simulink/Matlab confirm that the PI controller based on the proposed duplicate particle swarm optimization (D-PSO) algorithm yield much better results compared to non-optimized controllers, and conventional PSO optimized controllers.
