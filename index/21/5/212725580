Adversarial patch attacks were recently recognized as the most practical threat model against real-world computer vision systems. Most published defenses against patch attacks are based on preprocessing input images to mitigate adversarial noise. The first contribution of this paper is a set of experiments demonstrating that such defense strategies can easily be broken by white-box adversaries. Motivated by this finding, we present an extension of certified defense algorithms and propose significantly faster variants for robust training against patch attacks. Finally, we experiment with different patch shapes for testing, and observe that robustness to such attacks transfers surprisingly well.
