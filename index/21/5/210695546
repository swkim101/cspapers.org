Model Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques raise the level of abstraction at which developers construct software. However, modern cyber-physical systems are becoming more prevalent and complex and hence software models that represent the structure and behavior of such systems still tend to be large and complex. These models may have numerous if not infinite possible behaviors, with complex communications between their components. Appropriate software testing techniques to generate test cases with high coverage rate to put these systems to test at the model-level (without the need to understand the underlying code generator or refer to the generated code) are therefore important. Concolic testing, a hybrid testing technique that benefits from both concrete and symbolic execution, gains a high execution coverage and is used extensively in the industry for program testing but not for software models. In this paper, we present a novel technique and its tool mCUTE1, an open source 2 model-level concolic testing engine. We describe the implementation of our tool in the context of Papyrus-RT, an open source Model Driven Engineering (MDE) tool based on UML-RT, and report the results of validating our tool using a set of benchmark models.
