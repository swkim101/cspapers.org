The goal of fine-grained propaganda detection is to determine whether a given sentence uses propaganda techniques (sentence-level) or to recognize which techniques are used (fragment-level). This paper presents the sys- tem of our participation in the sentence-level subtask of the propaganda detection shared task. In order to better utilize the document information, we construct context-dependent input pairs (sentence-title pair and sentence- context pair) to fine-tune the pretrained BERT, and we also use the undersampling method to tackle the problem of imbalanced data.
