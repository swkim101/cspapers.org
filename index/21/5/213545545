 Engineering design is usually an iterative procedure where many different configurations are tested to yield a desirable end performance. When the design objective can only be measured by costly operations such as experiments or cumbersome computer simulations, a thorough design procedure can be limited. The design problem in these cases is a high cost optimization problem. Meta model-based approaches (e.g. Bayesian optimization) and transfer optimization are methods that can be used to facilitate more efficient designs. Transfer optimization is a technique that enables using previous design knowledge instead of starting from scratch in a new task. In this work, we study a transfer optimization framework based on Bayesian optimization using Gaussian Processes. The similarity among the tasks is determined via a similarity metric. The framework is applied to a particular design problem of thin film solar cells. Planar multilayer solar cells with different sets of materials are optimized to obtain the best opto-electrical efficiency. Solar cells with amorphous silicon and organic absorber layers are studied and the results are presented.
