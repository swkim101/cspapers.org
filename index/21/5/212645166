Cloud providers are concerned that Rowhammer poses a potentially critical threat to their servers, yet today they lack a systematic way to test whether the DRAM used in their servers is vulnerable to Rowhammer attacks. This paper presents an endto-end methodology to determine if cloud servers are susceptible to these attacks. With our methodology, a cloud provider can construct worst-case testing conditions for DRAM.We apply our methodology to three classes of servers from a major cloud provider. Our findings show that none of the CPU instruction sequences used in prior work to mount Rowhammer attacks create worst-case DRAM testing conditions. To address this limitation, we develop an instruction sequence that leverages microarchitectural side-effects to "hammer" DRAM at a near-optimal rate on modern Intel Skylake and Cascade Lake platforms. We also design a DDR4 fault injector that can reverse engineer row adjacency for any DDR4 DIMM. When applied to our cloud providerâ€™s DIMMs, we find that DRAM rows do not always follow a linear map.
