The autonomous driving (auto-driving) technology has been promoted significantly by the rapid advances in computer vision and deep neural networks. Auto-driving vehicles, nowadays, are fully equipped with numerous sensors such as cameras, geo-sensors, and radar sensors, to capture real-time data inside the vehicles and outside surroundings. Meanwhile, the captured data contains lots of private information about vehicles, drivers and passengers and thus faces a high risk of privacy breaches. Especially, side-channel information can be mined from camera data to identify vehicles' locations and even trajectories, raising serious privacy issues. Unfortunately, the issue, how to resist location-inference attack for camera data in auto-driving, has never been addressed in literature. In this paper, we intend to fill this blank by developing a GAN-based image-toimage translation method named Auto-Driving GAN (ADGAN). Through performance comparisons between ADGAN and the state-of-the-art, the superiority of ADGAN can be validated - offering an effective tradeoff between recognition utility and privacy protection for camera data.
