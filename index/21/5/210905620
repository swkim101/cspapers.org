As mobile applications have become popular among end-users, developers have introduced a wide range of features that increase the complexity of application code. Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) is a model that enables developers to classify defects and track the process of inspection and testing. However, ODC was introduced to classify defects of traditional software. Mobile applications differ from traditional applications in many ways; they are susceptible to external factors, such as screen and network changes, notifications, and phone interruptions, which affect the applicationsâ€™ functioning. Therefore, in this paper, the ODC model will be adapted to accommodate defects of mobile applications. This allows us to address newly introduced application defects found in the mobile domain, such as energy, notification, and Graphical User Interface (GUI). In addition, based on the new model, we classify found defects of two well-known mobile applications. Moreover, we discuss one-way and two-way analyses. This work provides developers with a suitable defect analysis technique for mobile applications.
