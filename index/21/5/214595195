In the field of electric drives, current fault detection approaches are already able to recognize a device fault and locate its root. Nevertheless, such methods require the integration of additional sensors that give a clear state of the equipmentâ€™s health, as well as enough computing resources that allow the processing of the large amount of data generated by these sensors. In contrast to these approaches, we present a method with which it is possible to identify faults in systems with limited computing performance and storage space, such as pedelecs, without requiring the integration of additional sensors or memory units. The core of this method is finding the operating conditions under which the fault identification is clearer, and the set of features that provide the most relevant information for the fault diagnosis. This approach implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the identification of the features that enlarges the distance between the classes (fault types). An SVM classifier is then trained with the resultant feature-set. To validate the presented framework, the signals of 5 pedelec Drive Units (DUs) without faults and 10 faulty DUs were gathered, during normal trips. The results of the experimental study show that the proposed approach achieves a great accuracy and due to the low size of the generated classifier, it can be deployed in a device with limited available storage, allowing real-time accurate classification.
