Observers are algorithms applied to estimate unknown parameters, which may be due to disturbances and plant mismatches. It is important to estimate those variables to construct a feedback control law and to avoid process disruption. However, the observer usage sometimes produced unsatisfactory estimation results thus hybrid approach is the best solution. Hybrid observers are combination of observers either with each other or with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy logic to increase the estimation performances and overcome the limitations of single observers. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid fuzzy-sliding mode observer to estimate melt index in a polyethylene polymerization process. Melt index is one of the important parameters that have influenced on the product quality and is costly yet difficult to measure online. The performance of the hybrid observer has also been compared with sliding mode observer. From the results, offsets were observed from the single sliding mode observer while there was no discrepancy between the actual and the estimated values of the melt index when applying the proposed hybrid observer.
