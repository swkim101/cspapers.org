 Reliability depends on time if the associated limit-state function includes time. A time-dependent reliability problem can be converted into a time-independent reliability problem by using the extreme value of the limit-state function. Then the first order reliability method can be used but it may produce a large error since the extreme limit-state function is usually highly nonlinear. This study proposes a new reliability method so that the second order reliability method can be applied to time-dependent reliability analysis for higher accuracy while maintaining high efficiency. The method employs sequential efficient global optimization to transform the time-dependent reliability analysis into the time-independent problem. The Hessian approximation and envelope theorem are used to obtain the second order information of the extreme limit-state function. Then the second order saddlepoint approximation is use to evaluate the reliability. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are verified through numerical examples.
