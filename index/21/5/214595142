Numerical algorithm, based on linear matrix inequalities, is presented for state-feedback synthesis of discrete-time linear positive systems using H2 norm principle. Two policies are formulated to obtain control matrix parameters respecting strictly positivity or non-negativity of the system matrix. It is reiterated that proposed approach leads to upper bound of H2 norm estimation of the closed-loop system transform matrix.
