Identifying privacy-sensitive data leaks by mobile applications has been a topic of great research interest for the past decade. Technically, such data ﬂows are not “leaks” if they are disclosed in a privacy policy. To address this limitation in automated analysis, recent work has combined program analysis of applications with analysis of privacy policies to determine the ﬂow-to-policy consistency, and hence violations thereof. However, this prior work has a fundamental weakness: it does not differentiate the entity (e.g., ﬁrst-party vs. third-party) receiving the privacy-sensitive data. In this paper, we propose P OLI C HECK , which formalizes and implements an entity-sensitive ﬂow-to-policy consistency model. We use P OLI C HECK to study 13,796 applications and their privacy policies and ﬁnd that up to 42.4% of applications either incorrectly disclose or omit disclosing their privacy-sensitive data ﬂows. Our results also demonstrate the signiﬁcance of considering entities: without considering entity, prior approaches would falsely classify up to 38.4% of applications as having privacy-sensitive data ﬂows consistent with their privacy policies. These false classiﬁcations include data ﬂows to third-parties that are omitted (e.g., the policy states only the ﬁrst-party collects the data type), incorrect (e.g., the policy states the third-party does not collect the data type), and ambiguous (e.g., the policy has conﬂicting statements about the data type collection). By deﬁning a novel automated, entity-sensitive ﬂow-to-policy consistency analysis, P OLI C HECK provides the highest-precision method to
