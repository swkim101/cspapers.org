This paper presents the implementation of a mobile robot in 3D environment. A non-holonomic mobile robot (TurtleBot Burger 3) is designed to navigate following different trajectories by controlling its motors, and it is expected to be useful to test autonomous navigation algorithm. The study of a non-holonomic mobile robot is so difficult due to the complexity of its mathematical description. Therefore, this paper introduces a simulator based on the geometrical structure of the robot. After that, a 3D mobile robot is built and simulated in Matlab-Simscape environment. Different schemes of tracking trajectories have been introduced in this work to study the behaviour of the mobile robot. The purpose of this 3D environment is to create a hostile environment with random obstacles and it optimize the path tracking of the robot. The proposed simulation modelling is valuable to give a clear understanding of complex systems and it will help to have a correct digital representation of the robot.
