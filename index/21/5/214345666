Despite the fact that current Facial Recognition (FR) models like FaceNet or many AI Web Services (e.g. AWS Rekognition) work very well recognizing people using One-shot learning, they are not able to detect if the face in front of the camera is genuine or not (e.g. face in a video replay). This is critical because many serious consequences may happen if anybody could successfully attack financial or government services that work with facial recognition system. This problem is known as Spoofing Attack and many state-of-art papers in computer vision focus in detecting noise, use Local Binary Patterns, use special hardware that measure depth or light reflection with different colors on faces, but new approaches of Deep Learning can make possible an end-to-end learning such as Transfer Learning (CNNs). The main contribution of this work-in-progress is that it uses a new embedded system that only works with face recognition techniques and were tested in 3 different datasets: CASIA, MSU USAA and a local dataset we prepared and named UNI-PUCP that shares attributes with CASIA Attack, Replay Mobile, MSU USAA and SiW dataset.
