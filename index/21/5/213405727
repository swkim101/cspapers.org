In this project we will design and simulate in software an algorithm for the assembly and coordination of architectures for a system composed of a set of robot agents that allow a multi-agent collaborative system to achieve two different architectures (1D and 2D) to reach the objective. This algorithm will be focused on the development of three main activities: first the analysis and planning of the trajectory to be executed with the most optimal architectures to achieve it, second the displacement of each module (in a random initial position) and its integration with the others to form a configuration, and finally (later) the integrated configuration will move to a final point defined by the user going through an unstructured environment (avoidance of obstacles), during this journey the robot can be re-armed in a second configuration when necessary to evade the present obstacles. Each configuration obtained will be considered as an agent composed of the union of multiple MECABOT robotic modules, which were previously designed and constructed by the DAVINCI research group of the Mechatronics Engineering Program of the New Granada Military University. 
In order to increase the robustness of the modular robotic system in the event of unexpected events in the operating environment and / or possible failures in components of the agents, it is proposed to develop a distributed command logic under which each unit will have independent control, always led by the main module, so that you can recognize such events and adapt your operation plan autonomously. The validation of the operation of the robotic system will be done through two stages: the simulation of each unit and then the collective system using a software designed. 
An efficient arming and disarming strategy will be developed to coordinate the modules using artificial intelligence techniques which will give the system the ability to automatically make decisions in order to optimize the performance of the same, reducing operating time and energy consumption.
