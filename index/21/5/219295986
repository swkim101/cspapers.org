This session is intended as an open discussion between a small group of panelists and the conference attendees. What can we do as a community to increase the impact (whatever that means) of our research, especially with the rise in paper counts, write only conferences, over-specialization of ourselves and our students, migration of distinguished researchers to more development-oriented positions, etc.? More specifically: What should we look for in graduate applicants? What should be the balance between breadth and depth in graduate programs? Are there emerging high-impact areas on which there should be greater focus (e.g., visualization, scientific data management)? How do we make data management techniques (databases, data mining, machine learning) usable by the masses? How can we contribute to a data-centric view of everything science, engineering, the social sciences, commerce?
