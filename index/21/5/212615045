Goal recognisers attempt to infer an observed agent’s intentions from a sequence of observations. Whereas, task planners, when provided with an initial and goal state, attempt to create a plan, i.e., sequence of actions. Both goal recog-nisers and task planners require a symbolic representation of the actions an agent can perform; however, the development of these representations can be time consuming and complex. Therefore, our work takes unlabelled pairs of images, namely, transitions, as input and transforms them into symbolic actions, which are subsequently reduced to a set of action deﬁnitions. These action deﬁnitions contain a set of effects and preconditions, including known preconditions (i.e., atoms representing the objects whose value changes) and possible preconditions. We aim to automatically generate generic (reusable) action deﬁnitions and, through the use of possible preconditions, aim to reduce the number of transitions that must be provided as input. To test the produced action deﬁ-nitions a task planner is called. This paper presents an early (conceptual) version of our work and focuses on a Towers of Hanoi domain.
