Recent years have witnessed the continuing growth of peopleâ€™s dependence on touchscreen devices. As a result, input speed with the onscreen keyboard has become crucial to communication efficiency and user experience. In this work, we formally discuss the general problem of input expectation prediction with a touch-screen input method editor (IME). Taken input efficiency as the optimization target, we proposed a neural end-to-end candidates generation solution to handle automatic correction, reordering, insertion, deletion as well as completion. Evaluation metrics are also discussed base on real use scenarios. For a more thorough comparison, we also provide a statistical strategy for mapping touch coordinate sequences to text input candidates. The proposed model and baselines are evaluated on a real-world dataset. The experiment (conducted on the PaddlePaddle deep learning platform1) shows that the proposed model outperforms the baselines.
