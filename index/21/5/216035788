Recently, the motion averaging method has been introduced as an effective means to solve the multi-view registration problem. This method aims to recover global motions from a set of relative motions, where the original method is sensitive to outliers due to using the Frobenius norm error in the optimization. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel robust motion averaging method based on the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC). Specifically, the correntropy measure is used instead of utilizing Frobenius norm error to improve the robustness of motion averaging against outliers. According to the half-quadratic technique, the correntropy measure based optimization problem can be solved by the alternating minimization procedure, which includes operations of weight assignment and weighted motion averaging. Further, we design a selection strategy of adaptive kernel width to take advantage of correntropy. Experimental results on benchmark data sets illustrate that our method has superior performance on accuracy and robustness for multi-view registration. Whatâ€™s more, it can be applied to robot mapping.
