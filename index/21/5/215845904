Critiquing is a method for conversational recommendation that iteratively adapts recommendations in response to user preference feedback. In this setting, a user is iteratively provided with an item recommendation and attribute description for that item; a user may either accept the recommendation, or critique the attributes in the item description to generate a new recommendation. Historical critiquing methods were largely based on explicit constraint- and utility-based methods for modifying recommendations w.r.t. critiqued item attributes. In this paper, we revisit the critiquing approach in the era of recommendation methods based on latent embeddings with subjective item descriptions (i.e., keyphrases from user reviews). Two critical research problems arise: (1) how to co-embed keyphrase critiques with user preference embeddings to update recommendations, and (2) how to modulate the strength of multi-step critiquing feedback, where critiques are not necessarily independent, nor of equal importance. To address (1), we build on an existing state-of-the-art linear embedding recommendation algorithm to align review-based keyphrase attributes with user preference embeddings. To address (2), we exploit the linear structure of the embeddings and recommendation prediction to formulate a linear program (LP) based optimization problem to determine optimal weights for incorporating critique feedback. We evaluate the proposed framework on two recommendation datasets containing user reviews with simulated users. Empirical results compared to a standard approach of averaging critique feedback show that our approach reduces the number of interactions required to find a satisfactory item and increases the overall success rate.
