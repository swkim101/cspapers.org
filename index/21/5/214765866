As web sites continue to grow in their complexity, one of the most important usability design decisions is how to structure the web site topic hierarchy. This decision lays the groundwork for designing other aspects of the site, including the home page table of contents, common navigation elements, hypertext links, and for categorizing new documents in the topic structure over the life of the site. Organizing web sites is a timely topic as evidenced by the recent spate of publications on this topic and by NIST's recent release of a tool, WebCAT, to help users participate in organizing their web site. More significantly, the organization is probably the limiting factor on success for web sites that provide useful information.
