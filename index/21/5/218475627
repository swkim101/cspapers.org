We consider a distributed information system that allows autonomous consumers to query autonomous providers. We focus on the problem of query allocation from a new point of view, by considering consumers and providers' satisfaction in addition to query load. We define satisfaction as a long-run notion based on the consumers and providers' preferences. We propose and validate a mediation process, called SBMediation, which is compared to Capacity based query allocation. The experimental results show that SBMediation significantly outperforms Capacity based when confronted to autonomous participants.
