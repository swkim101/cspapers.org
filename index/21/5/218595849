Vision is often used as a complementary modality for audio speech recognition (ASR), especially in the noisy environment where performance of solo audio modality significantly deteriorates. After combining visual modality, ASR is upgraded to the multi-modality speech recognition (MSR). In this paper, we propose a two-stage speech recognition model. In the first stage, the target voice is separated from background noises with help from the corresponding visual information of lip movements, making the model â€˜listen' clearly. At the second stage, the audio modality combines visual modality again to better understand the speech by a MSR sub-network, further improving the recognition rate. There are some other key contributions: we introduce a pseudo-3D residual convolution (P3D)-based visual front-end to extract more discriminative features; we upgrade the temporal convolution block from 1D ResNet with the temporal convolutional network (TCN), which is more suitable for the temporal tasks; the MSR sub-network is built on the top of Element-wise-Attention Gated Recurrent Unit (EleAtt-GRU), which is more effective than Transformer in long sequences. We conducted extensive experiments on the LRS3-TED and the LRW datasets. Our two-stage model (audio enhanced multi-modality speech recognition, AE-MSR) consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin, which demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of AE-MSR.
