Interests in the automatic generation of cooking recipes have been growing steadily over the past few years thanks to a large amount of online cooking recipes. We present RecipeGPT, a novel online recipe generation and evaluation system. The system provides two modes of text generations: (1) instruction generation from given recipe title and ingredients; and (2) ingredient generation from recipe title and cooking instructions. Its back-end text generation module comprises a generative pre-trained language model GPT-2 fine-tuned on a large cooking recipe dataset. Moreover, the recipe evaluation module allows the users to conveniently inspect the quality of the generated recipe contents and store the results for future reference.
