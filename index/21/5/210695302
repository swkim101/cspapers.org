GUI-based testing has been primarily used to examine the functionality and usability of mobile apps. Despite the numerous GUI-based test input generation techniques proposed in the literature, these techniques are still limited by (1) lack of context-aware text inputs; (2) failing to generate expressive tests; and (3) absence of test oracles. To address these limitations, we propose CraftDroid, a framework that leverages information retrieval, along with static and dynamic analysis techniques, to extract the human knowledge from an existing test suite for one app and transfer the test cases and oracles to be used for testing other apps with the similar functionalities. Evaluation of CraftDroid on real-world commercial Android apps corroborates its effectiveness by achieving 73% precision and 90% recall on average for transferring both the GUI events and oracles. In addition, 75% of the attempted transfers successfully generated valid and feature-based tests for popular features among apps in the same category.
