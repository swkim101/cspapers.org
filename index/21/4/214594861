With the appearance of small Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs), such as Israeli HARPY and American Switch-Blade, the boundary between precision guided munitions and drones is increasingly blurred. The terminal guidance law which originally belongs to missiles is gradually applied to the attack mission especially in terminal of strike processes. In this paper, the classical guidance law proportional navigation (PN) used in missilesâ€™ terminal control are analyzed and improved with pitch angle compensation to adapt to the terminal guidance control of small UCAVs. Then through simulation, the feasibility of modified guidance algorithm is discussed and the features of different guidance laws are analyzed. Finally, the performance and the strike accuracy of terminal guidance algorithms are verified by flight tests.
