In this research the wire mesh sensor (WMS) based on the measurement of the electrical capacitance or fluid permittivity was used in order to characterize two-phase liquid-liquid flows. Tap water and oil with 220 mPa.s of viscosity and 860 kg/m3 of density were the working fluids. The experiments were carried out in a 25.4mm i.d. 12m-long borosilicate glass pipe. To validate the results, phase fractions were measured with quick-closing valves technique (QCVs) and the results were compared with in-situ phase fractions calculated with the twelve permittivity models from the WMS. Images obtained by a high-speed camera were compared with the cross-sectional tomography obtained by the WMS, as a qualitatively validation. The results showed that the wire mesh sensor (WMS) is an accurate instrument for in situ holdup measurements of water-high viscosity oil liquid-liquid two-phase flows for the smooth stratified, wavy stratified and stratified with mixture at the interface flow patterns.
