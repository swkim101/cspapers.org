We introduce the Web-Enabled Simulation (WES) research agenda, and describe FACEBOOK's WW system. We describe the application of WW to reliability, integrity and privacy at FACEBOOK1, where it is used to simulate social media interactions on an infrastructure consisting of hundreds of millions of lines of code. The WES agenda draws on research from many areas of study, including Search Based Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Programming Languages, Multi Agent Systems, Graph Theory, Game AI, and AI Assisted Game Play. We conclude with a set of open problems and research challenges to motivate wider investigation.
