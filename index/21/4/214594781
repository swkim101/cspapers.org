In this paper, the quality of control deterioration induced by delays and shifts in real-time preemptive scheduling context is studied. A codesign task model is proposed, for both physical and scheduling parts, to highlight the foremost scheduling artifacts such as input-output latency and control jitters. For that, correlation between scheduling artifacts and quality of control is assessed. This correlation is particularly strong with the input/output latency, and in contrast, lacking with the control or input-output jitter if the sampling jitter or measurement inaccuracy is taken into account in control design.
