In this paper, we propose a method of analyzing the switching behavior of a general SPICE memristor model in order to extract its internal parameters and their impact on the device. Our simulation results demonstrate the correlation of the model for several input voltages with various amplitudes and shapes for various memristors devices by modeling the setting parameters. Thus, we measure the amount of the area of the pinched hysteresis loop for a parametric sweep for a specific domain. Each parameter has an independent impact on the I-V characteristic, which indeed affects the linearity and switching behavior of the device. Therefore, this analysis prove the flexibility and efficiency of the model.
