Given a graph <tex>$G=(V, E)$</tex>, an (<tex>$\alpha,\beta$</tex>) -ruling set is a subset <tex>$S\subseteq V$</tex> such that the distance between any two vertices in <tex>$S$</tex> is at least <tex>$\alpha$</tex>, and the distance between any vertex in <tex>$V$</tex> and the closest vertex in <tex>$S$</tex> is at most <tex>$\beta$</tex>. We present lower bounds for distributedly computing ruling sets. More precisely, for the problem of computing a (<tex>$2, \beta$</tex>) - ruling set (and hence also any (<tex>$\alpha,\beta$</tex>) -ruling set with <tex>$\alpha > 2$</tex>) in the LOCAL model of distributed computing, we show the following, where <tex>$n$</tex> denotes the number of vertices, <tex>$\Delta$</tex> the maximum degree, and <tex>$c$</tex> is some universal constant independent of <tex>$n$</tex> and <tex>$\Delta$</tex>. •Any deterministic algorithm requires <tex>$\Omega\left(\min\left\{\frac{\log\Delta}{\beta\log\log\Delta}, \log_{\Delta}n\right\}\right)$</tex> rounds, for all <tex>$\beta\leq c\cdot\min\left\{\sqrt{\frac{\log\Delta}{\log\log\Delta}}, \log_{\Delta}n\right\}$</tex>. By optimizing <tex>$\Delta$</tex>, this impliesa deterministic lower bound of <tex>$\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{\beta \log\log n}}\right)\ \mathrm{for\ all}\ \beta\leq c\sqrt[3]{\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}}$</tex>. •Any randomized algorithm requires <tex>$\Omega\left(\min\left\{\frac{\log\Delta}{\beta\log\log\Delta}, \log_{\Delta}\log n\right\}\right)$</tex> rounds, for all <tex>$\beta\leq c\cdot\min\left\{\sqrt{\frac{\log\Delta}{\log\log\Delta}}, \log_{\Delta}\log n\right\}$</tex>. By optimizing <tex>$\Delta$</tex>, this implies a randomized lower bound of <tex>$\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{\log\log n}{\beta\log\log\log n}}\right)$</tex> for all <tex>$\beta\leq c\sqrt[3]{\frac{\log\log n}{\log\log\log n}}$</tex>. For <tex>$\beta > 1$</tex>, this improves on the previously best lower bound of <tex>$\Omega(\log^{\ast}n)$</tex> rounds that follows from the 30-year-old bounds of Linial [FOCS'87] and Naor [J.Disc.Math.'91] (resp. <tex>$\Omega(1)$</tex> rounds if <tex>$\beta\in\omega(\log^{\ast}n)$</tex>). For <tex>$\beta=1$</tex>, i.e., for the problem of computing a maximal independent set (which is nothing else than a (2, 1)-ruling set), our results improve on the previously best lower bound of <tex>$\Omega(\log^{\ast}n)$</tex> on trees, as our bounds already hold on trees.
