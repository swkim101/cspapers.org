This paper presents the modeling and simulation of the Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) for electric power generation from Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS). A simpler model of the generator is presented. A control based on the theory of the control by orientation of the rotor flux is presented. The latter comprises two control loops for adjusting the stator voltage and the rotor current to their reference values. For this purpose PI classic regulators are used. To validate this study a DFIG of 4 kW is used. The simulation is performed under Matlab/Simulink.
