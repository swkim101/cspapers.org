—Software-deﬁned networking (SDN) achieves a programmable control plane through the use of logically centralized, event-driven controllers and through network applications (apps) that extend the controllers’ functionality. As control plane decisions are often based on the data plane, it is possible for carefully crafted malicious data plane inputs to direct the control plane towards unwanted states that bypass network security restrictions ( i.e., cross-plane attacks ). Unfortunately, because of the complex interplay among controllers, apps, and data plane inputs, at present it is difﬁcult to systematically identify and analyze these cross-plane vulnerabilities. We present E VENT S COPE , a vulnerability detection tool that automatically analyzes SDN control plane event usage, discovers candidate vulnerabilities based on missing event-handling routines, and validates vulnerabilities based on data plane effects. To accurately detect missing event handlers without ground truth or developer aid, we cluster apps according to similar event usage and mark inconsistencies as candidates. We create an event ﬂow graph to observe a global view of events and control ﬂows within the control plane and use it to validate vulnerabilities that affect the data plane. We applied E VENT S COPE to the ONOS SDN controller and uncovered 14 new vulnerabilities.
