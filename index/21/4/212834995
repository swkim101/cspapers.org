In this paper, various methods of bio-inspired locomotion are investigated with the objective of designing a robotic system to transport a payload via the convention of repeatable jump gliding. The authors provide the mission objective of transporting a payload over a stepped incline, and propose a winged bipedal robot parameterized under the bounding requisites that such a system be capable of exploiting the joint locomotive implications of jumping and gliding for a series of controlled flights and subsequent landings.
