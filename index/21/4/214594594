This paper deals with, a new approach for faults detection and estimation in the stator windings of the three phases induction motor. Firstly, the classical MRAS method is used for the online estimation of the stator resistance. The estimator well identifies the symmetric fault introduced in the three phases of the stator. However, this technique is not an efficient method for the estimation of asymmetric fault problems. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose a new diagnosis technique, which is based on the use of the error between the measured stator currents of the machine and the estimated ones obtained from the virtual model of the same machine. Therefore, fin adaption mechanism (PI), is used to estimate the unbalanced fault in the three stator phases. This method has been designed to be stable for different operating modes. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
