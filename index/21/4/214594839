From a point of view of automatic control, torque–driven robot manipulators are classified as Multi Input – Multi Output (MIMO) nonlinear dynamical systems. Although these features make them difficult to control, the regulation control objective (constant desired position) in joint space can be achieved by Proportional Derivative (PD) control with gravity compensation under trivial gains tuning. This paper addresses issues about the robustness of this control scheme vis–à–vis time-varying desired position, and approximated or imperfect velocity measurement.
