Industry widely uses unstructured merge tools that rely on textual analysis to detect and resolve conflicts between code contributions. Semistructured merge tools go further by partially exploring the syntactic structure of code artifacts, and, as a consequence, obtaining significant merge accuracy gains for Java-like languages. To understand whether semistructured merge and the observed gains generalize to other kinds of languages, we implement two semistructured merge tools for JavaScript, and compare them to an unstructured tool. We find that current semistructured merge algorithms and frameworks are not directly applicable for scripting languages like JavaScript. By adapting the algorithms, and studying 10,345 merge scenarios from 50 JavaScript projects on GitHub, we find evidence that our JavaScript tools report fewer spurious conflicts than unstructured merge, without compromising the correctness of the merging process. The gains, however, are much smaller than the ones observed for Java-like languages, suggesting that semistructured merge advantages might be limited for languages that allow both commutative and non-commutative declarations at the same syntactic level.
