This paper describes a multi-model identification of nonlinear system. Indeed, the multi-model approach is based on neural networks, and is obtained by parametric identification. The proposed architecture of the neural model is multilayered perceptron. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown through a numerical simulation of a nonlinear system. The obtained results are very satisfactory and show a very good precision relative in to the case of the nonlinearity of the system.
