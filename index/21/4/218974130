We present an automated approach to analyze the text of an online conversation and determine whether one of the participants is a cyberpredator who is preying on another participant. The task is divided into two stages, 1) the classification of each message, and 2) the classification of the entire conversation. Each stage uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to perform the classification task.
