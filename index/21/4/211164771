The use of robotics in surgery has increased significantly in the last decade from its initial applications in urologic procedures. Robotic surgery has been increasingly utilized not only for urologic and gynecologic procedures, but also in other gastrointestinal disease sites, particularly for cancers of the rectum, pancreas, stomach, and esophagus. As the use of robotic surgery becomes more widespread for gastrointestinal malignancies and the potential benefits of this approach become better defined, an understanding of disparities in access and availability of robotic surgery across different racial and socioeconomic factors is increasingly relevant. In this short commentary, we aim to discuss the use of robotic surgery specifically for gastrointestinal malignancies with a focus on disparate patient factors that have recently been associated the receipt of this approach.
