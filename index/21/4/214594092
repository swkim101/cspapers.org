DNA is the living cells macromolecule that contains all genetic information, it has several regular and irregular characteristics in its nucleotide composition. Mapping DNA sequence by the frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) produces fractal landscapes. A fractal analysis describes only the FCGR image global fractal features and neglects that the DNA sequences are highly heterogeneous. For this reason, a multifractal analysis is required. In this paper, we apply on the C.elegans genome a multifractal analysis. First, we construct the FCGR image with different orders. Next, with the FCGR probability set, the general dimension spectrum and the multifractal spectrum are calculated. Then, we extract this two spectrum from C.elegans chromosomes and some of its regions. The obtained results show C.elegans multifractal nature and this multifractality is variable according to the chromosome region.
