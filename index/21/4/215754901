Probabilistic logics combine the expressive power of logic with the ability to reason with uncertainty. Several probabilistic logic languages have been proposed in the past, each of them with their own features. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic constraint logic programming language, which combines constraint logic programming with probabilistic reasoning. The language supports modeling of discrete as well as continuous probability distributions by expressing constraints on random variables. We introduce the declarative semantics of this language, present an exact inference algorithm to derive bounds on the joint probability distributions consistent with the specified constraints, and give experimental results. The results obtained are encouraging, indicating that inference in our language is feasible for solving challenging problems.
