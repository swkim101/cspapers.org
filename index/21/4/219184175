This paper investigates the neural dynamics and gamma oscillation on a complex network with excitatory and inhibitory neurons (E-I network), as such network is ubiquitous in the brain. The system consists of a small-world network of neurons, which are emulated by Izhikevich model. Moreover, mixed Regular Spiking (RS) and Chattering (CH) neurons are considered to imitate excitatory neurons, and Fast Spiking (FS) neurons are used to mimic inhibitory neurons. Besides, the relationship between synchronization and gamma rhythm is explored by adjusting the critical parameters of our model. Experiments visually demonstrate that the gamma oscillations are generated by synchronous behaviors of our neural network. We also discover that the Chattering(CH) excitatory neurons can make the system easier to synchronize.
