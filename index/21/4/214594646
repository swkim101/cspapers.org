The synthesis method of sliding mode diagnostic observers for fault identification in dynamic and sensors of mechatronic systems is proposed and investigated. These diagnostic observers provide robustness of the diagnostic process under unknown disturbances. The proposed method is based on the idea of constructing a reduced (having a smaller dimension) model of the mechatronic systems, which has selective sensitivity with respect to faults and disturbances, based on which a sliding diagnostic observer is built. The results of simulation confirm the efficiency of synthesized observers proposed method.
