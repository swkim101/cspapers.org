 Over 250 million people in India currently lack access to basic services needed to live a rudimentary lifestyle. Most of these people reside in rural parts of the country. Lack of employment, economic opportunities, and development in rural areas are foundational to low socio-economic levels in these communities. Added to this are environmental issues such as natural resource depletion, yearlong droughts, climate change. We hypothesize that social enterprises developed at the community level can improve the quality of life of people in rural India.
 The lack of access to investment and resources to identify and develop social enterprises are major challenges for the creation of social enterprises. We hypothesize that a successful partnership between two major stakeholders, namely, social entrepreneurs and corporate social responsibility (CSR) investors is the key in developing multiple social enterprises to foster rural development. However, CSR and other investors require quantitative information along with impact evaluation of the value proposition before investing. Social entrepreneurs lack tools to develop and present value propositions for the village in a quantitative form. In this paper, we propose a computational framework to fill this gap and to facilitate dialog between CSR investors and social entrepreneurs that may result in a mutually favorable investment.
