Power quality disturbances became a major issue in modern commercial distribution grids; hence, an innovative attempt to diagnose the faults is necessary for their optimal management. This paper presents a hybrid approach using Stockwell Transform (ST) and Machine Learning Techniques (MLT) to detect, classify and locate the single-line-to-ground (SLG) faults in a modeled distribution feeder to a laboratory scale. The three-phase current signals are processed with ST to extract useful features whereas the Machine Learning Techniques (MLT) including the Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) were employed to diagnose the SLG faults based on the extracted features. The presented results proven to be highly satisfactory for the proposed hybrid SLG fault diagnosis methodology under the presence of measurement noise and load demand uncertainties.
