Existing learning-based surface reconstruction methods from point clouds are still facing challenges in terms of scalability and preservation of details on large-scale point clouds. In this paper, we propose the SSRNet, a novel scalable learning-based method for surface reconstruction. The proposed SSRNet constructs local geometry-aware features for octree vertices and designs a scalable reconstruction pipeline, which not only greatly enhances the predication accuracy of the relative position between the vertices and the implicit surface facilitating the surface reconstruction quality, but also allows dividing the point cloud and octree vertices and processing different parts in parallel for superior scalability on large-scale point clouds with millions of points. Moreover, SSRNet demonstrates outstanding generalization capability and only needs several surface data for training, much less than other learning-based reconstruction methods, which can effectively avoid overfitting. The trained model of SSRNet on one dataset can be directly used on other datasets with superior performance. Finally, the time consumption with SSRNet on a large-scale point cloud is acceptable and competitive. To our knowledge, the proposed SSRNet is the first to really bring a convincing solution to the scalability issue of the learning-based surface reconstruction methods, and is an important step to make learning-based methods competitive with respect to geometry processing methods on real-world and challenging data. Experiments show that our method achieves a breakthrough in scalability and quality compared with state-of-the-art learning-based methods.
