This paper deals with MRAS Speed sensorless Vector Control of Induction motor, where the adaptive mechanism include two parallel loops having Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controller (T2FLC) and low-pass filter. The main advantage of this controller is the consideration of the uncertainties in the linguistic rules of the estimated models. The stability of the closed loop is guaranteed by the Lyapunov function, and the robustness face to parameter variation at low speed range is proven. The simulation results show the effectiveness of our new approach.
