Transformers have been proved effective for many deep learning tasks. Training transformers, however, requires non-trivial efforts regarding carefully designing learning rate schedulers and cutting-edge optimizers (the standard SGD fails to train Transformers effectively). In this paper, we study Transformer training from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our analysis reveals that unbalanced gradients are not the root cause of the instability of training. Instead, we identify an amplification effect that substantially influences training. Specifically, we observe that for each layer in a multi-layer Transformer model, heavy dependency on its residual branch makes training unstable since it amplifies small parameter perturbations (e.g., parameter updates) and result in significant disturbances in the model output, yet a light dependency limits the potential of model training and can lead to an inferior trained model. Inspired by our analysis, we propose Admin ($\mathbf{Ad}$aptive $\mathbf{m}$odel $\mathbf{in}$itialization) to stabilize the training in the early stage and unleash its full potential in the late stage. Extensive experiments show that Admin is more stable, converges faster, and leads to better performance.
