The multiphase interleaved synchronous buck converters with coupled phase inductors, are being preferred for voltage regulator modules, they are widely used in the industry, requiring low output voltage, high output current, and fast transient response, since they simultaneously offer better steady-state efficiency and faster dynamic response. The reduction of the output current ripple and the increase of its frequency are possible due to the use of interleaving techniques.In this paper, we present a comparative study between PI and fuzzy controllers in purpose to regulate output current and voltage. Therefore, the overshoot decreased and the ripples will reduced. Using Matlab/Simulink, simulation results, showed that the performance of the fuzzy controller, its robustness and simplicity which characterize this controller.
