A wide range of applications, from social media to scientific literature analysis, involve graphs in which documents are connected by links. We introduce a topic model for link prediction based on the intuition that linked documents will tend to have similar topic distributions, integrating a max-margin learning criterion and lexical term weights in the loss function. We validate our approach on the tweets from 2,000 Sina Weibo users and evaluate our modelâ€™s reconstruction of the social network.
