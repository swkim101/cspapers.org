We introduce a novel lidar-monocular visual odometry approach using point and line features. Compared to previous point-only based lidar-visual odometry, our approach leverages more environment structure information by introducing both point and line features into pose estimation. We provide a robust method for point and line depth extraction, and formulate the extracted depth as prior factors for point-line bundle adjustment. This method greatly reduces the featuresâ€™ 3D ambiguity and thus improves the pose estimation accuracy. Besides, we also provide a purely visual motion tracking method and a novel scale correction scheme, leading to an efficient lidarmonocular visual odometry system with high accuracy. The evaluations on the public KITTI odometry benchmark show that our technique achieves more accurate pose estimation than the state-of-the-art approaches, and is sometimes even better than those leveraging semantic information.
