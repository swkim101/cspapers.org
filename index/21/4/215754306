The complexity of graph homomorphisms has been a subject of intense study [1]â€“[8]. The partition function $Z_{\mathrm{A}}(\cdot)$ of graph homomorphism is defined by a symmetric matrix A over $\mathbb{C}$. We prove that the complexity dichotomy of [7] extends to bounded degree graphs. More precisely, we prove that either $G\rightarrow Z_{\mathrm{A}}(G)$ is computable in polynomial-time for every $G$, or for some $\Delta > 0$ it is #P-hard over (simple) graphs $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta (G)\leq\Delta$. The tractability criterion on A for this dichotomy is explicit, and can be decided in polynomial-time in the size of A. We also show that the dichotomy is effective in that either a P-time algorithm for, or a reduction from #SAT to, $Z_{\mathrm{A}}(\cdot)$ can be constructed from A, in the respective cases.
