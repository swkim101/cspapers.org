Wheeled-legged robots combine the efficiency of wheeled robots when driving on suitably flat surfaces and versatility of legged robots when stepping over or around obstacles. This paper introduces a planning and control framework to realise dynamic locomotion for wheeled biped robots. We propose the Cart-Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (Cart-LIPM) as a template model for the rolling motion and the under-actuated LIPM for contact changes while walking. The generated motion is then tracked by an inverse dynamic whole-body controller which coordinates all joints, including the wheels. The framework has a hierarchical structure and is implemented in a model predictive control (MPC) fashion. To validate the proposed approach for hybrid motion generation, two scenarios involving different types of obstacles are designed in simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such online dynamic hybrid locomotion has been demonstrated on wheeled biped robots.
