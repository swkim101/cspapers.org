For the sliding mode control, the gains of the control algorithm depend on the knowledge of limits of the uncertain parameters of the system and perturbations. In practical life, it is not always possible to have an exact estimate of these limits. This practice can have effects on the closed-loop system, especially in terms of chattering. For this purpose an adaptive commands by super-twisting has been proposed in this paper in order to adjust the gains. Simulation results for the 2-DOF helicopter shows the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
