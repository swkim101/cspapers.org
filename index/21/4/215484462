Citing, quoting, and forwarding & commenting behaviors are widely seen in academia, news media, and social media. Existing behavior modeling approaches focused on mining content and describing preferences of authors, speakers, and users. However, behavioral intention plays an important role in generating content on the platforms. In this work, we propose to identify the referential intention which motivates the action of using the referred (e.g., cited, quoted, and retweeted) source and content to support their claims. We adopt a theory in sociology to develop a schema of four types of intentions. The challenge lies in the heterogeneity of observed contextual information surrounding the referential behavior, such as referred content (e.g., a cited paper), local context (e.g., the sentence citing the paper), neighboring context (e.g., the former and latter sentences), and network context (e.g., the academic network of authors, affiliations, and keywords). We propose a new neural framework with Interactive Hierarchical Attention (IHA) to identify the intention of referential behavior by properly aggregating the heterogeneous contexts. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively identify the type of intention of citing behaviors (on academic data) and retweeting behaviors (on Twitter). And learning the heterogeneous contexts collectively can improve the performance. This work opens a door for understanding content generation from a fundamental perspective of behavior sciences.
