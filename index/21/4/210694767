In recent years, the extensive application of the Python language has made its analysis work more and more valuable. Many static analysis algorithms need to rely on the construction of call graphs. In this paper, we did a comparative empirical analysis of several widely used Python static call graph tools both quantitatively and qualitatively. Experiments show that the existing Python static call graph tools have a large difference in the construction effectiveness, and there is still room for improvement.
