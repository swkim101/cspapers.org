This tutorial introduces the different challenges and current solutions to the automatic processing of Arabic and its dialects. The tutorial has two parts: First, we present a discussion of generic issues relevant to Arabic NLP and detail dialectal linguistic issues and the challenges they pose for NLP. In the second part, we review the state-of-the-art in Arabic processing covering several enabling technologies and applications, e.g., dialect identification, morphological processing (analysis, disambiguation, tokenization, POS tagging), parsing, and machine translation.
