Dynamic network pruning achieves runtime acceleration by dynamically determining the inference paths based on different inputs. However, previous methods directly generate continuous decision values for each weight channel, which cannot reflect a clear and interpretable pruning process. In this paper, we propose to explicitly model the discrete weight channel selections, which encourages more diverse weights utilization, and achieves more sparse runtime inference paths. Meanwhile, with the help of interpretable layerwise channel selections in the dynamic network, we can visualize the network decision paths explicitly for model interpretability. We observe that there are clear differences in the layerwise decisions between normal and adversarial examples. Therefore, we propose a novel adversarial example detection algorithm by discriminating the runtime decision features. Experiments show that our dynamic network achieves higher prediction accuracy under the similar computing budgets on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets compared to traditional static pruning methods and other dynamic pruning approaches. The proposed adversarial detection algorithm can significantly improve the state-of-the-art detection rate across multiple attacks, which provides an opportunity to build an interpretable and robust model.
