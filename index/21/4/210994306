Trust prediction in online social networks is crucial for information dissemination, product promotion, and decision making. Existing work on trust prediction mainly utilizes the network structure or the low-rank approximation of a trust network. These approaches can suffer from the problem of data sparsity and prediction accuracy. Inspired by the homophily theory, which shows a pervasive feature of social and economic networks that trust relations tend to be developed among similar people, we propose a novel deep user model for trust prediction based on user similarity measurement. It is a comprehensive data sparsity insensitive model that combines a user review behavior and the item characteristics that this user is interested in. With this user model, we firstly generate a user's latent features mined from user review behavior and the item properties that the user cares. Then we develop a pair-wise deep neural network to further learn and represent these user features. Finally, we measure the trust relations between a pair of people by calculating the user feature vector cosine similarity. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets, which demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over the representative baseline works.
