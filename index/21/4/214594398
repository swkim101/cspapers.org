The aim of this paper is to propose a new design variable speed wind turbine control based on Discrete-Time Sliding Mode Control (DT-SMC). Firstly, the plant model of the system is built as a linear model. To overcome the chattering problem, a second order sliding mode controller is proposed. A novel method for the design of the sliding surface based on the resolution of a Sylvester equation is designed and the stability is proved. Simulation results have been presented to illustrate and confirm the usefulness and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.
