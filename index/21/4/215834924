Recent works show that end-to-end, (semi-) supervised network embedding models can generate satisfactory vectors to represent network topology, and are even applicable to unseen graphs by inductive learning. However, domain mismatch between training and testing network for inductive learning, as well as lack of labeled data often compromises the outcome of such methods. To make matters worse, while transfer learning and active learning techniques, being able to solve such problems correspondingly, have been well studied on regular i.i.d data, relatively few attention has been paid on networks. Consequently, we propose in this paper a method for active transfer learning on networks named active-transfer network embedding, abbreviated ATNE. In ATNE we jointly consider the influence of each node on the network from the perspectives of transfer and active learning, and hence design novel and effective influence scores combining both aspects in the training process to facilitate node selection. We demonstrate that ATNE is efficient and decoupled from the actual model used. Further extensive experiments show that ATNE outperforms state-of-the-art active node selection methods and shows versatility in different situations.
