In this paper, an analysis of a general memristor model is discussed. This analysis is generated using a proposed Verilog-A model. We prove that this model correlates the experimental characterization data of the HfO2-based OxRRAM memristor device and investigate the characteristics of both bipolar and unipolar memristor behaviors. Our simulation results carry the desired nonlinear memristor fingerprint, and the applicability to fit and simulate different switching behaviors. These results are verified by both electrical and experimental characterization data. Hence, these results suggest that the Verilog-A model is suitable for logic circuits, low-power and high-density applications at the industrial levels.
