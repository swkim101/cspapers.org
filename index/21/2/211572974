Cross-modality person re-identification (cm-ReID) is a challenging but key technology for intelligent video analysis. Existing works mainly focus on learning modality-shared representation by embedding different modalities into a same feature space, lowering the upper bound of feature distinctiveness. In this paper, we tackle the above limitation by proposing a novel cross-modality shared-specific feature transfer algorithm (termed cm-SSFT) to explore the potential of both the modality-shared information and the modality-specific characteristics to boost the reidentification performance. We model the affinities of different modality samples according to the shared features and then transfer both shared and specific features among and across modalities. We also propose a complementary feature learning strategy including modality adaption, project adversarial learning and reconstruction enhancement to learn discriminative and complementary shared and specific features of each modality, respectively. The entire cmSSFTalgorithm can be trained in an end-to-end manner. We conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the superiority ofthe overall algorithm and the effectiveness ofeach component. The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts by 22.5% and 19.3% mAP on the two mainstream benchmark datasets SYSU-MM01 and RegDB, respectively.
