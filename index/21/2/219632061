In this paper, we propose a method of visualizing 3D motion with zero latency. This method achieves motion visualization by projecting special high-frequency light patterns on moving objects without using any feedback mechanisms. For this objective, we focus on the time integration of light rays in the sensing system of observers. It is known that the visual system of human observers integrates light rays in a certain period. Similarly, the image sensor in a camera integrates light rays during the exposure time. Thus, our method embeds multiple images into a time-varying light field, such that the observer of the time-varying light field observes completely different images according to the dynamic motion of the scene. Based on this concept, we propose a method of generating special high-frequency patterns of projector lights. After projection onto target objects with projectors, the image observed on the target changes automatically depending on the motion of the objects and without any scene sensing and data analysis. In other words, we achieve motion visualization without the time delay incurred during sensing and computing.
