Converting point clouds generated by Laser scanning, multiview stereo imagery or depth cameras into compact polygon meshes is a challenging problem in vision. Existing methods are either robust to imperfect data or scalable, but rarely both. In this paper, we address this issue with an hybrid method that successively connects and slices planes detected from 3D data. The core idea consists in constructing an efficient and compact partitioning data structure. The later is i) spatially-adaptive in the sense that a plane slices a restricted number of relevant planes only, and ii) composed of components with different structural meaning resulting from a preliminary analysis of the plane connectivity. Our experiments on a variety of objects and sensors show the versatility of our approach as well as its competitiveness with respect to existing methods.
