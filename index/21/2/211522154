Aimed at people interested in teaching AI to students of all backgrounds and others interested in broadening participation in AI, this lightning talk describes the thought process behind AI4ALL's online Open Learning curriculum, the first module of which was officially released in September 2019. AI4ALL Open Learning makes AI education free and approachable to groups that are otherwise excluded from the tech economy due to socioeconomic status, geographic location, access to resources, race, gender, and other factors. The module released in September is designed for high school students and requires no programming or Math experience. It centers around "AI literacy" - what AI is, how students are using it in their everyday lives, how they might in the future, and the ethics and social impacts of AI. It engages students through discussion with their classmates, their community, and their other classes, and it offers students opportunities to pursue AI projects that intersect with their interests. During the lightning talk, we will also discuss the next stage of development for the AI4ALL Open Learning curriculum: modules that build students' technical AI skills in the context of the students' interests and passions.
