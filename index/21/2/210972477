Distributed scalable algorithms are sought in many multi-robot contexts. In this work we address the dynamic optimal linear assignment problem, exemplified as a target tracking mission in which mobile robots visually track mobile targets in a one-to-one capacity. We adapt our previous work on formation achievement by means of a distributed simplex variant, which results in a conceptually simple consensus solution, asynchronous in nature and requiring only local broadcast communications. This approach seamlessly tackles dynamic changes in both costs and network topology. Improvements designed to accelerate the global convergence in the face of dynamically evolving task rewards are described and evaluated with simulations that highlight the efficiency and scalability of the proposal. Experiments with a team of three Turtlebot robots are finally shown to validate the applicability of the algorithm.
