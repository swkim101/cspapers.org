This thesis explores how reinforcement learning (RL) agents can provide explanations for their actions and behaviours. As humans, we build causal models to encode cause-effect relations of events and use these to explain why events happen. Taking inspiration from cognitive psychology and social science literature, I build causal explanation models and explanation dialogue models for RL agents. By mimicking human-like explanation models, these agents can provide explanations that are natural and intuitive to humans.
