The world of manufacturing has changed since Henry Ford first utilized a moving assembly line for the mass production of an entire automobile on December 1st, 1913. His innovation reduced the time it took to build a car from more than 12 hours to two hours and 30 minutes. Ford attested that the increased efficiency and reduced labor cost associated with the compartmentalization of production was almost unstoppable. Since that time, manufacturing robots handle a huge variety of practical tasks using much greater speed and efficiency than human workers.
