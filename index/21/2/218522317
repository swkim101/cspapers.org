Password managers allow users to use strong and unique passwords online. However, users have to either trust a third-party service to manage their passwords or manually synchronize passwords among local devices. To relax the trust assumption while maintaining usability, in this work, we develop a password manager that stores passwords on mobile phones. The passwords can be easily unlocked via the userâ€™s fingerprint and securely sent to other devices such as a desktop browser. Our implementation uses the iOS local authentication API for biological authentication, and uses firebase cloud messaging to send the password to the browser.
