The problem of selecting a subset of nodes with greatest influence in a graph, commonly known as influence maximization, has been well studied over the past decade. This problem has real world applications which can potentially affect lives of individuals. Algorithmic decision making in such domains raises concerns about their societal implications. One of these concerns, which surprisingly has only received limited attention so far, is algorithmic bias and fairness. We propose a flexible framework that extends and unifies the existing works in fairness-aware influence maximization. This framework is based on an integer programming formulation of the influence maximization problem. The fairness requirements are enforced by adding linear constraints or modifying the objective function. Contrary to the previous work which designs specific algorithms for each variant, we develop a formalism which is general enough for specifying different notions of fairness. A problem defined in this formalism can be then solved using efficient mixed integer programming solvers. The experimental evaluation indicates that our framework not only is general but also is competitive with existing algorithms.
