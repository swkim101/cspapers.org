Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most convenient and non-invasive tools for monitoring peoplesâ€™ heart condition, which can use for diagnosing a wide range of heart diseases, including Cardiac Arrhythmia, Acute Coronary Syndrome, et al. However, traditional ECG disease detection models show substantial rates of misdiagnosis due to the limitations of the abilities of extracted features. Recent deep learning methods have shown significant advantages, but they do not provide publicly available services for those who have no training data or computational resources. In this paper, we demonstrate our work on building, training, and serving such out-of-the-box cloud deep learning service for cardiac disease detection from ECG named CardioLearn. The analytic ability of any other ECG recording devices can be enhanced by connecting to the Internet and invoke our open API. As a practical example, we also design a portable smart hardware device along with an interactive mobile program, which can collect ECG and detect potential cardiac diseases anytime and anywhere.
