Swarm robots operate as autonomous agents and a swarm as a whole gets autonomous by its capability of collective decision-making. Despite intensive research on models of collective decision-making, the implementation in multi-robot systems is still challenging. Here, we advance the state of the art by introducing more plasticity to the decision-making process and by increasing the scenario difficulty. Most studies on large-scale multi-robot decision-making are limited to one instance of an iterated exploration-dissemination phase followed by successful and permanent convergence. We investigate a dynamic environment that requires constant collective monitoring of option qualities. Once a significant change in qualities is detected by the swarm, it has to collectively reconsider its previous decision accordingly. This is only possible by preventing lock-ins, a global consensus state of no return (i.e., a dominant majority of robots prevents the swarm from switching to another, possibly better option). In addition, we introduce a scenario of increased difficulty as the robots must locate themselves to assess the quality of an option. Using local communication, swarm robots propagate hop-count information throughout the swarm to form a global reference frame. We successfully validate our implementation in many swarm robot experiments concerning robustness to disruptions of the reference frame, scalability, and adaptivity to a dynamic environment.
