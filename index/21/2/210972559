In this paper we present a model for simulating the pushing of dirt. This is a complex problem requiring the study of the action space for the robot, a deformable model for movable earth, the interaction between the robotâ€™s pushing surface and the environment, and techniques that will allow this model to simulate such a scenario. We present our novel framework for studying this problem including the grid-based model of the environment, a simplified earth pushing robot model, and action strategies to model the pushing of dirt from one area of the environment to another.
