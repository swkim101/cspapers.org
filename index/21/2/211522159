To meet the ever-increasing demand for information technology (IT) workforce, we must educate and produce high-quality graduates. It is crucial to balance fundamental programming concepts and coding skills to develop skilled IT work forces who solve a complicated real-life problem using technology. In this project, we created scenario-based active learning modules by using a visual platform to improve student learning on programming concepts and skills.
