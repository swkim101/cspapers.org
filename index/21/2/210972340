Compared with conventional robots, soft structures such as living octopus arms and various soft-robot arms have more degrees of freedom (DOFs) and greater flexibility. Soft robot arms have a considerable range of applications. However, it is arduous to establish a mechanical model for them, because of the hyper-redundant DOFs, and the hyperelasticity and nonlinearity of the soft material. In this study, to investigate the deformation of soft octopus robot arms, the simplified closed-form analytical equations for the curvature and torsion were derived according to the Cosserat theory. A closed-form model for axial constriction was developed. The analytical equations were experimentally validated, and a dynamical simulation of the multi-flexible bodies was performed for a cable-driven soft-robot arm inspired by the octopus. The results show satisfactory accuracy.
