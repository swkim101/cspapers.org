For delivering high-quality artifacts within the budget and on schedule, software delivery teams ideally should have a holistic and in-process view of the current health and future trajectory of the project. However, such insights need to be at the right level of granularity and need to be derived typically from a heterogeneous project environment, in a way that helps development team members with their tasks at hand. Due to client mandates, software delivery project environments employ many disparate tools and teams tend to be distributed, thus making the relevant information retrieval, insight generation, and developer intelligence augmentation process fairly complex. In this paper, we discuss our journey in this area spanning across facets like software project modelling and new development metrics, studying developer priorities, adoption of new metrics, and different approaches of developer intelligence augmentation. Finally, we present our exploration of new immersive technologies for human-centered software engineering.
