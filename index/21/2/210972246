This paper presents a three-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) gravity compensation mechanism for the waists of cooperative robots whose centers of mass change according to the arm poses. It comprises 2-DOF and 1-DOF gravity compensation mechanisms in series, and is capable of natural and agile motions such as bobbing and weaving. The 2-DOF mechanism for the upper part of the waist acts as a universal joint. To compensate for the gravity of this 2-DOF motion, a simple and robust link mechanism with one compressive spring is proposed. Moreover, for the complete gravity compensation regardless of the arm poses, a three-dimensional (3D) parallel link structure that maintains the upper body parallel to the ground is introduced. The 1-DOF gravity compensation mechanism, which provides the motions of the hip and thigh, also has a parallelogram structure to maintain the waist parallel to the ground. The implemented 3-DOF waist mechanism can compensate for up to 23 kg and its own weight. It has an adjusting mechanism that can easily calibrate the amount of compensation in case the weight of the upper body changes. The large workspace enables the upper body to move in any direction in a 3D space without singularity. Therefore, the robot with this waist can touch the ground to pick up objects on the ground as well as reach an object at a height of 2145 mm.
