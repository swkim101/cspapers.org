Glass is very common in our daily life. Existing computer vision systems neglect it and thus may have severe consequences, e.g., a robot may crash into a glass wall. However, sensing the presence of glass is not straightforward. The key challenge is that arbitrary objects/scenes can appear behind the glass, and the content within the glass region is typically similar to those behind it. In this paper, we propose an important problem of detecting glass from a single RGB image. To address this problem, we construct a large-scale glass detection dataset (GDD) and design a glass detection network, called GDNet, which explores abundant contextual cues for robust glass detection with a novel large-field contextual feature integration (LCFI) module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more superior glass detection results on our GDD test set than state-of-the-art methods fine-tuned for glass detection.
