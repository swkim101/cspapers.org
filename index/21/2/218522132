Users tend to search over the Internet to get the most updated news when an event occurs. Search engines should then be capable of effectively retrieving relevant documents for event-related queries. As the previous studies have shown, different retrieval models are needed for different types of events. Therefore, the first step for improving effectiveness is identifying the event-related queries and determining their types. In this paper, we propose a novel model based on deep neural networks to classify event-related queries into four categories: periodic, aperiodic, one-time-only, and non-event. The proposed model combines recurrent neural networks (by feeding two LSTM layers with query frequencies) and visual recognition models (by transforming time-series data from a 1D signal to a 2D image - later passed to a CNN model) for effective query type estimation. Worth noting is that our method uses only the time-series data of query frequencies, without the need to resort to any external sources such as contextual data, which makes it language and domain-independent with regards to the query issued. For evaluation, we build upon the previous datasets on event-related queries to create a new dataset that fits the purpose of our experiments. The obtained results show that our proposed model can achieve an F1-score of 0.87.
