Programming is typically a difficult and repetitive task. Programmers encounter endless problems during programming, and they often need to write similar code over and over again. To prevent programmers from reinventing wheels thus increase their productivity, we propose a context-aware code-to-code recommendation tool named Lancer. With the support of a Library-Sensitive Language Model (LSLM) and the BERT model, Lancer is able to automatically analyze the intention of the incomplete code and recommend relevant and reusable code samples in real-time. A video demonstration of Lancer can be found at https://youtu.be/tO9nhqZY35g. Lancer is open source and the code is available at https://github.com/sfzhou5678/Lancer.
