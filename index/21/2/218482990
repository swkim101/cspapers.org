Despite high levels of digital technology access among college students, technology disruption remains an issue. This study was conducted to understand how technology disruption might contribute to socio-economic disparities in academic performance. Data were analyzed from a non-representative sample of 748 undergraduate students. We examined socio-economic differences in types of technology problems students experience; the consequences of those problems; and beliefs about how to handle future problems. Socio-economic status was not associated with types of technology problems, but it was associated with greater negative consequences and less-efficacious beliefs about handling future situations. These findings are consistent with sociological work on socio-economic differences in student help-seeking. They also elaborate mechanistic understanding of the technology maintenance construct. Finally, for those interested in designing to reduce socio-economic inequalities, they suggest the need for interfaces that go beyond information accessibility to facilitate student empowerment and student-teacher communication.
