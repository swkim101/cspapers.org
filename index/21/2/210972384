This study proposes a biped-robot pelvis-kinematics estimator based on the touch-point updating method. Because the pelvis frame is used as the base coordinate for the control, the kinematics of it with respect to the global frame should be precisely estimated. To this end, it was necessary to know where the robot made contact with the ground. The touch-point concept was introduced as the temporal contact-point, which was instantly the robotâ€™s rotation center. By updating this point, the biped's global pelvis-kinematics could be estimated. The proposed estimator was implemented into the actual robot, and its superiority was verified through ground-truth data.
