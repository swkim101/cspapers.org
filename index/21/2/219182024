Most feature selection methods only perform well on datasets with relatively small set of features. In the case of large feature sets and small number of data points, almost none of the existing feature selection methods help in achieving high accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize the feature selection process through Frequent Pattern Growth algorithm to find sets of features that appear frequently among the top features selected by the main feature selection methods. Our experimental evaluation on two datasets containing a small and very large number of features shows that our approach significantly improves the accuracy results of the dataset with a very large number of features.
