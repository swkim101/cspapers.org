Social live video streaming has become a global economic and social phenomenon with the rise of platforms like Facebook-Live, Youtube-Live, and Twitch. The phenomenon of user donation in these communities is rapidly emerging, towards which however we have very limited understandings. In this preliminary work, we reveal the dynamics of user donations based on a publicly available (anonymized) dataset with detailed information on over 2 million users and worth in total over 200 million US dollars. Among other results, we find that (i) both the donations received and the donations made are highly skewed, (ii) user donation is strongly correlated with the atmosphere (the volume and the sentiment of real-time user chats) and in the long run, the loss of broadcasters, and (iii) donors are loyal and very generous to their favorite broadcasters while in the mean time they also support others moderately. Our findings represent a first step towards understanding user donations which will shed lights on the donor retention problem and the design of social live video streaming services.
