Food insecurity is a persistent and pernicious problem in the UK. Due to logistical challenges, national food insecurity statistics are unmeasured by government bodies - and this lack of data leads to any local estimates that do exist being routinely questioned by policymakers. We demonstrate a data-driven approach to address this issue, deriving national estimates of food insecurity via combination of supervised machine learning with network analysis of user behaviour, extracted from the worldâ€™s most popular peer-to-peer food sharing application (OLIO). Despite long-standing theoretical links between social graph topologies and physical neighbourhoods, prior research has not considered dimensions of geography, network interactions and behaviours in the digital/analogue space simultaneously. In addressing this oversight, we produce a browser-based, interactive and rapidly updateable visualisation, which can be used to analyse the spatial distribution of food insecurity across the UK, and provide new perspective for policy research.
