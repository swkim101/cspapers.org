Component-based software design has been widely adopted as a way to manage complexity and improve reusability. The approach divides complex systems into smaller modules that can be independently created and reused in different systems. One then combines these components together to achieve desired functionality. Modern software systems are commonly built using components made by different developers who work independently.
