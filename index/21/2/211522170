This paper describes the development process of a graduate course on accessibility that is offered as an elective for software engineering students. The paper reports on the three iterations of the course evolution as topics and pedagogy are updated from one iteration to the next. The main motivation of the course updates was to cover the educational needs of software engineering students, which are not the same as HCI or design students. Software engineering students learned better and became more engaged with the topic of accessibility when it was tied to programming and development- based activities. The final form of the course was evaluated using a survey, and the results showed that students found the course beneficial to their education and relevant to their career. We discuss the challenges of creating, teaching, and maintaining a course on accessibility, and we offer insights on what research is needed in this area to support accessibility educators.
