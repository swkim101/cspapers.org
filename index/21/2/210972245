In the autonomous driving industry, vehicle dynamic models are important to control-in-the-loop simulations. For current commercial self-driving simulators, vehicle dynamic models are expressed explicitly by sophisticated analytical equations, which are accurate but difficult to build and expensive to scale to fleets of vehicles of different brands. In this paper, we introduce a highly automated learning-based vehicle dynamic modeling procedure, which has been deployed on Baidu Apollo self-driving platform, to support cross-vehicle data-driven applications on a large scale. Compared with our previous analytical models, the end-to-end learning-based dynamic models can achieve high accuracy with significantly reduced re-development effort.
