While substantial research has demonstrated that active learning pedagogies are better for learning than passive lectures, we need to understand the trade-offs between different active learning pedagogies. Computer Architecture at Midwestern University has historically been taught using active lectures, introducing content with a few clicker questions. In Fall 2018 (N = 363), short video lectures were made available to students as a supplemental resource. In Spring 2019, the instructor flipped the course, requiring students to watch the video lectures and complete an assignment before attending class. Two versions of the course were taught concurrently, using the same homework assignments, machine problems, and examinations but with different in-class pedagogies. Version SP19PI (N = 179) was taught using peer instruction. Version SP19CP (N = 73) was taught using collaborative problem solving, organizing students into teams of 3 to work on problems. Students completed surveys that measured their perceptions of time spent on the course, course difficulty, perceptions of stress, and sense of belonging. We compare students' performance on midterm exams and their non-cognitive outcomes to examine the relative effects of these different active learning pedagogies. We find that both flipped offerings (peer instruction and collaborative problem solving) benefited students beyond active lectures. Peer instruction (SP19PI) made learning more efficient. Collaborative instruction (SP19CP) provided greater social support for learning and eliminated gender grade disparities.
