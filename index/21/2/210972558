We designed a manipulation purpose small agent vehicle and performed a ghost net recovery mission with the vehicle to test its control accuracy and capacity to be used in other tasks. We constructed a control model that allows the vehicle to perform the complex motion of 4-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) movements and underwater manipulation. Also, we implemented a ghost net recovery algorithm that can automatically detect, grip, and lift ghost nets. The test results show stable yaw, depth, and position control capabilities, and the manipulation performance was verified by automatically performing a ghost net recovery mission.
