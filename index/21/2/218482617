In this paper we describe the design and evaluation of The Next Fairy Tale (TNFT) VR, a theatrical interactive storytelling system created in virtual reality and informed by performing arts theories. TNFT was designed to produce opportunities for interactors to experience role-taking and character identification using design principles drawn from actor training and theatrical performance. We report the results of a pilot qualitative study of interactors using TNFT to explore the elements of the design that supported or hindered roleplaying behavior. We identify four design patterns that supported roleplaying in the system: (1) using explicit roles to set player expectations, (2) embracing the "mask and the mirror" effect, (3) attending to visual and interactional details, and (4) easing the player gently into the roleplaying experience. These patterns speak to a broader need to support roleplay through explicit scaffolding of desired player behaviors in digital narrative experiences.
