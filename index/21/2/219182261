Knowledge graph embedding models enable representation learning on multi-relational graphs and are used in security sensitive domains. But, their security analysis has received little attention. I will research security of these models by designing adversarial attacks against them, improving their adversarial robustness and evaluating the effect of proposed improvement on their interpretability.
