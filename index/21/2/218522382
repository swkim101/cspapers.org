This demo presents VirtualCrowd, a simulation platform for crowdsourcing campaigns. The platform allows the design, configuration, step-by-step execution, and analysis of customized tasks, worker profiles, and crowdsourcing strategies. The platform will be demonstrated through a crowd-mapping example in two cities, which will highlight the utility of VirtualCrowd for complex crowdsourcing tasks in real world settings.
