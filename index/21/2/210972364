Light-weight robotic manipulators in combination with power wheelchairs can help to restore the mobility of people with disabilities. While such systems are available on the market, they typically are limited to fully manual control modes. In research, shared control methods are employed, to increase the usability of these systems. Here, we present an additional extension, by introducing a whole-body control concept to the assistive robotic system EDAN. Combined with shared control, the whole-body controller allows the realization of complex tasks which necessitate the coordination of arm and platform, while ensuring compliant behavior resulting from the impedance control law. The implemented approach is analyzed and validated in an exemplary task of opening a door, passing through it and closing it afterwards. While this task would exceed the reachability of the arm in a classical approach, the combination of whole-body control with a shared control scheme allows for quick and efficient execution.
