Underrepresentation of women and Black and Latinx individuals in computer science (CS) is a well-documented issue facing university training programs and the field in general. In an effort to expand on current knowledge and help bridge the equality gap in CS, a pilot interdisciplinary Computing Applications minor program was started in 2016 at San Francisco State University (SFSU). The "Promoting INclusivity in Computing" (PINC) program was designed to improve diversity in computing and increase computing literacy in data-intensive fields, specifically biology and chemistry. Students participating in the PINC program were compared to lower division CS majors at SFSU on measures assessing their attitudes toward computer science, goal-setting tendencies, experience of stereotype threat, general self-efficacy, and computer science self-efficacy. Analysis showed that students in the PINC program reported lower levels of computer science self-efficacy, but there were no significant differences between groups on self-report measures of goal-setting tendencies, experience of stereotype threat, attitudes toward computer science, and general self-efficacy. These findings highlight the success of the minor program in creating an educational environment that supports the achievement of underrepresented (UR) students, as well as the similar psychoeducational traits of the two groups of students. Findings may be of particular interest to postsecondary CS teachers, researchers interested in social justice and representation issues as they pertain to the field of computing, and university and departmental administrators who wish to increase and promote diversity in their CS programs.
