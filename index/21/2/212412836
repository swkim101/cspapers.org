Concurrent with the growth and widespread use of social networking platforms has been a rise in the prevalence of cyberbullying and cyberharassment, particularly among youth. Although cyberbullying is frequently defined as hostile communication or interactions that occur repetitively via electronic media, little is known about the temporal aspects of cyberbullying on social media, such as how the number, frequency, and timing of posts may vary systematically between cyberbullying and non-cyberbullying social media sessions. In this paper, we aim to contribute to the understanding of temporal properties of cyberbullying through the analysis of Instagram data. That is, the paper presents key temporal characteristics of cyberbullying and trends obtained from descriptive and burst analysis tasks. Our results have the potential to inform the development of more effective cyberbullying detection models.
