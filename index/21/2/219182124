Consumer reviews online may contain suggestions useful for improving the target products and services. Mining suggestions is challenging because the Ô¨Åeld lacks large labelled and balanced datasets. Furthermore, most prior studies have only focused on mining suggestions in a single domain. In this work, we introduce a novel up-sampling technique to address the problem of class imbalance, and propose a multi-task deep learning approach for mining suggestions from multiple domains. Experimental results on a publicly available dataset show that our up-sampling technique coupled with the multi-task framework outperforms state-of-the-art open domain suggestion mining models in terms of the F-1 measure and AUC.
