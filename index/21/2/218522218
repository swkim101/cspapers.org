We describe a digital platform developed in collaboration with clinicians and user groups to provide remote healthcare monitoring and support in a dementia care application. The platform uses data from sensory devices that are deployed in participantsâ€™ homes and utilises a set machine learning and analytical algorithms to identify risks of adverse health conditions such as Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) and hypertension in people with dementia. The platform includes a clinical interface that is used by a monitoring team to view alerts and notifications that are generated by the algorithms and to also browse the in-home activity and physiological data in a secure and privacy-aware system. The platform complies to the information governance requirements of the UK National Healthcare Service (NHS) and is registered as a class 1 medical device. The platform has been deployed and tested in over 150 homes.
