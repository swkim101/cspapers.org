We present a motion planning algorithm that computes rough trajectories used by a contact-points planner as a guide to grow its search graph. We adapt collision-free motion planning algorithms to plan a path within the guide space, a submanifold of the configuration space included in the free space in which the configurations are subject to static stability constraint. We first discuss the definition of the guide space. Then we detail the different techniques and ideas involved: relevant C-space sampling for humanoid robot, task-driven projection process, static stability test based on polyhedral convex cones theory's double description method. We finally present results from our implementation of the algorithm.
