In this demonstration, we present an intelligent system for business analysis and market research that can produce actionable competitive and strategic insight. It has two sub systems, a news content processing pipeline and a semantic search engine. The pipeline collects global business news and processes them to establish context, themes, topics, entities, sentiment and relationships. The semantic search system integrates all the information produced by the pipeline and provides users the semantic search and information exploration ability. This paper introduces all the components of this system.
