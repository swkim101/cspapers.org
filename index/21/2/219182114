Automatically detecting the private nature of images posted in social networks such as Facebook, Flickr, and Instagram, is a long-standing goal considering the pervasiveness of these networks. Several prior works to image privacy prediction showed that object tags from images are highly informative about images' privacy. However, we conjecture that other aspects of images captured by abstract concepts (e.g., religion, sikhism, spirituality) can improve the performance of models that use only the concrete objects from an image (e.g., temple and person). Experimental results on a Flickr dataset show that the abstract concepts and concrete object tags complement each other and yield the best performance when used in combination as features for image privacy prediction.
