Link prediction in knowledge graphs (KGs) aims at predicting potential links between entities in KGs. Existing knowledge graph embedding (KGE) based methods represent individual entities and links in KGs as vectors in low-dimension space. However, these methods focus mainly on the link prediction of individual entities, yet neglect that between group entities, which exist widely in real-world KGs. In this paper, we propose a KGE based method, called GTransA, for link prediction between group entities in a heterogeneous network by integrating individual entity links into group entity links during prediction. Experiments show that GTransA decreases mean rank by 5.4%, compared to TransA.
