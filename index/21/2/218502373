Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for nuclei instance segmentation is important for digital pathology, as it alleviates the burden of labor-intensive annotation and domain shift across datasets. In this work, we propose a Cycle Consistency Panoptic Domain Adaptive Mask R-CNN (CyC-PDAM) architecture for unsupervised nuclei segmentation in histopathology images, by learning from fluorescence microscopy images. More specifically, we first propose a nuclei inpainting mechanism to remove the auxiliary generated objects in the synthesized images. Secondly, a semantic branch with a domain discriminator is designed to achieve panoptic-level domain adaptation. Thirdly, in order to avoid the influence of the source-biased features, we propose a task re-weighting mechanism to dynamically add trade-off weights for the task-specific loss functions. Experimental results on three datasets indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods significantly, and demonstrates a similar performance as fully supervised methods.
