The state of the art person search methods separate person search into detection and re-ID stages, but ignore the consistency between these two stages. The general person detector has no special attention on the query target; The re-ID model is trained on hand-drawn bounding boxes which are not available in person search. To address the consistency problem, we introduce a Task-Consist Two-Stage (TCTS) person search framework, includes an identity-guided query (IDGQ) detector and a Detection Results Adapted (DRA) re-ID model. In the detection stage, the IDGQ detector learns an auxiliary identity branch to compute query similarity scores for proposals. With consideration of the query similarity scores and foreground score, IDGQ produces query-like bounding boxes for the re-ID stage. In the re-ID stage, we predict identity labels of detected bounding boxes, and use these examples to construct a more practical mixed train set for the DRA model. Training on the mixed train set improves the robustness of the re-ID stage to inaccurate detection. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, CUHK-SYSU and PRW. Our framework achieves 93.9% of mAP and 95.1% of rank1 accuracy on CUHK-SYSU, outperforming the previous state of the art methods.
