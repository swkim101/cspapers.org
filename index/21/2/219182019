There is an emerging trend for sellers to use videos to promote their products on e-commerce platforms such as Taobao.com. Current video production workflow includes the production of visual storyline by human directors. We propose a system to automatically generate visual storyline based on the input set of visual materials (e.g. video clips or still images) and then produce a promotional video. In particular, we propose an algorithm called Shot Composition, Selection and Plotting (ShotCSP), which generates visual storylines leveraging film-making principles to improve viewing experience and perceived persuasiveness.
