Deep reinforcement learning has been successfully applied in many decision making scenarios. However, the slow training process and difﬁculty in explaining limit its application. In this paper, we attempt to address some of these problems by proposing a framework of Rule-interposing Learning (RIL) that embeds knowledge into deep reinforcement learning. In this framework, the rules dynamically effect the training progress, and accelerate the learning. The embedded knowledge in form of rule not only improves learning efﬁciency, but also prevents unnecessary or disastrous explorations at early stage of training. Moreover, the modularity of the framework makes it straightforward to transfer high-level knowledge among similar tasks.
