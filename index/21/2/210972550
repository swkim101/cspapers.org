Recently, brushless motors with especially high torque densities have been developed for applications in autonomous aerial vehicles (i.e. drones), which usually employ exterior rotortype geometries (ER-BLDC motors). These motors are promising for other applications, such as humanoids and wearable robots; however, the emerging companies that produce motors for drone applications do not typically provide adequate technical specifications that would permit their general use across roboticsâ€“for example, the specifications are often tested in unrealistic forced convection environments, or are drone-specific, such as thrust efficiency. Furthermore, the high magnetic pole count in many ER-BLDC motors restricts the brushless drives able to efficiently commutate these motors at speeds needed for lightly-geared operation. This paper provides an empirical characterization of a popular ER-BLDC motor and a new brushless drive, which includes efficiencies of the motor across different power regimes, identification of the motor transfer function coefficients, thermal response properties, and closed loop control performance in the time and frequency domains. The intent of this work is to serve as a benchmark and reference for other researchers seeking to utilize these exciting and emerging motor geometries.
