Faster and more energy efficient hardware accelerators are critical for machine learning on very large datasets. The energy cost of performing vector-matrix multiplication and repeatedly moving neural network models in and out of memory motivates a search for alternative hardware and algorithms. We propose to use streaming batch principal component analysis (SBPCA) to compress batch data during training by using a rank-k approximation of the total batch update. This approach yields comparable training performance to minibatch gradient descent (MBGD) at the same batch size while reducing overall memory and compute requirements.
