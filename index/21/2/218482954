In cultural contexts where menstruation is a stigmatized health topic, daily management of menstrual hygiene comes with its set of challenges. Our research aims to identify and examine such challenges faced during menstruation in the urban environs of Delhi, India. Through participatory design activities and interviews conducted with 35 participants who identified as menstruating and female, and a survey with 139 responses, we investigate how participants deal with their periods on the go. We also examine participants' conceptualizations of safe spaces, where they are able to deal with their period on their own terms. Finally, we discuss how menstrual mobilities are being, and might be, supported through technology-based interventions for a third space, targeting the legibility, literacy, and legitimacy of surrounding environments.
