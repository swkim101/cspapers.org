Today, crowdsourcing the creation of AI programs is a common practice. However, combining the created programs with other programs and human computations to obtain efficient human-in-the-loop solutions is not trivial. Our paper proposes a framework to address the problem of dynamically assigning tasks to a crowd of AI and human workers, and presents the results of a preliminary experiment.
