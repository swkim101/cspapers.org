Battery aging is one of the critical issues in battery-powered electric systems. However, this issue has not received much attention in the real-time systems community. In this paper, we present the first attempt to translate the problem of minimizing battery aging subject to timing requirements into a real-time scheduling problem, addressing the following issues. (i) Can scheduling make a systematic impact on battery aging? If so, which scheduling principles are favorable to minimizing battery aging? (ii) If there exists any, how can we build upon the scheduling principle to guarantee real-time requirements? For (i), we first illuminate the connection between task scheduling and battery aging minimization and then derive a principle for task scheduling from abstracting the complicated dynamics of battery aging, which is to minimize the variance of total power consumption over time. In addition, we implement a battery aging simulator and use it to verify the effectiveness of the proposed principle in minimizing battery aging and its impact on quantitative improvement. For (ii), we propose a scheduling framework that separates control for timing guarantees from that for battery aging minimization. Such a separation allows reducing the complexity significantly such that we can employ existing scheduling algorithm and schedulability analysis for real-time guarantee and tailor the proposed scheduling principle to decelerate battery aging without taking real-time guarantees into accounts. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework can extend the battery lifespan by up to 144.4%.
