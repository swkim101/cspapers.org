The contractor uses the client, the network, and the server to give a service to the customer. We put it this way to emphasise that the denial of service against which we seek to protect is the denial of service to the customer, not to the client. The attack may indeed consist of disabling or destroying the client, just as it may consist of interfering with the network or with the server. This paper does not consider issues of responsibility.
