Entity alignment is a fundamental and vital task in Knowledge Graph (KG) construction and fusion. Previous works mainly focus on capturing the structural semantics of entities by learning the entity embeddings on the relational triples and pre-aligned "seed entities". Some works also seek to incorporate the attribute information to assist refining the entity embeddings. However, there are still many problems not considered, which dramatically limits the utilization of attribute information in the entity alignment. Different KGs may have lots of different attribute types, and even the same attribute may have diverse data structures and value granularities. Most importantly, attributes may have various "contributions" to the entity alignment. To solve these problems, we propose COTSAE that combines the structure and attribute information of entities by co-training two embedding learning components, respectively. We also propose a joint attention method in our model to learn the attentions of attribute types and values cooperatively. We verified our COTSAE on several datasets from real-world KGs, and the results showed that it is significantly better than the latest entity alignment methods. The structure and attribute information can complement each other and both contribute to performance improvement.
