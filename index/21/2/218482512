Although the processing speed of computers has been drastically increasing year by year, users still have to wait for computers to complete tasks or to respond. To cope with this, several studies have proposed presenting certain visual information to users to change their perception of time passing as shorter, e.g., progress bars with animated ribbing or faster/slower virtual clocks. As speech interfaces such as smart speakers are becoming popular, a novel method is required to make users perceive the passing of time as shorter by presenting auditory stimuli. We thus prepared 20 pieces of auditory information as experimental stimuli; that is, 11 auditory stimuli that have the same 10.1-second duration but different numbers of 0.1-second sine-wave sounds and 9 other auditory stimuli that have the same 10.1-second duration and numbers of sounds but different interval patterns between the sounds. We conducted three experiments to figure out which kinds of auditory stimuli can change users' perception of time passing as shorter. We found that a 10.1-second auditory stimulus that has 0.1-second sine-wave sounds appearing 11 times with intervals between the sounds that narrow rapidly in a linear fashion was perceived as shortest at about 9.3 seconds, which was 7.6% shorter than the actual duration of the stimulus. We also found that different interval patterns of sounds in auditory information significantly affected users' perception of time passing as shorter, while different numbers of sounds did not.
