Automatic acquisition of translation rules from parallel sentence-aligned text takes a variety of forms. Some machine translation (MT) systems treat aligned sentences as unstructured word sequences. Other systems, including our own ((Grishman, 1994) and (Meyers et al., 1996)), syntactically analyze sentences (parse) before acquiring transfer rules (cf. (Kaji et hi., 1992), (Matsumoto et hi., 1993), and (Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1995)). This has the advantage of acquiring structural as well as lexical correspondences. A syntactically analyzed, aligned corpus may serve as an example base for a form of example-based NIT (cf. (Sato and Nagao, 1990), (l(aji et al., 1992), and (Furuse and Iida. 1994)). This paper 1 describes: (1) an efficient algorithm for aligning a pair of source/target language parse trees; and (9) a procedure for deriving transfer rules from this alignment. Each transfer rule consists of a pair of tree fragments derived by "cutting up" the source and target trees. A set of transfer rules whose left-hand sides match a source language parse tree is used to generate a target language parse tree from their set of right-hand sides, which is a translation of the source tree. This technique resembles work on NIT using synchronous Tree-Adjoining Grammars (cf. (Abeille et al.. 1990)). The Proteus translation system learns transfer rules from pairs of aligned source and target regularized parses, Proteus's representation of predicate argument structure (cf. Figure 1). 2 Then it uses these transfer rules to map source tan-
