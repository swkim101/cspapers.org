For a fixed “pattern” graph <tex>$G$</tex>, the colored <tex>$G$</tex>-subgraph isomorphism problem (denoted <tex>$\text{SUB}(G)$</tex>) asks, given an <tex>$n$</tex>-vertex graph <tex>$H$</tex> and a coloring <tex>$V(H)\rightarrow V(G)$</tex>, whether <tex>$H$</tex> contains a properly colored copy of <tex>$G$</tex>. The complexity of this problem is tied to parameterized versions of <tex>$P=?\ \ NP$</tex> and <tex>$L=?\ \ NL$</tex>, among other questions. An overarching goal is to understand the complexity of <tex>$\text{SUB}(G)$</tex>, under different computational models, in terms of natural invariants of the pattern graph <tex>$G$</tex>. In this paper, we establish a close relationship between the formula complexity of <tex>$\text{SUB}(G)$</tex> and an invariant known as tree-depth (denoted td (<tex>$G$</tex>)). <tex>$\text{SUB}(G)$</tex> is known to be solvable by monotone <tex>$AC^{0}$</tex> formulas of size <tex>$O(n^{\text{td}(G)})$</tex>. Our main result is an <tex>$n^{\widetilde{\Omega}(\text{td}(G)^{1/3})}$</tex> lower bound for formulas that are monotone or have sub-logarithmic depth. This complements a lower bound of Li, Razborov and Rossman [8] relating tree-width and AC° circuit size. As a corollary, it implies a stronger homomorphism preservation theorem for first-order logic on finite structures [14]. The technical core of this result is an <tex>$n^{\Omega(k)}$</tex> lower bound in the special case where <tex>$G$</tex> is a complete binary tree of height <tex>$k$</tex>, which we establish using the pathset framework introduced in [15]. (The lower bound for general patterns follows via a recent excluded-minor characterization of tree-depth [4], [6].) Additional results of this paper extend the pathset framework and improve upon both, the best known upper and lower bounds on the average-case formula size of <tex>$\text{SUB}(G)$</tex> when <tex>$G$</tex> is a path.
