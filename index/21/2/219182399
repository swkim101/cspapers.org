Social media platforms are increasingly being used for studying psycho-linguistic phenomenon to model expressions of suicidal intent in tweets. Most recent work in suicidal ideation detection doesn't leverage contextual psychological cues. In this work, we hypothesize that the contextual information embedded in the form of historical activities of users and homophily networks formed between like-minded individuals in Twitter can substantially improve existing techniques for automated identification of suicidal tweets. This premise is extensively tested to yield state of the art results as compared to linguistic only models, and the state-of-the-art model.
