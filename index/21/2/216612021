One of the hallmarks of the human intelligence is the ability to learn continuously, accumulate the knowledge learned in the past and use the knowledge to help learn more and learn better. It is hard to imagine a truly intelligent system without this capability. This type of learning differs significantly than the classic machine learning (ML) paradigm of isolated single-task learning. Although there is already research on learning a sequence of tasks incrementally under the names of lifelong learning or continual learning, they still follow the traditional two-phase separate training and testing paradigm in learning each task. The tasks are also given by the user. This paper adds on-the-job learning to the mix to emphasize the need to learn during application (thus online) after the model has been deployed, which traditional ML cannot do. It aims to leverage the learned knowledge to discover new tasks, interact with humans and the environment, make inferences, and incrementally learn the new tasks on the fly during applications in a self-supervised and interactive manner. This is analogous to human on-the-job learning after formal training. We use chatbots and self-driving cars as examples to discuss the need, some initial work, and key challenges and opportunities in building this capability.
