Unsupervised WSD methods do not rely on annotated training datasets and can use WordNet. Since each ambiguous word in the WSD task exists in WordNet and each sense of the word has a gloss, we propose SGM and MGM to learn sense representations for words in WordNet using the glosses. In the WSD task, we calculate the similarity between each sense of the ambiguous word and its context to select the sense with the highest similarity. We evaluate our method on several benchmark WSD datasets and achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art unsupervised WSD systems.
