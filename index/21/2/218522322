In this study, we describe different aspects of nationalism revealed on Twitter in Japan and Korea during a recent international dispute on the trade conflict. We conducted a network analysis of 23 million tweets collected in July 2019, during a bitter economic dispute between Japan and South Korea. As a result, we could identify different emotional responses between two countries. Japan’s retweeted relationship was divided into two large groups – conservatives and liberals – in terms of political orientation, and Korea’s follow-up relationship was consisted of one large group that shared a sense of nationalism regardless of political orientation. Furthermore, we created a co-occurrence network to identify which words were frequently used in each distinctive group.
