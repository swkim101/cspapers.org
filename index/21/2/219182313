This paper describes an iterative learning framework consisting of multi-layer prediction processes for underwater link adaptation. To obtain a dataset in real underwater environments, we implemented OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)-based acoustic communications testbeds for the first time. Actual underwater data measured in Yellow Sea, South Korea, were used for training the iterative learning model. Remarkably, the iterative learning model achieves up to 25% performance improvement over the conventional benchmark model.
