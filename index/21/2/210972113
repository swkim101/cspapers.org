We present a method and an open-source implementation (BeBOT) for the generation of trajectories for autonomous system operations using Bernstein polynomials. Bernstein polynomials possess convenient geometric properties that enable the trajectory planner to efficiently evaluate and impose constraints along the vehiclesâ€™ trajectories, such as maximum speed and angular rates, minimum distance between trajectories and between the vehicles and obstacles. Thus, the proposed method is particularly suitable for generating trajectories in real-time for safe operations in complex environments and multiple vehicle missions.
