In this paper, a new adaptive tracking controller with learning ability is proposed for fully-constrained cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs). For these systems, the necessity of maintaining positive and bounded tensions in all cables while coping with disturbances represents a critical control requirement. To achieve this goal, we propose a control law based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), with an actorcritic structure. In the critic part, an artificial neural network (NN) approximates the value function which is to evaluate the system performance; in the action part, the controllerâ€™s parameters are tuned online to achieve optimal control performance. Additionally, the anti-windup (AW) technique is combined with the adaptive controller to cope with the input saturation problem. The stability of the closed-loop system with the proposed control algorithm is proved using the Lyapunov method. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.
