Bike sharing systems are popular worldwide now. However, these systems are facing a problem - rebalancing of shareable bikes among different docking stations. To address this challenge, we propose an approach for the spatial-temporal rebalancing of shareable bikes which allows domain experts to optimize the rebalancing operation with their knowledge and preferences without relying on learning by trial-and-error.
