Modern-day Chinese characters, or Hanzi, originate from the ancient oracle-bone scripts (甲骨文). Such etymological relationship creates unique opportunities for Hanzi learning. This work proposes to use Web-based tools and the latest machine learning techniques to scale-up and enhance etymological Hanzi learning. By sharing our implementation details from launching an interactive sketch-based learning exhibition, we hope education-AI becomes more widely incorporated into today’s commercial Web applications.
