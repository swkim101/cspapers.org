Obliq is a lexically-scoped, untyped, interpreted language that supports distributed object-oriented computation. Obliq objects have state and are local to a site. Obliq computations can roam over the network, while maintaining network connections. Distributed lexical scoping is the key mechanism for managing distributed computation.
