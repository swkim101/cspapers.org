With the growing demand for social network service advertisements, more accurate targeting methods are required. Therefore, the authors of this study try to predict the location of Twitter users in a more fine-grained manner with regard to area marketing. Specifically, the visit probability to each segment (e.g., prefecture and city) is predicted by a label propagation algorithm, and the userâ€™s location information is obtained from a geo-tagged tweet and an user profile as a label. The proposed method predicts which Twitter users may visit the corresponding area with improved granularity, to the level of an oaza or a block. As a verification experiment, we construct a system that outputs a list of users who are likely to visit the location when an oaza name is entered based on the proposed method, and we also try to predict the possibility of users visiting each segment. The results show that the average accuracy is 73% at the prefecture level, 42% at the city level, and 25% at the oaza level. In addition, the prediction accuracy in Tokyo alone is 31% at the oaza level. These results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
