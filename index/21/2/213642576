Spatiotemporal information is essential for video salient object detection (VSOD) due to the highly attractive object motion for human's attention. Previous VSOD methods usually use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or 3D ConvNet (C3D), which can only encode motion information through step-by-step propagation in the temporal domain. Recently, the non-local mechanism is proposed to capture long-range dependencies directly. However, it is not straightforward to apply the non-local mechanism into VSOD, because i) it fails to capture motion cues and tends to learn motion-independent global contexts; ii) its computation and memory costs are prohibitive for video dense prediction tasks such as VSOD. To address the above problems, we design a Constrained Self-Attention (CSA) operation to capture motion cues, based on the prior that objects always move in a continuous trajectory. We group a set of CSA operations in Pyramid structures (PCSA) to capture objects at various scales and speeds. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed (110 FPS on a single Titan Xp) on five challenge datasets.
