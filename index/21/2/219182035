Can we automatically predict failures of an object detection model on images from a target domain? We characterize errors of a state-of-the-art object detection model on the currently popular smart mobility domain, and find that a large number of errors can be identified using spatial commonsense. We propose ourmodel , a system that automatically identifies a large number of such errors based on commonsense knowledge. Our system does not require any new annotations and can still find object detection errors with high accuracy (more than 80% when measured by humans). This work lays the foundation to answer exciting research questions on domain adaptation including the ability to automatically create adversarial datasets for target domain.
