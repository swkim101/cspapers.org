This BOF will provide a platform for the discussion of ethics in Computer Science curricula. This will be a place to discuss challenges and successes over the years, as well as recent efforts to integrate ethics into the curricula. We will discuss some strategies developed in cohorts like the Responsible Computer Science Challenge, where universities and colleges were supported in the conceptualization, development, and piloting of curricula that integrate ethics with undergraduate computer science training, educating a new wave of engineers who bring holistic thinking to the design of technology products.
