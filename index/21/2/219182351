Our neural architecture search algorithm progressively searches a tree of neural network architectures. Child nodes are created by inserting new layers determined by a transition graph into a parent network up to a maximum depth and pruned when performance is worse than its parent. This increases efficiency but makes the algorithm greedy. Simpler networks are successfully found before more complex ones that can achieve benchmark performance similar to other top-performing networks.
