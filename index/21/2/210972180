Rigid body dynamics calculations are needed for many tasks in robotics, including online control. While there currently exist several competing software implementations that are sufficient for use in traditional control approaches, emerging sophisticated motion control techniques such as nonlinear model predictive control demand orders of magnitude more frequent dynamics calculations. Current software solutions are not fast enough to meet that demand for complex robots. The goal of this work is to examine the performance of current dynamics software libraries in detail. In this paper, we (i) survey current state-of-the-art software implementations of the key rigid body dynamics algorithms (RBDL, Pinocchio, RigidBodyDynamics.jl, and RobCoGen), (ii) establish a methodology for benchmarking these algorithms, and (iii) characterize their performance through real measurements taken on a modern hardware platform. With this analysis, we aim to provide direction for future improvements that will need to be made to enable emerging techniques for real-time robot motion control. To this end, we are also releasing our suite of benchmarks to enable others to help contribute to this important task.
