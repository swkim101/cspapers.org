Actor-based programs are not exempt from concurrency bugs. Inspiring contributions for debugging actor-based programs have been developed, however there is no approach that reliably identifies the root cause of complex concurrency bugs. Solving this problem can result in a reduction of the debugging time that programmers spend when developing concurrent applications. I propose a debugging approach based on the combination of offline debugging techniques that aim to help developers in the process of finding the root cause of concurrency bugs. I plan to evaluate this proposal through user studies and performance evaluation.
