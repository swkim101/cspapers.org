In this paper, we present a new method based on the Aerial Social Force Model (ASFM) to allow human-drone side-by-side social navigation in real environments. To tackle this problem, the present work proposes a new nonlinear-based approach using Neural Networks. To learn and test the rightness of the new approach, we built a new dataset with simulated environments and we recorded motion controls provided by a human expert tele-operating the drone. The recorded data is then used to train a neural network which maps interaction forces to acceleration commands. The system is also reinforced with a human path prediction module to improve the droneâ€™s navigation, as well as, a collision detection module to completely avoid possible impacts. Moreover, a performance metric is defined which allows us to numerically evaluate and compare the fulfillment of the different learned policies. The method was validated by a large set of simulations; we also conducted real-life experiments with an autonomous drone to verify the framework described for the navigation process. In addition, a user study has been realized to reveal the social acceptability of the method.
