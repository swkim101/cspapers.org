This paper introduces an obstacle-avoiding algorithm for bipedal robots, especially in push recovery situations. Typically, There are many algorithms that plan footstep to avoid obstacles based on vision recognition data. However, if the robot is pushed, the planned footprint will change, and thus, there is no guarantee that it will avoid obstacles. Although modified stepping positions can be limited, the robotâ€™s stability is not assured. Our proposed algorithm focuses on avoiding obstacles through vision recognition in push recovery situations and generating compensation actions for instability by restricting modified footsteps. We fuse vision feedback with our previous push recovery algorithm, which optimizes the ankle, hip, and stepping strategies. We build simple grid data using vision recognition and apply it to the inequality constraint of the stepping position. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm using the bipedal platform GAZELLE with the Kinect V2 RGBD sensor.
