. Programming is not just about writing programs that are "as long as they are", "as long as they can run", "as long as they can deliver the results they expect". Programming requires good methods, techniques, and methodologies so that the written program is an effective program. It is true that many people can make programs, but only a few can program properly. In current technological developments, Algorithms play an imperative part in the field of programming. Especially in the lectures of the Department of Informatics, its relationship is strong with its specific algorithmic programming for students of Multimedia Engineering and Network Study Program. An understanding of algorithms is needed so that it can make the program more effective and efficient. To be able to help students understand the Algorithm and programming material, suitable learning media are important. Media that can be used are 2D Animation Video and Live Shoot Motion Graphic. Given the development of learning media in the form of 2D Animation Video and Live Shoot Motion Graphic that can help students understand the concepts of Algorithms and Programming, it is necessary to conduct research related to testing the effectiveness of learning. This study compares the effectiveness of the use of 2D Animation Video with Live Shoot Motion Graphic on the first-semester student of Multimedia Engineering and Network, Politeknik Negeri Batam. The results of this study indicate that learning using 2D video with live shoot motion graphics is relatively better than learning using power-point.
