In this paper, we compare the performance of a state-of-the-art statistical parser (Bikel, 2004) in parsing written and spoken language and in generating sub-categorization cues from written and spoken language. Although Bikelâ€™s parser achieves a higher accuracy for parsing written language, it achieves a higher accuracy when extracting subcategorization cues from spoken language. Additionally, we explore the utility of punctuation in helping parsing and extraction of subcat-egorization cues. Our experiments show that punctuation is of little help in parsing spoken language and extracting sub-categorization cues from spoken language. This indicates that there is no need to add punctuation in transcribing spoken corpora simply in order to help parsers.
