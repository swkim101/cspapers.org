Agent-based simulations are widely used for modeling human behavior in various contexts. However, such simulations may oversimplify human decision-making. We propose the use of Gamettes to extract rich data on human decision-making and help in improving the human behavioral aspects of models underlying agent-based simulations. We show how Gamettes are designed and provide empirical validation for using Gamettes in an experimental supply chain setting to study human decision-making. Our results show that Gamettes are successful in capturing the expected behaviors and patterns in supply chain decisions, and, thus, we find evidence for the capability of Gamettes to inform behavioral models.
