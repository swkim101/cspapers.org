Network function virtualization (NFV) brings significant performance and management benefits for the enterprises to place virtual network functions (VNFs) while reducing the operating expenses and capital expenditures. In this paper, we study the dynamic VNF placement problem for mapping usersâ€™ service function requests (SFCRs) in NFV-enabled networks. The problem is formulated as a heuristic cost function aiming at minimizing the cost of mapping each SFCR. Then we propose SFCR-Mapping and Dynamic VNF-Releasing algorithms to efficiently map SFCRs and timely release the redundant VNF instances. The simulation results demonstrate that our method efficiently reduces the total activated VNF instances and improves VNF utilization compared with the benchmarks.
