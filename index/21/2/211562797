We introduce delft, a factoid question answering system which combines the nuance and depth of knowledge graph question answering approaches with the broader coverage of free-text. delft builds a free-text knowledge graph from Wikipedia, with entities as nodes and sentences in which entities co-occur as edges. For each question, delft finds the subgraph linking question entity nodes to candidates using text sentences as edges, creating a dense and high coverage semantic graph. A novel graph neural network reasons over the free-text graph—combining evidence on the nodes via information along edge sentences—to select a final answer. Experiments on three question answering datasets show delft can answer entity-rich questions better than machine reading based models, bert-based answer ranking and memory networks. delft’s advantage comes from both the high coverage of its free-text knowledge graph—more than double that of dbpedia relations—and the novel graph neural network which reasons on the rich but noisy free-text evidence.
