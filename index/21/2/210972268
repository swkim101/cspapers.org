Future industrial robotic systems increasingly rely on automation of dangerous and tedious tasks. The acquisition of diverse and partially redundant information using reliable and rugged multimodal sensors helps to improve the safety an dependability of such systems. In this paper we propose proximity sensors suitable for the integration into the gripper of a forestry robot. The suggested sensors are complementary to vision based data acquisition as it can in particular provide information on objects close to the gripper that could otherwise not be obtained due to occlusion and missing direct line of sight. We present the design, fabrication and evaluation of 3Dand inkjet-printed capacitive sensors for grasping applications in harsh industrial environment, especially forestry robotics. The sensor elements have been developed along with a complete gripper re-design. The suggested fabrication strategy allows retrofitting of various industry components and reduced maintenance and costs as well as application-specific design and optimization and are also suitable for wireless operation. The developed gripper allows the support of grasping tasks by providing proximity and contact information.
