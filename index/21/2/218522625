Given a large graph with millions of vertices and different types, how can we spot anomalies and find potential adversaries in time? Most graph-based fraud detection algorithms focus on finding dense blocks, discovering local subgraphs, designing belief propagation, and latent factor models. However, as fraudsters in online social networks gradually become adversarial, distributed, and invisible, it is easy for them to evade traditional detection methods. Even worse, existing detection systems are fragile to the new attacks. Once attackers update their tragedies, they will be inefficient. Our focus is to detect potential adversaries as soon as possible. We design and propose ASA (Adversary Situation Awareness), a system that (a) uncovers potential adversaries in time, (b) utilizes heterogeneous information in the graph, and (c)is effective in real-world data. We do experiments on a heterogeneous graph including 198,541 nodes with five types and 224,384 edges. The result shows that ASA can spot potential adversaries and successfully recovers 60 of potential abnormal users within a few minutes. Additionally, after two months we deployed it, ASA could achieve 90 recall, which means ASA can well discover a small number of adversaries with a latent period in time.
