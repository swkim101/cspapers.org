Constraint Programming (CP) is a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial problems. In CP, the user creates a model by declaring variables with their domains and expresses the constraints that need to be satisfied in any solution. The solver is then in charge of finding feasible solutionsâ€”a value in the domain of each variable that satisfies all the constraints. The discovery of solutions is done by exploring a search tree that is pruned by the constraints in charge of removing impossible values. The CP framework has the advantage of exposing a rich high-level declarative constraint language for modeling, as well as efficient purpose-specific filtering algorithms that can be reused in many problems. In this work, we harness this flexibility and efficiency for the Block Modeling problem. It is a variant of the graph clustering problem that has been used extensively in many domains including social science, spatio-temporal data analysis and even medical imaging. We present a new approach based on constraint programming, allowing discrete optimization of block modeling in a manner that is not only scalable, but also allows the easy incorporation of constraints. We introduce a new constraint filtering algorithm that outperforms earlier approaches. We show its use in the analysis of real datasets.
