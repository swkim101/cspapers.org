We present an approach for controlling the position of a quadrotor in 3D space using pointing gestures; the task is difficult because it is in general ambiguous to infer where, along the pointing ray, the robot should go. We propose and validate a pragmatic solution based on a push button acting as a simple additional input device which switches between different virtual workspace surfaces. Results of a study involving ten subjects show that the approach performs well on a challenging 3D piloting task, where it compares favorably with joystick control.
