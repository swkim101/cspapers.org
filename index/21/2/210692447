An enterprise system operates business by providing various services that are guided by set of certain business rules (BR) and constraints. These BR are usually written using plain Natural Language in operating procedures, terms and conditions, and other documents or in source code of legacy enterprise systems. For implementing the BR in a software system, expressing them as UML use-case specifications, or preparing for Merger & Acquisition (M&A) activity, analysts manually interpret the documents or try to identify constraints from the source code, leading to potential discrepancies and ambiguities. These issues in the software system can be resolved only after testing, which is a very tedious and expensive activity. To minimize such errors and efforts, we propose BuRRiTo framework consisting of automatic extraction of BR by mining documents and source code, ability to clean them of various anomalies like inconsistency, redundancies, conflicts, etc. and able to analyze the functional gaps present and performing semantic querying and searching.
