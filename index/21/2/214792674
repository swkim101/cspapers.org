Binary-based and fixed-length structure computers are often inconvenient and wasteful of resources. In this paper we present a design for a fully variable-length structured minicomputer. Since all parameters (instructions and data) are unrestricted in length, their boundaries and interpretation are effected by special delimiter codes. For practical reasons (dictated by current technology) the machine utilizes a binary-coded decimal number representation.
