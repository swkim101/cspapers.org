Surgical robots for laparoscopy consist of several patient side slave manipulators that are controlled via surgeon operated master telemanipulators. Commercial surgical robots do not perform any sub-tasks – even of repetitive or noninvasive nature – autonomously or provide intelligent assistance. While this is primarily due to safety and regulatory reasons, the state of such automation intelligence also lacks the reliability and robustness for use in high-risk applications. Recent developments in continuous control using Artificial Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning have prompted growing research interest in automating mundane sub-tasks. To build on this, we present an inspired Asynchronous Framework which incorporates realtime dynamic simulation – manipulable with the masters of a surgical robot and various other input devices – and interfaces with learning agents to train and potentially allow for the execution of shared sub-tasks. The scope of this framework is generic to cater to various surgical (as well as non-surgical) training and control applications. This scope is demonstrated by examples of multi-user and multi-manual applications which allow for realistic interactions by incorporating distributed control, shared task allocation and a well-defined communication pipe-line for learning agents. These examples are discussed in conjunction with the design philosophy, specifications, system-architecture and metrics of the Asynchronous Framework and the accompanying Simulator. We show the stability of Simulator while achieving real-time dynamic simulation and interfacing with several haptic input devices and a training agent at the same time.
