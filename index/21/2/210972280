This paper presents a novel distributed mapping algorithm for multiple resource-constrained robots operating in a rectilinear 2D environment. The algorithm is built upon the sparse wireframe map representation and updating framework in [1]. We propose an exploration strategy based on the labeling of the vertices in the wireframe map, combined with a map-merging interrupt routine that is activated when robots enter into communication range with one another. The maps are not naively merged, but instead the receiving robot verifies the received information before it is assimilated by attempting to drive to the location where the other robot was when communication was established. The robots do not share a global coordinate frame, so prior to a merge the relative map alignment is determined. This is achieved using the random sample consensus (RANSAC) framework with a custom feature which leverages the structure inherent in the wireframe map representation. This results in a lower rate of false-positive matches compared to another state-of-the-art feature used in point cloud alignment, the 4-point congruent set (4PCS). We show our feature to be more robust to false-positive alignments, a common occurrence when attempting to align sparse structures such as wireframe maps. We present high fidelity simulation results in a ROS-Gazebo environment with lidar-equipped TurtleBots1 to highlight the benefits of our algorithm.1The TurtleBot3 burger configuration www.turtlebot.com
