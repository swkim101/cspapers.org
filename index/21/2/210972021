With recent development of robotic technology, it is increasingly common that robot coexist with human, in which humans and robots share a common workspace and work in close proximity. To maintain efficiency and ensure safety under these circumstances, robot should have the ability to predict the future human motion based on the observed on-going motion. In this paper, we present a methodology for on-line inference of human intention and prediction of human hand motion. The proposed framework is built using Probabilistic Dynamic Movement Primitive (PDMP). In the off-line stage, a set of PDMPs is constructed based on the recorded demonstrations and they will then be used for inferring human intention and predicting human hand motion in the on-line stage. A proof of concept evaluation is carried out in a tabletop manipulation task. Experimental result shows the proposed framework achieve high performance in human intention inference and in the trajectory similarity between the predicted and the actual hand movement under the normally defined environment. We also show the proposed framework can adapt and generalize to the newly defined environment.
