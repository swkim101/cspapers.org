Developers often look for solutions to programming problems in community Q&A sites like Stack Overflow. Due to the crowdsourcing nature of these Q&A sites, many user-provided answers are wrong, less optimal or out-of-date. Relying on community-curated quality indicators (e.g., accepted answer, answer vote) cannot reliably identify these answer problems. Such problematic answers are often criticized by other users. However, these critiques are not readily discoverable when reading the posts. In this paper, we consider the answers being criticized and their critique posts as controversial discussions in community Q&A sites. To help developers notice such controversial discussions and make more informed choices of appropriate solutions, we design an automatic open information extraction approach for systematically discovering and summarizing the controversies in Stack Overflow and exploiting official API documentation to assist the understanding of the discovered controversies. We apply our approach to millions of java/android-tagged Stack overflow questions and answers and discover a large scale of controversial discussions in Stack Overflow. Our manual evaluation confirms that the extracted controversy information is of high accuracy. A user study with 18 developers demonstrates the usefulness of our generated controversy summaries in helping developers avoid the controversial answers and choose more appropriate solutions to programming questions.
