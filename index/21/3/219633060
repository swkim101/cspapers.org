Adversarial domain adaptation (DA) has been an effective approach for learning domain-invariant features by adversarial training. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial DA approach completely defined in spherical feature space, in which we define spherical classifier for label prediction and spherical domain discriminator for discriminating domain labels. To utilize pseudo-label robustly, we develop a robust pseudo-label loss in the spherical feature space, which weights the importance of estimated labels of target data by posterior probability of correct labeling, modeled by Gaussian-uniform mixture model in spherical feature space. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, and also confirm effectiveness of spherical classifier, spherical discriminator and spherical robust pseudo-label loss.
