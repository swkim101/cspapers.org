Drones draws increasing attention as vehicles for home delivery services. Delivery time is one of the most critical concerns of both customers and delivery service providers. The delivery time depends not only on the flight distance but also on the flight speed, and the flight speed depends on the payload. This paper studies a routing problem for delivery drones considering load-dependent flight speed. This paper formally defines Flight Speed-aware Vehicle Routing Problem (FSVRP) and proposes a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently solve the problem. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of quality of results and algorithm runtime.
