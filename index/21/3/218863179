Features of security classifiers have various costs to be manipulated. The costs are asymmetric across features and to the directions of changes, which cannot be precisely captured by existing cost models based on $L_p$-norm robustness. In this paper, we utilize such domain knowledge to increase the evasion cost against security classifiers, specifically, tree ensemble models that are widely used by security tasks. We propose a new cost modeling method to capture the domain knowledge of features as constraint, and then we integrate the cost-driven constraint into the node construction process to train robust tree ensembles. During the training process, we use the constraint to find data points that are likely to be perturbed given the costs of the features, and we optimize the quality of the trees using a new robust training algorithm. Our cost-aware training method can be applied to different types of tree ensembles, including random forest model that cannot be robustly trained by previous methods. Using twitter spam detection as the security application, our evaluation results show that training cost-aware robust model can rank high cost features as the most important ones, and increase the adaptive attack cost by 6.4X compared to the baseline.
