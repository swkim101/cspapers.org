DeepEncyclolink is a web-based system for linking pairs of corresponding articles from different encyclopedias in different languages. The core technology of DeepEncyclolink is based on paragraph embeddings calculated by a long-short-term-memory network with attention. Compared to our previous feature-based machine learning model, DeepEncyclolink has made great strides in coverage and accuracy. DeepEncyclolink offers an easy-to-use user interface and is supported by a powerful service backend for retrieving and selecting equivalent articles between English Wikipedia and Chinese Baidu Encyclopedia. DeepEncyclolink breaks the barriers of different encyclopedias and different languages, making it easy for users to access knowledge written in various languages.
