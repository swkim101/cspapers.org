With rapid development of space systems in recent years and their limited lives, it is imperative that a sustainable space development approach is developed to support more affordable access to space for all stakeholders. The European Commission hence funded the MOSAR project which aims to create a new paradigm technology to address this increasing challenge. This paper provides an overview of this technologyâ€™s preliminary development to enable onorbit servicing. Building on five successful projects which collectively created all required common building 
blocks for both planetary explorations and in-orbit missions, a novel architecture is proposed to create a walking manipulator to demonstrate its unique capability in both space system assembly and on-orbit servicing. Preliminary design concepts of a walking manipulator and spacecraft modules are shown. A dedicated simulator is also developed to evaluate the proposed novel architecture for these targeted applications.
