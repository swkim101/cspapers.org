On behalf of the organizing committee, it is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 20th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management in Glasgow! 
 
Since its inception, the CIKM conference has provided a unique international forum for the presentation, discussion and dissemination of research findings in data management, information retrieval and knowledge management. The purpose of the conference is to identify challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and information systems and to shape future research directions through the publication of high quality, applied and theoretical research findings. The conference has been a leading forum in which experts from academic, industry and the public sector gather to exchange ideas, research achievements and technical developments in multidisciplinary research areas. 
 
CIKM is one of the world's most recognized conferences in the field. This year CIKM received 918 full paper submissions, 220 poster submissions, and 56 demonstration submissions. This is a great demonstration of the lively research areas that contribute to the CIKM area. In addition, CIKM 2011 will host 10 tutorials from leading researchers, 15 workshops on cutting-edge areas of research, a panel session on Social and Collaborative Search and a dedicated Industry Day featuring leading industrial practitioners. We are grateful to all authors who chose to submit their research to CIKM 2011 and are very excited by the final program. 
 
CIKM values interdisciplinary research and we are proud to present three keynote speakers, Professor Justin Zobel, Professor Maurizio Lenzerini and Professor David Karger, all of whom will give presentations that cross discipline boundaries.
