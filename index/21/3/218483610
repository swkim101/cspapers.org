Most intervention methods used for social skills training in children with autism are dedicated to high-functioning autism (HFA). However, extensive neurological and developmental disorders of low-functioning autism (LFA) have hampered their adoption. In this study, we observed and interviewed children with LFA, and their teachers, from a local educational institution, to better understand the children's social needs and barriers. Then, with the aim of aiding the children with their social activities, we illustrate the design process of SqueeBall, an interactive playground equipment. We evaluated the design with 18 children (16 with LFA and 2 with HFA) between 2.5 and 7 years of age. Results showed that these children had a pleasant game experience when the group bonded, and the equipment had a positive effect on aiding them in various ways. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of multimedia interaction techniques in aiding children with LFA.
