Multi-view stereo (MVS) aims to reconstruct 3D geometry of the target scene by using only information from 2D images. Although much progress has been made, it still suffers from textureless regions. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a mesh-guided MVS method with pyramid architecture, which makes use of the surface mesh obtained from coarse-scale images to guide the reconstruction process. Specifically, a PatchMatch-based MVS algorithm is first used to generate depth maps for coarse-scale images and the corresponding surface mesh is obtained by a surface reconstruction algorithm. Next we project the mesh onto each of depth maps to replace unreliable depth values and the corrected depth maps are fed to fine-scale reconstruction for initialization. To alleviate the influence of possible erroneous faces on the mesh, we further design and train a convolutional neural network to remove incorrect depths. In addition, it is often hard for the correct depth values for low-textured regions to survive at the fine-scale, thus we also develop an efficient method to seek out these regions and further enforce the geometric consistency in these regions. Experimental results on the ETH3D high-resolution dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in completeness.
