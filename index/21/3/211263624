A content delivery network (CDN) improves the accessing performance and availability of websites via its globally distributed network infrastructures, which contributes to the thriving of CDN-powered websites on the Internet. Because CDNpowered websites normally operate important businesses or critical services, attackers are mostly interested in taking down these high-value websites, to achieve severe damage with maximum influence. Because the CDN absorbs distributed attacking traffic with its massive bandwidth resources, it is commonly believed that CDN vendors provide effective DoS protection for the CDNpowered websites. However, we reveal that implementation or protocol weaknesses in the forwarding mechanisms of the CDN can be exploited to break this CDN protection. By sending crafted but legal requests, an attacker can launch an efficient DoS attack against the website origin behind it. In particular, we present three CDN threats in this study. By abusing the HTTP/2 requestconverting behavior and HTTP pre-POST behavior of a CDN, an attacker can saturate the CDN–origin bandwidth and exhaust the connection limits of the origin. What is more concerning is that some CDN vendors use only a small set of traffic forwarding IPs with lower IP-churning rates to establish connections with the origin. This characteristic provides a great opportunity for an attacker to effectively degrade the global availability of a website just by cutting off specific CDN–origin connections. In this work, we examine the CDN request-forwarding behaviors across six well-known CDN vendors and perform real-world experiments to evaluate the severity of the threats. Because the threats are caused by flawed trade-offs made by the CDN vendors between usability and security, we discuss possible mitigation and received positive feedback after responsible disclosure to the aforementioned CDN vendors.
