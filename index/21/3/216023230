A proposal is made for combining ongoing volunteer efforts to produce and freely distribute real-world, consumer-oriented software with the existing curricula in computer science. The differences between such an endeavor and currently ongoing free software efforts are described. The pedagogical advantages of working with and contributing to such an effort are explored. Potential enhancements to existing course work are discussed, as are some possible new avenues of instruction. The economic viability of such an enterprise is also briefly described.
