 Additive manufacturing (AM) offers access to the entire volume of a printed artifact during the build operation. This makes it possible to embedding foreign components (e.g. sensors, motors, actuators) into AM parts, thus enabling multifunctional products directly from the build tray. However, the process of designing for embedding currently requires extensive designer expertise in AM. Current methods rely on a designer to select an orientation for the embedded component and design a cavity such that the component can be successfully embedded without compromising the print quality of the final part. For irregular geometries, additional design knowledge is required to prepare a shape converter: a secondary piece to ensure a flush deposition surface on top of the embedded component. This research aims to develop a tool to automate these different design decisions for in-situ embedding, thus reducing the need for expert design knowledge. A three-stage process is proposed to 1) find the optimum orientation based on cavity volume and cross-section area, 2) create the necessary cavity geometry to successfully insert the component, and 3) perform a Boolean operation to create the digital design for any requisite shape converter. Performance of the tool is demonstrated with four test cases with varying levels of geometric complexity. These test cases show that the proposed process successfully handles arbitrary embedded geometries, though several limitations are noted for future work.
