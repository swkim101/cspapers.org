We have found that there is a certain degree of missing information through studying the current exposure of software vulnerabilities. This problem is caused by incomplete information submitted by the vulnerability report submitter. In this paper, we extract the knowledge of software vulnerability in a fine-grained way, and design a machine learning method to complete the missing information through the other information of the vulnerability itself. Our method can predict and complete the missing types and causes information of vulnerability reports.
