Web applications that rely on datasets of limited sizes to handle small but frequent updates and numerous queries have no simple way to define where data should be stored and processed. We propose a reasoning framework that can be integrated in Web applications and is able to perform the same reasoning tasks on both client or server sides. This framework embeds a rule-based reasoning engine that uses an algorithm relying on both incremental reasoning and named graphs. We evaluate the performance of our approach and compare the effects of incremental reasoning and named graphs in different experimental conditions. Results show that our reasoner can significantly reduce response times to INSERT and DELETE queries. During the demo we will exhibit how it can be used to perform reasoning tasks based on client-generated information and improve Web applications with location-agnostic reasoning.
