Many lines of progress have been made since the Cog robot, designed two decades ago, that was equipped with a few degrees of freedom and a variety of sensory systems, including visual, auditory, vestibular, kinesthetic, and tactile senses [1]. Cog was one of the first robots to be developed following the notion that, to be similar to a human, a robot should not only have to exhibit logical and analytical traits but also be able to emulate human behavior. The Cog’s designers were persuaded that four attributes specific to human intelligence should come to bear on robot behavior: Developmental organization, social interaction, embodiment and physical coupling, and multimodal integration [2,3]. This view is broadly shared today in the scope of behavioral robotics, in an approach that focuses on a robots’ ability to exhibit complex human-appearing behaviors.
