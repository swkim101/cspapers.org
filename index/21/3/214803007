As recently emerged rowhammer exploits require undocumented DRAM address mapping, we propose a generic knowledge-assisted tool, DRAMDig, which takes domain knowledge into consideration to efficiently and deterministically uncover the DRAM address mappings on any Intel-based machines. We test DRAMDig on a number of machines with different combinations of DRAM chips and microarchitectures ranging from Intel Sandy Bridge to Coffee Lake. Comparing to previous works, DRAMDig deterministically reverse-engineered DRAM address mappings on all the test machines with only 7.8 minutes on average. Based on the uncovered mappings, we perform double-sided rowhammer tests and the results show that DRAMDig induced significantly more bit flips than previous works, justifying the correctness of the uncovered DRAM address mappings.
