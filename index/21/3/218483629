Auditory description display is verbalized text typically used to describe live, recorded, or graphical displays to support access for people who are blind or visually impaired. Significant prior research has resulted in guidelines for auditory description for non-interactive or minimally interactive contexts. A lack of auditory description for complex interactive environments remains a tremendous barrier to access for people with visual impairments. In this work, we present a systematic design framework for designing auditory description within complex interactive environments. We illustrate how modular descriptions aligned with this framework can result in an interactive storytelling experience constructed through user interactions. This framework has been used in a set of published and widely used interactive science simulations, and in its generalized form could be applied to a variety of contexts.
