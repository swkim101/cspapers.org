The Wikimedia Foundation’s mission is to disseminate open knowledge effectively and globally. In keeping with this mission, we support research in areas that benefit the free knowledge community. We aim to make any work with our support openly available to the public. At the same time that we do a minimalist user data collection, all the material (text and multimedia) available in our projects is public and reusable by everybody under a creative commons license. Moreover, all the article’s history and interactions among users are also public, and we offer a set of tools for accessing such data. In this tutorial we are going to give an overview on all the data sources, and a detailed explanation of how to interact with this content including data and tools such as the Wikipedia Dumps, Quarry (SQL Replicas), Pageviews, PAWS (Wikimedia hosted Jupyter Notebooks), WikiData and put special attention to the multimedia content hosted by Wikimedia Commons project.
