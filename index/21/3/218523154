Despite the increasing interest to investigate and promote scientific collaborations, we know little about scientific collaboration sustainability. In this work-in-progress, we propose to investigate the extent to which scientific collaboration sustainability can be predicted. For this purpose, we design a reciprocity-based collaboration sustainability prediction model by injecting h-index reciprocity. Experiments indicate considering early-stage reciprocity can improve prediction performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.
