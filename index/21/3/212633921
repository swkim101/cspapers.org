Robotic automation in surgery requires precise tracking of surgical tools and mapping of deformable tissue. Previous works on surgical perception frameworks require significant effort in developing features for surgical tool and tissue tracking. In this work, we overcome the challenge by exploiting deep learning methods for surgical perception. We integrated deep neural networks, capable of efficient feature extraction, into the tissue tracking and surgical tool tracking processes. By leveraging transfer learning, the deep-learning-based approach requires minimal training data and reduced feature engineering efforts to fully perceive a surgical scene. The framework was tested on three publicly available datasets, which use the da VinciÂ® Surgical System, for comprehensive analysis. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance in a surgical environment by utilizing deep learning for feature extraction.
