In many real-world applications, the data have several disjoint sets of features and each set is called as a view. Researchers have developed many multi-view learning methods in the past decade. In this paper, we bring Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) into multi-view learning and propose a novel multi-view semi-supervised learning method Co-GCN by adaptively exploiting the graph information from the multiple views with combined Laplacians. Experimental results on real-world data sets verify that Co-GCN can achieve better performance compared with state-of-the-art multi-view semi-supervised methods.
