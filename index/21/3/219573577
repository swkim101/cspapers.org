Multi-hop reading comprehension across multiple documents attracts much attentions recently. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle this multi-hop reading comprehension problem. Inspired by the human reasoning processing, we introduce a path-based graph with reasoning paths which extracted from supporting documents. The path-based graph can combine both the idea of the graph-based and path-based approaches, so it is better for multi-hop reasoning. Meanwhile, we propose Gated-GCN to accumulate evidences on the path-based graph, which contains a new question-aware gating mechanism to regulate the usefulness of information propagating across documents and add question information during reasoning. We evaluate our approach on WikiHop dataset, and our approach achieves the the-state-of-art accuracy against previous published approaches. Especially, our ensemble model surpasses the human performance by 4.2%.
