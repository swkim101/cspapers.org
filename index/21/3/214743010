Long-term visual tracking has drawn increasing attention because it is much closer to practical applications than short-term tracking. Most top-ranked long-term trackers adopt the offline-trained Siamese architectures, thus,they cannot benefit from great progress of short-term trackers with online update. However, it is quite risky to straightforwardly introduce online-update-based trackers to solve the long-term problem, due to long-term uncertain and noisy observations. In this work, we propose a novel offline-trained Meta-Updater to address an important but unsolved problem: Is the tracker ready for updating in the current frame? The proposed meta-updater can effectively integrate geometric, discriminative, and appearance cues in a sequential manner, and then mine the sequential information with a designed cascaded LSTM module. Our meta-updater learns a binary output to guide the trackerâ€™s update and can be easily embedded into different trackers. This work also introduces a long-term tracking framework consisting of an online local tracker, an online verifier, a SiamRPN-based re-detector, and our meta-updater. Numerous experimental results on the VOT2018LT,VOT2019LT, OxUvALT, TLP, and LaSOT benchmarks show that our tracker performs remarkably better than other competing algorithms.
