The rapid advancement and use of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has brought about the necessity for enhancing security and attack identification in such systems to counter malicious attacks. One example of an attack on a CPS involves the Stuxnet worm which caused significant damage to both the control system and the physical world. Such events have created a need for a robust security system in order identify and prevent attacks. This paper focuses on the detection of integrity attacks, such as replay attacks, on Linear Time Invariant systems. More specifically, it considers the feasibility of combining a chi-squared failure detector and a moving target approach to identify malicious sensors.
