With the rise of mobile video, user-generated content, and social networks, there is a massive opportunity for disruptive innovations in the media and content industry. It is now a fast-changing landscape with rapid advances in AI-powered content creation, dissemination and interaction technologies. I believe the current trends are leading us towards a world where everyone is equally empowered to produce high-quality content in video, music, augmented reality or more â€“ and to share their information, knowledge, and stories with a large global audience. This new AI- powered content platform can further lead to innovations in advertising, e-commerce, online education, and productivity. I will share the current research efforts at ByteDance connected to this emerging new platform through products such as Douyin and TikTok, and discuss the challenges and the direction of our future research.
