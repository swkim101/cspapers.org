Users frequently have trouble finding and changing technology settings, even when adjusting those settings to personalize their technology devices may significantly improve their user experience. This paper describes the Morphic project, a cloud-based auto-personalization tool. Primarily designed for improving accessibility, the auto-personalization in Morphic may also help a broader audience. This paper describes: 1) the technical infrastructure needed to support cloud-based auto-personalization, 2) the interaction design approaches necessary to support users during the personalization of their settings, and 3) which settings and modifications have been most frequently used. This paper presents the evolution of the Morphic project, the building of the infrastructure, the formative evaluation of various interaction design approaches (NFC cards, physical keypads, on-screen buttons, and menus), and implications for researchers and developers. It also includes preliminary findings from six technology probes.
