OR-constrained (ORC) graphical user interface layouts unify conventional constraint-based layouts with flow layouts, which enables the definition of flexible layouts that adapt to screens with different sizes, orientations, or aspect ratios with only a single layout specification. Unfortunately, solving ORC layouts with current solvers is time-consuming and the needed time increases exponentially with the number of widgets and constraints. To address this challenge, we propose ORCSolver, a novel solving technique for adaptive ORC layouts, based on a branch-and-bound approach with heuristic preprocessing. We demonstrate that ORCSolver simplifies ORC specifications at runtime and our approach can solve ORC layout specifications efficiently at near-interactive rates.
