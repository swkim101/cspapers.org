Urban traffic management (UTM) is responsible for planning and controlling traffic on road infrastructures, including lane closures, full freeway closures, and pedestrian access. An essential element in UTM is the Intersection Management (IM) that deals with traffic control and is vulnerable to traffic congestion and accidents. In this paper, we propose an intelligent intersection management architecture along with the synchronous intersection management protocol (SIMP) instantiated in two versions. Simulation results show the advantages of SIMP-M (one of the versions) over the well known TraCI IM protocol, in terms of both worst-case and average vehicle speed passing through one intersection.
