Since the performance issues of apps can influence users' experience, developers leverage application performance management (APM) tools to locate the potential performance bottleneck of their apps. Unfortunately, most developers do not understand how APMs monitor their apps during the runtime and whether these APMs have any limitations. In this paper, we demystify APMs by inspecting 25 widely-used APMs that target on Android apps. We first report how these APMs implement 8 key functions as well as their limitations. Then, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 500,000 Android apps from Google Play to explore the usage of APMs. This study has some interesting observations about existing APMs for Android, including 1) some APMs still use deprecated permissions and approaches so that they may not always work properly; 2) some app developers use APMs to collect users' privacy information.
