Recent recommender systems started to use rating elicitation, which asks new users to rate a small seed itemset for inferring their preferences, to improve the quality of initial recommendations. The key challenge of the rating elicitation is to choose the seed items which can best infer the new users’ preference. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end Deep learning framework for Rating Elicitation (DRE), that chooses all the seed items at a time with consideration of the non-linear interactions. To this end, it first defines categorical distributions to sample seed items from the entire itemset, then it trains both the categorical distributions and a neural reconstruction network to infer users’ preferences on the remaining items from CF information of the sampled seed items. Through the end-to-end training, the categorical distributions are learned to select the most representative seed items while reflecting the complex non-linear interactions. Experimental results show that DRE outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in the recommendation quality by accurately inferring the new users’ preferences and its seed itemset better represents the latent space than the seed itemset obtained by the other methods.
