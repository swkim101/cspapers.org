Multi-surface environments, which may contain any combination of large, high-resolution display walls (powerwalls), interactive tabletops, fixed computing infrastructure, laptops, tablets, and smartphones all linked together, offer a rich opportunity for new interactions and collaboration. Creating applications for these environments, however, breaks many of the assumptions of traditional computing environments, and requires a redefinition of the meaning of what constitutes an application. Furthermore, they present challenges when faced with a heterogeneous environment consisting of both new multi-surface applications and legacy data and applications.
