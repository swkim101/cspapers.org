BOX is an artwork that exposes some of the social and political impact of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and automation. The project uses a commercially available computer vision system that predicts the interactor's ethnicity, and locks or unlocks itself depending on this prediction. The artwork showcases a possible use of computer vision, making explicit the fact that every technological implantation crystallises a political worldview.
