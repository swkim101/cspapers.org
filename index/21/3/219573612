Accurate force sensing is important for endoluminal intervention in terms of both safety and lesion targeting. This paper develops an FBG-based force sensor for robotic bronchoscopy by configuring three FBG sensors at the lateral side of a conical substrate. It allows a large and eccentric inner lumen for the interventional instrument, enabling a flexible imaging probe inside to perform optical biopsy. The force sensor is embodied with a laser-profiled continuum robot and thermo drift is fully compensated by three temperature sensors integrated on the circumference surface of the sensor substrate. Different decoupling approaches are investigated, and nonlinear decoupling is adopted based on the cross-validation SVM and a Gaussian kernel function, achieving an accuracy of 10.58 mN, 14.57 mN and 26.32 mN along X, Y and Z axis, respectively. The tissue test is also investigated to further demonstrate the feasibility of the developed triaxial force sensor.
