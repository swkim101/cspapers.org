Heterogeneous-ISA multi-core systems have performance and power consumption benefits. Today, numerous system components, such as NVRAMs and Smart NICs, already have built-in processor cores with ISAs different from that of the host CPUs, making many modern systems heterogeneous-ISA multi-core systems. Unfortunately, programming and using such systems efficiently is difficult and requires extensive support from the host operating systems. Existing programming solutions are complex, require dramatic changes to the systems, and often incur significant performance overheads. To address this challenge, we propose Flick: Fast and Lightweight ISA-Crossing Call, for migrating threads in heterogeneous-ISA multi-core systems. By leveraging hardware virtual memory support and standard operating system mechanisms, a software thread can transparently migrate between cores with different ISAs. We prototype a heterogeneous-ISA multi-core system using FPGAs with off-the-shelf hardware and software to evaluate Flick. Experiments with microbenchmarks and a BFS application show that Flick requires only minor changes to the existing OS and software, and incurs only 18ps round trip overhead for migrating a thread through PCIe, which is at least 23x faster than prior work.
