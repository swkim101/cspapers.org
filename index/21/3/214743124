This paper presents a multirotor control architecture, where Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) and ℒ1 adaptive control are combined to achieve both fast model predictive trajectory planning and robust trajectory tracking. MPPI provides a framework to solve nonlinear MPC with complex cost functions in real-time. However, it often lacks robustness, especially when the simulated dynamics are different from the true dynamics. We show that the ℒ1 adaptive controller robustifies the architecture, allowing the overall system to behave similar to the nominal system simulated with MPPI. The architecture is validated in a simulated multirotor racing environment.
