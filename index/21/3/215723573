This paper investigates the effects of various parameters of high priority traffic classes on the Best Effort (BE) traffic in the networks based on the IEEE Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards. In this regard, the paper discusses ongoing work and presents preliminary results using a TSN simulator. The results indicate that several parameters of the high priority traffic such as periods, offsets and preemption modes can have a significant impact on the quality of service (e.g., guaranteed message delivery and message delays) of the BE traffic.
