hosts on the Internet, despite their design. We discover unique TCP behaviors of ﬁve probe-resistant protocols used in popular circumvention software that could allow censors to effectively conﬁrm suspected proxies with minimal false positives. We evaluate and analyze our attacks on hundreds of thousands of servers collected from a 10 Gbps university ISP vantage point over several days as well as active scanning using ZMap. We ﬁnd that our attacks are able to efﬁciently identify proxy servers with only a handful of probing connections, with negligible false positives. Using our datasets, we also suggest defenses to these attacks that make it harder for censors to distinguish proxies from other common servers, and we work with proxy developers to implement these changes in several popular circumvention tools.
