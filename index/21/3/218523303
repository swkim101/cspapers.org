Uncertainty in a text refers to the propositions that exhibit fuzziness in meaning. In this paper, we present a novel Multi-Channel Tree-LSTM model that integrates a relation aware self-attention along with multiple embeddings to automatically detect uncertainty cues in texts. We have evaluated the models with data sources across multiple domains that include bio-medical texts, privacy policies, and consumer reviews. Our preliminary analysis showed that the proposed model outperforms the existing baseline systems across all the domains.
