With the advance of sensor technologies, the Multivariate Time Series classification (MTSC) problem, perhaps one of the most essential problems in the time series data mining domain, has continuously received a significant amount of attention in recent decades. Traditional time series classification approaches based on Bag-of-Patterns or Time Series Shapelet have difficulty dealing with the huge amounts of feature candidates generated in high-dimensional multivariate data but have promising performance even when the training set is small. In contrast, deep learning based methods can learn low-dimensional features efficiently but suffer from a shortage of labelled data. In this paper, we propose a novel MTSC model with an attentional prototype network to take the strengths of both traditional and deep learning based approaches. Specifically, we design a random group permutation method combined with multi-layer convolutional networks to learn the low-dimensional features from multivariate time series data. To handle the issue of limited training labels, we propose a novel attentional prototype network to train the feature representation based on their distance to class prototypes with inadequate data labels. In addition, we extend our model into its semi-supervised setting by utilizing the unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on 18 datasets in a public UEA Multivariate time series archive with eight state-of-the-art baseline methods exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model.
