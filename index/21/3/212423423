Quantum computers promise to solve hard mathematical problems such as integer factorization and discrete logarithms in polynomial time, making standardized public-key cryptosystems insecure. Lattice-Based Cryptography (LBC) is a promising post-quantum public key cryptographic protocol that could replace standardized public key cryptography, thanks to the inherent post-quantum resistant properties, efficiency, and versatility. A key mathematical tool in LBC is the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), a common method to compute polynomial multiplication. It is the most compute-intensive routine and requires acceleration for practical deployment of LBC protocols. In this paper, we propose CryptoPIM, a high-throughput Processing In-Memory (PIM) accelerator for NTT-based polynomial multiplier with the support of polynomials with degrees up to 32k. Compared to the fastest FPGA implementation of an NTT-based multiplier, CryptoPIM achieves on average 31x throughput improvement with the same energy and only 28% performance reduction, thereby showing promise for practical deployment of LBC.
