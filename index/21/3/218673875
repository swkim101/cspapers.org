Recent years have witnessed great progress in person re-identification (re-id). Several academic benchmarks such as Market1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC play important roles to promote the re-id research. To our best knowledge, all the existing benchmarks assume the same person will have the same clothes. While in real-world scenarios, it is very often for a person to change clothes. To address the clothes changing person re-id problem, we construct a novel large-scale re-id benchmark named Clothes Changing Person Set (COCAS), which provides multiple images of the same identity with different clothes. COCAS totally contains 62,382 body images from 5,266 persons. Based on COCAS, we introduce a new person re-id setting for clothes changing problem, where the query includes both a clothes template and a person image taking another clothes. Moreover, we propose a two-branch network named Biometric-Clothes Network (BC-Net) which can effectively integrate biometric and clothes feature for re-id under our setting. Experiments show that it is feasible for clothes changing re-id with clothes templates.
