This paper relates parameter distance to gradient breakdown for a broad class of nonlinear compositional functions. The analysis leads to a new distance function called deep relative trust and a descent lemma for neural networks. Since the resulting learning rule seems not to require learning rate grid search, it may unlock a simpler workflow for training deeper and more complex neural networks.
