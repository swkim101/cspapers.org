In this interactive special session, participants will learn to facilitate a workshop for training teaching assistants (TAs) based on a card game. The game invites players to respond to challenging scenarios that TAs may face in the course of their duties. Each scenario appears on a card, and players discuss how they would respond. Session participants will receive a deck of 52 of these cards created with funding from a SIGCSE Special Projects Grant. This session uses the format of two previous well attended SIGCSE special sessions that focused on bias and had a target audience of faculty. While the intended audience is those interested in TA training, everyone interested in inclusive teaching practices is welcome to join in the rich small and large group discussions that we expect to take place!
