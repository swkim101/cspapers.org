Computing curricula are finding their way into many elementary and middle school students' classrooms and after-school learning experiences. As more curricula are developed, there is a need to understand how they align with the Rich et al. learning trajectories (LTs) for sequencing, repetition, and conditionals [3] in terms of curricula design and student learning outcomes. This poster examines how LTs map to the 2018-2019 Girls Who Code (GWC) curricula implemented in a local GWC coding club. This poster shows how student learning under the 2018-2019 GWC curriculum maps to paths within the beginning and intermediate levels of the Rich et al. LTs for sequencing, repetition, and conditionals [3]. We also discuss challenges in evaluating several LT learning goals and potential uses of LTs as diagnostic tools to identify student misconceptions.
