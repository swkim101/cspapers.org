As data privacy and security rapidly become key requirements, securely erasing data from a storage system becomes as important as reliably storing data in the system. Unfortunately, in modern flash-based storage systems, it is challenging to irrecoverably erase (i.e., sanitize) a file without large performance or reliability penalties. In this paper, we propose Evanesco, a new data sanitization technique specifically designed for high-density 3D NAND flash memory. Unlike existing techniques that physically destroy stored data, Evanesco provides data sanitization by blocking access to stored data. By exploiting existing spare flash cells in the flash memory chip, Evanesco efficiently supports two new flash lock commands (pLock and bLock) that disable access to deleted data at both page and block granularities. Since the locked page (or block) can be unlocked only after its data is erased, Evanesco provides a strong security guarantee even against an advanced threat model. To evaluate our technique, we build SecureSSD, an Evanesco-enabled emulated flash storage system. Our experimental results show that SecureSSD can effectively support data sanitization with a small performance overhead and no reliability degradation.
