This paper proposes a framework to define a zoning strategy taking into account both functional and spatial patterns. This partition allows further development of territorial intelligence analytics indicators, mainly in the context of urban logistics in developing countries. First, the main notions of territorial intelligence and analytics are proposed, as well as the needs of producing standard, transferable spatial and zoning data. Then, the main framework, based on functional and spatial clustering techniques, is presented. After that, the framework is illustrated via an application to the metropolitan area of Lima-Callao, Peru. Results show that functional elementary zones of same type mainly have a continuity, but some actions need to be taken in a small set of zones. Finally, main research and practice implications are addressed, showing a generic, replicable methodology based on open data.
