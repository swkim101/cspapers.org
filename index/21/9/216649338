Normalizing ﬂows are powerful invertible probabilistic models that can be used to translate two probability distributions, in a way that allows us to efﬁciently track the change of probability density. However, to trade for computational efﬁciency in sampling and in evaluating the log-density, special parameterization designs have been proposed at the cost of representational expressiveness. In this work, we propose to use ODEs as a framework to establish universal approximation theory for certain families of ﬂow-based models
