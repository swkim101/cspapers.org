Quantum computing harnesses quantum laws of nature to enable new types of algorithms, not efficiently possible on traditional computers, that may lead to breakthroughs in crucial areas like materials science and chemistry. There is rapidly growing demand for a quantum workforce educated in the basics of quantum computing. However, there have been very few offerings that help the learner to bridge the gap between the theoretical quantum computing knowledge and applying it to solving real-world problems. The Quantum Katas project has been designed specifically to reduce that gap. Each kata is a sequence of programming exercises that walk the learner through one or several closely related topics in quantum computing. The learner turns to the kata once they have studied the theory on this topic, to internalize their new knowledge. Each exercise requires writing a fragment of code in Q# - a quantum programming language. Most importantly, each kata includes a testing framework that provides immediate feedback for the attempted solutions, allowing the learner to study at their own pace even without access to instructor. This makes the project beneficial both for instructor-led studies and for self-learning. The Quantum Katas are an open-source project available at https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas. In this demo I will showcase the Quantum Katas and talk about our experience using them in a variety of learning environments, from guided university courses to workshops and study groups to self-paced learning.
