The aim of this research is to discover if a structured study session program for CS1 students led by Teaching Assistants using Peer Instruction can promote an environment in which students feel an increased sense of belonging and improve course material retention. This study investigates the efficacy of weekly study sessions by measuring student attitudes and content retention over the course of a single semester of the introductory CS1 course at a medium sized liberal arts university with approximately 8 sections of 30 students each.
