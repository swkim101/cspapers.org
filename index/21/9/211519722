Study abroad is considered a high-impact practice (HIP) in higher education. However, few discipline-specific study abroad courses are offered in computer science (CS) or physics. We implemented a CS/physics-based short-term study abroad course to England that focused on the history and science of information. This work provides insight for anyone considering the development and implementation of such a course at their own institution.
