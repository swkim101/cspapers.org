Experiences from the Google Faculty in Residence Program are presented as a unique, productive example of an industry driven academic collaboration emphasizing project-based learning [2]. Representative faculty participants describe their experiences and their unique projects developed during Google Faculty in Residence (FIR) where faculty worked together with experienced Google developers. Part of FIR included training from Google developers on a wide range of software engineering best practices, student preparation for industry and computer science recruitment and retention. Consideration of diversity and inclusivity in students backgrounds and preparedness were tantamount in project goals. Projects developed targeted both lower and upper division curriculum and in some cases pedagogy outside of traditional classroom boundaries. Results of the application of projects at panelists institutions are given.
