The purpose of this poster is to provide practical arguments to stimulate debate and discussion on whether or not to introduce concepts of theoretical computer science in the pre-university education system, conveniently adapted within students' capability. Theoretical computer science is a hard subject to teach at the university level. Many students who enter the computer sciences courses have very little mathematical or theoretical background. For this reason, it is important that students acquire an appreciation of these concepts before they leave the secondary education. In anticipation that these contents would not be included or addressed in the context of a subject of Computer Science, a work in progress educational experience is presented during the 2018-2019 academic year for enhancing the algorithmic curriculum of pre-university computing and mathematical courses. We describe a collection of selected problems, puzzles and riddles from high school mathematics and introductory logic, to be added to the current secondary curriculum. We want to show attendees the use of our educational activities, offering practical aspects that could not be shown through the reading of a paper, so that they can learn to use them in their own classes. The preliminary experimental results show that the students who have undergone this educational experience have obtained a higher motivation that those who have followed the course in its traditional form. We believe that introducing these theoretical computer concepts can help students to perform better in some areas of computer science and be increasingly prepared and motivated for their university studies.
