The success of existing face deblurring methods based on deep neural networks is mainly due to the large model capacity. Few algorithms have been specially designed according to the domain knowledge of face images and the physical properties of the deblurring process. In this paper, we propose an effective face deblurring algorithm based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Motivated by the conventional deblurring process which usually involves the motion blur estimation and the latent clear image restoration, the proposed algorithm first estimates motion blur by a deep CNN and then restores latent clear images with the estimated motion blur. However, estimating motion blur from blurry face images is difficult as the textures of the blurry face images are scarce. As most face images share some common global structures which can be modeled well by sketch information, we propose to learn face sketches by a deep CNN so that the sketches can help the motion blur estimation. With the estimated motion blur, we then develop an effective latent image restoration algorithm based on a deep CNN. Although involving the several components, the proposed algorithm is trained in an end-to-end fashion. We analyze the effectiveness of each component on face image deblurring and show that the proposed algorithm is able to deblur face images with favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods.
