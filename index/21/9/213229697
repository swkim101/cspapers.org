Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are commonly used by the machine learning community for research on problems speciﬁcally related to health care and medicine. EHRs have the advantages that they can be easily distributed and contain many features useful for e.g. classiﬁcation problems. What makes EHR data sets different from typical machine learning data sets is that they are often very sparse, due to their high dimensionality, and often contain heterogeneous data types. Furthermore, the data sets deal with sensitive information, which limits the distribution of any models learned using them, due to privacy concerns. In this work, we explore using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate synthetic, heterogeneous EHRs with the goal of using these synthetic records in place of existing data sets. We will further explore applying differential privacy (DP) preserving optimization in order to produce differentially private synthetic EHR data sets, which provide rigorous privacy guarantees, and are therefore more easily shareable. The performance of our model’s synthetic, heterogeneous data is very close to the original data set (within 6.4%) for the non-DP model. Although around 20% worse, the DP synthetic data is still usable for machine learning tasks.
