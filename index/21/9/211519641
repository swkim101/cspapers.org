With the introduction of computer science into school curricular around the world in recent years, it is easy to forget the challenges that developing countries may experience in following suit. Here we describe a study carried out to investigate the challenges faced by teachers in Guyana relating to resources, student engagement and in-service teacher education. A small-scale mixed-methods study with 48 teachers was conducted in two areas of Guyana, accompanying a workshop covering a range of interactive activities. Teachers reported a desire to improve the opportunities for their students but described challenges including lack of computers, lack of subject knowledge, and lack of support. They also reported that they found programming hard to learn and teach, with computer architecture easier both to learn and teach.
