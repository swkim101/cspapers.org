This special session furthers the work associated with SIGCSE Reads and the growing community of SIGCSE members who connect to each other through science fiction. The session starts with a practical experience addressing one of the five common goals presented previously: a learning experience for participants in how science fiction can be used in computing classrooms to teach ethics and develop CS students' facility for considering ethical situations with deeper critical thinking. Materials will be available so that the exercise can be translated to other classrooms. This will be followed by a significant Q & A session with one of this year's authors, Hugo Award winner David D. Levine, whose short story "Damage" addresses questions of ethical decision making by an AI.
