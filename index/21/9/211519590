Although personalized feedback is believed to improve student learning more than correctness tests alone, resource constraints make it difficult for many CS programs to provide personalized feedback on student programming work. This workshop discusses strategies for reducing the cost of code review, as well as pedagogical benefits that can be reaped once a course implements a robust code review process. We showcase the code review process implemented by Princeton's CS1 and CS2 courses which leverages codePost (https://codepost.io), and will teach participants to implement a similar process. codePost is a tool that allows instructors to annotate code with comments, points, and rubrics in a GUI. Beyond code annotation, codePost also includes three classes of functionality that Princeton leverages to provide personalized feedback at scale. (1) Functionality to help instructors manage teams of reviewers by distributing unreviewed code and auditing their review quality. (2) Ways for students to provide "feedback on feedback", allowing quantification of student comprehension and uncovering learning breakdowns. (3) A RESTful API that enables instructors to programmatically read and write codePost data. The codePost API enables Princeton to connect codePost with a custom autograding environment and programmatically comment on student work according to test output. This workshop seeks to show participants one possible way of providing human feedback, which mostly scales. We will do so in two concrete steps: First, introduce participants to workflows achievable using the codePost GUI. Second, introduce the codePost API and provide tips for writing custom scripts to unlock pedagogical use cases.
