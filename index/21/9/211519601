POGIL activities have been used for various computer science courses. However, there is no published POGIL activity for introducing parallel and distributed computing concepts. Recent ABET curriculum recommendations include the introduction of parallel and distributed computing concepts in undergraduate Computer Science/Engineering programs. In this work, we plan a cross-university study of evaluating the impact of using POGIL to introduce parallel computing topics in Data Structures and Algorithms or similar courses in an undergraduate computer science curriculum. We designed a POGIL tool that includes an unplugged activity that helps demonstrate some fundamental concepts of parallel computing. This unplugged activity is then followed by a set of reflective questions regarding potential advantages and challenges of using parallel computing. %NEEDED? WE SAY IT LATER: The POGIL tool also contains code written in Java, C/C++, and C\#. We plan to use PRE/POST surveys to collect data from undergraduate CS students from five universities located in different parts of the US with diverse student population. At the end of this work in progress, we will use the data to investigate how this POGIL activity helps students gain an understanding of parallel computing.
