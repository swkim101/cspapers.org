Studies have found that many CS students perform poorly on basic programming tasks, and interviewers in industry complain that CS graduates cannot write code. Learning gains have been shown from active learning techniques such as Peer Instruction, but only for multiple-choice questions, not for writing code. Studies of multiple choice questions such as code tracing have shown weak correlations to code writing, and extremely small improvements in syntax in only one third of students. These results are consistent with a century of research showing limited transfer of knowledge, and skill acquisition literature showing that skill is developed only with many hours of practice. We developed an active learning activity called LiveQuiz for large university courses, enabling every student to write specific small functions during lecture, using an online community tool on their own devices. Anonymous responses can be seen on the lecture hall screen in a single conversation thread, which the instructor scrolls. Both students and the instructor analyze and discuss the correctness of different solutions. LiveQuiz was effective in helping students to write correct code: e.g, the percentage of correct sequential search functions rose from 36% to 96%. LiveQuiz is a promising active learning technique using existing tools, giving students practice and prompt feedback in a high-level skill. It is fast and easy to implement, and it provides the instructor first drafts of students' problem solving, which can yield insights for future teaching.
