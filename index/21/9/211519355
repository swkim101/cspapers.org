This poster presents a one-quarter seminar required of first-time and re-turning teaching assistants in the Computer Science and Engineering department at UC Riverside. The seminar covers departmental expectations, introduces TAs to methods for engaging large and diverse classrooms, and covers pedagogical practices in Computer Science. In addition to coverage of general issues surrounding teaching, the seminar includes many exercises that relate specifically to the teaching of computer science. Returning TAs serve as mentors for first-time TAs and participate in peer-observation and other activities. Initial results show a significant improvement in TA evaluations over the past year since the revamping of this seminar course.Moreover, TAs self-report an increased confidence in their teaching ability, communicating with students as well as motivating students.
