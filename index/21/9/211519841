With the 2018 revision of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, there is a growing interest in how computer science faculty can integrate these principles into the education of future practitioners. This special session illustrates one approach by highlighting assignments that blend ethics and technology. These assignments can be used in a variety of courses, including CS1, CS2, and later courses. Presenters will provide an overview of each assignment and gather feedback from the audience. All materials, including descriptions, starter files, and guidelines for instructors, will be published at https://ethics.acm.org/SIGCSE2020.
