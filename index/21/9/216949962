Current research prototypes provide haptic experiences unthinkable with current commercial devices. As haptic feedback is complex and multi-faceted a significant research effort has been put into developing elaborate feedback devices. We believe that haptics must be considered as a coupled input/output system. Looking at commercial VR / AR systems it appears as if the work on the output side has far outpaced the work on the input side. We therefore argue that the next step in improved haptic touch and communication systems lies not in better output technologies, but in better input and position tracking technologies. In this position paper we provide context to this claim, explain how our backgrounds put us in a uniquely suited position to explore this topic further and present some discussion points which we wish to consider in our future work.
