This paper presents a system which automatically generates shallow semantic frame structures for conversational speech in unrestricted domains.We argue that such shallow semantic representations can indeed be generated with a minimum amount of linguistic knowledge engineering and without having to explicitly construct a semantic knowledge base. The system is designed to be robust to deal with the problems of speech dysfluencies, ungrammaticalities, and imperfect speech recognition.Initial results on speech transcripts are promising in that correct mappings could be identified in 21% of the clauses of a test set (resp. 44% of this test set where ungrammatical or verb-less clauses were removed).
