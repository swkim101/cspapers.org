There are over 1,000 community colleges (CC) in the U.S.; they enroll more than 13 million students--nearly half of all undergraduates-- and over half of CC students are non-white (American Association of Community Colleges). However, efforts to broaden participation in computing have been directed disproportionately to 4-year institutions. The focus of this panel is on research and strategies for increasing the retention of students from groups that are underrepresented in computing--female, Latinx, and African American students. It includes experts from across the US--from CC's and a research organization. The panelists will describe curriculum and programs that are designed to support students, and include the perspectives of students on what helps and hinders them from persisting. The intended audience for this panel is researchers, educators, and administrators from both community colleges and 4-year institutions.
