Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a popular topic modeling technique for exploring hidden topics in text corpora. Increasingly, topic modeling needs to scale to larger topic spaces and use richer forms of prior knowledge, such as word correlations or document labels. However, inference is cumbersome for LDA models with prior knowledge. As a result, LDA models that use prior knowledge only work in small-scale scenarios. In this work, we propose a factor graph framework, Sparse Constrained LDA (SC-LDA), for efficiently incorporating prior knowledge into LDA. We evaluate SC-LDAâ€™s ability to incorporate word correlation knowledge and document label knowledge on three benchmark datasets. Compared to several baseline methods, SC-LDA achieves comparable performance but is significantly faster.
