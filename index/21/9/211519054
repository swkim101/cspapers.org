With the current widespread use of WiFi, it is important for students to understand how WiFi access points can be exploited in practice in order to defend networks better. The theory behind exploiting WEP and WPA2 has been available for a number of years. However, it has not been easy to offer students the opportunity to apply these theories in a real environment. In this workshop, we demonstrate and discuss how to build an exploitable WiFi environment for your classroom, how Raspberry Pis can be used to act as the necessary clients for access points, different hacking scenarios where WEP access points have connected clients versus no connected clients, WEP vs WPA2 hacking and how to hack these access points. Then, you will get a chance to hack up to four WEP access points as well as a WPA2 access point.
