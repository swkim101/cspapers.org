Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) aims at recognizing both seen and unseen classes by constructing correspondence between visual and semantic embedding. However, existing methods have severely suffered from the strong bias problem, where unseen instances in target domain tend to be recognized as seen classes in source domain. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end Self-supervised Domain-aware Generative Network (SDGN) by integrating self-supervised learning into feature generating model for unbiased GZSL. The proposed SDGN model enjoys several merits. First, we design a cross-domain feature generating module to synthesize samples with high fidelity based on class embeddings, which involves a novel target domain discriminator to preserve the domain consistency. Second, we propose a self-supervised learning module to investigate inter-domain relationships, where a set of anchors are introduced as a bridge between seen and unseen categories. In the shared space, we pull the distribution of target domain away from source domain, and obtain domain-aware features with high discriminative power for both seen and unseen classes. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to introduce self-supervised learning into GZSL as a learning guidance. Extensive experimental results on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our model performs favorably against state-of-the-art GZSL methods.
