Topical blog post retrieval is the task of ranking blog posts with respect to their relevance for a given topic. To improve topical blog post retrieval we incorporate textual credibility indicators in the retrieval process. We consider two groups of indicators: post level (determined using information about individual blog posts only) and blog level (determined using information from the underlying blogs). We describe how to estimate these indicators and how to integrate them into a retrieval approach based on language models. Experiments on the TREC Blog track test set show that both groups of credibility indicators significantly improve retrieval effectiveness; the best performance is achieved when combining them.
