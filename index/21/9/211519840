Enrollment in computing at the college level has skyrocketed, and many institutions have responded by enacting competitive enrollment processes. However, little is known about the effects of enrollment policies on students' experiences. To identify relationships between those policies and students' experiences, we linked survey data from 1245 first-year students in 80 CS departments to a dataset of department policies. We found that competitive enrollment negatively predicts first-year students' perception of the computing department as welcoming, their sense of belonging, and their self-efficacy in computing. Both belonging and self-efficacy are known predictors of student retention in CS. In addition, these relationships are stronger for students without pre-college computing experience. Our classification of institutions as competitive is conservative, and false positives are likely. This biases our results and suggests that the negative relationships we found are an underestimation of the effects of competitive enrollment.
