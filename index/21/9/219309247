This tutorial will provide general natural language processing specialists with an introduction to the field of “BioNLP”—natural language processing in the fields of medicine and biology. This field has long roots in the history of natural language processing, but has been an absolutely burgeoning area of interest in recent years. The past few years have been characterized by an unusual mixing of bioinformatics and NLP specialists at the conferences of both communities: ACL or NAACL has now hosted workshops on BioNLP every year since 2002, with excellent attendance numbers, and bioinformatics and medical informatics meetings have featured NLP papers, sessions, and SIG meetings since the late 1990s. Recent MUC-like and TREC-sponsored shared tasks have had some unusual results, and the implications of these findings should make for an interesting tutorial for the general NLP specialist. BioNLP presents unique challenges in a number of areas, ranging from low-level processing tasks—tokenization and sentence boundary detection are demonstrably different tasks in biomedical publications than in newswire text—to high-level conceptual issues, such as theoretical issues in predicate-argument structure representation, which have been a topic of much discussion in recent work in the field. Despite the many challenges that are unique to biomedical text, most of the sub-topics of NLP are the subject of current research in the BioNLP community—information retrieval, named entity recognition, information extraction, text classification, semantic role labelling, coreference resolution, question-answering, parsing, morphological analysis, and discourse analysis. Thus, there are interesting challenges in BioNLP for almost anyone working in natural language processing. One unique advantage to the field of BioNLP is the wide availability of resources, including an enormous body of freely available text. The tutorial will include an overview of a variety of publicly available BioNLP resources, including:
