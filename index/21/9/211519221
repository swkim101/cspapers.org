The classrooms used by Computer Science students come in all shapes and sizes, from large lecture halls to small computer labs to collaborative active learning classrooms. Does our teaching style need to match the space? Are particular classroom environments more effective than others and might the types of artifacts generated by Computer Science students lend themselves better to one space over the other? As many students come to class with their own personal computer, development environment and opinions about effective instruction, does the classroom and supporting technology even matter? What effect does the space have on the instructional choices made? This BOF will provide a platform for a discussion around individual teaching styles and preferences and how they relate to the classroom space. Access and awareness of active learning pedagogy and active learning classrooms can create both tension (e.g., not wanting to teach in an active learning classroom) and challenges (e.g., desire to have access to an active learning classroom despite the costs associated, how working specific techniques into a given space). Shared experiences will help participants better leverage their classroom spaces to their desired pedagogy.
