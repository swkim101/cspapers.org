Web pages have evolved into very complex dynamic applications, which are often very opaque and difficult for non-experts to understand. At the same time, security researchers push for more transparent web applications, which can help users in taking important security-related decisions about which information to disclose, which link to visit, and which online service to trust. In this paper, we look at one of the simplest but also most representative aspect that captures the struggle between these opposite demands: a mouse click. In particular, we present the first comprehensive study of the possible security and privacy implications that clicks can have from a user perspective, analyzing the disconnect that exists between what is shown to users and what actually happens after. We started by identifying and classifying possible problems. We then implemented a crawler that performed nearly 2.5M clicks looking for signs of misbehavior. We analyzed all the interactions created as a result of those clicks, and discovered that the vast majority of domains are putting users at risk by either obscuring the real target of links or by not providing sufficient information for users to make an informed decision. We conclude the paper by proposing a set of countermeasures.
