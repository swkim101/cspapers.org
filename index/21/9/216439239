The culinary culture that is constantly developing in various countries and regions cannot be separated from the existence of a cooking culture that is unique. In Indonesian traditional cooking culture, there is a cooking tool called luweng. Luweng made from clay is a specifically of kitchenware that can be considered of the most traditional types of pottery, it does not need the process of firing. The existence of pottery was brought to life by human civilization, where during the times ancient humans were not nomadic, to live farming, then began to create necessary equipment. Cooking, eating and drinking utensils were made using natural materials found in surroundings. Clay being the main source of earthenware exemplifies the simplicity and sensitivity humans show to nature for survival. Luweng is a traditional cooking stove is very interesting and fascinating especially to show the local genius of ancient humans. Luweng is used by rural communities to cook using wood or dry twigs as fuel. Its simple shape consists of rectangles with several holes at the top that are made according to the heat generated. Special ancestors skills passed down from generation to generation are transfer of knowledge in the traditional education culture. Furthermore, this research will find the unique functions of Luweng that are still used by rural communities at the countryside in Indonesia, are artifacts in traditional culture that still survive in this modern technology era. This paradox although is very interesting to have been criticized, and proven to have inspired writers when ideating installation art concepts. Through this research and artwork are expected to become a track record and a new knowledge for young to learn about history; particularly on cooking tools and traditional culture.
