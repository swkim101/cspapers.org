Programming is a skill that many individuals in tech-related fields have to develop. It is an essential component to all Computer Science (CS) majors' development and learning. Literature show that there is a consistent percentage of CS majors that become stuck and discouraged while learning to program, which sometimes deter them from the major as a whole. Coding reviews are one potential practice that could combat this learning barrier. This practice is common in industry settings and is used by professionals to solve major computational problems. Likewise, in the classroom, coding review practices could be used to help students identify both syntax and semantic flaws, and related code defects of developed solutions. Literature also show that modest attention has been placed on the exploration of coding reviews in early stages of a CS course curriculum. Therefore, more attention could be given to this particular topic. To personally explore this topic in more detail, we analyzed the outcomes from coding review assessments that were conducted on two programming courses at a Mid-Atlantic University in the United States during the 2018-2019 school year. These assessments were embedded into the periodical exams administered in these two courses that taught either Python or C++ programming concepts. The data structures imposed for these reviews ranged from simple function usage to advanced class & object-oriented programming paradigms. The results revealed that students in these respective courses on average were able to analyze the behavior of the code effectively for most of the employed data structures.
