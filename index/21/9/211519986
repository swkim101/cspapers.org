Micro-aggressions, hostile climates, and intersectional discrimination contribute to students feeling excluded from fully participating in Computer Science or other STEM programs. To address this exclusion, students need to empathize with each other, and for that we need them to be having frank, open conversations about difficult situations. This is hard to achieve, as people do not typically want to talk about difficult situations with strangers. Computer Science faculty may shy away from these difficult conversations, as they may feel they lack the expertise to address social issues effectively. To address this issue, we have been conducting 'Exclusion Response Workshops' based on the 'Theatre of the Oppressed' methodology of rehearsing social change. This involves students anonymously contributing scenarios of micro-aggressions they have experienced or witnessed and then roleplaying alternate outcomes. These workshops create an empathetic environment for frank and open discussion of difficult issues. We have been scaling this effort by conducting workshops with all freshmen and transfer students in our College of Computing and Informatics. In this SIGCSE workshop, attendees will participate in an Exclusion Response Workshop, then have an open discussion about the workshop experience, workshop logistics, and pros and cons of running this workshop as a mandatory class activity versus a voluntary activity. Participants will learn about the workshop structure, and the Theatre of the Oppressed methodology. This workshop is a taste of a 3-day, train-the-trainer workshop that we will be conducting at our institution in May 2020. Supported by NSF IUSE/RED Award #151960.
