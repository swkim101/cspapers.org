As CS1 enrollment continues to grow, the challenge to address all students' learning preferences grows as well. Accounting for the needs of larger and more diverse populations of students requires innovation in the realms of course design and structure. In a non-major context, these challenges are made even more explicit. By studying the manner in which non-major engineering students approach an introductory programming course, revisions to existing course designs may be better informed. This study presents the analysis of one semester of qualitative data provided by 237 students via survey about their approach to an introductory programming course designed for engineering students. By clustering students into groups based on factors such as their usage of different study materials and prior programming experience, trends in student engagement are observed. We find that students with significant levels of prior programming experience exhibit higher levels of confidence and enjoyment in programming, as well as satisfaction with overall performance. However, these students make less use of available study materials. Students entering the course without any prior experience are more frequently utilize the available course resources. This contrast in approaches and attitudes demonstrates the need for flexibility within CS1 courses that face large, diverse enrollment populations. In order to ensure that all students receive a positive learning experience, many learning pathways must be made available. Therefore, knowledge of student behavior can help to guide instructors in the creation of course content which is more closely focused on what students use to succeed.
