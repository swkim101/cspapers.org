This paper presents a computational model of how conversational participants collaborate in making referring expressions. The model is based on the planning paradigm. It employs plans for constructing and recognizing referring expressions and meta-plans for constructing and recognizing clarifications. This allows the model to account for the generation and understanding both of referring expressions and of their clarifications in a uniform framework using a single knowledge base.
