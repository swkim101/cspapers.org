Most personal student interactions with instructional staff come through office hours. Particularly in large courses, office hours are predominantly run by teaching assistants (TAs). TAs are best advantaged by support and training from more senior instructional staff, especially faculty. This Birds-of-a-Feather session will provide a forum for discussing challenges and innovations in managing office hours, particularly in computer science courses, with the aim of improving the student learning experience and environment. This session will have the opportunity for discussing the mentoring and personalized support of TAs, as well as what technological support exists, such as queue software or internal wikis, and additionally ideas for more significant changes to office hours structure that could lead to future collaborations or research. While this session will emphasize TA-supported office hours, the discussion should inspire new ideas and techniques for managing individual-instructor office hours as well.
