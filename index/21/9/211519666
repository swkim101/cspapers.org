News articles can have a profound influence on voter opinions and preferences according to studies conducted on the effects of bias in political news coverage. Because political opinions and preferences can be persuaded, it is important that readers are aware of biases embedded within a story, as it may be perceived differently by others and motivate readers to find different sources to inform their opinions. Whereas previous research has attempted to characterize bias strictly from article text, ours examines the subjective perception of it as a function of the reader's political leanings and salience of the article's source. Our research seeks to determine if we can empirically verify in-group out-group bias in news sources rather than news article content. We present Mechanical Turk participants with a neutral definition of bias and administer a survey that collects data on whether or not readers believe the given definition of bias applies to the given article. The three news sources (CNN, Fox News, and BBC) are randomly displayed as the authoring body on the same article content. Afterward, participants answer demographic questions including their own political leanings. Furthermore, we will discuss the perceived bias by political camp, implications for news source bias, and our goal to harness the results of this experiment in pursuit of training machine learning models that can detect bias from the perspectives of members belonging to particular political leanings.
