Invited Talk. Motion Autonomy and Safety issues in Autonomous Vehicles are strongly dependent upon the capabilities and performances of both Embedded Perception and Decision-making systems. This talk presents how it is possible to address these important issues by mixing Bayesian and Machine Learning approaches. The talk will be illustrated using results obtained by Inria Grenoble Rhone-Alpes (France) in the scope of several R&D projects conducted in collaboration with IRT Nanoelec (French Technological Research Institute) and with several industrial companies such as Toyota or Renault.
