This paper presents an original method for interactions' haptic rendering when treating hyperelastic materials. Such simulations are known to be difficult due to the non-linear behavior of hyperelastic bodies; furthermore, haptic constraints enjoin contact forces to be refreshed at least at 1000 updates per second. To enforce the stability of simulations of generic objects of any range of stiffness, this method relies on implicit time integration. Soft tissues dynamics is simulated in real time (20 to 100 Hz) using the Multiplicative Jacobian Energy Decomposition (MJED) method. An asynchronous preconditioner, updated at low rates (1 to 10 Hz), is used to obtain a close approximation of the mechanical coupling of interactions. Finally, the contact problem is linearized and, using a specific-loop, it is updated at typical haptic rates (around 1000 Hz) allowing this way new simulations of prompt stiff-contacts and providing a continuous haptic feedback as well.
