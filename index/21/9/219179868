Advanced data augmentation strategies have widely been studied to improve the generalization ability of deep learning models. Regional dropout is one of the popular solutions that guides the model to focus on less discriminative parts by randomly removing image regions, resulting in improved regularization. However, such information removal is undesirable. On the other hand, recent strategies suggest to randomly cut and mix patches and their labels among training images, to enjoy the advantages of regional dropout without having any pointless pixel in the augmented images. We argue that the random selection of the patch may not necessarily represent any information about the corresponding object and thereby mixing the labels according to that uninformative patch enables the model to learn unexpected feature representation. Therefore, we propose SaliencyMix that carefully selects a representative image patch with the help of a saliency map and mixes this indicative patch with the target image that leads the model to learn more appropriate feature representation. SaliencyMix achieves a new state-of-the-art top-1 error of 20.09% on ImageNet classification using ResNet-101 architecture and also improves the model robustness against adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, SaliencyMix trained model helps to improve the object detection performance.
