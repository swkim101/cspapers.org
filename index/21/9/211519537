As projections of the shortage of cybersecurity workers grow, the ACM CCECC (Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges) has led creation of a set of guidelines for two-year cybersecurity programs at the associate-degree level, called Cyber2yr2020. The Cyber2yr2020 guidelines underwent two rounds of public review and comment with the StrawDog and IronDog drafts, and the final version will be released in early 2020. This poster presents the curriculum guidelines, provides perspectives on the use of the guidelines, and offers opportunities to highlight two-year cybersecurity programs by aligning with the guidelines in a program example.
