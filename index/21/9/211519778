The best-studied techniques for reducing academic dishonesty rates rely on increasing the likelihood of consequences. These techniques offer instructors effective tools for identifying dishonest behavior as a means to "encourage" honesty. We wonder if we can promote integrity through proactive measures, such as designing courses' structures and assignments to reduce temptations for cheating, or by sculpting culture and forming relationships to foster a robust "community of trust." Our discussion will consider students' perspectives on academic integrity, how those might differ from instructors' perspectives, and how to build firm yet compassionate systems for promoting honesty in coursework. Through conversations with students and faculty, the discussion leaders have identified several compelling explanations for student cheating that largely derive from student culture and faculty messaging. We hope to share these lessons and inspire tactics for instructors to address student temptations to cheat that do not rely on the threat of penalty. This can help foster mentoring, rather than antagonistic, relationships between students and instructors, making computing courses increasingly welcoming for a greater diversity of students.
