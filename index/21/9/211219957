—Reconnaissance is critical for adversaries to prepare attacks causing physical damage in industrial control systems (ICS) like smart power grids. Disrupting reconnaissance is challenging. The state-of-the-art moving target defense (MTD) techniques based on mimicking and simulating system behaviors do not consider the physical infrastructure of power grids and can be easily identiﬁed. To overcome these challenges, we propose physical function virtualization (PFV) that “hooks” network interactions with real physical devices and uses these real devices to build lightweight virtual nodes that follow the actual implementation of network stacks, system invariants, and physical state variations in the real devices. On top of PFV, we propose DefRec, a defense mechanism that signiﬁcantly increases the effort required for an adversary to infer the knowledge of power grids’ cyber-physical infrastructures. By randomizing communications and crafting decoy data for virtual nodes, DefRec can mislead adversaries into designing damage-free attacks. We implement PFV and DefRec in the ONOS network operating system and evaluate them in a cyber-physical testbed, using real devices from different vendors and HP physical switches to simulate six power grids. The experimental results show that with negligible overhead, PFV can accurately follow the behavior of real devices. DefRec can delay adversaries’ reconnaissance for more than 100 years by adding a number of virtual nodes less than or equal to 20% of the number of real devices.
