Active learning environments have only recently started to be analyzed in the CS discipline, in terms of their effect on student performance. Recent studies in CS1 found contradictory results, in part due to different control on the learning pedagogy used, and issued a call for further investigation. This study evaluates the effects of the learning space on student performance in CS2, as measured by their grades. We use a quasi-experimental setup with 529 participants across five lecture sections over one academic term. All sections employ the same active learning method (inverted classroom), identical lecture materials, and the same number of TAs for in-class support, but differ in terms of classroom type (active learning classroom vs traditional lecture hall), instructor, and lecture time of day. Similarly to a recent study in CS1, we find no significant impact of the learning space in CS2. We also inspect factors not analyzed in previous studies, such as student prior preparation (as measured by prerequisite CS1 grades), course drop rates, and exam failure rates, and find that the CS2 sections are statistically similar. This work also examines student survey responses, to assess student perception differences on properties of the learning space which may impact their learning experience, such as the use of technology, ability to hear the instructor, ability to get help during lectures, and conduciveness of desk types to group work.
