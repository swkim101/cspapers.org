The need to integrate the development of innovative thinking and creative problem-solving skills into computer science curricula has been increasingly recognized. However, two major hurdles face many computer science educators: (1) What exercises can be used to develop creative and innovative thinking in the context of computing? and (2) How, in crowded curricula, can the time be found to engage students in creative problem-solving exercises? This demonstration presents a solution to both questions using video scenarios. These short films, with associated discussion questions, feature fictitious companies facing problems that computing solutions could alleviate. For example: Can an art gallery please a patron who wants paintings categorized by redness? In what innovative ways can a pet shop create customer communities? The problems the characters are facing are not explicitly stated nor do they have a single solution. Instead, the viewer must discern the problems through critical listening and observation, and then develop creative solutions to solve them. Since the videos decouple problem-solving from implementation, they also provide an equal-footing environment that allows students with varying technical abilities to participate productively in the exercises. Participants will be introduced to how video-based creative problem-solving exercises can be used, even in time-restricted situations.
