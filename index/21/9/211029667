Multi-view data has become ubiquitous, especially with multi-sensor systems like self-driving cars or medical patient-side monitors. We propose two methods to approach robust multi-view representation learning with the aim of leveraging local relationships between views.The first is an extension of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) where we consider multiple one-vs-rest CCA problems, one for each view. We use a group-sparsity penalty to encourage finding local relationships. The second method is a straightforward extension of a multi-view AutoEncoder with view-level drop-out.We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in simple synthetic experiments. We also describe heuristics and extensions to improve and/or expand on these methods.
