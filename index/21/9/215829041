Searching for documents with semantically similar content is a fundamental problem in the information retrieval domain with various challenges, primarily, in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Despite the promise of modeling structured dependencies in documents, several existing text hashing methods lack an efficient mechanism to incorporate such vital information. Additionally, the desired characteristics of an ideal hash function, such as robustness to noise, low quantization error and bit balance/uncorrelation, are not effectively learned with existing methods. This is because of the requirement to either tune additional hyper-parameters or optimize these heuristically and explicitly constructed cost functions. In this paper, we propose a Denoising Adversarial Binary Autoencoder (DABA) model which presents a novel representation learning framework that captures structured representation of text documents in the learned hash function. Also, adversarial training provides an alternative direction to implicitly learn a hash function that captures all the desired characteristics of an ideal hash function. Essentially, DABA adopts a novel single-optimization adversarial training procedure that minimizes the Wasserstein distance in its primal domain to regularize the encoderâ€™s output of either a recurrent neural network or a convolutional autoencoder. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in capturing the intrinsic semantic manifold of the related documents. The proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art shallow and deep unsupervised hashing methods for the document retrieval task on several prominent document collections.
