Rapid growth of enrollment has rendered students' academic success in computing courses increasingly important. Given the value of having insight from a peer's point of view, advice from students who have taken such courses will greatly help their peers better prepare for, and be academically successful in, those courses. We present a novel personalized peer advice recommender system called myCCAdvice (my-Computing-Course-Advice), which provides individual students with personalized peer advice on new computing courses. myCCAdvice finds students similar to a given student via multi-criteria rating-based collaborative filtering, using grades and perceived difficulty of the courses' concept and coding components as course ratings. For a given course, myCCAdvice then predicts the given student's personalized grade and perceived difficulty of concept and coding, and suggests personalized textual peer advice for the given student to succeed.
