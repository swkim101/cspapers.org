We aim to detect real-world concurrent activities performed by a single person from a streaming 3D skeleton sequence. Different from most existing works that deal with concurrent activities performed by multiple persons that are seldom correlated, we focus on concurrent activities that are spatio-temporally or causally correlated and performed by a single person. For the sake of generalization, we propose an approach based on a decompositional design to learn a dedicated feature representation for each activity class. To address the scalability issue, we further extend the class-level decompositional design to the postural-primitive level, such that each class-wise representation does not need to be extracted by independent backbones, but through a dedicated weighted aggregation of a shared pool of postural primitives. There are multiple interdependent instances deriving from each decomposition. Thus, we propose Stacked Relation Networks (SRN), with a specialized relation network for each decomposition, so as to enhance the expressiveness of instance-wise representations via the inter-instance relationship modeling. SRN achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public dataset and a newly collected dataset. The relation weights within SRN are interpretable among the activity contexts. The new dataset and code are available at https://github.com/weiyi1991/UA_Concurrent/
