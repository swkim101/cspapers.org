Automated test generation has helped to reduce the cost of software testing. However, developing effective test oracles for these automatically generated test inputs is a challenging task. Therefore, most automated test generation tools use trivial oracles that reduce the fault detection effectiveness of these automatically generated test cases. In this work, we provide results of an empirical study showing that utilizing metamorphic relations can increase the fault detection effectiveness of automatically generated test cases.
