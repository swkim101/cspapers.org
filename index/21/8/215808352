We demonstrate Reptor, a bytecode instrumentation tool enabling API virtualization on Android. It provides a general way to alter functionality of platform APIs on Android. With Reptor, third-party developers can modify the behavior of platform APIs according to their needs. All modifications are completely at the app layer without modifying the underlying platform. This allows practical openness---third-party developers can easily distribute their modifications for a platform without the need to update the entire platform.
