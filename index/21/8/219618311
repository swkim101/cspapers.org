Person images captured by unconstrained surveillance cameras often have low resolutions (LR). This causes the resolution mismatch problem when matched against the high-resolution (HR) gallery images, negatively affecting the performance of person re-identification (re-id). An effective approach is to leverage image super-resolution (SR) along with person re-id in a joint learning manner. However, this scheme is limited due to dramatically more difficult gradients backpropagation during training. In this paper, we introduce a novel model training regularisation method, called Inter-Task Association Critic (INTACT), to address this fundamental problem. Specifically, INTACT discovers the underlying association knowledge between image SR and person re-id, and leverages it as an extra learning constraint for enhancing the compatibility of SR model with person re-id in HR image space. This is realised by parameterising the association constraint which enables it to be automatically learned from the training data. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of INTACT over the state-of-the-art approaches on the cross-resolution re-id task using five standard person re-id datasets.
