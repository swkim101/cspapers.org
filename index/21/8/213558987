The Kirchhoff law is one of the most widely used physical laws in many engineering principles, e.g., biomedical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer engineering. One challenge of applying the Kirchhoff law to real-world applications at scale lies in the high, if not prohibitive, computational cost to solve a large number of nonlinear equations. Despite recent advances in leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the solutions of Kirchhoff equations, the low performance is still significantly hindering the broad adoption of CNN-based approaches. This paper proposes a high-performance deep-learning-based approach for Kirchhoff analysis, namely HDK. HDK employs two techniques to improve the performance: (i) early pruning of unqualified input candidates and (ii) parallelization of forward labelling. To retain high accuracy, HDK also applies various optimizations to the data such as randomized augmentation and dimension reduction. Collectively, the aforementioned techniques improve the analysis speed by 8Ã— with accuracy as high as 99.6%.
