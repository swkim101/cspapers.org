In this paper, the concepts of car maneuvers, fuzzy logic control (FLC), and sensor-based behavior are merged to implement the human-like driving skills in the garage-parking task by an autonomous car-like mobile robot (CLMR). We decompose the garage-parking control into four modes to synthesize the fuzzy garage parking control (FGPC). Computer simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes. The setup of the CLMR is provided, where the FGPC is implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. Finally, the real-time experiments of the FPGA-based CLMR for the garage-parking task demonstrate the feasibility in a practical car maneuvering.
