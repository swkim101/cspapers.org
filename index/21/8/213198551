The growing use of deep learning for a wide range of data problems has highlighted the need to understand and diagnose these models appropriately, making deep learning interpretation techniques an essential tool for data analysts. The numerous model interpretation methods proposed in recent years are generally based on heuristics, with little or no theoretical guarantees. Here, we present a statistical framework for saliency estimation for black-box computer vision models. Our proposed model-agnostic estimation procedure, which is statistically consistent and capable of passing sanity checks, has polynomial-time computational efficiency since it only requires solving a linear program. An upper bound is established on the number of model evaluations needed to recover regions of importance with high probability through our theoretical analysis. Furthermore, a new perturbation scheme is presented for the estimation of local gradients that is more efficient than commonly used random perturbation schemes. The validity and excellence of our new method are demonstrated experimentally via sensitivity analyses.
