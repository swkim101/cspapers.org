For in-hand manipulation, estimation of the object pose inside the hand is one of the important functions to manipulate objects to the target pose. Since in-hand manipulation tends to cause occlusions by the hand or the object itself, image information only is not sufficient for in-hand object pose estimation. Multiple modalities can be used in this case, the advantage is that other modalities can compensate for occlusion, noise, and sensor malfunctions. Even though deciding the utilization rate of a modality (referred to as reliability value) corresponding to the situations is important, the manual design of such models is difficult, especially for various situations. In this paper, we propose deep gated multi-modal learning, which self-determines the reliability value of each modality through end-to-end deep learning. For the experiments, an RGB camera and a GelSight tactile sensor were attached to the parallel gripper of the Sawyer robot, and the object pose changes were estimated during grasping. A total of 15 objects were used in the experiments. In the proposed model, the reliability values of the modalities were determined according to the noise level and failure of each modality, and it was confirmed that the pose change was estimated even for unknown objects. 1
