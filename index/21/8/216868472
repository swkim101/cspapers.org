Topic models are a useful analysis tool to uncover the underlying themes within document collections. Probabilistic models which assume a generative story have been the dominant approach for topic modeling. We propose an alternative approach based on clustering readily available pre-trained word embeddings while incorporating document information for weighted clustering and reranking top words. We provide benchmarks for the combination of different word embeddings and clustering algorithms, and analyse their performance under dimensionality reduction with PCA. The best performing combination for our approach is comparable to classical models, and complexity analysis indicate that this is a practical alternative to traditional topic modeling.
