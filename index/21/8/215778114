P2Prec is a social-based P2P recommendation system for large-scale content sharing that leverages content-based and social-based recommendation. The main idea is to recommend high quality documents related to query topics and contents held by useful friends (of friends) of the users, by exploiting friendship networks. We have implemented a prototype of P2Prec using the Shared-Data Overlay Network (SON), an open source development platform for P2P networks using web services, JXTA and OSGi. In this paper, we describe the demo of P2Prec's main services (installing P2Prec peers, initializing peers, gossiping topics of interest among friends, key-word querying for contents) using our prototype implemented as an application of SON.
