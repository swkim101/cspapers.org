Top-K recommender systems aim to generate few but satisfactory personalized recommendations for various practical applications, such as item recommendation for e-commerce and link prediction for social networks. However, the numbers of users and items can be enormous, thereby leading to myriad potential recommendations as well as the bottleneck in evaluating and ranking all possibilities. Existing Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) based methods treat the item ranking problem for each user independently and the relationship between users has not been explored. In this paper, we propose a novel model for clustering and navigating for top-K recommenders (CANTOR) to expedite the computation of top-K recommendations based on latent factor models. A clustering-based framework is first presented to leverage user relationships to partition users into affinity groups, each of which contains users with similar preferences. CANTOR then derives a coreset of representative vectors for each affinity group by constructing a set cover with a theoretically guaranteed difference to user latent vectors. Using these representative vectors in the coreset, approximate nearest neighbor search is then applied to obtain a small set of candidate items for each affinity group to be used when computing recommendations for each user in the affinity group. This approach can significantly reduce the computation without compromising the quality of the recommendations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six publicly available large-scale real-world datasets for item recommendation and personalized link prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that CANTOR significantly speeds up matrix factorization models with high precision. For instance, CANTOR can achieve 355.1x speedup for inferring recommendations in a million-user network with 99.5% precision@1 to the original system while the state-of-the-art method can only obtain 93.7x speedup with 99.0% precision@1.
