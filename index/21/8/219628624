In order to remove the non-uniform blur of images captured from dynamic scenes, many deep learning based methods design deep networks for large receptive fields and strong fitting capabilities, or use multi-scale strategy to deblur image on different scales gradually. Restricted by the fixed structures and parameters, these methods are always huge in model size to handle complex blurs. In this paper, we start from the deblurring deconvolution operation, then design an effective and real-time deblurring network. The main contributions are three folded, 1) we construct a spatially variant deconvolution network using modulated deformable convolutions, which can adjust receptive fields adaptively according to the blur features. 2) our analysis shows the sampling points of deformable convolution can be used to approximate the blur kernel, which can be simplified to bi-directional optical flows. So the position learning of sampling points can be supervised by bi-directional optical flows. 3) we build a light-weighted backbone for image restoration problem, which can balance the calculations and effectiveness well. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art deblurring performance, but with less parameters and shorter running time.
