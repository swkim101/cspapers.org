Wearable robotic arms (WRA) aim to be useful in unstructured environments where other lifting machines are cumbersome. Wearing an extra arm provides intuitive control to perform complex tasks. Current WRA designs rely on powerful actuators, resulting in dangerous and high-cost solutions. They also interfere with the visual field and workspace of the operator. This paper presents a new low-cost design of WRA to manipulate objects in elevated locations. The proposed WRA minimises the interference caused to its operator’s visual field and workspace. It is capable of reaching over the operator’s shoulder and folding behind their back. The WRA also implements passive gravity compensation. A new method of tuning a springcrank gravity compensation mechanism post manufacturing is presented, resulting in reduction of compensation error. A novel gripper design is also introduced. The gripper is passively actuated with a spring-lever mechanism in parallel with a servo actuator. In this mechanism, motor torque is only required to transition the gripper between open and closed configurations, allowing utilisation of low performance actuators. The same mechanism can also be used to add to the motor’s grip strength. The gripping mechanism is evaluated through experimental studies with a prototype.
