The task of grading solutions to student programming exercises is laborious and error-prone. We have developed a software tool called ASSYST that is designed to relieve a tutor of much of the burden of assessing such programs. ASSYST offers a graphical interface that can be used to direct all aspects of the grading process, and it considers a wide range of criteria in its automatic assessment. Experience with the system has been encouraging.
