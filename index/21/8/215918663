This study looks at students in introductory computer science courses at two major universities in order to understand some of the reasons behind the recent sharp decline in the number of female computer science majors. The study focuses on gender differences in preparation and skills and the implications of these differences on success in the introductory course.The study showed that despite the proliferation of computers in many areas of daily life, female students still enter introductory computer science classes with weaker programming skills and less involvement with computers than their male counterparts.Prior familiarity with programming concepts emerged as the most useful predictor of success in the course and a high level of success was difficult to achieve without this prior knowledge. The mean grades were comparable for men and women but the women were underrepresented among the highest achievers.This study suggests that the above factors combine to place women at a disadvantage in introductory computer science classes and that some adjustments to the pace and/or structure of this course might be necessary to attract and retain more women in the major.
