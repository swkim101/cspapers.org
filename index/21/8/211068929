We propose a new framework for online testing of heterogeneous treatment effects. The proposed test, named sequential score test (SST), is able to control type I error under continuous monitoring and detect multi-dimensional heterogeneous treatment effects. We provide an online p-value calculation for SST, making it convenient for continuous monitoring, and extend our tests to online multiple testing settings by controlling the false discovery rate. We examine the empirical performance of the proposed tests and compare them with a state-of-art online test, named mSPRT using simulations and a real data. The results show that our proposed test controls type I error at any time, has higher detection power and allows quick inference on online A/B testing.
