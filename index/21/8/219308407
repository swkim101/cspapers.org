We propose a new variant of TreeAdjoining Grammar that allows adjunction of full wrapping trees but still bears only context-free expressivity. We provide a transformation to context-free form, and a further reduction in probabilistic model size through factorization and pooling of parameters. This collapsed context-free form is used to implement efficient grammar estimation and parsing algorithms. We perform parsing experiments the Penn Treebank and draw comparisons to TreeSubstitution Grammars and between different variations in probabilistic model design. Examination of the most probable derivations reveals examples of the linguistically relevant structure that our variant makes possible.
