Robots have been widely used to replace human labors in the manufacturing factories, especially when dealing with hazardous environments such as chemicals, heat, etc. Other objective including ensuring consistent quality taking advantages of continuous operation of the robots. However, one major hindrance is the high initial investment of the robots despite the benefit acquired when the robots is used. Often, the skeptical opinion of the investors winding down the proposal. Therefore, the simulation of process improvement activities especially on the robot-based production process is a subject of great interest, which requires low to no-cost without jeopardizing the investor trust. In the ceramic factory, different value products are produced. Finding the highest benefit from robotics is something to consider. In this study, a simulation software, namely FlexSim is analyzed and simulated to optimize the painting process by robots.
