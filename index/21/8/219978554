There is a cognitive bias in the hacker community to select a piece of software and invest signiﬁcant human resources into ﬁnding bugs in that software without any prior indication of success. We label this strategy depth-ﬁrst search andproposeanalternative: breadth-ﬁrstsearch. Inbreadth-ﬁrst search, humans perform minimal work to enable automated analysis on a range of targets before committing additional time and effort to research any particular one. We present a repeatable human study that leverages teams of varying skill while using automation to the greatest extent possible. Our goal is a process that is effective at ﬁnding bugs; has a clear plan for the growth, coaching, and efﬁcient use of team members; and supports measurable, incremental progress. We derive an assembly-line process that improves on what was once intricate, manual work. Our work provides evidence that the breadth-ﬁrst approach increases the effectiveness of teams.
