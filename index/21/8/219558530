First identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared as a global emergency in January, and a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Along with this pandemic, we are also experiencing an "infodemic" of information with low credibility such as fake news and conspiracies. In this work, we present ReCOVery, a repository designed and constructed to facilitate research on combating such information regarding COVID-19. We first broadly search and investigate ~2,000 news publishers, from which 60 are identified with extreme [high or low] levels of credibility. By inheriting the credibility of the media on which they were published, a total of 2,029 news articles on coronavirus, published from January to May 2020, are collected in the repository, along with 140,820 tweets that reveal how these news articles have spread on the Twitter social network. The repository provides multimodal information of news articles on coronavirus, including textual, visual, temporal, and network information. The way that news credibility is obtained allows a trade-off between dataset scalability and label accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to present data statistics and distributions, as well as to provide baseline performances for predicting news credibility so that future methods can be compared.
