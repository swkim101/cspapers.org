A method for resolving the ellipses that appear in Japanese dialogues is proposed. This method resolves not only the subject ellipsis, but also those in object and other grammatical cases. In this approach, a machine-learning algorithm is used to select the attributes necessary for a resolution. A decision tree is built, and used as the actual ellipsis resolver. The results of blind tests have shown that the proposed method was able to provide a resolution accuracy of 91.7% for indirect objects, and 78.7% for subjects with a verb predicate. By investigating the decision tree we found that topic-dependent attributes are necessary to obtain high performance resolution, and that indispensable attributes vary according to the grammatical case. The problem of data size relative to decision-tree training is also discussed.
