Compared to desktop PCs, mobile devices have several constraints such as restricted screen size and reduced interactivity. Hence, it is not clear if it is helpful to provide educational multimedia material for mobile media players. In this paper, we present a study of algorithm animations on mobile devices, i.e. an Apple iPod with video functionality. The results of our experiment indicate that despite limitations there is an actual learning effect and therefore mobile media players offer a potential to increase learning that deserves further investigation.
