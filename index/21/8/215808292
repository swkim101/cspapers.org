It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Poster Track, associated with WWW 2016. 
 
The poster track is a forum to foster interactions among researchers and practitioners, by allowing them to present their new and innovative work in-progress. By presenting their ideas to the WWW 2016, researchers will have a chance to collect feedback from the WWW community and start fruitful conversations. We have a wide variety of topics in the poster track, which cover many topics of interest to the WWW community. We hope that you will enjoy attending the track, and you will find it useful for your future research.
