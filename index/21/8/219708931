Recent studies have shown that skeletonization (pruning parameters) of networks at initialization provides all the practical benefits of sparsity both at inference and training time, while only marginally degrading their performance. However, we observe that beyond a certain level of sparsity (approx 95%), these approaches fail to preserve the network performance, and to our surprise, in many cases perform even worse than trivial random pruning. To this end, we propose to find a skeletonized network with maximum foresight connection sensitivity (FORCE). Intuitively, out of all possible sub-networks, we propose to find the one whose connections would have a maximum impact on the loss when perturbed. Our approximate solution to maximize the FORCE, progressively prunes connections of a given network at initialization. This allows parameters that were unimportant at earlier stages of skeletonization to become important at later stages. In many cases, our approach enables us to remove up to 99.9% parameters, while keeping networks trainable and providing significantly better performance than recent approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach at various levels of sparsity (from medium to extreme) through extensive experiments and analysis. Code can be found in this https URL.
