—The last decade has seen a growing interest in adversarial classiﬁcation , where an attacker tries to mislead a classiﬁer meant to detect anomalies. We study this problem in a setting where anomaly detection is being used in conjunction with differential privacy to protect personal information. We show that a strategic attacker can leverage the additional noise (introduced to ensure differential privacy) to mislead the classiﬁer beyond what the attacker could do otherwise; we also propose countermeasures against such attacks. We then evaluate the impact of our attacks and defenses in road trafﬁc congestion and smart metering examples
