Semantic segmentation is a class of methods to classify each pixel in an image into semantic classes, which is critical for autonomous vehicles and surgery systems. Cross-entropy (CE) loss-based deep neural networks (DNN) achieved great success w.r.t. the accuracy-based metrics, e.g., mean Intersection-over Union. However, the CE loss has a limitation in that it ignores varying degrees of severity of pair-wise misclassified results. For instance, classifying a car into the road is much more terrible than recognizing it as a bus. To sidestep this, in this work, we propose to incorporate the severity-aware inter-class correlation into our Wasserstein training framework by configuring its ground distance matrix. In addition, our method can adaptively learn the ground metric in a high-fidelity simulator, following a reinforcement alternative optimization scheme. We evaluate our method using the CARLA simulator with the Deeplab backbone, demonstraing that our method significantly improves the survival time in the CARLA simulator. In addition, our method can be readily applied to existing DNN architectures and algorithms while yielding superior performance. We report results from experiments carried out with the CamVid and Cityscapes datasets.
