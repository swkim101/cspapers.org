Although pronounceability can improve password memorability, most existing password generation approaches have not properly integrated the pronounceability of passwords in their designs. In this work, we demonstrate several shortfalls of current pronounceable password generation approaches, and then propose, ProSemPass, a new method of generating passwords that are pronounceable and semantically meaningful. In our approach, users supply initial input words and our system improves the pronounceability and meaning of the user-provided words by automatically creating a portmanteau. To measure the strength of our approach, we use attacker models, where attackers have complete knowledge of our password generation algorithms. We measure strength in guess numbers and compare those with other existing password generation approaches. Using a large-scale IRB-approved user study with 1,563 Amazon MTurkers over 9 different conditions, our approach achieves a 30% higher recall than those from current pronounceable password approaches, and is stronger than the offline guessing attack limit.
