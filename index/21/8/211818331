The intuitive collaboration of humans and intelligent robots (embodied AI) in the real-world is an essential objective for many desirable applications of robotics. Whilst there is much research regarding explicit communication, we focus on how humans and robots interact implicitly, on motor adaptation level. We present a real-world setup of a human-robot collaborative maze game, designed to be non-trivial and only solvable through collaboration, by limiting the actions to rotations of two orthogonal axes, and assigning each axes to one player. This results in neither the human nor the agent being able to solve the game on their own. We use deep reinforcement learning for the control of the robotic agent, and achieve results within 30 minutes of real-world play, without any type of pre-training. We then use this setup to perform systematic experiments on human/agent behaviour and adaptation when co-learning a policy for the collaborative game. We present results on how co-policy learning occurs over time between the human and the robotic agent resulting in each participant’s agent serving as a representation of how they would play the game. This allows us to relate a person’s success when playing with different agents than their own, by comparing the policy of the agent with that of their own agent.
