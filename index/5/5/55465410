The subject of this paper is about the use of a suspended Cable-Driven Parallel Robot (CDPR) for pick-and-place operations of heavy and heterogeneous objects. The knowledge of the payload mass and its center of mass in realtime is an asset for robust control of the device, which is required to ensure a good stability, especially when the objects have different shapes, sizes and masses. Accordingly, this paper aims at experimentally evaluating the effects of (i) the pulleys modeling and (ii) the use of force sensors for the payload estimation. It turns out that the consideration of the pulleys into the geometric model of the robot improves the mass and center of mass estimations of the payload. A comparison is made between the estimation of cable tensions from force sensors and from motor currents. Finally, a torque controller with a feedforward term for real-time mass compensation is proposed and implemented on a CDPR prototype.
