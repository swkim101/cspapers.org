We present C-Saw, a system that measures Internet censorship by offering data-driven censorship circumvention to users. The adaptive circumvention capability of C-Saw incentivizes users to opt-in by offering small page load times (PLTs). As users crowdsource, the measurement data gets richer, offering greater insights into censorship mechanisms over a wider region, and in turn leading to even better circumvention capabilities. C-Saw incorporates user consent in its design by measuring only those URLs that a user actually visits. Using a cross-platform implementation of C-Saw, we show that it is effective at collecting and disseminating censorship measurements, selecting circumvention approaches, and optimizing user experience. C-Saw improves the average PLT by up to 48% and 63% over Lantern and Tor, respectively. We demonstrate the feasibility of a large-scale deployment of C-Saw with a pilot study.
