Line extraction is a preliminary step in various visual robotic tasks performed in low textured scenes such as city and indoor settings. Several efficient line segment detection algorithms such as LSD and EDLines have recently emerged. However, the state of the art segment grouping methods are not robust enough or not amenable for detecting lines in real-time. In this paper we present FSG, a fast and robust line detection algorithm. It is based on two independent components. A proposer that greedily cluster segments suggesting plausible line candidates and a probabilistic model that decides if a group of segments is an actual line. In the experiments we show that our procedure is more robust and faster than the best methods in the literature and achieves state-of-the art performance in a high level robot localization task such as vanishing points detection.
