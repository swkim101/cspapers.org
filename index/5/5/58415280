Systematic search and local search paradigms for combinatorial problems are generally believed to have complementary strengths. Nevertheless, attempts to combine the power of the two paradigms have had limited success, due in part to the expensive information communication overhead involved. We propose a hybrid strategy based on shared memory, ideally suited for multi-core processor architectures. This method enables continuous information exchange between two solvers without slowing down either of the two. Such a hybrid search strategy is surprisingly effective, leading to substantially better quality solutions to many challenging Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) instances than what the current best exact or heuristic methods yield, and it often achieves this within seconds. This hybrid approach is naturally best suited to MaxSAT instances for which proving unsatisfiability is already hard; otherwise the method falls back to pure local search.
