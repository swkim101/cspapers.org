The ACM International Workshop on Data Warehousing and Online Analytical Processing (DOLAP) is an annual event that provides an international forum where both researchers and practitioners can share their findings in theoretical foundations, current methodologies, practical experiences, and new research directions in the areas of data warehousing and online analytical processing. The main theme of seventh DOLAP workshop is the methods, technologies, and tools that enable the Business Intelligence lifecycle from data modeling and acquisition to knowledge extraction to delivery of results across a wide variety of organizations including corporate, scientific, government, and healthcare domains. 
 
These proceedings contain the papers selected for presentation at the workshop. We received 29 submissions from 13 different countries. After careful review, the program committee selected 14 papers for presentation at the workshop. The accepted papers were presented in 4 sessions: Physical Design, OLAP, Business Intelligence, and Query/View Processing. A keynote address was given by Kareem M. Saad of IBM Healthcare and Life Sciences on clinical/genomics data warehousing to support information-based medicine. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for data warehousing and OLAP researchers and practitioners.
