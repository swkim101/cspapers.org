Developing advanced robots can be a resource-intensive activity that creates many challenges for research teams. There is a need to formulate new techniques for systematically designing complex robot systems, especially in cases where high adaptability is needed and design metrics cannot be explicitly specified in advance. This research explores how the Goals/Questions/Metrics (GQM) method, a well-established technique for process measurement, can be modified for use as a design tool in robotics. To illustrate how a design-orientated GQM method may be used in practice, a sample use-case is given detailing how the approach was applied to the task of developing a bespoke robotic gripper for a service robot. The study provides an early indication that the adoption of GQM principles by designers can have significant benefits in robotics applications. However, further investigation is needed to better understand the magnitude and scope of any improvements.
