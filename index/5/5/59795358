In many real-world tasks of image classification, limited amounts of labeled data are available to train automatic classifiers. Consequently, extensive human expert involvement is required for verification. A novel solution is presented that makes use of active learning combined with an ensemble of classifiers for each class. The result is a significant reduction in required expert involvement for uncertain image region classification.
