The aim of this qualitative study is to explore school conditions and the needs of teacher's professional knowledge in practice through Collaborative-Reflective Supervision (CRS) at one elementary school under the guidance of the Indonesian University of Education. This research, a preliminary study, looked for the empirical evidence about school conditions in general and needs of teacherâ€™s professional development which was suitable with the CRS model. The result of a study is constructed as scaffolding for a component of the CRS. The data were gathered based on in-depth interview and participative observation with one of the principal and school members. The problem of teacher professional development is used to be implemented in perspective, directive, and short tornadoes. Consequently, it must be changed to become more collaborative, constructive, school-based and collegial in their relationship. In this model, the activity of the supervisors (principal and master teacher) is facilitating teachers to learn together in improving professional, practical knowledge by rethinking their experience in order to design better instruction in future. Reflection process is started by responding particular problems which arose in the classroom and expanding more knowledge and apply in professional practice situation. The CRS should see a collaborative, constructive, school-based and collegial relationship. The results of the study indicate that the school has the features available for condition to implement the CRS and fulfill the needs of teacher professional development. All of the results can be constructed as the components of the CRS model which consist of reflection process, distributed function of supervision, structural leadership of the principal and collegial relationship.
