Requirements engineering (RE) provide means of communication for the effective support of subsequent software engineering phases. However, initial requirements are often in the form of natural language and are prone to ambiguity and imprecision. Therefore it is vital to elicit these requirements in a clear manner before representation. Guiding rules and language patterns are meant to help reduce ambiguities and imprecision in natural language requirements. This paper presents the application of language patterns to an object oriented knowledge representation framework with the objective of improving the quality of requirements representation.
