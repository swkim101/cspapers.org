The BADGERS workshop is intended to encourage the development of large scale security-related data collection and analysis initiatives. It provides an environment to describe already existing real-world, large-scale datasets, and to share with the systems community the return on experiences acquired by analyzing such collected data. Furthermore, novel approaches to collect and study such data sets are presented at the first edition of this workshop. By giving visibility to existing solutions, we expect that the workshop will promote and encourage the better sharing of data and knowledge. 
 
We are happy to report that the first BADGERS workshop received many interesting submissions, spanning three continents, and many aspects of data collection and analysis initiatives. In the end, the program committee accepted 15 papers (including three short papers) out of 21 submissions (71%) for publication and all of the papers received at least three reviews from our program committee. This workshop would never have taken place without the truly excellent program committee and external reviewers and we are grateful for all the hard work they put in. 
 
In our opinion the resulting program is quite interesting and promises to spark lively discussions. In summary, the accepted papers address topics that range from testbeds that can be used to study current attacks, to large scale data collection systems, to legal issues associated with data collection and sharing. All very different papers and presentations, but all focusing on the problem of data collection and analysis initiatives. They were selected for their novelty, and their potential for interesting debate. We sincerely hope you will enjoy the workshop.
