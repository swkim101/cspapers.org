In this paper we present the design and control strategies of a novel quadruped climbing robot (named Magneto) with three degrees of freedom (3-DOF) actuated limbs and a 3-DOF compliant magnetic foot. By exploiting its high degrees of freedom, Magneto is able to deform its body shape to squeeze through gaps of 23cm, which is smaller than standard human entry portholes of industrial confined spaces. Its compact foot design of footprint 4cm allows Magneto to walk on narrow beams of thickness less than 5cm, even at varying separation. The inherent high dimensional system design enables the body to be positioned in a wide range of orientations and seamlessly switch a limb function from locomotion to manipulation mode mid-climb. This capability enables access to confined space openings and occluded pockets and navigation through complex 3-D structures previously not demonstrated on legged climbing robots.
