Real-world experiments have shown that the transmission power and the received signal strength of low-power radio transceivers used in sensornets decrease when temperature increases. We analyze how this phenomenon affects the network layer, and find that temperature fluctuations may cause undesirable behavior by sensornet routing protocols such as CTP and RPL. Furthermore, we present an approach to make these protocols robust to temperature fluctuations by augmenting the ETX link metric with temperature hints.
