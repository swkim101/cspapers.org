This paper revisits the problem of estimating the attitude, linear velocity and depth of an IMU-Camera with respect to a planar target. The considered solution relies on the measurement of the optical flow (extracted from the continuous homography) complemented with gyrometer and accelerometer measurements. The proposed deterministic observer is accompanied with an observability analysis that points out camera's motion excitation conditions whose satisfaction grants stability of the observer and convergence of the estimation errors to zero. The performance of the observer is illustrated by performing experiments on a testbed IMU-Camera system.
