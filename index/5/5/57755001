In this work, the authors report the investigation of liposomes' stability as a drug delivery vehicle, using the method of resistive pulse method. The main objects of interest are the 50nm diameter liposomes, while the 100nm diameter liposomes are widely used for its stability. However, certain drug delivery scenarios arise, like tighter cancerous tissue arrangement and different circulation time requirement, which dictates the necessity of sub-100nm diameter vesicles. The size measurements upon freshly fabricated liposomes are performed frequently on increasing time interval. The results exhibit a trend of size increasing, suggesting the existence of liposome fusion. The possible models of fusion are proposed and discussed. This work demonstrates the localized organic nanoparticle measurement with fine dual 3D manipulator positioning, which paves the way for the possible cellular in-vivo measurement within an environmental SEM chamber.
