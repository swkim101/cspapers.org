A growing number of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients are being remotely monitored while at home enabling hospital staff to access clinical information, e.g. heart rate, rhythm electrograms. Previous research has shown that such monitoring leads to increased patient safety, e.g. on mortality. We illustrate a paradox of safety of remote monitoring from a qualitative study of nineteen ICD patients and their spouses, as they feel less safe while connected to a remote monitoring service. Based on this, we describe three challenges for health technologies in the home namely device feedback to patients, physical appearance of devices, and lack of in-clinic visits.
