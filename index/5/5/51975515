We introduce a new technique to bound the asymptotic performance of splay trees. The basic idea is to transcribe, in an indirect fashion, the rotations performed by the splay tree as a Davenport-Schinzel sequence, none of whose subsequences are isomorphic to a fixed <i>forbidden subsequence</i>. We direct this technique towards Tarjan's <i>deque conjecture</i> and prove that <i>n</i> deque operations take only <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>α*<i>(n)</i>) time, where α* <i>(n)</i> is the minimum number of applications of the inverse-Ackermann function mapping <i>n</i> to a constant. We are optimistic that this approach could be directed towards other open conjectures on splay trees such as the <i>traversal</i> and <i>split</i> conjectures.
