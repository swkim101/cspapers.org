Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (MDDs) are instrumental in modeling combinatorial problems with Constraint Programming.In this paper, we propose a related data structure called sMDD (semi-MDD) where the central layer of the diagrams is non-deterministic.We show that it is easy and efficient to transform any table (set of tuples) into an sMDD.We also introduce a new filtering algorithm, called Compact-MDD, which is based on bitwise operations, and can be applied to both MDDs and sMDDs.Our experimental results show the practical interest of our approach, both in terms of compression and filtering speed.
