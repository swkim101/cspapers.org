Video delivery over the Internet has been historically a challenging problem in the Internet. Recently, we have witnessed a number of proposals that promise high-quality video streaming without the need for infrastructure support. Such proposals rely in P2P networks as their core delivery method. 
 
However, still in its infancy, both live and on-demand P2P streaming present many research challenges. This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in the field of P2P and IPTV video delivery networks to share their experiences and discuss the most pressing research challenges in the years to come. 
 
We have received 18 submissions from the US, Europe, and Asia. Each paper received at least three reviews from experts in the field. Based on the received reviews, the program committee selected 8 papers that will appear in the final program.
