This paper presents the dynamic modelling and motion planning method for a quadruped robot that uses its legs for nonprehensile manipulation as well as locomotion. Three different working modes named Drive Mode, Inchworm Mode and Scoot Mode are proposed to enable the robot to move forward together with the object. We firstly introduce a universal model for these modes and deduce its dynamic equation. Then the contact force constraints are combined and mapped to the system state variables. Based on the acquired state acceleration constraints, the motion planning problem can be solved by designing system state paths in the phase space. After that, we described the mathematical problems within the three working modes and generate the robot motions accordingly. Finally, experimental results obtained through simulations and physical tests are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
