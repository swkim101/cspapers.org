In this demonstration paper, we present a pedagogical tool called Hintikka's world for showing how artificial agents can reason about higher-order knowledge (an agent knows that another agent knows that...). The system provides famous AI examples such as Muddy children and Russian cards. The system also allows to implement user's own examples via the description of a Kripke model or via its generation by the generic tableau method prover MetTeL2.
