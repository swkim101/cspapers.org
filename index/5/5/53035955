In this paper, we propose a novel sequential neural network with structure attention to model information diffusion. The proposed model explores both sequential nature of an information diffusion process and structural characteristics of user connection graph. The recurrent neural network framework is employed to model the sequential information. The attention mechanism is incorporated to capture the structural dependency among users, which is defined as the diffusion context of a user. A gating mechanism is further developed to effectively integrate the sequential and structural information. The proposed model is evaluated on the diffusion prediction task. The performances on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate its superiority over popular baselines and state-of-the-art sequence-based models.
