Topic modelling and citation recommendation of scientific articles are important yet challenging research problems in scientific article analysis. In particular, the inference on coherent topics can be easily affected by irrelevant contents in articles. Meanwhile, the extreme sparsity of citation networks brings difficulty to a valid citation recommendation. Intuitively, articles with similar topics are more likely to cite each other, and cited articles tend to share similar themes. Motivated from this intuition, we aim to boost the performance of both topic modelling and citation recommendation by effectively leverage this underlying correlation between latent topics and citation networks. To this end, we propose a novel Bayesian deep generative model termed as Neural Relational Topic Model (NRTM), which is composed with a Stacked Variational Auto-Encoder (SVAE) and a multilayer perception (MLP). Specifically, the SVAE utilizes an inference network to learn more representative topics of document contents, which can help to enrich the latent factors in collaborative filtering of citations. Furthermore, the MLP network conducts nonlinear collaborative filtering of citations, which can further benefit the inference of topics by leveraging the knowledge of citation networks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model can effectively take advantages of the coherence between topic learning and citation recommendation, and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods on both tasks.
