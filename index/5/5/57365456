We introduce a novel ensemble learning framework for supervised classification. Our proposed framework, mixed bagging, is a form of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) in which the sampling process takes into account the classification hardness of the training instances. The classification hardness, or simply hardness, of an instance is defined as the probability that the instance will be misclassified by a classification model built from the remaining instances in the training set. We incorporate instance hardness into the bagging process by varying the sampling probability of each instance based on its estimated hardness. Bootstraps of differing hardness can be created in this way by over-representing, under-representing and equally representing harder instances. This results in a diverse committee of classifiers induced from the bootstraps, whose individual outputs can be aggregated to achieve a final class prediction. We propose two versions of mixed bagging â€“ one where the bootstraps are grouped as easy, regular or hard, with all bootstraps in one group having the same hardness; and the other where the hardness of bootstraps change gradually from one iteration to the next. We have tested our system on 47 publicly available binary classification problems using C4.5 Decision Trees of varying depth as base learners. We find that the proposed mixed bagging methods perform better than traditional bagging and weighted bagging (wagging) regardless of the base learner. The proposed method also outperforms AdaBoost when the base learner consists of deeper decision trees. We examine the results of mixed bagging in terms of bias-variance decomposition and find that mixed bagging is better than AdaBoost at reducing variance and better than traditional bagging at reducing inductive bias.
