We present a novel sound localization algorithm for a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sound source in indoor environments. Our approach exploits the diffraction properties of sound waves as they bend around a barrier or an obstacle in the scene. We combine a ray tracing-based sound propagation algorithm with a Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) model, which simulate bending effects by placing a virtual sound source on a wedge in the environment. We precompute the wedges of a reconstructed mesh of an indoor scene and use them to generate diffraction acoustic rays to localize the 3D position of the source. Our method identifies the convergence region of those generated acoustic rays as the estimated source position based on a particle filter. We have evaluated our algorithm in multiple scenarios consisting of static and dynamic NLOS sound sources. In our tested cases, our approach can localize a source position with an average accuracy error of 0.7m, measured by the L2 distance between estimated and actual source locations in a 7m×7m×3m room. Furthermore, we observe 37% to 130% improvement in accuracy over a state-of-the-art localization method that does not model diffraction effects, especially when a sound source is not visible to the robot.
