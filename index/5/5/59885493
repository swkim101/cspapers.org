This paper discusses the creation of re-useable log files for investigating interactive cross-language search behaviour. This was run as part of iCLEF 2008-09 where the goal was generating a record of user-system interactions based on interactive cross-language image searches. The level of entry to iCLEF was made purposely low with a default search interface and online game environment provided by the organisers. User-system interaction and input from users was recorded in log files for future investigation. This novel approach to running iCLEF resulted in logs containing more than 2 million lines of data.
