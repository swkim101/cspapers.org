We introduce TuringBox, a platform to democratize the study of AI. On one side of the platform, AI contributors upload existing and novel algorithms to be studied scientifically by others. On the other side, AI examiners develop and post machine intelligence tasks to evaluate and characterize the outputs of algorithms. We outline the architecture of such a platform, and describe two interactive case studies of algorithmic auditing on the platform.
