This study reports the initial testing of a gait exoskeleton for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) patients having variable muscle strength with no balance or ambulation capabilities. To improve the quality of life of such patients, a pediatric gait exoskeleton was developed. The ATLAS exoskeleton has 8 active degrees of freedom (DOF): 2 at the hip (adduction/abduction and flexion/extension), 1 at the knee and ankle joint for flexion and extension. A feasibility test was performed to gauge the initial response of the patients. This study demonstrates that the exoskeleton was able to provide gait assistance and sit-to-stand movements effectively to the subjects. This kind of wearable exoskeleton will play a key role in the rehabilitation of SMA patients and delay further metabolic degeneration in the future.
