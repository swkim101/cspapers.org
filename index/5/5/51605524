Hashing has been widely deployed to large-scale image retrieval due to its low storage cost and fast query speed. Almost all deep hashing methods do not sufficiently discover semantic correlation from label information, which results in the learned hash codes less discriminative. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Joint Semantic-Embedding Hashing (DSEH) approach that contains LabNet and ImgNet. Specifically, LabNet is explored to capture abundant semantic correlation between sample pairs and supervise ImgNet from semantic level and hash codes level, which is conductive to the generated hash codes being more discriminative and similarity-preserving. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
