Modern automotive systems and IoT devices are designed through a highly complex, globalized, and potentially untrustworthy supply chain. Each player in this supply chain may (1) introduce sensitive information and data (collectively termed “assets”) that must be protected from other players in the supply chain, and (2) have controlled access to assets introduced by other players. Furthermore, some players in the supply chain may be malicious. It is imperative to protect the device and any sensitive assets in it from being compromised or unknowingly disclosed by such entities. A key – and sometimes overlooked – component of security architecture of modern electronic systems entails managing security in the face of supply chain challenges. In this paper we discuss some security challenges in automotive and IoT systems arising from supply chain complexity, and the state of the practice in this area.
