This paper deals with the optimization of the geometry of a Cable-Driven Parallel Robot (CDPR) dedicated to large-scale construction applications. Since the maximum cable tension is a critical parameter in the design of the CDPR components, the geometry of the CDPR is optimized by minimizing the lowest maximum cable tension that ensures the validity of wrench-feasibility constraints. The geometric design procedure used in this paper consists of two phases, the CDPR cable connections is selected in the first phase followed by a second phase where the geometric parameters are optimized. The result of this procedure is an original fully-constrained CDPR geometry.
