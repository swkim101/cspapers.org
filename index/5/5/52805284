Summary form only given. This paper presents the design simulation and measured performance of a 2.45 GHz meander line antenna for RFID, are fabricated on a FR-4 PCB substrate. HFSS simulator is used in the design simulation of this antenna structure. Numerical and measured results of the antenna radiation characteristics, including return loss, VSWR and radiation pattern coverage, are presented.
