It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Third ACM Workshop on Digital Identity Management -- DIM 2007. This year's symposium continues its tradition for being an important forum for exploring opportunities of, and issues with, digital identity. The aim of this year's workshop is to discuss and provide recommendations for the making implementable and deployable improvements to the usability of identity management by gathering vendors, users, and researchers, in the areas of identity management 
 
The call for papers attracted 26 submissions from Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America. The program committee accepted 10 papers that cover areas crossing over usability, privacy and security in authentication, reputation, and trust management. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners and facilitate further research and development in digital identity management.
