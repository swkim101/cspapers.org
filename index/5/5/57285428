Enhancing transparency of a teleoperation system by increasing the command-following bandwidth has not received lots of attention so far. This is considered a challenging task since in a teleoperation system the command-following bandwidth of the slave robot motion controller cannot be increased with a conventional motion controller as the desired trajectory is instantaneously commanded by the human user and thus, cannot be considered to be given in a pre-computed, smooth second order derivative form. We propose a method to increase the command-following bandwidth by extending the previously introduced Successive Stiffness Increment (SSI) approach to bilateral teleoperation. The approach allows realizing a very high motion controller gain, which cannot be realized with a conventional bilateral teleoperation controller as confirmed by experimental results.
