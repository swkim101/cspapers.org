The Axel rappelling rover was designed to enable access to intriguing and important science sites that lie in difficult terrains that are inaccessible to conventional rovers. Extended autonomous rappelling calls for careful control of tether tension, precise management of tether spooling, and some measure of shock tolerance. This paper covers the design and testing of a first-generation tether management system (TMS) for Axel. The system uses a double bull-wheel capstan driven by a low-stiffness series elastic actuator (SEA) to provide tension control and decouple internal spooling tension from external tether tension. A series elastic actuator was chosen for this application to permit closed-loop tether tension control and to provide shock/drop tolerance of the rappelling system both while moving and when the system is inactive with the motors locked. Experiments on the new TMS show that this design performs well in keeping nearly constant spooling tension while rejecting large dynamic disturbances at the output. While the SEA is very effective at maintaining a given tension contribution, the additional effects of friction and the unique mechanical properties of the tether result in substantial errors in the measured output tension. Upcoming field trials will be used to evaluate the effectiveness and sufficiency of this system when integrated in Axel.
