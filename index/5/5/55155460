Sleep-states are emerging as a first-class design choicein energy minimization. A side effect of this is that the releasebehavior of the system is affected and subsequently thepreemption relations between tasks. In a first step we haveinvestigated how the behavior in terms of number of preemptions of tasks in the system is changed at runtime, using an existing procrastination approach, which utilizes sleepstates for energy savings purposes. Our solution resulted in substantial savings of preemptions and we expect from even higher yields for alternative energy saving algorithms. This work is intended to form the base of future research, which aims to bound the number of preemptions at analysistime and subsequently how this may be employed in the analysis to reduced the amount of system utilization, which is reserved to account for the preemption delay.
