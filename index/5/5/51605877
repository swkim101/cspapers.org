The job interview is considered as one of the most essential tasks in talent recruitment, which forms a bridge between candidates and employers in fitting the right person for the right job. While substantial efforts have been made on improving the job interview process, it is inevitable to have biased or inconsistent interview assessment due to the subjective nature of the traditional interview process. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to intelligent job interview assessment by learning the large-scale real-world interview data. Specifically, we develop a latent variable model named Joint Learning Model on Interview Assessment (JLMIA) to jointly model job description, candidate resume and interview assessment. JLMIA can effectively learn the representative perspectives of different job interview processes from the successful job application records in history. Therefore, a variety of applications in job interviews can be enabled, such as person-job fit and interview question recommendation. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world data clearly validate the effectiveness of JLMIA, which can lead to substantially less bias in job interviews and provide a valuable understanding of job interview assessment.
