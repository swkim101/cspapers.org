In order to accurately reach a target position while executing a task which imposes occlusion or constraints of the posture, a humanoid robot requires an adaptive locomotion system, which can comprehensively integrate localization, environmental mapping, global locomotion planning and local error correction. In this paper, we propose a method of constructing a perception based locomotion system for a humanoid robot. The major contribution of this paper is solving a problem of the locomotion error caused by the task constraints, by locally compensating footsteps and assessing the need for global footstep re-planning online based on environmental measurements. The proposed system provides an accurate and dense ground point cloud, called HeightField, using plane estimation and space interpolation, and obstacle point cloud for frequent collision avoidance by accumulating laser scans. This environmental perception enables a humanoid robot to plan footsteps globally even in the situation where the sight of the robot is limited and compensate footsteps while estimating landing state during locomotion online with the localization result. We evaluated the practicality of the proposed system by applying it to our humanoid robot carrying a heavy object in a construction site and confirmed that the proposed system contributed to improved locomotion abilities of a humanoid robot engaging in heavy-duty or dangerous tasks.
