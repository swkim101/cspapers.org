This paper proposes a novel framework for image retrieval. The retrieval is treated as searching for an ordered cycle in an image database. The optimal cycle can be found by minimizing the geometric manifold entropy of images. The minimization is solved by the proposed method, fast active tabu search. Experimental results demonstrate the framework for image retrieval is feasible and quite promising.
