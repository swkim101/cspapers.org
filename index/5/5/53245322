Computer systems are commonly attacked by malicious transport contacts. We present a comparative study that analyzes to what extent those attacks depend on the network access, in particular if an adversary targets specifically on mobile or non-mobile devices. Based on a mobile honeypot that extracts first statistical results, our findings indicate that a few topological domains of the Internet have started to place particular focus on attacking mobile networks.
