This paper deals with a new dynamic formulation of parallel manipulators incorporating the actuator and friction dynamics to be utilized in control. A model-based controller, PD with computed feedforward, is implemented for a parallel robot taking into consideration the formulated dynamics. The motivation behind this contribution is to enhance the control performance by compensating the unfavourable nonlinearities abundant extensively in PKMs. Those nonlinearities may increase considerably when operating at high-speed motions. The proposed feedforward part relies on the reference trajectories instead of the measured ones improving the control performance and the computational efforts. To validate our contribution, real-time experiments are conducted on a four degree-of-freedom parallel robot named VELOCE in different operating conditions.
