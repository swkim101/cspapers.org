The aim of designing efficient localized text entry interfaces need not only apply to alphabetic text, a similar approach can also be taken with number entry interface design. Sets of domain specific numbers behave in similar ways to natural language, with predictable patterns in terms of the frequency of characters and bigrams. It is therefore possible to tailor the number entry interface to make it better suited to the task at hand, potentially making it faster and less error prone. Thinking of numbers as a language, we can better see the steps next required to allow us to design superior number entry interfaces.
