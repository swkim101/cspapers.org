A new method for enhancing the mobility of the polysilicon thin‐film transistors (poly‐Si TFT) by pattern‐dependent metal‐induced‐ lateral‐crystallization (PDMILC) with different device dimensions were successfully demonstrated and characterized. The experimental results indicate that the field effect mobility of PDMILC TFT was enhanced as the channel width decreased, because the lateral length of its poly‐Si grain was increased. For the gate length of 2 um, the ten nano‐wire channels (M10) PDMILC poly‐Si TFT had the greatest mobility of 107.79 cm2/Vs and the smallest subthreshold swing (SS) of 0.23 V/dec. The mobility also increased with the decline in the gate length, because the number of poly‐Si grain boundary defects was reduced.
