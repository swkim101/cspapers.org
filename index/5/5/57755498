Microrobotic cargo delivery possesses promising perspective for precision medicine, and has attracted much attention recently. However, its automation remains challenging, especially with complex environmental conditions, such as obstacles and obstructed optical feedback. In this paper, we propose an automated control approach for a new microrobotic cargo carrier, i. e. the multifunctional magnetic spore (Mag-Spore). By surface functionalization of the spore with Fe3O4 nanoparticles and carbon quantum dots, it can be remotely actuated and tracked by an electromagnetic coil system and the fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Our strategy utilizes fluorescence imaging for vision feedback, which enhances the recognition and tracking of Mag-Spores and cells. Then, information of the cells and Mag-Spores for planning and control is identified via image processing, and an optimal path planner with obstacle avoidance capability is designed based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)algorithm. To make the Mag-Spore follow the planed path accurately, an observer-based trajectory tracking controller is synthesized. Simulations and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.
