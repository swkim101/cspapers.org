Real-time computing provides insightful ways to explore the optimization in resource usages, especially from the time point of view. Nevertheless, real-time task scheduling is recognized by its high complexity when there are non-preemptive shared resources and multiple processors. When more and more practical factors in system designs are considered, such as energy consumption and memory allocation, even some sub-problems in real-time task scheduling become intractable. Although people often criticize various artificial assumptions in real-time task scheduling, they have to admit that ideas in real-time computing and their extensions, such as tradeoff in cost, performance, energy, and even the quality of service, can be applied to multi-dimensional optimization in system designs. In this direction, we witness the rapid development of the embedded system industry and join the task force in system designs, especially mobile devices and non-volatile memory systems. Resource management on mobile devices, with a special emphasis on user experience, should not only consider the response time but also the visual perception of users. Non-volatile memory has also blurred the boundary between the memory and the storage. It enables certain unified considerations of the main memory and storage and also in-memory computing. It shows the ways to break the boundaries between hardware and software layers and have better integration of computing and memory/storage units. The advances in mobile systems and memory innovations inspire the evolution of embedded system designs and have also brought us insights to solutions regarding how systems should be restructured and how computing should be done. They might also provide their feedback to real-time computing and even shape the future direction of real-time computing in various innovative ways.
