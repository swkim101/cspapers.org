For developing parallel systems composed of both hard- and software, powerful simulation tools are needed in order to decrease time-to-market. With the Parallel Simulation Framework, which was developed for designing the Parallel APPLES Processor, clock-cycle accurate simulation of parallel devices communicating with each other is possible. By adding hierarchical levels reflecting the physical structure of the simulation, a speedup is tried to be archieved.
