E-learning as the process of conveying information to the learner typically relies heavily upon textual materials. This dependency on one modal as means to attract students is not effective anymore, because it lacks to important elements that should be incorporated to get high quality results. Researcher on the other hand suggested a number of guiding principle targeted to improve capturing learners' attention. Therefore these guiding principles do not consider the entertainment as one of the dimension that helps to attract student's attention and stimulate their memory. Therefore this study with the consideration to the guidelines presented will study the affect of entertainment as new medium through four interfaces in order to explore the influence of edutainment in helping orient learner attention. User achievement and user satisfaction were measured within each game. The results showed potential effect on the user performance.
