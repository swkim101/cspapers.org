The Bucket Sort has been one of the simplest distribution sorts and the Shell Sort (presented in 1959 by Donald L. Shell) has been one of the oldest sort methods until now. Although we cannot change their complexities, we determined that some improvements on the bucket sort can be made by different implementation mechanisms. In this paper, we mixed the bucket sort and shell sort. This new approach has worked with greater performance than the standard bucket sort algorithm.
