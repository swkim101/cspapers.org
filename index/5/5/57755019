Manycores are capable of providing the computational demands required by functionally-advanced critical applications in domains such as automotive and avionics. In manycores a network-on-chip (NoC) provides access to shared caches and memories and hence concentrates most of the contention that tasks suffer, with effects on the worst-case contention delay (WCD) of packets and tasks' WCET. While several proposals minimize the impact of individual NoC parameters on WCD, e.g. mapping and routing, there are strong dependences among these NoC parameters. Hence, finding the optimal NoC configurations requires optimizing all parameters simultaneously, which represents a multidimensional optimization problem. In this paper we propose NoCo, a novel approach that combines ILP and stochastic optimization to find NoC configurations in terms of packet routing, application mapping, and arbitration weight allocation. Our results show that NoCo improves other techniques that optimize a subset of NoC parameters.
