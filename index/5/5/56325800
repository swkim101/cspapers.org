Assessing maintainability at the design level will help software designers to decide if the design of the software should be altered for reducing cost of software maintenance in later phase. This paper presents a controlled experiment carried out to investigate whether aesthetic metrics can be indicators of class and sequence diagrams maintainability and to establish maintainability models from aesthetic metrics. The experimental result indicates that aesthetic metrics can be indicators of class and sequence diagrams maintainability. Two maintainability models are constructed using two techniques: Discriminant Analysis and Decision Tree in order to find the best one. Our preliminary result shows that the accuracy of model constructed using Decision Tree is higher than that of the other one.
