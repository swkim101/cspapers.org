The success of applications that process data critically depends on the quality of the ingested data. Completeness of a data source is essential in many cases. Yet, most missing value imputation approaches suffer from severe limitations. They are almost exclusively restricted to numerical data, and they either offer only simple imputation methods or are difficult to scale and maintain in production. Here we present a robust and scalable approach to imputation that extends to tables with non-numerical values, including unstructured text data in diverse languages. Experiments on public data sets as well as data sets sampled from a large product catalog in different languages (English and Japanese) demonstrate that the proposed approach is both scalable and yields more accurate imputations than previous approaches. Training on data sets with several million rows is a matter of minutes on a single machine. With a median imputation F1 score of 0.93 across a broad selection of data sets our approach achieves on average a 23-fold improvement compared to mode imputation. While our system allows users to apply state-of-the-art deep learning models if needed, we find that often simple linear n-gram models perform on par with deep learning methods at a much lower operational cost. The proposed method learns all parameters of the entire imputation pipeline automatically in an end-to-end fashion, rendering it attractive as a generic plugin both for engineers in charge of data pipelines where data completeness is relevant, as well as for practitioners without expertise in machine learning who need to impute missing values in tables with non-numerical data.
