Nowadays, precast concrete panels are one of the most popular construction components. To safeguard the overall quality of construction projects, it is important to ensure that the dimensional quality of precast concretes conform to the design specifications. In order to achieve this, a terrestrial laser scanning (TLS)-based automated dimensional quality assessment technique has been developed by the authorâ€™s group. The scope of this paper is such that the developed dimensional quality assessment technique is further advanced so that this technique can also be applied to full-scale precast concrete panels with complex geometries. A full-scale precast slab with dimensions of 10,610 mmx1,980 mm in a precast manufacturing company is used as a test target to validate the effectiveness of the dimensional quality assessment technique. The challenges encountered during the data analysis of the full-scale test are investigated and resolved using optimized algorithms. Furthermore, comparison of the effectiveness between the conventional technique (deviation analysis) and the proposed technique is conducted. The average dimensional error for the proposed technique is 5.2 mm, while that of the conventional deviation analysis is 10.2 mm, demonstrating that the proposed technique can have high potentials in estimating and assessing the dimensional properties of the precast concrete panel.
