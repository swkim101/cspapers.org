We are delighted to welcome you to SIGMETRICS 2003. This year the conference is being held as a part of the ACM Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC 2003) in San Diego, California. FCRC is a week long (June 7-14, 2003) coordinated meeting with more than fifteen individual conferences with joint plenary talks on broad topics in computer science. This format will allow SIGMETRICS participants to interact with researchers from other areas including programming languages, algorithms, theory, and architecture.We have an excellent conference for you. This has been possible due to the hard work of many individuals. First, Program Co-Chairs Jennifer Rexford and William Sanders have done a great job in selecting program committee members and coordinating the selection of papers. The technical program is outstanding and the program committee co-chairs and the members of the program committee deserve special thanks for a well done job. Tutorial Co-Chairs Steven Low and John C. S. Lui have put together four extremely high quality tutorials. Dan Rubenstein has done a superb job of publicizing the conference. We would also like to thank Evgenia Smirni for her efforts as the Proceedings Chair.This year's conference is again augmented by a set of tutorials and workshops. We wish to thank all those who took the time to contribute to the conference by preparing tutorials. Thanks also to Mark Squillante for organizing the MAthematical performance Modeling and Analysis (MAMA) workshop, and to Jeffrey Chase, Moises Goldszmidt, Kimberly Keeton, Jeffrey Kephart, and William Tetzlaff for organizing the workshop on Algorithms and Architectures for Self-Managing Systems.
