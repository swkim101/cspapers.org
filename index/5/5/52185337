Welcome to the tech talks of SPLASH 2011! We have put together, in just three talks, a program, which will tell you about the past, the present and the future of developing software. First we hear from Jesper Richter-Reichhelm about the status of today, which is colored by the ridiculous number of users some systems of today have. Next, Dave Thomas will play the (not so farfetched) role of a grumpy old man and tell us what is wrong with the industry of today. And last, but not least, Kresten Krab Thorup will give us his vision of where things are going. Enjoy!
