P, Q, R, S and T peaks of ECG signal are fundamental and normally will be used as reference for classification and other parameters application for ECG signal. Multiple Radial Basis Function (MRBF) network is proposed in the current study for identification of these peaks for ECG signal. Amplitude, duration, pre-gradient, post-gradient and peak degree were used as inputs to the individual RBF networks with selected features. The best accuracy achieved for individual network are combined and overall accuracy of 86.53% achieved for identification of P, Q, R, S and T peaks.
