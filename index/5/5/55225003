This paper presents a method to evaluate software safety using a rough sets theory. The data about the software product and process are collected via the questionnaire. The result is the direct assessment of the software safety in terms of a single coefficient, whose goodness is analyzed using the rough sets. Java based program has been developed to help in the interactive analysis. Results from a real experiment of software safety evaluation are discussed
