There are several approaches to document requirements, from totally informal and document-oriented to formal languages/methods that may represent requirements graphically. The SysML Requirements Diagram has the advantage of being created specifically to document requirements and their relationships in a graphical manner, without being tied to a specific methodology. But the diagram still lacks some important characteristics that are fundamental to requirements engineering, such as requirements priorities and classification. In this paper, an extension to the SysML Requirements Diagram is proposed, in which new stereotypes and properties that may improve the requirements engineering process are created. The extension is part of a profile that is being created to improve the application of SysML to complex systems.
