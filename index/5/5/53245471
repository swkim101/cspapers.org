Technology binding is the process of mapping a technology independent description of a circuit into a particular technology. This paper outlines a formalism of this problem and offers a solution to the problem in terms of matching patterns, describing technology specific cells and optimizations, against a technology independent circuit represented as a directed acyclic graph. This solution is implemented in DAGON. DAGON rests on a firm algorithmic foundation, and is able to guarantee locally optimal matches against a set of over three thousand patterns. DAGON is an integral part of a synthesis system that has been found to provide industrial quality solutions to real circuit design problems.
