Microrobots are considered as promising tools for biomedical applications. However, the imaging of them becomes challenges in order to be further applied on in vivo environments. Here we report the magnetic navigation of a paramagnetic nanoparticle-based swarm using ultrasound images. The swarm can be generated using simple rotating magnetic fields, resulting in a region containing particles with a high area density. Ultrasound images of the swarm shows a periodic changing of imaging contrast. The reason for such dynamic contrast has been analyzed and experimental results are presented. Moreover, this swarm exhibits enhanced ultrasound imaging in comparison to that formed by individual nanoparticles with a low area density, and the relationship between imaging contrast and area density is testified. Furthermore, the microrobotic swarm can be navigated near a solid surface at different velocities, and the imaging contrast show negligible changes. This method allows us to localize and navigate a microrobotic swarm with enhanced ultrasound imaging indicating a promising approach for imaging of microrobots.
