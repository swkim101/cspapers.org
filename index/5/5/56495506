The 2002 International Workshop on Web Information and Data Management (WIDM'02) is the fourth in a series of workshops on Web Information and Data Management held in conjunction with the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). The objective of the workshop is to bring together researchers, industrial practitioners, and developers to study how the web information can be extracted, stored, analyzed and processed to provide useful knowledge to the end users for various advanced database applications. WIDM'02 has received sponsorship from both ACM SIGIR and ACM SIGMIS.The call for papers resulted in the submission of 53 papers from 21 countries around the world. Compared to WIDM'01, the number of paper received had increased by 50%. All papers were thoroughly reviewed by the program committee and external reviewers. The program committee accepted 12 full papers and 6 short papers for the one-day's program. The authors of these papers are from 9 countries. The twelve full papers were divided into 3 sessions: "Advanced XML Technologies and Applications", "Web Mining", and "Web Services and Performance Evaluation." The workshop would not be a success without the support from the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management (SEEM) of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The department provided both the manpower and computing resources to host the workshop web site. Song Gao, a graduate student at the department, did a wonderful job running the ConfMan paper submission and review system. We would like to express our appreciation of his assistance.
