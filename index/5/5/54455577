Task planning and scheduling techniques developed as part of a project whose goal is to control the operations of many robots in the same environment are presented. Centralized approaches allow task allocation to be improved. However, they are not appropriate for coordinating the actions of multiple mobile robots in a dynamic environment where unforeseeable events occur. Consequently, the author advocates a mixed strategy, allowing robots to make and execute individual plans as well as to connect with a central task planner and scheduler when appropriate. The author first presents individual planning techniques. Then he describes a framework allowing robots to exchange information with a central system able to optimize task allocation. >
