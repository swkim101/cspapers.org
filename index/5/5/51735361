In this article we explore a coupled design strategy for the simultaneous optimization of lumped-parameter (electrical) and continuum parameter (thermal) systems. In terms of electrical circuit response, advances in the development of wide band-gap semiconductors and the high speed transient behavior of these devices leads to challenges associated with damping or overshoot. To address such issues, traditional circuit design strategies should evolve to incorporate next generation electrical components effectively. Thus, we propose the incorporated design of circuit layout and routing in conjunction with heat spreader design as a more comprehensive means to optimize the layout of power-dense electronics. The effects of this multidisciplinary design are evaluated by analyzing the Pareto set, which was observed to shift towards the utopia point with each additional design consideration.
