In a Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack, a local, passive eavesdropper utilizes network flow information to identify which web pages a user is browsing. Previous researchers have extensively demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of WF, but only under the strong Single Page Assumption: the network flow extracted by the adversary always belongs to a single page. In other words, the WF classifier will never be asked to classify a network flow corresponding to more than one page, or part of a page. The Single Page Assumption is unrealistic because people often browse with multiple tabs. When this happens, the network flow induced by multiple tabs will overlap, and current WF attacks fail to classify correctly. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of WF with the relaxed Single Page Assumption: we can attack a client who visits more than one pages simultaneously. We propose a multi-tab website fingerprinting attack that can accurately classify multi-tab web pages if they are requested and sequentially loaded over a short period of time. In particular, we develop a new BalanceCascade-XGBoost scheme for an attacker to identify the start point of the second page such that the attacker can accurately classify and identify these multi-tab pages. By developing a new classifier, we only use a small chunk of packets, i.e., packets between the first page's start time to the second page's start time, to fingerprint website. Our experiments demonstrate that in the multi-tab scenario, WF attacks are still practically effective. We have an average TPR of 92.58% on SSH, and we can also averagely identify the page with a TPR of 64.94% on Tor. Specially, compared with previous WF classifiers, our attack achieves a significantly higher true positive rate using a restricted chunk of packets.
