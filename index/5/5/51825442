Accurate online estimation of the structure of the environment together with the pose of the robot is an important component to enable autonomous robotic applications. This paper analyses the different parameterisations used in structure from motion (SFM) problem in the context of accuracy and efficiency of the online solutions. Three point parameterisations are compared: Euclidean, inverse depth and inverse distance. At the same time two representations, global and local point coordinates are tested. Different metrics are used to compare the results, camera localisation errors, reprojection errors, execution time as well as a complete analysis on how different parameterisations affect the convergence, systemâ€™s condition number and the incremental solving are provided. The paper shows that, with the correct parameterisation, efficient globally consistent SFM is possible, which under the assumption of small, bounded number of correspondences performs in constant time in open loop.
