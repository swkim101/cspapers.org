Although TCP has widespread adoption in the Internet, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) generally use simpler UDP-based protocols. The few existing TCP implementations for sensor network operating systems do not support all of the features of TCP. We present a full-scale TCP implementation for sensor networks, called TCPlp, based on the TCP protocol logic of the FreeBSD Operating System. Our implementation demonstrates that full-scale TCP can run within the resource constraints of a modern WSN platform, and serves as a vehicle to explore the benefits of using a full TCP stack in the WSN setting. We showcase TCPlp via three applications of TCP: (1) reliable data collection in the context of an application, (2) an interactive configuration/debug shell, and (3) a mote-based web server.
