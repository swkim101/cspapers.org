It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 9th ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security - ASIACCS '14, which will be held in Kyoto, Japan, June 3-6, 2014. The inaugural ASIACCS was held in Taipei (2006). Since then ASIACCS have been held in Singapore (2007), Tokyo (2008), Sydney (2009), Beijing (2010), Hong Kong (2011), Seoul (2012), and Hangzhou (2013). 
 
ASIACCS is a major international forum for information security researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore and exchange the newest cyber security ideas, breakthroughs, findings, techniques, tools, and experiences. We welcome submissions from academia, government, and industry presenting novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of computer and network security. 
 
The conference received a record of 255 paper submissions, and accepted 42 regular papers and 8 short papers for presentation at the conference. The final versions of the accepted papers, which the authors finalized on the basis of comments from the reviewers, were included in the proceedings. Each accepted paper was carefully reviewed by at least three program committee members on the basis of its significance, novelty, and technical quality. The reviewing process was double-blind. It was followed by a web-based discussion. Based on the comments and scores given by reviewers, the final decisions on acceptance were made. 
 
This year we have an excellent and diverse conference agenda with sessions on software security, network security, cryptography, and various applications of cryptography, among others. Unique papers on various kinds of authentication methods are mixed with papers on new advances on important research problems, such as Android security. In addition, we also encourage attendees to attend the keynote: Fighting malicious code - An eternal struggle, Christopher Kruegel of UC Santa Barbara
