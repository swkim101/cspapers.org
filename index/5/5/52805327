In the classic EKF SLAM framework, the vision based approaches raise the problem of landmark initialization. As a single observation is not enough to compute a gaussian state estimate, a special initialisation algorithm must be developed. This video presents our approach with a step by step simulation, then a more complex simulation is proposed. The last part gathers results obtained on real data.
