This paper describes a generic platform for vision based navigation which is partially inspired by the biological principles that underlie insect vision and navigation. The system developed uses a CMOS sensor that is directly interfaced with a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), to calculate an optical flow field in real time, and control an unmanned vehicle. The imaging system also provides useful information about the vehicleâ€Ÿs surroundings, enabling the construction of terrain maps.
