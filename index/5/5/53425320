The deluge of Android apps from third-party developers calls for sophisticated security testing and analysis techniques to inspect suspicious apps without accessing their source code. Code coverage is an important metric used in these techniques to evaluate their effectiveness, and even as a fitness function to help achieving better results in evolutionary and fuzzy approaches. Yet, so far there are no reliable tools for measuring fine-grained bytecode coverage of Android apps. In this work we present ACVTool that instruments Android apps and measures the smali code coverage at the level of classes, methods, and instructions.
