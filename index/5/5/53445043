Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) allows integration of existing legacy systems, packaged software (as ERP systems), and new developed systems. Starting from a previously proposed idea, in this paper the authors address the problem to collect input data for the model. The problem is approached using the Klenowâ€™s model, that aims at evaluating the efficiency improvement capability in using a technology. Here is carried on the analysis of a typical EAI architecture with the Goal Question Metrics (GQM) paradigm for the individualization of the questions. Appling the first two steps of GQM the authors obtained a list of question whose answer can help to assess the degree of adequacy of an EAI solution and the extent on which it can benefit from the learning curve.
