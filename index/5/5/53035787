User Identification with Spatio-Temporal awareness has been attracting much attention from academia. The existing methods not only handle temporal and spatial data separately but also do not consider conflictive check-in records. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel approach that consists of three parts. 1) Measure the similarity of users with a kernel density estimation based method, which handles the spatial and temporal data together; 2) Assign weights to check-in records following the idea of TFIDF, which highlights the discriminative check-in records; 3) Penalize the similarity of users based on the number of conflictive check-in records. The pair-wise users with similarity higher than a predefined threshold are considered to belong to the same individual. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.
