For enterprises, customer relationships have been commonly recognized as a critical factor to succeed their business. Effective customer relationships could help enterprises deliver services/products to customers based on their needs, preferences, or past transactions. This model however emphasizes on the use of customer information for benefiting enterprises; customers in contrast receive less information from enterprises. To address this issue, a new paradigm, namely Consumer Support Systems (CSS) is initiated to support effective information provision for customers to help on their decision making. In this paper, we present an architecture for the construction of such a new CSS paradigm. The architecture starts from the identification of CSS characteristics, through the recognition of architectural components that support the realization of these issues, and finally ends with the specification of collaborations among architectural components to realize these issues. The architecture is modeled by UML notations and illustrated by an exemplified CSS for book publishing.
