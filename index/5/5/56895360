Network traffic classification, which has numerous applications from security to billing and network provisioning, has become a cornerstone of today's computer networks. Previous studies have developed traffic classification techniques using classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning methods when large quantities of labeled data are available. However, capturing large labeled datasets is a cumbersome and time-consuming process. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach that obviates the need for large labeled datasets. We first pre-train a model on a large unlabeled dataset where the input is the time series features of a few sampled packets. Then the learned weights are transferred to a new model that is re-trained on a small labeled dataset. We show that our semi-supervised approach achieves almost the same accuracy as a fully-supervised method with a large labeled dataset, though we use only 20 samples per class. In tests based on a dataset generated from the more challenging QUIC protocol, our approach yields 98% accuracy. To show its efficacy, we also test our approach on two public datasets. Moreover, we study three different sampling techniques and demonstrate that sampling packets from an arbitrary portion of a flow is sufficient for classification.
