Robot learning by demonstration gives robots the ability to learn tasks which they have not been programmed to do before. The paradigm allows robots to work in a greater range of real-world applications in our daily life. However, this paradigm has traditionally been applied to learn tasks from a single demonstration modality. This restricts the approach to be scaled to learn and execute a series of tasks in a real-life environment. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal learning approach using DMP+ with linear decay integrated in a dialogue system with speech and ontology for the robot to learn seamlessly through natural interaction modalities (like an apprentice) while learning or re-learning is done on the fly to allow partial updates to a learned task to reduce potential user fatigue and operational downtime in teaching. The performance of new DMP+ with linear decay system is statistically benchmarked against state-of-the-art DMP implementations. A gluing demonstration is also conducted to show how the system provides seamless learning of multiple tasks in a flexible manufacturing set-up.
