In the light of the problems in reliability modeling and analyzing for CBS (Component-Based Software), occurring time-invariant, less attention to debugging process, absence of considering differences in the components, a CBS SRGM (Software Reliability Growth Model) is presented. In terms of characters of different components, components are divided into critical and non-critical component sets. An imperfect debugging model considering fault correction probability and introducing new fault is used to describe critical component, and G-O model is applied to non-critical component. The formulation of the cumulative number of faults detected in CBS is derived. The proposed CBS SRGM can appropriately describe real testing process. Numerical examples verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and it outperforms other models. Keywords-software reliability; Component-Based Software; software testing; SRGM
