Robotic technology has transformed manufacturing

industry ever since the first industrial robot was put

in use in the beginning of the 60s. The challenge

of developing flexible solutions where production

lines can be quickly re-planned, adapted and structured

for new or slightly changed products is still

an important open problem. Industrial robots today

are still largely preprogrammed for their tasks,

not able to detect errors in their own performance

or to robustly interact with a complex environment

and a human worker. The challenges are even more

serious when it comes to various types of service

robots. Full robot autonomy, including natural interaction,

learning from and with human, safe and

flexible performance for challenging tasks in unstructured

environments will remain out of reach

for the foreseeable future. In the envisioned future

factory setups, home and office environments,

humans and robots will share the same workspace

and perform different object manipulation tasks in

a collaborative manner. We discuss some of the

major challenges of developing such systems and

provide examples of the current state of the art.
