Recently, the quest to reduce energy consumption in digital systems has been the subject of a number of ongoing studies. One of the most researched focus points is “Approximate Computing“. Approximate computing is a new computing paradigm in both hardware and software designs that aim to achieve energy-efficient digital systems by applying relaxations to the designs and allowing them to have errors within an acceptable range. Although approximate computing is a broad and current interest of many researchers all over the world, the main question, “In which section of a program or a circuit approximations can be applied¿‘ has not been well answered yet. There exist some statistical works that tried to answer that question using trial-and-error approaches. This paper proposes a new approach to answer the above-mentioned question by using symbolic execution to eliminate the data-dependency and the time wastage of existing methods. Experiments on the proposed approach has shown up to 85%, in addition to eliminating data dependency and the need of the approximate version of the application.
