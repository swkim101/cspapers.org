Real-time task scheduling for wireless networked control systems provides guarantees for the quality of service. This paper introduces a new model for joint network and computing resource scheduling (JNCRS) in real-time wireless networked control systems. This new end-to-end real-time task model considers a strict execution order of segments including the sensing, the computing and the actuating segment based on the control loop of WNCSs. The general JNCRS problem is proved to be a NP-hard problem. After dividing the JNCRS problem into four subproblems, we propose a polynomial-time optimal algorithm to solve the first subproblem where each segment has unit execution time, by checking the intervals with 100% network resource utilization and modify the deadlines of tasks. To solve the second subproblem where the computing segment is larger than one unit execution time, we define the new timing parameters of each network segment by taking into account the scheduling of the computing segments. We propose a polynomial-time optimal algorithm to check the intervals with the network resource utilization larger than or equal to 100% and modify the timing parameters of tasks based on these intervals.
