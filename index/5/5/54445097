ARM has become the leading processor architecture for mobile and IoT devices, while it has recently started claiming a bigger slice of the server market pie as well. As such, it will not be long before malware more regularly target the ARM architecture. Therefore, the stealthy operation of Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) is an obligation to successfully analyze and proactively mitigate this growing threat. Stealthy VMI has proven itself perfectly suitable for malware analysis on Intel's architecture, yet, it often lacks the foundation required to be equally effective on ARM.
