In this work we present a novel approach for multi-sensor calibration that significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art. We introduce a new spherical calibration target which has major benefits over existing targets. Those are subresolution detection accuracy in both camera and depth sensor, view invariance and applicability to a wider range of sensor setups than current approaches. With our method a single person achieves high quality calibration in less than a minute. No preparations for setting up the environment for calibration is needed. Our method is fast, easy to use and fully automatic. We evaluate our method in simulation and show high accuracy with an error of less than 3mm in translation and 0.1 0 in rotation on real data.
