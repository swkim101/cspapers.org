In this paper, we propose methods for walking on a steep slope using a rope by a humanoid robot. There are two difficulties for walking on a steep slope without a rope. First, range of motion of ankle joints get limited. Second, feet of a robot slip on a steep slope. For these problems, using a rope is effective solution because the robot can receive enough friction force from the slope and walk on a steep slope by pulling a rope with proper tension. In addition, the robot pulling a rope on a slope can relax limitations of ankle joints. Therefore, we propose methods to determine tension of a grasped rope by solving a linear least-square problem considering deformability of a rope. With these methods, a life-size humanoid robot HRP-2 could walk on a steep slope which angle is 40 degree.
