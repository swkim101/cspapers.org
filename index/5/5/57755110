This paper addresses the source localization problem of an acoustic fish-tag using the Time-of-Arrival measurement of an acoustic signal, transmitted by the fish-tag. The Time-of-Arrival measurements denote the pseudo-range information between the acoustic receiver and the fish-tag, except that the Time-of-Transmission of the acoustic signal is unknown. Starting with the pseudo-range measurement equation, a globally valid quasi-linear time-varying measurement model is presented that is independent of the Time-of-Transmission of the acoustic signal. Using this measurement model, an Uniformly Globally Asymptotically Stable (UGAS), three stage estimation strategy (eXogenous Kalman Filter) is designed to estimate the position of an acoustic fish-tag and evaluated against a benchmark Extended Kalman Filter based estimator. The efficacy of the developed estimation method is demonstrated experimentally, in presence of intermittent observations using an array of receivers mounted on three Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs).
