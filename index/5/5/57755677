We present a novel manufacturing process for creating monolithic, multi-chambered inflatable structures including both soft and rigid components. Specifically, our process involves stacking layers of textiles or plastics and thermal adhesive film, then bonding the structure with a heat press or in an oven. Several different ways of arranging textiles and thermal adhesive film in order to achieve airtight structures are presented. Since this process only uses materials that bend, but do not stretch, it permits the easy inclusion of rigid structures such as circuit boards, plates that constrain inflatable chambers to bend in specified locations, and rigid pieces that enable sections of a robot to be connected in a modular fashion. Additionally, the process permits folding layers before their assembly, leading to more complex geometries. We present three different possible seam types, and enumerate the different types of corners that can be constructed without leaking. We present measurements of the ability of these structures to support pressure and measurements of the strength of bonds between textiles and other materials. Finally, we present two examples of robots constructed using this manufacturing method, including a hybrid soft/rigid robotic arm and a soft robot that can roll along the ground.
