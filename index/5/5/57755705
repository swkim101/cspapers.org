Absolute orientation estimation is the determination of the similarity transformation between two sets of corresponding $\pmb{3}\mathbf{D}$ points, a task arising frequently in computer vision and robotics. We have recently proposed an absolute orientation algorithm based on the Fast Optimal Attitude Matrix (FOAM) algorithm from astronautics and demonstrated that it is more efficient computationally compared to widely-used approaches involving costly eigen- and singular-value matrix decompositions. In this work, we compare our FOAM-based solution with several more algorithms derived from attitude estimation techniques and show that further computational savings are possible by employing an algorithm grounded on the Optimal Linear Attitude Estimator (OLAE) method.
