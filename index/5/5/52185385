This was our initial attempt to organize a premier forum to address web-based application and Apps’ design and development in the smart city context, which is a rapidly emerging domain and suggests a steadily evolving dominant market. Applications of these types are crucial, since they refer to all the dimensions of common smart city frameworks: economy, mobility, environment, living, people and governance while no particular standards define rules for corresponding application development. The mission of the symposium is to share the theoretical context, the existing state and current issues and trends with regard to developments for future cities’ applications (web-based and Apps). Same types of applications (web-based applications and apps) for instance, aim to deliver different visions and ambitions, which come even from cities of the same country (i.e., in U.K. Bristol, Birmingham, Glasgow or in China where about 500 different smart cities are being built from scratch), while this issue is more challenging at a supranational level (European Union). Similar challenges are crucial for web-based end-to-end smart city management applications too, which are being developed by different vendors.
