The player scores points by rolling specific combinations of five 6-sided dice. The game consists of 13 rounds. In each round, the player rolls the 5 dice (up to 3 times) and then scores the roll in one of 13 categories. In the first 6 categories, the goal is to get as many 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s as possible, while the other categories are related to special combinations such as: three of a kind, four of a kind, full house, small straight, large straight, chance, and Yahtzee. A Yahtzee is rolled when all five dice show the same face. Each category can be scored only once. After 3rd roll, the player must choose his score; if he cannot enter a score, he must select a zero. If the sum of points scored in the first 6 categories is greater than 62, the player earns a bonus of 35 points. The object of the game is to maximize the total score. The game ends once all 13 categories have been scored. In the simplified version of Yahtzee we propose as a benchmark, the player cannot choose the dice to re-roll, while, in the original version, the player must throw all the dice on its first turn of each round, but he can select the dice to re-roll on its second and third turns. Therefore, the action space is reduced to 14 possible actions: the learner can choose either to fill one of the 13 categories with the obtained result, or reroll the dice. Furthermore, we have removed the possibility to obtain the mentioned bonus. We propose a representation consisting of 14 variables. One is related to the number of rolls performed in the current round; the other 13 are
