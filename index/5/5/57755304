In this paper we present a new robotic control approach inspired in the animal nervous system control. The system implements the binomial Brain-Peripheral Nervous System (CNS-PNS) combining the use of microprocessors as the high level control, or brain, and FPGAs as the low level control, or nervous system. Thanks to the new open source tools for FPGAs, we are able to apply them in the field of robotics in new ways that were impossible before. In this paper, we will demonstrate that our approach is not only able to control the movements of robots using digital circuits built inside an FPGA, but is also capable of generating, synthesizing and uploading them inside the FPGA in real time and on demand.
