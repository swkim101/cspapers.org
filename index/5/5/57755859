Human-Robot shared workspace is a dynamic and unstructured environment. In such environment, pre-programmed robot paths might cause collisions or production disruptions. In order to solve this problem, motion planning framework has been proposed that adapts the robot's movement (path and speed)according to the human movement or any other dynamic obstacles in real time. Firstly, it defines the safety distance between robot and human or other obstacles. During run-time the 3D-Smart-Sensors capture the current position of human and other dynamic/static obstacles in human-robot shared workspace. The proposed framework plans and optimizes collision free robot trajectories with consideration for safety distance, path length and executing time. Once a new optimal trajectory is found, the framework controls the robot to adjust its movement paths. Moreover, the proposed framework can adjust the robot velocity based on the 3D-Zone Model of human-robot shared workspace. Therefore, the robot can reach its goal quickly and safely in a dynamic and unstructured environment.
