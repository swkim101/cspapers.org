A provably stable decentralized control scheme is proposed to allow multiple conventional quadcopters carry a cable-suspended payload. The method exploits a fundamental energetic passivity property of the combined drones, cables, and payload system to stably move the payload from its origin to destination. This is achieved without making any assumption about the status of the cables tension during the flight, and any measurement from the payload. The controller is decentralized in the sense that inter-drone communication of feedback measurements is not required. Motion stability is demonstrated via a Lyapunov analysis. The proposed controller is successfully implemented on a three-drone payload transport system in an indoor environment, using measurement from an optical tracking systems and the drones on-board IMUs.
