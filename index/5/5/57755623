Standing on a beam is a challenging motor skill that requires the regulation of upright balance and stability. In this paper, we analyzed the behavior of humans balancing on a narrow beam without footwear. The results revealed high anti-correlation between lumped upper- and lower-body angular momentum. Despite differences in gross measures of balance, interlimb coordination was consistent between the novice and expert subjects, suggesting that both performances could be described with the same balance controller. By simulating a double inverted pendulum model utilizing different balancing controllers described in the robotics literature, we identified that the whole behavior observed from humans standing on a beam was best replicated with controllers that predominantly utilized hip actuation.
