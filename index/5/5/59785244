This paper presents a fuzzy multiple criteria group decision making (FMCGDM) problem with the Technique for Order Performance by Similarity ti Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) based on the concept of positive and negative ideal solution. Triangular fuzzy numbers (TEN) among decision making process is used to evaluate the weighted different alternatives versus criteria and a fuzzy group weight is made by different experts. Various decision makers' attitudes categorized into optimistic and pessimistic judgements are introduced. Eventually, a comparison between traditional fuzzy TOPSIS method and our new and simple fuzzy TOPSIS method and defuzzified TFN is also done. Different ranking for preferred material handling devices with our approach shows the efficiency of this one.
