For each k ≤ 4, we give τ k > 0 such that a random k-CNF formula F with n variables and ⌊r k n⌋ clauses is satisfiable with high probability, but ORDERED-DLL takes exponential time on F with uniformly positive probability. Using results of [2], this can be strengthened to a high probability result for certain natural backtracking schemes and extended to many other DPLL algorithms.
