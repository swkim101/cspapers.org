This paper presents a hierarchical path planner consisting of two stages: a global planner that uses workspace information to create collision-free paths for the robot end-effector to follow, and multiple local planners running in parallel that verify the paths in the configuration space by expanding a task-space rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT). We demonstrate the practicality of our approach by comparing it with state-of-the-art planners in several challenging path planning problems. While using a single tree, our planner outperforms other single tree approaches in task-space or configuration space (C-space), while its performance and robustness are comparable to or better than that of parallelized bidirectional C-space planners.
