This paper describes the framework of nonlinear finite element model validation for vehicle crash simulation. Several methods were developed to quantify transient time-domain data (functional data). The concept of correlation index was proposed to determine the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of the intended uses of the model. The methodologies developed in this paper can also be used for CAE model updating, parameter tuning, and model calibration.Copyright Â© 2003 by ASME
