This work presents a novel method for estimating online the torques at the ankle, knee and hip of a user with the goal of generating reference signals for torque controlled lower limb exoskeletons. In particular, this approach attempts to address difficulties arising in real life scenarios when noncyclic locomotion activity, unexpected terrain or unpredicted interactions with the surroundings occur. An advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require any information on the user's upper body (i.e. pose, weight and center of mass location)or on any interaction of the user's upper body with the environment (i.e. payload handling or pushing and pulling task). By monitoring the interaction of the user's feet with the ground through a novel sensorized shoe sensing system, the method applies an inverse static analysis on the user's lower limbs to estimate in real time the torque at each leg joint. The system is fully wearable, ergonomic and portable and uses a reduced number of body posture sensors. The design of the sensorized shoes permits plantar flexion, while measuring the toe and heel orientation and the interaction loads. This allows walking on irregular terrains and natural feet postures in different tasks. Trials were performed to validate the proposed approach under different tasks and terrains. Finally, the knee torques estimated online by the proposed strategy were used as reference signals to drive the iT-Knee Bipedal System in an assistive task.
