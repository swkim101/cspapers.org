BOOTSTRAP VOTING EXPERTS (BVE) is an extension to the VOTING EXPERTS algorithm for unsupervised chunking of sequences. BVE generates a series of segmentations, each of which incorporates knowledge gained from the previous segmentation. We show that this method of bootstrapping improves the performance of VOTING EXPERTS in a variety of unsupervised word segmentation scenarios, and generally improves both precision and recall of the algorithm. We also show that Minimum Description Length (MDL) can be used to choose nearly optimal parameters for VOTING EXPERTS in an unsupervised manner.
