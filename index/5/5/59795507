We can distinguish two kinds of causal rules in the situation calculus the dynamic ones that are normally used to capture the e ects of ac tions and the static ones that are used to cap ture causal dependencies among uents within a single situation While the former in the form of e ect axioms come naturally with or even can be said to be the trademark of the situation calculus the latter are more recent additions In this paper we propose a system atic transformation of static causal rules to dy namic ones by using a special natural action and show some relationships between these two types of causal rules using this transformation
