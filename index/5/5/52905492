Architectural research has made significant contributions to the prospects for near-term quantum computation by leveraging techniques such as mapping, scheduling, and parallelism. In this work, we systematically explore two additional techniques that can reduce space (ancillae) and time (circuit depth) requirements by accessing computational resources that are traditionally ignored. The first technique is the use of d-level qudits in favor of the conventional two-level qubit (quantum bit) abstraction. The second technique is the exploitation of dirty ancillae: idle qubits (or qudits) from other parts of computation which can be borrowed with the promise that they will be restored to their original states. We introduce new results for more efficient quantum circuits, particularly for multiply-controlled unitary gates, which are critical for many quantum algorithms. Our ongoing work includes the development of an error model that accounts for the cost of using qudits. We are also building a software framework for synthesizing logic circuits that exploit qudits and dirty ancillae, with the goal of maximizing the amount of useful computation possible.
