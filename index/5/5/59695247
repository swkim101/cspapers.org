Situated communication technologies in emergencies are subject to decay or fail because of their inadequate services. With the advances in tiny-sensor technologies and ubiquity of smart phones, public awareness on urgent situations can be raised in more efficient and distributed ways. We center on opportunistic data dissemination schemes where the objective is to provide an operability among sensing, communication, and data spread. Such mobile networks do not require end-to-end routes or servers; however connectivity and scalability issues may last forever without determinism. We have started implementing context-aware services to understand the mobile phone carriersâ€™ characteristics and routines in order to increase the quality of service in our collaboration and dissemination objectives. We are currently working on real implementation of mobile ad hoc networks and routing algorithms. Besides, we simulate an urban city network with different scenarios and objectives to analyze the open research challenges.
