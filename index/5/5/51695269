Most content providers are interested in providing good video delivery QoE for all users, not just on average. State-of-the-art ABR algorithms like BOLA and MPC rely on parameters that are sensitive to network conditions, so may perform poorly for some users and/or videos. In this paper, we propose a technique called Oboe to auto-tune these parameters to different network conditions. Oboe pre-computes, for a given ABR algorithm, the best possible parameters for different network conditions, then dynamically adapts the parameters at run-time for the current network conditions. Using testbed experiments, we show that Oboe significantly improves BOLA, MPC, and a commercially deployed ABR. Oboe also betters a recently proposed reinforcement learning based ABR, Pensieve, by 24% on average on a composite QoE metric, in part because it is able to better specialize ABR behavior across different network states.
