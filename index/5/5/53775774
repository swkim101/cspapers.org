An improved resistor element especially suitable for use in spark plugs is disclosed. The resistor element is prepared from a stannic oxide-barium, calcium or strontium borate composition doped with from 1 to 18 percent tantalum pentoxide or 1/2 to 5 percent niobium pentoxide based on the total batch weight. A method for producing the element is also disclosed.
