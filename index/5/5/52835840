Wireless personal communication has existed for about a quarter century. In the 1980's analog FDMA served a small mostly North American base of wireless telephony users. The 1990's witnessed the start of widespread worldwide digital telephony and limited data service, categorized as 2nd Generation, employing two conflicting technologies, TDMA and CDMA. The first decade of the new century brought full wireless data and Internet connectivity with two competing 3rd Generation CDMA implementations: CDMA2000 and WCDMA. For the second decade beginning in 2010, early indications point to convergence upon a single 4th Generation high speed data technology, OFDMA, generally referred to as Mobile WiMax for which a standard 802.16e has recently been adopted. After describing this historical evolution, we shall address the challenges and opportunities of both 3rd and 4th Generation Wireless Broadband service.
