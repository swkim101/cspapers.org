This paper proposes an approach to learn robust behavior representations in online platforms by addressing the challenges of user behavior skew and sparse participation. Latent behavior models are important in a wide variety of applications: recommender systems; prediction; user profiling; community characterization. Our framework is the first to jointly address skew and sparsity across graphical behavior models. We propose a generalizable bayesian approach to partition users in the presence of skew while simultaneously learning latent behavior profiles over these partitions to address user-level sparsity. Our behavior profiles incorporate the temporal activity and links between participants, although the proposed framework is flexible to introduce other definitions of participant behavior. Our approach explicitly discounts frequent behaviors and learns variable size partitions capturing diverse behavior trends. The partitioning approach is data-driven with no rigid assumptions, adapting to varying degrees of skew and sparsity. A qualitative analysis indicates our ability to discover niche and informative user groups on large online platforms. Results on User Characterization (+6-22% AUC); Content Recommendation (+6-43% AUC) and Future Activity Prediction (+12-25% RMSE) indicate significant gains over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, user cluster quality is validated with magnified gains in the characterization of users with sparse activity.
