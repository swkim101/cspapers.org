This tutorial has four aims: (1) Providing the current comparative works on different outlier detectors, and analysing the strengths and weaknesses of these works and their recommendations. (2) Presenting non-obvious applications of outlier detectors. This provides examples of how outlier detectors are used in areas which are not normally considered to be the domains of outlier detection. (3) Inviting the research community to explore future research directions, in terms of both comparative study and outlier detection in general. (4) Giving an advice on the factors to consider when choosing an outlier detector, and strengths and weaknesses of some "top" recommended algorithms based on the current understanding in the literature.
