It is our great pleasure to welcome you to PRESTO'08 -- the workshop on Programmable Routers for Extensible Services of Tomorrow. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the networking research community in re-architecting the distribution of functions in an IP network. Also, researchers and practitioners in industry have been exploring the notion of open routers, which allows new functionality to be easily added into routers, as well as exploring router virtualization as a way to support a diverse set of applications and users. These efforts span the range from building open-source routing software, to making routers third-party-developer friendly by exposing router APIs, as recent industry announcements indicate. Programmable network elements hold the promise of accelerating innovation and service deployment. At the same time programmability could exacerbate already challenging network management tasks. The mission of this workshop is to foster the exchange of ideas between researchers and industry practitioners with a goal of driving service innovation in IP networks using novel extensible router architectures. 
 
The call for papers attracted 26 submissions from Europe, Japan, China, and the United States. The program committee accepted 12 papers that cover a variety of topics including programmable packet processing, virtualization, next generation data-center architectures, software routers and new network services. In addition, the program includes a mini-panel accompanying each session aimed at stimulating discussion and at providing an industry perspective. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers interested in programmable router architectures.
