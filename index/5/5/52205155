The availability of reliable and trustworthy models for agrifood processes is crucial to evaluate and predict the environmental impact of the process and the final quality of the product. Experiments can be performed on models to optimise their features, and, if successful, the results can be integrated into the real-world. In this context, robust and user friendly interfaces that facilitate expert knowledge integration into existing models, can help steer and optimise both the model and the model-building process itself. This in turn may help improve the eco-design of sustainable agrifood processes. In this paper, we reflect upon our previous work and highlight existing challenges in building interactive modelling tools for sustainable food systems.
