The advancement of molecular profiling techniques 
fuels biomedical research with a deluge of data. To facilitate 
data sharing, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health 
established the Beacon system, a search engine designed to help 
researchers find datasets of interest. While the current Beacon 
system only supports genomic data, other types of biomedical 
data, such as DNA methylation, are also essential for advancing 
our understanding in the field. In this paper, we propose the first 
Beacon system for DNA methylation data sharing: MBeacon. As 
the current genomic Beacon is vulnerable to privacy attacks, such 
as membership inference, and DNA methylation data is highly 
sensitive, we take a privacy-by-design approach to construct 
MBeacon. 
First, we demonstrate the privacy threat, by proposing a 
membership inference attack tailored specifically to unprotected 
methylation Beacons. Our experimental results show that 100 
queries are sufficient to achieve a successful attack with AUC 
(area under the ROC curve) above 0.9. To remedy this situation, 
we propose a novel differential privacy mechanism, namely SVT2 
, 
which is the core component of MBeacon. Extensive experiments 
over multiple datasets show that SVT2 
can successfully mitigate 
membership privacy risks without significantly harming utility. 
We further implement a fully functional prototype of MBeacon 
which we make available to the research community
