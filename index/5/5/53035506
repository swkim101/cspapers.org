One of the most challenging issues in the era of Big Data is the Variety of the data. In general, there are two solutions to directly manage multi-model data currently: a single integrated multi-model database system or a tightly-integrated middleware over multiple single-model data stores. In this tutorial, we review and compare these two approaches giving insights on their advantages, trade-offs, and research opportunities. In particular, we dive into four key aspects of technology for both types of systems, namely (1) theoretical foundation of multi-model data management, (2) storage strategies for multi-model data, (3) query languages across models, and (4) query evaluation and its optimization. We provide a comparison of performance for the two approaches and discuss related open problems and remaining challenges.
