We present an energy-efficient real-time scheduling algorithm called the Resource-constrained Energy-Efficient Utility Accrual Algorithm (or ReUA). ReUA considers an application model where activities are subject to time/utility function-time constraints, resource dependencies including mutual exclusion constraints, and statistical performance requirements including probabilistically satisfied, activity (timeliness) utility bounds. Further, ReUA targets mobile embedded systems where system-level energy consumption is a major concern. For such a model, we consider the scheduling objectives of (1) satisfying statistical performance requirements, and (2) maximizing system-level energy efficiency, while respecting resource dependencies. Since the problem is NP-hard, ReUA allocates resources using statistical properties of application cycle demands and heuristically computes schedules with a polynomial-time cost. We analytically establish several timeliness and non-timeliness properties of the algorithm. Further, our simulation experiments illustrate ReUA's effectiveness.
