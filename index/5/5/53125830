The results of this paper provide an Efficient Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (EPTAS) for approximating the genus (and non-orientable genus) of dense graphs. The running time of the algorithm is quadratic. Moreover, we extend the algorithm to output an embedding (rotation system), whose genus is arbitrarily close to the minimum genus. This second algorithm is an Efficient Polynomial-time Randomized Approximation Scheme (EPRAS) and the expected running time is also quadratic.
