It is our pleasure to welcome you to the ACM SIGPLAN Fourth Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security (PLAS 2009). 
 
The call for papers attracted 19 submissions: 15 full-length papers, and 4 formal short papers. Authors could choose to submit full-length papers, formal short papers, or informal short papers (which would not be included in the proceedings, and would not preclude publication in other conference venues or journals). Authors could choose to submit their work anonymously; one submission did so. 
 
Each submission received at least three reviews. All reviews were made available to all program committee members, and the final decision on which papers to accept was made after a three day on-line program committee meeting. Eight long papers and three short ones will appear in the proceedings and be presented at the Workshop.
