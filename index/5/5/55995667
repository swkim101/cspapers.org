This article summarized the performance of knowledge diffusion on community network by looking level of final knowledge as an evaluation index of the whole knowledge network based on agent's absorptive ability and diffused ability. We construct a knowledge diffusion model and simulate the process of knowledge diffusion, theoretic analyses and simulation results indicate that the average knowledge level increases as the enhance of absorptive ability when keeping community connections constant. The experimental outcomes told us low diffused ability will depress the final research level.
