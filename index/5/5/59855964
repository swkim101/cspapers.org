The 12th ACM International Symposium on Geographic Information Systems (Arlington, VA, USA, November 12-13, 2004) continues the series of symposia/workshops that started in 1993 with the aim of bringing together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners carrying out research and development in novel systems based on geo-spatial data and knowledge, and fostering interdisciplinary discussions and research in all aspects of geographic information systems. 
 
In response to the call for papers, the program committee received 90 submissions, of which 30 were selected for presentation and included in these proceedings. The increasing number of submissions over previous years and the high quality of the submissions indicates the continued interest in and health of the field. The accepted papers cover a wide range of topics, including spatio-temporal data representation, query processing, data mining, computational geometry, image analysis, mobile and Web applications.
