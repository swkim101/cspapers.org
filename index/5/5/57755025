This paper proposes the implementation of an impedance controller on the ankle level of COMAN+, a robot with parallel kinematics ankles actuated by a dual four-bar mechanism. The main contribution of the work is a realization of said control scheme that grants a less abrupt and safer robot response in case of system failures, that would cause the local joint torque controllers to lose their torque reference inputs. In particular, we propose a semi-centralized impedance control implementation which eliminates the instability of the pure joint torque control schemes used in the classical fully centralized methods when torque reference interruptions occur. Finally, we present experimental results, proving the effectiveness of our method and demonstrating how it ensures a safer behaviour compared to a fully centralized impedance control implementation when the communication to the ankle joints is interrupted. This paper is a follow-up work of [1], which presented and analyzed the parallel kinematics ankles.
