We introduce a new family negotiation algorithms for complex domains with a large space of possible solutions, non-linear utility functions, limited time and many agents. This family of algorithms applies a Branch & Bound search tree to search for deals that can be proposed to other agents. We test it on two test cases: the Negotiating Salesmen Problem and the strategic board game Diplomacy.
