Information Systems researchers and technologists have built and investigated Decision Support Systems (DSS) for more than 35 years. This paper chronicles and explores the developments in DSS beginning with building model-oriented DSS in the late 1960s, theory developments in the 1970s, and the implementation of financial planning systems and Group DSS in the early and mid 80s. Then it documents the origins of Executive Information Systems, OLAP and Business Intelligence. Finally, the discussion ends with the implementation of Web-based DSS in the mid-1990s.
