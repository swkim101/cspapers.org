This paper describes how a reduced colored Petri net modeling approach can be used to represent faults and recovery action when designing embedded systems, control systems, real time hardware and other systems. The idea of the reduced CPN is to represent errors using complex tokens based on sets to store error information. A comprehensive example of a computerized fuel control system for a gas/combustion turbine is used to illustrate this methodology. Results and conclusions are given.
