In this Paper (U)CML -- (Unified) Compatibility Modeling Language -- is introduced, which was developed to model compatibility aspects in systems. In (U)CML it is possible, to model systems (or parts of systems) including the interfaces of the parts of the systems. The interfaces of the components are tested against the corresponding interfaces of the surrounding components. This is useful for detecting compatibility issues. For example, when exchanging a component with a newer one, the component is tested for compatibility with the rest of the system. The following paper will give a short overview of the term "compatibility" and the basic concepts and elements of (U)CML.
