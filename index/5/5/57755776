As simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques have flourished with the advent of 3D Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, accurate 3D maps are readily available. Many researchers turn their attention to localization in a previously acquired 3D map. In this paper, we propose a novel and lightweight camera-only visual positioning algorithm that involves localization within prior 3D LiDAR maps. We aim to achieve the consumer level global positioning system (GPS) accuracy using vision within the urban environment, where GPS signal is unreliable. Via exploiting a stereo camera, depth from the stereo disparity map is matched with 3D LiDAR maps. A full six degree of freedom (DOF) camera pose is estimated via minimizing depth residual. Powered by visual tracking that provides a good initial guess for the localization, the proposed depth residual is successfully applied for camera pose estimation. Our method runs online, as the average localization error is comparable to ones resulting from state-of-the-art approaches. We validate the proposed method as a stand-alone localizer using KITTI dataset and as a module in the SLAM framework using our own dataset.
