This paper addresses the problem ofmulti-instance entity typing from corpus. Current approaches mainly rely on the structured features (\textitattributes, attribute-value pairs andtags ) of the entities. However, their effectiveness is largely dependent on the completeness of structured features, which unfortunately is not guaranteed in KBs. In this paper, we therefore propose to use the text corpus of an entity to infer its types, and propose a multi-instance method to tackle this problem. We take each mention of an entity in KBs as an instance of the entity, and learn the types of these entities from multiple instances. Specifically, we first use an end-to-end neural network model to type each instance of an entity, and then use an integer linear programming (ILP) method to aggregate the predicted type results from multiple instances. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.
