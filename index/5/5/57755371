Recently, self-supervised approach is common for robot grasping. Although this approach improves success rate, it requires a long time to execute a number of grasp trials, and single-arm grasping is only considered. However, robots can grasp more various objects with two arms, and dual-arm robots such as humanoid robots are expected to execute dual-arm manipulation and overcome the single-arm limitation. In this paper, we introduce dual-arm grasping as another possible strategy and propose a multi-stage learning method for selective dual-arm grasping using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)for grasping point prediction and semantic segmentation. In the first stage, the network learns grasping points with the automatic annotation. Although a robot learns both single-arm and dual-arm grasping efficiently with the annotation, the robot may not be able to grasp it because the annotation algorithm is designed by human. Therefore, for the second stage, the robot samples various grasping points with both grasping strategies and learns how to grasp in the real world. In this stage, the robot obtains new possible grasping points and prunes unsuccessful ones for both grasping strategies through the robot experience. In the experiments in the real world, the adapted network achieved high success rate 76.7% in 90 trials. Since the network trained with no adaptation stage resulted in lower success rate 56.7%, this result also shows the network was refined with less than 250 times of grasp sampling. As an application of our method, we demonstrated that our system worked well in warehouse picking task.
