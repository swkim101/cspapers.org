CSMA/CA networks have often been analyzed using a stylized model that is fully characterized by a vector of back-off rates and a conflict graph. We present an explicit formula for the unique vector of back-off rate needed to achieve any achievable throughput vector provided that the network has a chordal conflict graph. These back-off rates are such that the back-off rate of a node only depends on its own target throughput and the target throughput of its neighbors and can be determined in a distributed manner. We also introduce a distributed chordal approximation algorithm for general conflict graphs which is shown (using numerical examples) to be more accurate than the Bethe approximation.
