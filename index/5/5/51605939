In this paper, we propose conducting Robust Graph Dimensionality Reduction (RGDR) by learning a transformation matrix to map original high-dimensional data into their low-dimensional intrinsic space without the influence of outliers. To do this, we propose simultaneously 1) adaptively learning three variables, \ie a reverse graph embedding of original data, a transformation matrix, and a graph matrix preserving the local similarity of original data in their low-dimensional intrinsic space; and 2) employing robust estimators toÂ  avoid outliers involving the processes of optimizing these three matrices. As a result, original data are cleaned by two strategies, \ie a prediction of original data based on three resulting variables and robust estimators, so that the transformation matrix can be learnt from accurately estimated intrinsic space with the helping of the reverse graph embedding and the graph matrix. Moreover, we propose a new optimization algorithm to the resulting objective function as well as theoretically prove the convergence of our optimization algorithm. Experimental results indicated that our proposed method outperformed all the comparison methods in terms of different classification tasks.
