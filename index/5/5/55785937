Design environments and automated CAD systems are proliferated nowadays with various preferences and restrictions in their work environments. One serious problem of automated high-level synthesis tools is their inability of at least difficulty to use for low, bit level functions such as signal processing blocks. Here the Cubed-C environment is used for the rapid implementation of a number of low level functions and blocks such as UARTs without difficulty. Cubed-C is a full-strength high-level synthesis CAD system; nevertheless, its structure and properties make it particularly suitable for this type of fine-grained applications. The experiments in this paper prove that the Cubed-C synthesis tools are particularly suitable for both complex and for low, bit level signal coding functions.
