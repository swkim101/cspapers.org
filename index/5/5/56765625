Starting from a concern raised by the reading of a text of Roland Barthes, 1968 - which stated that the voice is what is really at stake in modernity - this text develops a conceptual discussion about the media listening in the global era. Also addressing the concept of world music, we discuss listening as a form of cultural consumption that can enable the knowledge of the Other, the different, mediated by technical media in the songs, at a time when global and local flows are in a confrontation and negotiation, setting intercultural spaces. In this 
context, the voice and listening to media acquire a prominent role in a world where identities and senses of belonging are under constant reconstruction. One hears that brings into play new connections between own / foreign, local / global, in that “listening is listening to” (Barthes).
