This work addresses the design and implementation of a filter that estimates the orientation of the body-fixed $z$ axis and the velocity of a quadrotor UAV from the inertial measurement unit (IMU)given a known yaw. The velocity and attitude estimation is possible since the filter employs a linear drag model measuring the drag forces on the quadrotor through the IMU. These forces are functions of the robot's velocity and attitude. In addition, the filter estimates the linear drag parameters and thrust coefficient for the propellers. These parameters may be fed back into a controller to improve tracking performance. Experimental results are used to validate the proposed approach.
