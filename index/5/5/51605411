A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) character speller allows human-beings to directly spell characters using eye-gazes, thereby building communication between the human brain and a computer. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown better performance than traditional machine learning methods for BCI signal recognition and its application to the character speller. However, current CNN architectures limit further accuracy improvements of signal detection and character spelling and also need high complexity to achieve competitive accuracy, thereby preventing the use of CNNs in portable BCIs. To address these issues, we propose a novel and simple CNN which effectively learns feature representations from both raw temporal information and raw spatial information. The complexity of the proposed CNN is significantly reduced compared with state-of-the-art CNNs for BCI signal detection. We perform experiments on three benchmark datasets and compare our results with those in previous research works which report the best results. The comparison shows that our proposed CNN can increase the signal detection accuracy by up to 15.61% and the character spelling accuracy by up to 19.35%.
