We present the new HippoCampus micro underwater vehicle, first introduced in [1]. It is designed for monitoring confined fluid volumes. These tightly constrained settings demand agile vehicle dynamics. Moreover, we adapt a robust attitude control scheme for aerial drones to the underwater domain. We demonstrate the performance of the controller with a challenging maneuver. A submerged Furuta pendulum is stabilized by HippoCampus after a swing-up. The experimental results reveal the robustness of the control method, as the system quickly recovers from strong physical disturbances, which are applied to the system.
