We provide a definition of actual causation in the logical framework of the causal calculus, which is based on a causal version of the well-known NESS (or INUS) condition. We compare our definition with other, mainly counterfactual, approaches on standard examples. On the way, we explore general capabilities of the logical representation for structural equation models of causation and beyond.
