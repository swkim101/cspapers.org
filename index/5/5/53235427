In breakthrough developments about two decades ago, L. G. Khachiyan [14] showed that the Ellipsoid method solves linear programs in polynomial time, while M. Grötschel, L. Lovász and A. Schrijver [4, 5] extended this to the problem of minimizing a convex function over any convex set specified by a separation oracle. In 1996, P. M. Vaidya [21] improved the running time via a more sophisticated algorithm. We present a simple new algorithm for convex optimization based on sampling by a random walk; it also solves for a natural generalization of the problem.
