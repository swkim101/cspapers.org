We study the evolution of Artificial Intelligence conference closeness, using the coscinus tool. Coscinus computes the closeness between publication supports using the co-publication habits of authors: the more authors publish in two conferences, the closer these two conferences. In this paper we perform an analysis of the main Artificial Intelligence conferences based on principal components analysis and clustering performed on this closeness relation.
