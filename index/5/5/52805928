Held each year in conjunction with one of the largest data management conferences, CIKM, the Ninth ACM International Workshop on Data and Text Mining in Biomedical Informatics (DTMBIO'15) is organized to bring together researchers interested in development and application of cutting-edge data management and analysis methods with a specific focus on applications in biology and medicine. The purpose of DTMBIO is to foster discussions regarding the state-of-the-art applications of data and text mining on biomedical research problems. DTMBIO'15 will help scientists understand emerging trends and opportunities in the evolving area of informatics related techniques and problems in the context of biomedical research.
