Many of the solutions proposed for the object manipulation problem are based on the knowledge of the object features. The approach proposed in this paper intends to provide a simple geometrical approach to securely manipulate an unknown object based only on tactile and kinematic information. The tactile and kinematic data obtained during the manipulation is used to recognize the object shape (at least the local object curvature), allowing to improve the grasping forces when this information is added to the manipulation strategy. The approach has been fully implemented and tested using the Schunk Dexterous Hand (SDH2). Experimental results are shown to illustrate the efficiency of the approach.
