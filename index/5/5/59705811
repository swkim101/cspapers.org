This paper deals with basic concepts of autonomic computing. Each concept is associated with an autonomy indicator. Quality indicators for autonomic environments are also given. They describe system capability for self- -healing, -optimization, -configuration and -protection. The proposed Autonomic Computing Layer Model (ACLM) is described in detail. It enables a framework for implementation of autonomic computing concepts at the levels of security and authentication, policy and goals, management, translation, security as well as communication and resource level. Autonomy of a computational grid as a heterogeneous and dynamic environment is discussed. Also, usability of the proposed ACLM model for the implementation of autonomic computing concepts in the grid is analyzed.
