Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service The mode-of-action is the overall manner in which a herbicide affects a plant at the tissue or cellular level. Herbicides with the same mode-of-action will have the same translocation (movement) pattern and produce similar injury sympÂ­ toms. Selectivity on crops and weeds, behavior in the soil and use patterns are less predictable, but are often similar for herbicides with the same mode-of-action.
