Whereas various things are connected via networks thanks to IoT technology, and the era of the 4th industrial revolution which realizes optimization and efficiency by utilizing AI and big data is emerging, manufacturing systems are also significantly transforming globally. In addition to the robot revolution, along with progressing digitalization, manufacturing sites in Japan are changing, aiming at establishment of “Connected Industries” that is a solution-oriented industrial society, based on the high technological capabilities. In order to respond timely to diversifying demands of customers, it is necessary to build a next-generation manufacturing systems that realizes flexible and high productivity, such as human-robot collaboration, and it is becoming difficult to respond to the necessity by conventional safety concept. Therefore, in order to realize the 4th industrial revolution, the robot revolution, and “Connected Industries,” it is essential to establish a new safety concept corresponding to the next-generation manufacturing systems to ensure safety. This paper introduces the safety concept to be changed along with the evolution of manufacturing sites, and proposes a new safety concept, which realizes collaboration safety of humans and robots, and an outline of its safety level, for the first time in the world.
