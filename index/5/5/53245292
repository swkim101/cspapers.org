Let <italic>G=(V,E)</italic> be an undirected <italic>weighted</italic> graph with <italic>|V|=n</italic> and <italic>|E|=m</italic>. Let <italic>k\ge 1</italic> be an integer. We show that <italic>G=(V,E)</italic> can be preprocessed in <italic>O(kmn^{1/k})</italic> expected time, constructing a data structure of size <italic>O(kn^{1+1/k})</italic>, such that any subsequent <italic> distance query</italic> can be answered, approximately, in <italic>O(k)</italic> time. The approximate distance returned is of stretch at most <italic>2k-1</italic>, i.e., the quotient obtained by dividing the estimated distance by the actual distance lies between 1 and <italic>2k-1</italic>. We show that a 1963 girth conjecture of Erd{\H{o}}s, implies that <italic>&ohgr(n^{1+1/k})</italic> space is needed in the worst case for any real stretch strictly smaller than <italic>2k+1</italic>. The space requirement of our algorithm is, therefore, essentially optimal. The most impressive feature of our data structure is its <italic> constant</italic> query time, hence the name ``oracle''. Previously, data structures that used only <italic>O(n^{1+1/k})<italic> space had a query time of <italic>&ohgr(n^{1/k})</italic> and a slightly larger, non-optimal, stretch. Our algorithms are extremely simple and easy to implement efficiently. They also provide faster constructions of sparse <italic>spanners</italic> of weighted graphs, and improved <italic>tree covers</italic> and <italic>distance labelings</italic> of weighted or unweighted graphs.}
