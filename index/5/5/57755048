Bimanual assembly of two parts require that a relative target pose is reached prior to the joining operation. Rather than utilizing one arm as a fixture for holding one of the parts while the other performs the assembly, motion generation in the relative end-effector frame is proposed that involves both arms. The proposed approach considers bimanual motion in a dynamic and uncertain environment addressing avoidance of collision with obstacles as well as the robot itself and the environment. Moreover, configurations that optimize the motion and force capabilities for the sucessful and efficient completion of the task are taken into account. A task priority strategy is adopted achieving online performance. Experimental results on the YuMi bimanual robot using the Stack-Of- Tasks hierarchical solver validate the performance of the proposed approach in a folding assembly task.
