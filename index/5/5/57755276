Most existing trajectory tracking controllers are based on non-skidding and non-slipping assumptions, also assume that full states are accessible, which is unrealistic for real-world applications due to tire-road interaction. This paper presents a novel vision-based approach to achieve high performance tracking control of a Car-Like Mobile Robot (CLMR) with wheel skidding and slippage. A visual estimation algorithm is proposed to provide reliable position, velocity, skidding and slipping information to close the control loop. The stability of the proposed system can be guaranteed by Lyapunov method since the position tracking error and the estimation error converge to zero simultaneously. Simulation is made to validate the effectiveness of the developed controller in the presence of skidding and slipping with online visual estimator.
