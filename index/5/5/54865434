of the originals. It means we can extract longer wave from high frequency waves without any transform. This gives us many advantages. For example, we are free from choosing frequency range. Even though when we have to deal with high frequency, we can extract longer wave from original signals without any transform. For these reasons we used beating signal to estimate multiple acoustic sources. In order to estimate source location we have to extract arrival time difference of the received sensor signals respectively. Time differences could be extracted from phase differences. In this paper, we extracted beating signalâ€™s phase difference from original signals. We showed how to find a beating signal frequencies and phases and how to extract phase differences among beating signals. Finally showed how these phase differences are used finding source locations.
