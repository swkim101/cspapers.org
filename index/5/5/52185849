The Linked Media workshop (http://www.linkedtv.eu/event/lime2015/) takes place now for the third time, and thus continues to call for more research and development on a concept which we have called "Linked Media". Indeed, while this term still has little resonance in the wider R&D community, the actual principles it embodies clearly become more and more relevant with each passing year. Linked Media considers the value of annotation of media resources using Linked Data concepts, with the expectation that the source of an annotation can be a spatial or a temporal fragment of a media (e.g. a video) and that the result of these annotations can be further processed by software and services to create meaningful links between media fragments based on semantic similarity (or difference!).
