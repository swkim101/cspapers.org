How can high dimensional robots learn general sets of skills from experience in the real world? Many previous approaches focus on maximizing a single utility function and require large datasets of experience to do this, something that is not possible to collect outside of simulation as every data point is expensive both in time and in a potential wear down of the robot. This paper addresses this question using a newly developed framework called Finite Element Goal Babbling (FEGB). FEGB is an online learning method that aims at providing general control over some measurable feature, in contrast to optimizing it to some given utility function. It generalizes standard goal babbling by breaking down the full learning problem into local sub-problems, and combining it with a planner that learns how to navigate between these subproblems. We test FEGB using a real humanoid robot Nao, and find that it could quickly learn to robustly control its body orientation. After only 20â€“30 minutes of training, the robot could freely move into any body orientation between lying on either side and on its back. Rapid learning of body orientation control in high dimensional real robots is largely an unexplored field of robotics, and although many challenges remain, FEGB shows a feasible approach to the problem.
