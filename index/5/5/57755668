In this paper, a study on nonlinear state estimation methods for Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Underwater Vehicles (HUAUVs) is presented. Based on a detailed dynamic model simulation, we analyse and elect the best nonlinear algorithm among those presented in the state-of-the-art literature addressing local derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filters (KFs): the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), the Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) and the Transformed Unscented Kalman Filter (TUKF). Here, these three nonlinear probabilistic estimators were compared in terms of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the average execution time over Monte Carlo simulations. We simulated real-world conditions for our in-production HUAUV prototype using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data and state augmentation for sensor data filtering and trajectory estimation. We have concluded that the CKF proved to be the most interesting KF to low-cost on-board applications for high dimensional state spaces.
