With the increasing uptake of knowledge graphs comes an increasing need for validating the knowledge contained in these graphs. However, the sheer size and number of knowledge bases used in real-world applications makes manual fact checking impractical. In this paper, we employ sentence coherence features gathered from trustworthy source documents to outperform the state of the art in fact checking. Our approach, FactCheck, uses this information to score how likely a fact is to be true and provides the user the evidence used to validate the input facts. We evaluated our approach on two different benchmark datasets and two different corpora. Our results show that FactCheck outperforms the state of the art by up to 13.3% in F-measure and 19.3% AUC.
