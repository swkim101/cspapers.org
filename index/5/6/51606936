To combat the evolving Android malware attacks, in this paper, instead of only using Application Programming Interface (API) calls, we further analyze the different relationships between them and create higher-level semantics which require more efforts for attackers to evade the detection. We represent the Android applications (apps), related APIs, and their rich relationships as a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN). Then we use a meta-path based approach to characterize the semantic relatedness of apps and APIs. We use each meta-path to formulate a similarity measure over Android apps, and aggregate different similarities using multi-kernel learning to make predictions. Promising experimental results based on real sample collections from Comodo Cloud Security Center demonstrate that our developed system HinDroid outperforms other alternative Android malware detection techniques.
