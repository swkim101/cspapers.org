We propose interactive beautification, a technique for rapid geometric design, and introduce the technique and its algorithm with a prototype system Pegasus. The motivation is to solve a problem with current drawing systems: toomany complex commands and unintuitiveprocedures to satisfy geometric constraints. The Interactive beautification system receives the userâ€™s free stroke and beautifies it by considering geometric constraints among segments. A single stroke is beautified one after another, preventing accumulation of recognition errors or catastrophic deformation. Supported geometric constraints include perpendicularity, congruence, symmetry, etc., which were not seen in existing free stroke recognition systems. In addition, the system generates multiple candidates as a result of beautification to solve the problem of ambiguity. Using this technique, the user can draw precise diagrams rapidly satisfying geometric relations without using any editing commands. Interactive beautification is achieved by three sequential processes: 1) inferring underlining geometric constraints based on the spatial relationships among the input stroke and the existing segments, 2) generating multiple candidates by combining inferred constraints appropriately, and 3) evaluating the candidates to find the most plausible candidate and to remove the inappropriate candidates. A user study was performed using the prototypesystem, a commercial CAD tppl, and an OObased drawing system. The result showed that users can draw required diagrams more rapidly and more precisely using the prototype system.
