The knowledge acquisition is major research field in knowledge engineering and still the most difficult and error-prone task for knowledge engineer while building an expert system. This situation influences the performance of the knowledge due to the quality of information and the reduction of error possibility. 
 
The Ternay Grid technique has potentiality to achieve the above mentioned performance of the knowledge. It is proposed in [1] as a potentially new technique for knowledge elicitation/acquisition. Meanwhile we have developed a suitable process of the knowledge acquisition and developed the knowledge acquisition tools based on the Ternary Grid technique and knowledge model that is called KasTerGrid.
