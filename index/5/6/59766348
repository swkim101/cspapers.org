The standardization of the architecture of electronic healthcare records is very important from several point of view. To design a reference architecture for personal healthcare, ensuring interoperability between heterogeneous devices and services, as well as a reliable and secure patient data management and a seamless integration with the clinical workflow, is the point of starting of our research. In this paper we present ESB, as the core of the Middleware subsystem for interaction among different and heterogeneous systems.
