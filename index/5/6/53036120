Review-based methods are one of the dominant methods to address the data sparsity problem of recommender system. However, the performance of most existing review-based methods will degrade when the review is also sparse. To this end, we propose a method to exploit user-item p air-dependent features from a uxiliary r eviews written by l ike-minded users (PARL) to address such problem. That is, both the reviews written by the user and the reviews written for the item are incorporated to highlight the useful features covered by the auxiliary reviews. PARL not only alleviates the sparsity problem of reviews but also produce extra informative features to further improve the accuracy of rating prediction. More importantly, it is designed as a plug-and-play model which can be plugged into various deep recommender systems to improve recommendations provided by them. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that PARL achieves better prediction accuracy than other state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with the exploitation of auxiliary reviews, the performance of PARL is robust on datasets with different characteristics.
