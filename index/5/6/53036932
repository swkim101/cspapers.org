Copernicus is the European program for monitoring the Earth. It consists of a set of complex systems that collect data from satellites and in-situ sensors, process this data and provide users with reliable and up-to-date information on a range of environmental and security issues. The data collected by Copernicus is made available freely following an open access policy. Information extracted from Copernicus data is disseminated to users through the Copernicus services which address six thematic areas: land, marine, atmosphere, climate, emergency and security. We present a demo from the Horizon 2020 Copernicus App Lab project which takes big data from the Copernicus land service, makes it available on the Web as linked geospatial data and interlinks it with other useful public data to aid the development of applications by developers that might not be Earth Observation experts. Our demo targets a scenario where we want to study the "greenness" of Paris.
