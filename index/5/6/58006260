Almost all major news and professional publications e.g. [1,2] document IT Offshoring & Outsourcing (O&O), which has caused job losses in the US and drops in CS/IS enrollment. Public opinion and understanding of O&O are colored by several misperceptions: • All software development is going offshore. Actually, O&O has the biggest impact on lower skilled jobs. Wired Magazine Feb 2004 reported the offshored jobs as custom software development, software maintenance, IT documentation, telephone support, remote networking monitoring, software reengineering, systems management, and IT admin & operations. Reference [5] indicates that an " undergraduate computer science degree is neither common nor appropriate training " for many of these jobs. • There will not be onshore jobs in the CS/IT industry. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that such jobs are among the fastest growing in 2002-2012, with 40-55% increases [3]. 2004 starting IS salaries exceed $34k and CS salaries approach $50k. There are still plenty of available jobs in the US depending on skill set, location, and career goals of the job seekers [6]. • O&O only affects IT fields. Actually, it will increasingly affect other areas, such as accounting and legal research. • O&O is only about cost savings. Although cost is the most commonly cited advantage of offshoring, over 70% of CIOs feel the cost factor is overrated; typical savings are 15-25% the first year, and up to 40% later on. Other commonly cited reasons for outsourcing include accessing specialized skills or facilities, being able to increase or decrease developer head count as needed, and increasing development speed [7]. • All jobs outsourced go to low-wage countries. In fact, large US outsourcing service companies keep requirements, project management and integration staff onshore. • Many IT-producing companies have established significant presence overseas, so they must have transferred software development overseas. Actually, these companies globalize to enhance their business and in turn help the US economy. Using in-country staff for local content and customization is a common market entry approach.
