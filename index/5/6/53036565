Heterogeneous Information Network(HIN) has been employed in recommender system to represent heterogeneous types of data, and meta path has been proposed to capture semantic relationship among objects. When applying HIN to the recommendation, there are two problems: how to extract features from meta paths and how to properly fuse these features to further improve recommendations. Some recent work has employed deep neural network to learn user and item representation, and attention mechanism has been explored to integrate information for recommendation. Inspired by these work, in this paper, we propose Heterogeneous Neural Attentive Factorization Machine(HNAFM) to solve above problems. Specifically, we first calculate the commuting matrices based on meta paths and use multilayer perceptrons to learn user and item features. A hierarchical attention mechanism is employed to find the meta path that best describes user's preference and item's property. Comprehensive experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed HNAFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art rating prediction methods.
