Software problems originate from real world problems. A software solution must address its real world problem in a satisfactory way. A software engineer must therefore understand the real world problem that their software intends to address. To be able to do this, the software engineer must understand the problem context and how it is to be affected by the proposed software, expressed as the requirements. Without this knowledge the engineer can only hope to chance upon the right solution for the problem. Application of problem-oriented approaches may well be a way of meeting this challenge.
