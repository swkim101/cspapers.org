This paper introduces the theoretical design and control of reconfigurable parallel kinematic machine tools. First, the general concept of reconfigurable parallel kinematic machine (RPKM) and its growing demand are introduced. Second, the design of reconfigurable parallel kinematic machines is discussed and the geometric modeling of such structures is presented and explained. The potential applications of this type of machine are described. Finally, a case study for one of the proposed structures is conducted, including kinematic/dynamic modeling and control, some results and simulation are demonstrated.Copyright Â© 2007 by ASME
