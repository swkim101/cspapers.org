Screw theory was introduced and inducted to the statics analysis and calculation of 6-DOF (Degree of Freedom) parallel robot. Based on the scheme, a 6-DOF parallel robot--hydraulic Stewart test platform was checked specially. The results reveal that, the platform design is appropriate, the analysis procedure is concise and the calculation operation is simple and convenient.
