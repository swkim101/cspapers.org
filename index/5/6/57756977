The paper proposes a spatial sound perception system for an autonomous mobile robot. The system performs three-dimensional position localization and recognition as online processing from a robot in motion. For online processing, the sound positions are estimated as probabilistic regions in three dimensional space, because the robot could observe only arrival direction of the sound at a moment. The detected sound signals are recognized using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for the adjustment to short input signals. The experimental results show our mobile robot could observe surrounding sound sources online and continuously update its position and sound label.
