In the next generation network, whose main characteristics are terminal, network and technology heterogeneity, one of the problems is to provide an efficient automated and adaptable framework for software installation, control and maintenance. It is necessary to ensure that the process of implementing a new service into the provider network is fast and cost effective. As part of our previous work, we developed a framework based on agent technology. In this paper, we extend this framework with BDI agents which enables higher flexibility and adaptability.
