In mobile wireless multimedia sensor networks (MWMSNs) image compression task coordination, the existing methods without considering the dynamic changes of the processing ability and location of cooperative nodes, which will cause frequent interruptions of image compression tasks and task data re-transmission. To solve these problems, an image compression task cooperation algorithm based on dynamic alliance (ATDA) is proposed. The image compression task is divided into image transfer subtask and image compression subtask based on the task stable execution time and the principles and constraints of task decomposition. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can realize the task load balancing of the alliance collaboration nodes and reduce the execution time of the image compression task and energy consumption.
