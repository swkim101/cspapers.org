Attempting to derive image algorithms solely under orthographic projection is deceptively easy. However, orthographic algorithms often fail when applied to the perspective case. More critically, since many things simplify under orthography, such algorithms often give no evidence for their proper extension. This paper gives two such examples, showing both the problems that arise for them under perspective, and the suprising extensions that they require.
