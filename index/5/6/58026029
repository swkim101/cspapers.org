Design and verification of Distributed Real-time Embedded (DRE) systems are crucial because a failure or a security problem may cause loss of life or the premature end of a mission. Code for such systems must be verified to avoid failures and errors. To improve dependability and reliability, the concept of partitioned architecture has been proposed. Partitioned architectures isolate partitions and reduce failures propagation. However, systemâ€™s configuration as well as application code remain hand-written, which is error-prone, difficult to check and certify. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically generate and configure partitioned systems. We model partitioned systems using a language suitable for real-time embedded systems. Then, we automatically generate code from models. Generated code follows the semantics of the model so it enforces specified requirements.
