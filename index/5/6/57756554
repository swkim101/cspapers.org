FroBot can locomote both on land and underwater based on its dual swing-legs propulsion mechanism. This paper presents the dynamic model, experimental studies, and control strategies of FroBot underwater. In this work, an experimental setup consisting of two-degree-of-freedom(2DOF) robotic swing-legs is built to study the model of FroBot underwater. We first improve the dynamic model of caudal fins based on the Morison equation. Combined with experimental data, we optimize the model parameters and then obtain the optimal control strategy of uniform swing. In addition, we apply the CPGs control strategy and improve it based on the FroBot model. These two control strategies have their advantages and demonstrate the potential for future use in control applications.
