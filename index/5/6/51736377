On account of ant colony algorithm easy to fall into local optimum, this paper presents an improved ant colony optimization called α-AACS and reports its performance. At first, we provide an concise description of the original ant colony system(ACS) and introduce α-nearness based on the minimum 1-tree for ACS’s disadvantage, which better reflects the chances of a given link being a member of an optimal tour. Then, we improve α-nearness by computing a lower bound and propose other adaptations for ACS. Finally, we conduct a fair competition between our algorithm and others. The results clearly show that α-AACS has a better global searching ability in finding the best solutions, which indicates that α-AACS is an effective approach for solving the traveling salesman problem.
