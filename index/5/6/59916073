It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2nd International Workshop on Social Software Engineering and Applications -- SoSEA 2009. The workshop discusses various topics related to the engineering and use of social software. The aim of the workshop is to create a scientific foundation for social software and to form a research community that can focus on the technological and technical aspects of the movement. 
 
The program contained 5 technical presentations (3 full papers and 2 short papers) discussing social software from different perspectives: knowledge sharing, end-user programming, community-driven development, social networks, and social tagging. In addition, the program includes open discussion and a networking session to build and extend cooperation among the workshop participants. We hope that the program will serve as a valuable reference for researchers on social software engineering.
