Some particularly important rich sources of open and free big geospatial data are the Earth observation (EO) programs of various countries such as the Landsat program of the US and the Copernicus programme of the European Union. EO data is a paradigmatic case of big data and the same is true for the big information and big knowledge extracted from it. EO data (satellite images and in-situ data), and the information and knowledge extracted from it, can be utilized in many applications with financial and environmental impact in areas such as emergency management, climate change, agriculture and security.
