Multicores are becoming ubiquitous in automotive. Yet, the expected benefits on integration are challenged by multicore contention concerns on timing V&V. Worst-case execution time (WCET) estimates are required as early as possible in the software development, to enable prompt detection of timing misbehavior. Factoring in multicore contention necessarily builds on conservative assumptions on interference, independent of co-runners load on shared hardware. We propose a contention model for automotive multi-cores that balances time-composability with tightness by exploiting available information on contenders. We tailor the model to the AURIX TC27x and provide tight WCET estimates using information from performance monitors and software configurations.
