We propose the demonstration of SP4, a software-based programmable packet processing platform that supports (1) stateful packet processing useful for analyzing traffic flows with session semantics, (2) uses a task-stealing architecture that automatically leverages multi-core processing capabilities in a load-balanced manner without the need for explicit performance profiling, and (3) a declarative language for rapidly specifying and composing new packet processing functionalities from reusable modules. Our demonstration showcases the use of SP4 for performing high-throughput analysis of traffic traces for a variety of applications, such as filtering out unwanted traffic and detection of DDoS attacks using machine learning based analysis.
