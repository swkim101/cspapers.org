Important changes in image file appear in contracting the images. The aim of our investigations was to introduce and suggest the quantitative methods of evaluation of compression and decompression value of image files prepared for printing. The values of the pixel density and its changes in multilayer file transition flow tiff/jpg/tiff have been compared. The usual qualitative evaluation values, based on the subjective experience of the image quality are insecure. The results of this work have practical application in the filed of graphic engineering in the analysis of the print realized with the compressed file.
