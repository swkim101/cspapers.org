Recent studies show that table scans are increasingly more common than using secondary indices. Given that the optimizer may choose table scans when the selectivity is as low as 0.5% with large data, it is important to make initial query results faster for interactive data explorations. We formulate it as a query result timeliness problem, and propose two complementary approaches. The first approach builds lightweight statistics and judiciously determines an access order to data blocks for a given query. The second approach performs adaptive microscopic tuple reordering online without relying on pre-built statistics. Our systematic experimental evaluation further verifies the efficiency and efficacy of our approaches.
