In this paper, we present a Mobile Agile Printer (MAP) construction robot; a highly agile, 4-legged, omnidirectional robot capable of 3D printing large structures. To overcome dynamic challenges when operating within an outdoors construction site, MAP incorporates a high-DoF 3D printing system connected to a mobile platform with novel features designed to enable disturbance rejection and live adaption to the robot's pose. In doing so, we demonstrate the benefits of designing construction robots with a focus on agility, a compact working volume and ability to operate within a potentially unlimited workspace. Performance tests were conducted showing smooth omni-directional motion as a key requirement for maintaining low 3D printing trajectory deviations over a large volume. In doing so, we show that MAP has the ability to construct in new ways more sensitive to its environment, context and concurrent on-site operations.
