Wave induced liquefaction at a coastal structure is studied. Experiments in a glass-wall flume filled with a partially saturated bed of light-weight sediment are presented. Periodic waves and single wave loadings are simulated. For large enough wave conditions an excess pore pressure is recorded within the soil and a liquefaction threshold is reached. Velocity fields obtained from video recordings display large zones of the bed that behave as a fluid. Phases of soil compaction and dilatation are identified. Moreover, a Discrete Element Method - Pore-scale Finite Volume model is used to simulate the wave-sediment interactions. The computation of the coupling between the flow and the motion of the particles enables to reproduce the excess pore pressure that lead to liquefaction and the progressive compaction of the bed.
