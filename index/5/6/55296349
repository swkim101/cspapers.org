This paper presents an image-based visual servoing system that was used to track the atmospheric Earth re-entry of Hayabusa. The primary aim of this ground based tracking platform was to record the emission spectrum radiating from the superheated gas of the shock layer and the surface of the heat shield during reentry. To the author's knowledge, this is the first time that a visual servoing system has successfully tracked a super-orbital re-entry of a spacecraft and recorded its spectral signature. Furthermore, we improve the system by including a simplified dynamic model for feed-forward control and demonstrate improved tracking performance on the International Space Station (ISS). We present comparisons between simulation and experimental results on different target trajectories including tracking results from Hayabusa and ISS. The required performance for tracking both spacecraft is demanding when combined with a narrow field of view (FOV). We also briefly discuss the preliminary results obtained from the spectroscopy of the Hayabusa's heat shield during re-entry.
