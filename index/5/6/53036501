Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are significant and valuable for subject information extraction from the text. Word embedding that can map the words to low-dimensional vector representations has been widely used in natural language processing tasks. But the word embedding based on context such as Word2Vec and GloVe is lack of capturing the sentiment information. Most of existing sentiment analysis methods incorporate sentiment polarity (positive and negative) to improve the sentiment embedding for sentiment tasks. Instead of making a new word embedding model, we introduce the multi-emotion category (MEC) model to improve the pre-trained word vectors which aims to move target word vectors closer to the words from both similar semantics and similar emotions. The MEC model can give eight-dimensional vector for one word in emotion space that can capture more sentiment information than the binary polarity labels. In addition, the obvious advantage of the MEC model is that it can be fit for any pre-trained word embedding. The experimental results on several Chinese and English data sets show that this new model can improve the conventional word embedding and some existing sentiment embedding for sentiment classification.
