Information search is an indispensable component of our lives. Web search engines are widely used for searching textual documents, images, and video. However, there are also vast collections of structured and semi-structured data both on the Web and in enterprises, such as relational databases, XML data, etc. Traditionally, to access these resources, a user must learn structured or semi-structured query languages, and must be able to access data schemas, which are most likely heterogeneous, complex, and fastevolving. To relieve web and scientific users from the learning curve and enable them to easily access structured and semi-structured data, there is a growing research interest to support keyword search on these data sources. 
 
The first International Workshop on Keyword Search on Structured Data (KEYS 2009) is held in Providence, Rhode Island, USA on 28th June, 2009, in conjunction with SIGMOD 2009 conference, and aims to encourage researchers from both academia and industry communities to discuss the opportunities and challenges in keyword search on (semi-)structured data, and to present the key issues and novel techniques in this area. In response to the call for papers, KEYS 2009 has attracted 25 submissions. The submissions are highly diversified, coming from Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Greece, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand, and USA, resulting in an international final program. All submissions were peer reviewed by three program committee members. The program committee selected 6 full research papers and 4 demo and poster papers for inclusion in the proceeding. The accepted papers covered a wide range of research topics and novel applications on keyword search on structured data.
