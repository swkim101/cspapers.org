This paper presents a visual odometry approach using a Pixel Processor Array (PPA) camera, specifically, the SCAMP-5 vision chip. In this device, each pixel is capable of storing data and performing computation, enabling a variety of computer vision tasks to be carried out directly upon the sensor itself. In this work the PPA performs HDR edge detection, perspective correction and image alignment based odometry, allowing the position and heading of a MAV to be tracked at several hundred frames per second. We evaluate our PPA based approach by direct comparison with a motion capture system for a variety of trajectories. These include rapid accelerations that would incur significant motion blur at low frame rates, and lighting conditions that would typically lead to under or over exposure of image detail. Such challenging conditions would often lead to unusable images when relying on traditional image sensors.
