Navigating large knowledge bases made of billions of triples is very challenging. In this demonstration, we showcase Fouilla, a topical Knowledge Base browser that offers a seamless navigational experience of DBpedia. We propose an original approach that leverages both structural and semantic contents of Wikipedia to enable a topic-oriented filter on DBpedia entities. We devise an approach to drastically reduce the query time and to ensure a seamless browsing experience to the end user. We demonstrate how our system offers a novel and meaningful experience of DBpedia browsing by challenging the user to search for relevant information within the Knowledge Base in different use cases.
