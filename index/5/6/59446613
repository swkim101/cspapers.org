Engineering the interaction between components is a key issue in the development of complex software systems. While technologies for developing components are spread, more difficult is the composition of such components in heterogeneous, unpredictable and dynamic scenarios. In this paper we introduce the Join-Computing as a general model in which components are able to "join" in order to exploit each other features. We discuss also the technological issues related to the Join-Computing, which can be exploited to concretize the model.
