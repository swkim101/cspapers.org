Visual Question Answering (VQA) aims to learn a joint embedding of the question sentence and the corresponding image to infer the answer. Existing approaches learn the joint embedding don't consider the answer-related information, which results in that the learned representation is not effective to reflect the answer of the question. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel method, i.e., Adversarial Learning of Answer-Related Representation (ALARR) for visual question answering, which seeks an effective answer-related representation for the question-image pair based on adversarial learning between two processes. The embedding learning process aims to generate modality-invariant joint representations for the question-image and question-answer pairs, respectively. Meanwhile, it tries to confuse the other process, embedding discriminator, which tries to discriminate the two representations from different modalities of pairs. Specifically, the joint embedding of the question-image pair is learned by a three-level attention model, and the joint representation of the question-answer pair is learned by a semantic integration model. Through the adversarial leaning, the answer-related representation are better preserved. Then an answer predictor is proposed to infer the answer from the answer-related representation. Experiments conducted on two widely used VQA benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.
