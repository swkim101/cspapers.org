This paper analyzes the general work breakdown structure(GWBS) for cost estimation and the mapping relation of features of GWBS-resource consumption-cost, and proposes a fast cost estimation model of project in project family based on case based reasoning (PFCBR). Differ from the common CBR, the proposed model adopt CBR technique to retrieve project case or element case from top to bottom. Based on the hierarchical structure of the GWBS, it reuses not only cost information of project case, but also element cases. Finally, the PFCBR is compared to the common CBR, artificial neural network and multiple regression analysis according to MMRE and Pred(0.25). Comparative results show that the PFCBR is significantly more accurate than other three methods.
