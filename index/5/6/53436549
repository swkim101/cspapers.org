The Shadow Brokers (TSB) are an infamous group of hackers responsible for major cybercrime incidents. There are currently few studies on TSB, and to prevent their attacks in the future, we believe it is necessary to study them beforehand. This study constructs a relation graph of all the entities concerning TSB using identifiers in the Web. We introduce a systematic approach to finding relations among entities using a case study based on identifiers and clearness of relations. Our investigation covers data from both the Surface Web and Dark Web, with our Dark Web data consisting of over 40 million Dark Web webpages. We have uncovered many hacking forums, hacking groups, and individuals having a relation with TSB using our method. The relation graph of TSB will become a stepping stone in developing a knowledge base of TSB.
