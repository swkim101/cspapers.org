Robotics teleoperation has been extensively studied and considered in the past in several task scenarios where direct human intervention is not possible due to the hazardous environments. In such applications, both communication degradation and reduced perception of the remote environment are practical issues that can challenge the human operator while controlling the robot and attempting to physically interact within the remote workspace. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel shared-autonomy Tele-Interaction control approach that blends the motion commands from the pilot (master side) with locally (slave side) executed autonomous motion and impedance modulators. This enables a remote robot to handle and autonomously avoid physical obstacles during manoeuvring, reduce interaction forces during contacts, and finally accommodate different payload conditions while at the same time operating with a “default” low impedance setting. We implemented and experimentally validated the proposed method both on simulation and on a real robot platform called CENTAURO. A series of tasks, such as maneuvering through the physical constraints of the remote environment in an autonomous manner, pushing and lifting heavy objects with autonomous impedance regulation and colliding with the rigid geometry of the remote environment were executed. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the shared-autonomy control principles that eventually aim to reduce the level of attention and stress of human pilot while manoeuvring the slave robot, and at the same time to enhance the robustness of the robot during physical interactions even if accidentally occurred.
