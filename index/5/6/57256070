Ontologies are efficient way of getting a better idea about a particular domain. There are various forms of ontologies. Certain ontologies are reusable and are available online. Some other ontology can be developed for a specific purpose and are used to yield precise results in the field of knowledge engineering and automated tasks. If we want to gather information between different ontologies of different domains a cross ontology mining method has to be implemented for mining the semantic data. A framework has been discussed here for advanced ontology mining which can be very much useful to the semantic society. (6 pages)
