Tactile sensing arrays are used to detect contacts of robotic systems with the environment. They are particularly useful for scenarios in which vision-based sensors cannot be used. Thanks to the presence of multiple sensing elements, tactile arrays also provide spatial information about the contact location. In this work, we present our series elastic tactile array to enable tactile exploration for position-controlled robot manipulators. Sixteen compliant sensing elements are arranged as a 4Ã—4 array. This allows the position-controlled robot to explore objects via palpation. Tactile sensing was accomplished by measuring the change of the magnetic field caused by neodymium magnets embedded into the series elastic elements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our sensor with two sets of experiments involving physical interaction scenarios. Firstly, we show that the sensor can be used to differentiate between rigid and deformable objects. Secondly, we show that point clouds of objects can be generated quickly with our sensor module attached to a position-controlled robot manipulator as an end-effector.
