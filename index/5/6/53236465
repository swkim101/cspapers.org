Modern mobile systems are equipped with a diverse collection of I/O devices, including cameras, microphones, various sensors, and cellular modem. There exist many novel use cases for allowing an application on one mobile system to utilize I/O devices from another. This video demonstrates Rio, an I/O sharing solution that supports unmodified applications and realizes many of these novel use cases. Rio's design is common to many classes of I/O devices, significantly reducing the engineering effort to support new I/O devices. Moreover, it supports all the functionalities of an I/O device for sharing. Rio also supports I/O sharing between mobile systems of different form factors, including smartphones and tablets.
