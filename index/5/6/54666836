The Supercondacting Fragment Recoil Separator will be a key part of the experiments of the NuSTAR-collaboration. The beam of the separator will have heavy ion projectiles that are steered to experimental area. With the Time Projection Chambers with Gas Electron Multiplier amplification (GEM-TPC), diagnostics of the beam properties can be performed. The performance of the components of the design of a GEM-TPC prototype has been studied with Geant4 and Garfield simualtion tools.
