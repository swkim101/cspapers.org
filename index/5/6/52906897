As transistor scaling hits its limits, a new challenge for general purpose computing arises: the need for efficient structures both in architecture and microarchitecture levels. Until recently, gains in transistor performance justified complex architectures, while computer systems security and safety has been dealt with as a software-only problem. The result is that current computer architectures are plagued with security vulnerabilities, intentional and unintentional backdoors. As a response to this, we propose a fresh look on functional programming architectures, based on combinatory logic. A functional processor has been designed, enabling the development of safe, purely functional operational systems and device drivers.
