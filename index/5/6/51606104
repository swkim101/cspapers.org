The classical disjoint shortest path problem has recently recalled

interests from researchers in the network planning and optimization

community. However, the requirement of the shortest paths being completely

vertex or edge disjoint might be too restrictive and demands much

more resources in a network. Partially disjoint shortest paths, in

which a bounded number of shared vertices or edges is allowed, balance

between degree of disjointness and occupied network resources.



In this paper, we consider the problem of finding k 

shortest paths which are edge disjoint but partially vertex disjoint.

For a pair of distinct vertices in a network graph, the problem aims

to optimally find k edge disjoint shortest paths among which

at most a bounded number of vertices are shared by at least two paths. In particular,

we present novel techniques for exactly solving the problem

with a runtime that significantly improves

the current best result. The

proposed algorithm is also validated by computer experiments on both

synthetic and real networks which demonstrate its superior efficiency

of up to three orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art.
