It is our pleasure to welcome you to the First International Workshop on Software Test Output Validation, held in conjunction with ISSTA 2010. 
 
In organizing this workshop, we seek to address some of the challenges and issues related to the software testing of applications that do not have a "test oracle," such as machine learning, optimization, scientific computing, and simulation. As society becomes more dependent on these types of software, and these applications become more complex and more difficult to test by current conventional means, it quickly becomes clear that the development of new techniques and approaches gains importance. This workshop represents the first effort to bring together researchers and practitioners working toward verification of software output correctness in such domains.
