It has been widely recognized that automated bots may have a significant impact on the outcomes of national events. It is important to raise public awareness about the threat of bots on social media during these important events, such as the 2018 US midterm election. To this end, we deployed a web application to help the public explore the activities of likely bots on Twitter on a daily basis. The application, called Bot Electioneering Volume (BEV), reports on the level of likely bot activities and visualizes the topics targeted by them. With this paper we release our code base for the BEV framework, with the goal of facilitating future efforts to combat malicious bots on social media.
