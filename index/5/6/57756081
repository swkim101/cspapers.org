Robotics applications in the raw materials sector are becoming increasingly common due to their many perceived benefits. In mining, the extended use of robotics is especially seen in the exploration and exploitation phases, where mineral resources are discovered, extracted and processed. The use of robotics in the mining industry started in the 60s and today it is seen in the automation of material transport or in robotic digging and loading. Potential benefits include improved productivity, decreased production costs, better operational efficiency, increased safety, reduced waste and, ultimately, more value creation. The increasing amount of robotics used in the raw materials sector is coupled with a series of ethical and legal issues, regulatory challenges and policy requirements that affect both producers and end-users of robotic technologies. The benefits and challenges of robotics applications, often overlooked by the stakeholders, can hinder both their integration in the sector and the further development of mining activities, if not properly addressed.
