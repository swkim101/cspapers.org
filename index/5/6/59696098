The factors influencing the response time are a key issue in distributed systems. This paper presents the results of performance measurements which focus how the software and the client workload affect the response time of a J2EE web application. Among the software factors the settings of the application server and the implementation of the web application were changed during the several measurements. In order to check which parameters are the main performance factors independence tests have been carried out.
