At the core of many important machine learning problems faced by online streaming services is a need to model how users interact with the content they are served. Unfortunately, there are no public datasets currently available that enable researchers to explore this topic. In order to spur that research, we release the Music Streaming Sessions Dataset (MSSD), which consists of 160 million listening sessions and associated user actions. Furthermore, we provide audio features and metadata for the approximately 3.7 million unique tracks referred to in the logs. This is the largest collection of such track metadata currently available to the public. This dataset enables research on important problems including how to model user listening and interaction behaviour in streaming, as well as Music Information Retrieval (MIR), and session-based sequential recommendations. Additionally, a subset of sessions were collected using a uniformly random recommendation setting, enabling their use for counterfactual evaluation of such sequential recommendations. Finally, we provide an analysis of user behavior and suggest further research problems which can be addressed using the dataset.
