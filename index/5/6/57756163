This paper presents the formalization of the closest point plane representation and an analysis of its incorporation in 3D indoor simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We present a singularity free plane factor leveraging the closest point plane representation, and demonstrate its fusion with inertial preintegratation measurements in a graph-based optimization framework. The resulting LiDAR-inertial 3D plane SLAM (LIPS) system is validated both on a custom made LiDAR simulator and on a real-world experiment.
