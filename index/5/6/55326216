This paper discusses the extent to which the fundamental sociological phenomenon is the emergence of power centered on an elite group (oligarchy) and the appearance of veiled hatred that became the source of the turmoil of post-reform Indonesian society. The paper argues that the problem lies in the lack of an agreement to develop naturally, and participatory values (normative integration) and rely more on power approach (integration coercive). Indonesia needs to create a civic culture as a cultural agreement to establish harmony among groups in society and one of them through the learning of Sociology. On the other hand, in the era of 'democratic transition' Indonesian people are confronted with the various phenomena that really concern people's lives. In the society bad characters emerge as typified by the drastic and fantastic change in social and cultural life. The people who were formerly known as patient, friendly, courteous and good at small talks are now becoming grumpy, abusive, and vindictive. They mistreat fellow human beings in the hustle of the city. People of different villages/tribes savagely fight with each other. Even more tragic, our students are hurting each other in the streets. Level of discipline in our society in various fields of life also does not seem encouraging, even obeying a simple rule such as riding/driving on a street is still very poor (2). On the basis of this reality it is imperative that we investigate seriously what exactly the source of the aforementioned phenomena is.
