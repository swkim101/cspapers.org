Biped robots have not achieved the efficient and harmonious locomotion of the human beings, capable of walking and running on unstructured terrains, with obstacles, holes and slopes. With this in mind, researchers started the development of biomimetic solutions to control the locomotion of biped models. This work presents a new solution of motion control of bipedal robots with adaptable stiffness, by exploring effects of joint stiffness in modulating walking behavior. Further, torque adjustment is achieved through a biomimetic controller that mimics and adjusts the natural dynamics of the robot to the environment. Specifically, the torque adjustment is made using AFOs (adaptive frequency oscillator) to generate the correct equilibrium positions that will be applied to the impedance control that computes the torque of each joint. Results show that the biped model is capable of walking in several types of terrain, including flat terrain, ramps, stairs and flat terrain with obstacles.
