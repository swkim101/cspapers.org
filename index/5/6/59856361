Data analytics is an integral part of many online businesses. In fact, the ability to process data efficiently has become so critical in recent years that companies depend on it for significant fractions of their core business. Yahoo! transforms and presents digital media content; Google and Microsoft index vast amounts of Web content to process Web search queries online. Today much of the data crunching performed by these companies relies on offline batch processing frameworks such as MapReduce. New models have been emerging, however, such as event and stream processing, to enable different use cases and to satisfy a variety of SLAs.
