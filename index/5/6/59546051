In recent years, the use of ontologies ininformation systems has dramatically in-creased. Ontology design and mainte-nance, nonetheless, have been and stillare daunting tasks. We argue that ontolo-gies need to evolve, or else the semanticinfrastructure of the information systemwill no longer support the organization’schanging needs. Therefore, in this workwe aim at tackling the problem of ontologyevolution. We propose to use (machine-generated) contexts as a mechanism forquantifying relationships among concepts.To do so we compare contexts that are as-sociated with ontology concepts. Our ap-proach is unique in two aspects. First, webase it on a combination of ontologies andcontexts, where contexts replace, to a cer-tain extent, the role of the ontology engi-neer in the process. Second, we providethe ontology administrator with an explicitnumeric estimation of the extent to whicha modiﬁcation “makes sense.” We moti-vate our work with examples from the ﬁeldof eGovernment applications and supportour model with an empirical analysis, us-ing real-world traces of news syndication.Keywords: Ontology evolution, Contexts, Seman-tic interpretation, eGovernment applications
