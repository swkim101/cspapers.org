Many agricultural tasks are known to be dangerous for human operators, the environment, and human health in general. The increasing pressure both on safety and on production levels motivates the development of new methodologies and technologies. The rising of off-road mobile robots for agricultural application appears to be a promising contribution to required innovations. It both permits to limit the exposure of people to hazardous products and to achieve difficult and repetitive tasks. Nevertheless, to be fully efficient, autonomous robots have to ensure a high level of accuracy, while carrying potentially heavy tools, possibly in harsh conditions. It is especially the case of spraying, for which accuracy is a key challenge for reducing environmental impacts. The use of huge robots for spraying might seem to be a straightforward solution, by simply automating existing machines. Nevertheless, a simple automation does not reduce directly the environmental impact of human activities (soil compaction, energy, reduction of the use of chemical products). Moreover, huge machines are not necessarily an advantage when considering safety aspects (rollover risk and maneuverability). As a result, a solution based on the cooperation of at least two mobile robots, moving from either side of a vine row, is investigated in this paper thanks to Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology.
