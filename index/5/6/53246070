This research examines spontaneous spoken disfluencies during human-computer interaction, presents a predictive model accounting for their occurrence, and outlines interface techniques for minimizing disfluent input. Data were collected during two studies in which people spoke to a highly interactive simulated system. Two factors were associated with an increase in speech disfluency rates: lengthiness of utterance, and lack of structure in the presentation format. In these studies, structural changes to the presentation format eliminated 70% of all disfluent speech. The long-term goal of this research is to provide empiriczd guidance for the design of robust spoken language technology.
