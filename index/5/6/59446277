Proposed a quantitative model for enterprises to make decision in the investments of Computer Aided Innovation (CAI) projects, based on investigations in 12 cases. The model considered the principle of performance-based budgeting, consisting of three main components: (A) a performance indicator system consists of 5 domains, (B) a nonlinear evaluation algorithm based on innovation project risk theory, (C) a theoretical model for budget decision on the project investment. Part of the model has been verified and applied in some corporations. The paper discussed the performance evaluation model and the budget decision model, and compared the evaluation results from the model to that from professional experts.
