In multi-robot systems, although the idea of behaviors allows for an efficient solution to low-level tasks, high-level missions can rarely be achieved by the execution of a single behavior. In contrast to this, a sequence of behaviors would provide the requisite expressiveness, but there are no a priori guarantees that the sequence is composable in the sense that the robots can actually execute it. In order to guarantee a provably correct composition of behaviors, Finite-Time Convergence Control Barrier Functions are introduced in this paper to guarantee the terminal configuration of one behavior is a valid initial configuration for the following one. Nominal control inputs prescribed by the behaviors are modified in a minimally invasive fashion, in order to establish the information-exchange network required by the following behavior. The effectiveness of the proposed composition strategy is validated on a team of mobile robots.
