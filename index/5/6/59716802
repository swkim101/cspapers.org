This paper documents some of the hurdles that were encountered during a semester long project to implement Brill 's POS tagger for Arabic. These hurdles include: word ambiguity due to lack of short vowels, objects comprised of multiple lexemes, lack of tagged training corpora (until very recently), and the unavailability of machine-readable dictionaries. In general there seems no way to avoid the necessity for a front-end phase that partiall y parses the morphology and encliti cs. Results were stil l promising that in the process of building the tagger's dictionary we could semi-automatically tag a training corpus.
