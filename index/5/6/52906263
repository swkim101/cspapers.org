Due to the slowdown of Dennard scaling and the dark silicon era, computer architects introduce hardware accelerators to maintain expected performance improvements without violating power budgets. These accelerators improve energy efficiency over a processorâ€™s general-purpose pipeline and increase performance by trading off software flexibility for performance. Initial hardware accelerators often targeted large tasks, such as video encoding [1], graphics, etc. Then, looselycoupled sea of accelerators [2] became a model to accelerate several different domains. On the other hand, today, we see tightly-coupled accelerator proposals for heap management, hash maps, string functions, and fine-grained tasks [3] [4]. SIMD is in the same class of fine-grained acceleration, where a small group of operations are replaced by a single instruction.
