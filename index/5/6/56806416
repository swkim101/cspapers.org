Modeling is a process of making a model that is an idealized and simplified representation of various objects in the real world and constructed by interpreting and analyzing the target world from a specific viewpoint. Many researchers have paid much attention to building modeling frameworks. The UML is a typical research result acquired by concentrating the know-how on the software development processes. It plays a central role as the foundation that facilitates the model driven system development. But on the other hand, specifying the modeling language is not enough to regulate the fluctuations of modeling. This paper addresses our ontological approach to constructing a framework for accumulating sophisticated modeling premises and illustrates our ontologies as modeling premises ad their operational semantics. In this paper, we firstly describe an overview of our ontology based modeling framework whereby ontology plays a role as modeling premises. Lastly, we illustrate our ontologies and an ontology based conceptual model management function that facilitates the communication among agents.
