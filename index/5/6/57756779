We focus on the task of amodal 3D object detection, which is to predict object locations, dimensions, poses and categories in the real world. We introduce a 3D Convolutional Neural Network that takes a volumetric representation of an indoor scene as input and predicts 3D object bounding boxes, object categories, and orientations. Unlike prior state-of-the-arts, our approach does not depend on region proposal techniques to hypothesize object locations. We treat detection and recognition as one regression problem in a single network. Our elegant model is extremely fast and all predictions are reasoned from the global context of a point cloud in a continuous pipeline. We evaluate our approach on two standard datasets: the NYUv2 RGBD dataset and the SUN RGBD dataset. Experiments show that our approach is faster than start-of-the-art 3D detectors by several orders of magnitude towards real-time amodal 3D object detection.
