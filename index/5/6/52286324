To achieve immersive and natural navigation in a virtual environment through human locomotion, it is necessary to generate a 2-dimensional infinite ground for omnidirectional walking. However, the existing omnidirectional treadmills are heavy, complex and exhibit low acceleration due to power transmission inefficiency. In this paper, we present a novel fast-omnidirectional treadmill (F-ODT) with a new power transmission mechanism called the Geared Omni-pulley. This mechanism ensures higher power transmission efficiency for driving the belts of the multiple transversal treadmills for independent Y-axis motion. Due to the improved power transmission performance combined with a simpler and relatively light-weight structure, the proposed 2D treadmill can generate a maximum speed of 3m/sec with an acceleration of 3m/sec2. Based on the improved performance, the F-ODT system can be used as a locomotion interface platform in various virtual reality environments such as training of soldiers, gaming/educational experiences and gait rehabilitation.
