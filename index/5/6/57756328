This paper describes a procedure to design a passive nonlinear impedance control for port-Hamiltonian systems. By expressing the system with the port-Hamiltonian system, the proposed method can be applied to the nonholonomic system as well as fully actuated mechanical systems. The feedback controller for nonlinear impedance control is acquired by utilizing the results of generalized canonical transformation for port-Hamiltonian system. In addition, we investigate the passivity of the closed loop system and discuss the characteristics of the controlled system. A numerical simulation of two-wheeled vehicle shows the effectiveness of the proposed control method.
