"Plan recognition as planning" uses an off-the-shelf planner to perform goal recognition. In this paper, we apply the technique to path-planning. We show that a simpler formula provides an identical result in all but one set of conditions and, further, that identical ranking of goals by probability can be achieved without using any observations other than the agent's start location and where she is "now".
