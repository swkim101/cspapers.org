The eBug is a low-cost and open robotics platform designed for undergraduate teaching and academic research in areas such as multimedia smart sensor networks, distributed control, mobile wireless communication algorithms and swarm robotics. The platform is easy to use, modular and extensible. Thus far, it has been used in a variety of applications, including an eight-hour demonstration managed by undergraduates at the Monash University Open Day. This paper describes both the eBug hardware and software which is in the process of being open-sourced online. The paper also highlights several research applications of the eBug, including its use in a wireless control testbed and as the eyeBug; an eBug that senses the world in real-time using the Microsoft Kinect.
