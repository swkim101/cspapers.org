A relative new trend in machine learning is interactive learning. Rather than passively absorbing knowledge, a learning agent can shape its learning experience through interaction with its teacher. As such, the learning becomes a bidirectional exchange. In a series of experiments, both in simulation and using a robotic platform, we examine how a learner that actively tries to influence the learning session can become more effective. Results show how interactive learning leads to more effective and faster learning, as social cues provided by the robot are picked up by human teachers. In addition, we observed gender differences, with female interactants being significantly more receptive to social cues displayed by the robot.
