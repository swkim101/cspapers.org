This paper presents a parallel robotic mechanism for endoscope tip stabilization and guidance for a robot-assisted minimally invasive laser osteotome. The mechanism attaches to the bone of the patient, providing a stable and robust platform for the laser integrated in the endoscope tip which has to be moved precisely in the sub-millimeter range along a preoperatively planned path. This method is only possible because cutting bone with laser instead of using conventional bone drills and saws involves considerably lower interaction forces. The design, kinematics, control, and motion performance of the concept are presented for an upscaled prototype. The obtained deviation of the endoscope tip motion from the reference path lies in the sub-millimeter range. This result allows us to conclude that the concept is more than promising. Furthermore, we expect that the herein presented principle will influence the way osteotomies will be performed in the future.
