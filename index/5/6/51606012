Traffic congestion has a significant impact on quality of life and the economy. This paper presents a decentralised traffic management mechanism for intersections using a distributed constraint optimisation approach (DCOP). Our solution outperforms the state of the art solution both for stable traffic conditions (about 60% reduced waiting time) and robustness to unpredictable events.Â
