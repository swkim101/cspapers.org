In this work, we introduce a framework for performing dexterous manipulations on the humanoid robot Robonaut-2. This framework memorizes how actions change perceptions and can learn a sequence of actions based on demonstrations. With the anthropomorphic Robonaut-2 hand and arm, a variety of manipulation tasks such as grasping novel objects, rotating a drill for grasping, and tightening a bolt with a ratchet can be accomplished. This framework was also used to compete in the IROS2018 Fan Robotic Challenge that requires manipulating a hand fan and was a winner of the phase I modality A competition.
