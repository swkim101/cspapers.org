This paper presents measurements of human hand-impedance during a laparoscopic training program with physically interactive robotic manipulators. The knowledge of how the hand-impedance changes due to training might be useful to inform better training programs and to introduce co-manipulated robotic assistants for effective trainings. Ten novice subjects participated in a three weeks training program for a suturing activity in laparoscopy. The subjects have been instructed to set the needle, enter the skin, and tie knots by using laparoscopic tools within a Minimally Invasive Surgery training box. Variable admittance controlled robots, attached to the tools with force sensors, applied step vice velocity disturbances while subjects were trying to set the needle. Based on the interaction force and end-effector position information, impedances of the left and right hands were computed in four different directions. The computed results were compared with respect to the participants skill progression.
