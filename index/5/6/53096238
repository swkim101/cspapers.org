In this paper we address configuration and management issues of smart homes. Current platforms requires the user to deal with several management inconvenience problems, such as increasing devices, operating between devices, and using new devices. From a user perspective, system configuration and management are major issues: ordinary consumers want to use systems performing minimal configuration. To address this issue, we propose a platform, composed of a web application and Software Defined Network (SDN). While the user interacts with an easy-to-use interface on a smart device, the app automatically generates and installs SDN rules. Our platform, besides facilitating configuration and management, results more efficient --- up to 4 times faster --- and reliable --- able to operate even in case of no connection with the cloud --- than current solutions.
