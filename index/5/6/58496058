UML-B is a graphical front end for Event-B. It adds support for class-oriented modelling but retains the Event-B concept of a closed system characterized by families of spontaneous events. UML-B is similar to UML but is essentially a new notation based on a separate meta-model. We provide tool support for UML-B, including drawing tools and a translator to generate Event-B models. The tools are closely integrated with the Event-B verification tools so that when a drawing is saved the translator automatically generates the corresponding Event-B model. The Event-B verification tools (syntax checker and prover) then run automatically providing an immediate display of problems. We introduce the UML-B notation its tool support and its integration with Event-B.
