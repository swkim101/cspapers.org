The exponential growth in PVT corners due to Moore's law scaling, and the increasing demand for consumer applications and longer battery life in mobile devices, has ushered in significant cost and power-related challenges for designing and productizing mobile chips within a predictable schedule. Two main reasons for this are the reliance on human decision-making to achieve the desired performance within the target area and power budget, and significant increases in complexity of the human decision-making space. The problem is that to-date human design experience has not been replaced by design automation tools, and tasks requiring experience of past designs are still being performed manually.In this paper we investigate how machine learning may be applied to develop tools that learn from experience just like human designers, thus automating tasks that still require human intervention. The potential advantage of the machine learning approach is the ability to scale with increasing complexity and therefore hold the design-time constant with same manpower.Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning technique that allows us to mimic a human designers' ability to learn from experience and automate human decision-making, without loss in quality of the design, while making the design time independent of the complexity. In this paper we show how manual design tasks can be abstracted as RL problems. Based on the experience with applying RL to one of these problems, we show that RL can automatically achieve results similar to human designs, but in a predictable schedule. However, a major drawback is that the RL solution can require a prohibitively large number of iterations for training. If efficient training techniques can be developed for RL, it holds great promise to automate tasks requiring human experience. In this paper we present a Bayesian Optimization technique for reducing the RL training time.
