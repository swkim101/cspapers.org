Centrifugal compressors are widely used in oil and gas industries. In order to achieve maximum profit, compressors should be used at maximum efficiency and with the least possible power consumption. The working range of centrifugal compressors is limited due to their flow rate. High flow rate cause in reducing compressor pressure ratio which can leads to choking. On the other hand, if the flow rate is less than a certain threshold, it will cause surge phenomenon in the compressor. In surge state, pressure and flow rate of output gas fluctuate, which can cause vibration in accessories such as pipes, fittings, etc., and can lead to serious damage to facilities and equipment [1]. There are two ways to deal with the surge phenomenon: controlling active surge and controlling anti-surge. The first method is trying to stabilize the surge, while the second method prevents the compressor working point from reaching the surge line and keeps it permanently to the right side of the line [2]. In Figure 1, characteristic curves of a typical centrifugal compressor can be seen. In this diagram, the vertical axis shows the compressor output pressure ratio to its input pressure and the horizontal axis shows the flow rate and parallel curves of different compressor RPMs. There is a “surge line” for each compressor that shows the values of the flow rates and the RPMs that cause the compressor to surge. “Surge control line” specifies the boundary of the area that anti-surge controller allows the compressor to operate. The area to the right of this line is the stable operation area of the compressor.
