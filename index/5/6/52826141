Tensor-based methods have shown promise in improving upon traditional matrix factorization methods for recommender systems. But tensors may achieve improved recommendation quality while worsening the fairness of the recommendations. Hence, we propose a novel fairness-aware tensor recommendation framework that is designed to maintain quality while dramatically improving fairness. Four key aspects of the proposed framework are: (i) a new sensitive latent factor matrix for isolating sensitive features; (ii) a sensitive information regularizer that extracts sensitive information which can taint other latent factors; (iii) an effective algorithm to solve the proposed optimization model; and (iv) extension to multi-feature and multi-category cases which previous efforts have not addressed. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show that the framework enhances recommendation fairness while preserving recommendation quality in comparison with state-of-the-art alternatives.
