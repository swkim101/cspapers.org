People tend to choose short and predictable passwords that are vulnerable to guessing attacks. Passphrases are passwords consisting of multiple words, initially introduced as more secure authentication keys that people could recall. Unfortunately, people tend to choose predictable natural language patterns in passphrases, again resulting in vulnerability to guessing attacks. One solution could be system-assigned passphrases, but people have difficulty recalling them. With the goal of improving the usability of system-assigned passphrases, we propose a new approach of reinforcing system-assigned passphrases using implicit learning techniques. We design and test a system that implements this approach using two implicit learning techniques: contextual cueing and semantic priming. In a 780-participant online study, we explored the usability of 4-word system-assigned passphrases using our system compared to a set of control conditions. Our study showed that our system significantly improves usability of system-assigned passphrases, both in terms of recall rates and login time.
