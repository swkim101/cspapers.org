The present study highlights the benefits of using well-controlled experimental designs, grounded in experimental psychology research and objective neuroscientific methods, for generating progress in human-robot interaction (HRI) research. More specifically, we aimed at implementing a well-studied paradigm of attentional cueing through gaze (the so-called “joint attention” or “gaze cueing”) in an HRI protocol involving the iCub robot. Similarly to documented results in gaze-cueing research, we found faster response times and enhanced event-related potentials of the EEG signal for discrimination of cued, relative to uncued, targets. These results are informative for the robotics community by showing that a humanoid robot with mechanistic eyes and human-like characteristics of the face is in fact capable of engaging a human in joint attention to a similar extent as another human would do. More generally, we propose that the methodology of combining neuroscience methods with an HRI protocol, contributes to understanding mechanisms of human social cognition in interactions with robots and to improving robot design, thanks to systematic and well-controlled experimentation tapping onto specific cognitive mechanisms of the human, such as joint attention.
