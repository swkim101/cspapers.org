Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) are being successfully used for the monitoring of large-scale systems that are delay-tolerant and which have low-bandwidth requirements. The next step would be instrumenting these for the control of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) distributed over large areas which require more bandwidth, bounded delays and higher reliability or at least more rigorous guarantees therein. This paper presents LPWA-MAC, a novel Low Power Wide-Area network MAC protocol, that ensures bounded end-to-end delays, high channel utility and supports many of the different traffic patterns and data-rates typical of CPS.
