Wheels are the conventional mode of locomotion, especially for planetary exploration robots. These missions require long distances on limited power over discontinuous terrain. These requirements make the wheel a major component contributing to performance. Any enhancement that can be made to a wheel will enhance the total vehicleâ€™s performance in that area. One area of interest is skid steer turning, which is a simple practical approach to vehicle design. A
