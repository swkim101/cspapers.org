Welcome to the 19th SOSP, and to the beautiful Adirondack mountains of New York State! Larry Peterson and his committee have put together a strong and varied technical program, showcasing the most significant and influential work in operating systems today. Other program highlights include the poster and work-in-progress sessions, the Anita Borg luncheon and the evening banquet on Monday, and the SIGOPS business meeting Tuesday evening. The banquet will include presentation of the third annual Mark Weiser award, and eulogies for Roger Needham and Anita Borg, both of whom were lost to us this year. The business meeting will include presentation of awards in the first-ever SIGOPS division of the ACM Student Research Competition (SRC).Entrants in the SRC include all the regular papers and posters on which a student is principal author. To help to put the competition on an equal footing, four poster finalists will be making formal presentations during the session on Monday afternoon. Many thanks to Kevin Jeffay and his subcommittee for organizing the poster session and judging the submissions, and to Ann Sobel for her help in bringing SIGOPS into the SRC.Continuing the tradition of past SOSPs, we have encouraged student attendance through reduced registration fees and a strong program of financial scholarships. Generous support for this program has come from Microsoft via the SRC, from the National Science Foundation (CISE CCR), from Hewlett-Packard Labs, and from SIGOPS itself. Thanks to Cary Gray and his scholarship committee (John Carter, Norm Hutchinson, Marc Shapiro, and Bob Wisniewski) for their outstanding work under very tight time constraints.
