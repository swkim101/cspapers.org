Main-memories are prone to attacks [1], [4], [12] that allow an adversary to take control of the system by reading and tampering memory-contents. Commercial solutions like Intel’s Software Guard Extensions (SGX) [3] and AMD’s Secure Memory Encryption (SME) [5] attempt to secure memory against attacks. However, providing security requires accessing metadata, resulting in storage and performance overheads. In navigating this performance-security tradeoff, SGX and SME end up at different ends of the spectrum as shown in Fig 1.
