The problem of restraining the spreading of pandemics and the treatment of the infected by the influenza virus people is widely based on the latest achievements of molecular biology, cellular biology, biocomputing, as well as many other advanced areas of modern science. In this paper we have performed comparative analyses of viral nucleotide sequences and finding out consensus motifs and variable domains in the different segments of influenza virus A/H1N1 genome on the basis of parallel computer simulation. For this purpose a parallel computational model based on parallel ClustalW algorithm for multiple sequence alignment is suggested. The suggested model has been verified on the basis of parallel program implementations on a heterogeneous compact cluster.
