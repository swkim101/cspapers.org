Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communications technology is an essential substrate to realize future road intelligence and autonomous driving, especially in the areas where there are no existing (radio) network infrastructure. The emerging visible light backscatter communication technique shows great potentials in enabling the massive on-road retroreflective objects to delivery dynamic information to host vehicles. In this work, we design a polarization-based differential reception scheme to suppress ambient noise and realize long range retroreflective V2X communications.
