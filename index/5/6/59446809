This paper evaluates the latest GPU generation from NVIDIA, called "Fermi", with respect to the previous generation. The experiments include benchmarks of elementary kernels as well as of linear solvers applied to problems arising in the area of computational fluid dynamics. Both the consumer version of the hardware (GeForce GTX 480 and GTX 280) as well as the professional line (Tesla C2050 and C1060) are taken into account.
