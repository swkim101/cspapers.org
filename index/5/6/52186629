Panels are an opportunity for learning and engaging in dialog, in an informal environment. Each panel member contributes a unique perspective on a topic, and then you have the opportunity to ask questions and contribute new ideas.
 As I look at the Panels that we have scheduled, I am confident that we will provide both educational and entertaining experiences. Each focuses on a timely, relevant, and important topic: Going Green with Refactoring: Sustaining the "World Wide Virtual Machine": What exciting advances have been made in refactoring strategies and tools to help sustain rapid growth of system scale and scope? Language-based Security as Extreme Modularity: How can programming language design help us write abstractions robust against malice and accident, at little cost to expressiveness? Multicore, Manycore, and Cloud Computing: Is a new programming language paradigm required? Does the arrival of multicore, manycore, and cloud computing mean that we need new languages with new programming paradigms, and if so, what should these new languages look like? Industry-Academic Research Partnerships in the Age of Big Data and Global Computing Networks: Research partnerships between industry and academia are grown through relationships, a desire for innovation, and opportunities for sponsorship. Can we improve research engagement strategies?
