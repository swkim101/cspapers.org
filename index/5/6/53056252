Volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can bring any network to a halt. Because of their distributed nature and high volume, the victim often cannot handle these attacks alone and needs help from upstream ISPs. Today's Internet has no automated mechanism for victims to ask ISPs for help in attack handling and ISPs themselves do not offer such services. We propose SENSS, a security service for collaborative mitigation of volumetric DDoS attacks. SENSS enables the victim of an attack to request attack monitoring and filtering on demand, and to pay for the services rendered. Requests can be sent both to the immediate and to remote ISPs, in an automated and secure manner, and can be authenticated by these ISPs, without having prior trust with the victim. Simple and generic SENSS APIs enable victims to build custom detection and mitigation approaches against a variety of DDoS attacks. SENSS is deployable with today's infrastructure, and it has strong economic incentives both for ISPs and for the attack victims. It is also very effective in sparse deployment, offering full protection to direct customers of early adopters, and considerable protection to remote victims when deployed strategically. Deployment on the largest 1% of ISPs protects not just direct customers of these ISPs, but everyone on the Internet, from 90% of volumetric DDoS attacks.
