Quadrotor state estimation generally relies on the vehicle aerodynamics modeling to achieve improved performance. In this paper the effects of the rotors angular speeds on the quadrotor drag, and therefore on the lateral accelerations, are investigated. While these effects are usually disregarded, we analyze their modeling starting from the Blade Element Theory and flight test data. Two lateral acceleration formulations are proposed. They are adopted within a velocity and attitude state estimator and validated in real-world flights. The EKF-based estimator fuses measurements from low-cost sensors present in the majority of quadrotors (IMU, magnetometer, ultrasonic sensor, optical flow) with the accelerations of the vehicle predicted from the revisited models. Experimental results show the benefits of adopting these innovative models in the estimator when compared with the existing modeling approach.
