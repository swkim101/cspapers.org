This paper presents a free-space open-loop dynamic response analysis for an MRI -guided magnetically-actuated steerable intra-vascular catheter system. The catheter tip is embedded with a set of current carrying micro-coils. The catheter is directly actuated via the magnetic torques generated on these coils by the magnetic field of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)scanner. The relationship between the input current commands and catheter tip deflection angle presents an inherent nonlinearity in the proposed catheter system. The system nonlinearity is analyzed by utilizing a pendulum model. The pendulum model is used to describe the system nonlinearity and to perform an approximate input-output linearization. Then, a black-box system identification approach is performed for frequency response analysis of the linearized dynamics. The optimal estimated model is reduced by observing the modes and considering the Nyquist frequency of the camera system that is used to track the catheter motion. The reduced model is experimentally validated with $3D$ open-loop Cartesian free-space trajectories. This study paves the way for effective and accurate free-space closed-loop control of the robotic catheter with real-time feedback from MRI guidance in subsequent research.
