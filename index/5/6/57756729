A novel gait planning and control framework was developed for quadruped locomotion of a robot. It modeled the quadruped robot as two bipeds carrying the body from the front and rear ends. We first mapped the relationship between the joint torques of support legs and the torso forces of the bipedal sub-robots. Then the equations describing the relationship between the quadruped body forces and the bipedal torso forces under various operating modes of the robot were deduced and solved. Virtual forces were generated on the quadruped body to manipulate its velocity and orientation. Then these virtual forces were distributed to the front and hind sub-robots to generate support leg torques. The state machines and gait generators for the two bipedal sub-robots were designed individually, resulting in the decoupling of the gait parameters in the front legs and hind legs. The effectiveness of the controller was validated through dynamic simulations.
