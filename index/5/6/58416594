For several years, adaptive range genetic algorithms have been developed and it turned out to be very efficient in treatment of both discrete variables and continuous variables. That means it is useful tools for mixed variable problem, which was thought most daunting problem in design engineering. We have shown its effectiveness through benchmark problems and outperformed the other method in its accuracy. In this paper, we will newly develop a new type of Adaptive Range Genetic Algorithms, which will consider inheritance of searching range. We have demonstrated its effectiveness through benchmark problem and showed its characters. Through numerical example, we showed the stability and effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the conventional method.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
