The aim of this study was to develop a walking assistance device by controlling trunk and pelvis motion. Human gait motion is a whole-body exercise that includes both lower body and upper body motion. Therefore, focusing on trunk and pelvic rotational motion, assist and resist the walking by applying external forces. By introducing periodic input control, control the timing of the supplementary force, and assist the walking. As an experimental result, the walking assistance improves gait by decreasing energy loss, and the walking resistance applies a load during walking.
