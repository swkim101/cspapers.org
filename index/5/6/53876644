It is our pleasure to welcome you to MobiArch 2011, the sixth edition of the MobiArch workshop series that focuses on architectural issues arising from mobility. The phenomenal adoption rate of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has made mobility a pervasive characteristic of today's Internet. Effectively supporting mobile devices requires addressing issues such as decoupling location from identity, multi-homing, security, and energy efficiency. The workshop provides an interactive venue for researchers interested in exploring these issues. 
 
This year's workshop received 14 papers, of which 7 were selected for inclusion in the program. We thank all authors who submitted their work. We also thank the members of the technical program committee who helped with the selection process through their reviews and discussions. 
 
In addition to paper presentations, the program includes a panel discussion on maintaining connectivity to mobile devices. This a problem for which solutions were originally proposed over 15 years ago, and yet, it continues to attract attention from the research and engineering communities. 
 
We hope that you will find this program interesting and thought provoking, and that the workshop will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.
