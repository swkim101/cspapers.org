Science journalism is the art of conveying a detailed scientific research paper in a form that non-scientists can understand and appreciate while ensuring that its underlying information is conveyed accurately. It plays a crucial role in making scientific content suitable for consumption by the public at large. In this work, we introduce the problem of automating some parts of the science journalism workflow by automatically generating the 'title' of a blog version of a scientific paper. We have built a corpus of $87,328$ pairs of research papers and their corresponding blogs from two science news aggregators and have used it to buildSci ence-Blogger - a pipeline-based architecture consisting of a two-stage mechanism to generate the blog titles. Evaluation using standard metrics indicate viability of the proposed system.
