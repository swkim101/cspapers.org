This paper presents the design, modeling and fabrication of a millimeter-size Continuum Soft Robot (CSR). The robot consists of active flexible polymer actuator-based multisegment robot. A multiphysics model based on multilayer cantilever for large displacement is established between the input voltages to the distal tip position of a single segment robot. The extension of the model to multisegment CSR is derived. The proposed model is validated experimentally then a two-segment CSR and three-segment CSR in 3D arrangement are investigated, demonstrating the model efficiency for obtaining complex configuration. Moreover, various configurations can be explored to derive complex kinematics then increasing the robot capability.
