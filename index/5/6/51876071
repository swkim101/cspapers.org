With the recent success of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in Machine Translation (MT), attention mechanisms have become increasingly popular. The purpose of this paper is two-fold; firstly, we propose a novel attention model on Tree Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Tree-LSTMs), a tree-structured generalization of standard LSTM. Secondly, we study the interaction between attention and syntactic structures, by experimenting with three LSTM variants: bidirectional-LSTMs, Constituency Tree-LSTMs, and Dependency Tree-LSTMs. Our models are evaluated on two semantic relatedness tasks: semantic relatedness scoring for sentence pairs (SemEval 2012, Task 6 and SemEval 2014, Task 1) and paraphrase detection for question pairs (Quora, 2017).
