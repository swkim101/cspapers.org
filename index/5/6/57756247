The dolphin kick is a swimming style characterized by undulation of the body. As a platform for swimming research, we have developed a musculoskeletal humanoid robot called Triton. Triton has a flexible spine with erector spinae muscles and a stiffness adjustment system for lumbar joints. The musculoskeletal body includes biarticular and polyarticular muscles, providing multi-joint coordination. The robot is actuated by pneumatic muscles, yielding lightweight and inherently waterproof properties. The compliance of the joints allows interactions between body and fluid similar to those of human swimming. This study presents the design concept of Triton and experimental results from a water tank test. We compare the results with simulation and human movements reported in literature. The results show that the musculoskeletal swimming robot has similar cycle trends in joint angle and thrust force.
