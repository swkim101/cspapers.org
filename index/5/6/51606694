Novice users require assistance when performing handicraft tasks. Adequate instruction ensures task completion and conveys knowledge and abilities required to perform the task. We present an assistant teaching novice users how to operate electronic tools, such as drills, saws, and sanders, in the context of Do-It-Yourself (DIY) home improvement projects. First, the actions that need to be performed for the project are determined by a planner. Second, a dialogue manager capable of natural language interaction presents these actions as instructions to the user. Third, questions on these actions and involved objects are answered by generating appropriate ontology-based explanations.
