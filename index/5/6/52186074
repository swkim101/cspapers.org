SPLASH and Onward! workshops are a great way to grow your knowledge and expand your professional network. They are highly interactive events that provide a creative and collaborative environment where attendees meet to discuss and solve challenging problems related to a variety of new emerging technologies and research areas.
 Over the past two decades, the OOPSLA workshops provided an incubator for exploring many of the ideas that went on to shape general software practice (for example, design patterns, UML, aspect-oriented programming, and agile methods). That tradition continues this year both within the new charter for SPLASH established last year, and incorporating the visionary focus of Onward!
 This year, SPLASH and Onward! offer twelve workshops that represent a diverse set of technology and research topics. Areas covered by the workshops include actors, agents, agile practices, cloud-based computing, decentralized control, embedded systems, evaluation and usability of programming languages and tools, foundations of object-oriented programming, free composition, legacy code, multicore programming, objectoriented and domain-specific modelling, programming languages and runtimes for internet clients, smartphone applications, and virtual machines. The summaries included in this companion provide an introduction to the goals and objectives of each workshop.
 We welcome you to these workshops with the hope that the discussions are productive and fruitful, and assist in fostering new collaborations that extend beyond the borders of the conference!
