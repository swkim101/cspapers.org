Search queries issued over the Web increasingly look like questions, especially as the domain becomes more specific. Finding good response to such queries amounts to finding relevant passages from Web documents. Traditional information retrieval based Web search still matches the query to the words in the entire document. With the advent of machine reading comprehension techniques, Web search is moving more towards identifying the best sentence / group of sentences in the document. We present AQuPR an A ttention based Qu ery P assage R etrieval system to find human acceptable answer containing passages to technology queries issued over the Web. We train character level embeddings for the query and passage pairs, train a deep recurrent network with a novel simplified attention mechanism and incorporate additional signals present in Web documents to improve the performance of such a system. We collect a database of human issued queries along with their answer passages and learn an end to end system to enable automated query resolution. We present results for answering human issued search queries which show considerable promise against basic versions of current generation question answering systems.
