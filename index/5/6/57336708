The analysis of concurrent real time systems involves dealing with issues like time dependant execution semantics as well as behaviour complexity due to a large number of execution schemes in the concurrent applications. In this paper we exploit the structure of communicating timed components to address the previous issues while attempting to avoid the complexity related to the construction of the global product of the communicating subcomponents. We propose a new simulation approach based on (1) grid automata semantics and (2) composition of previously computed patterns. This enables the design of simulation scenarios against concurrent real-time applications, with low cost. An example is presented to illustrate the results of the method.
