Consider the problem of disseminating data from an arbitrary source node to all other nodes in a distributed computer system, like Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). We assume that wireless broadcast is used and nodes do not know the topology. We propose new protocols which disseminate data faster and use fewer broadcasts than the simple broadcast protocol.
