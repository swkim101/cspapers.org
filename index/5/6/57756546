Versatile multi-modal robots are advantageous for their wider operational environments. By taking design principles from observation of Pteromyini, commonly known as the flying squirrel, which shows balanced performances in both aerial and terrestrial locomotion, a novel robotic platform with the ability of gliding and walking is designed. The flexible membrane and gliding method of Pteromyini have been applied to the robot design. The legs of the robot were optimized to perform with regulated motor torques in both walking and gliding. The robot glided with an average gliding ratio of 1.88 and controlled its angle-of-attack for slowing down to land safely. The robot was able to walk utilizing different gait patterns. These results demonstrated our robot's balanced multi-modal locomotion of gliding and walking.
