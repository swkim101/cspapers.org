The regrasping function of a robotic hand and arm has been investigated by many studies. Dynamic regrasping is performed by accelerating objects and it has the advantage of being able to perform the regrasp function at high speed. However, the difficulty of increasing the success rate is a persistent problem. In this study, we aimed to realize this continuous high-speed operation by increasing the success rate of the regrasping function. The handling of the Rubik's cube was used as the specific task to be performed. The action that was required to handle the Rubik's cube consisted of two types of regrasping motion and one type of one-face turn motion. In this study, a Rubik's cube was placed in a plane and manipulated by combining these three types of motion. Continuous operation was realized with a robotic hand and high-speed vision by utilizing environmental constraints in order to minimize the error. As a result, we succeeded 3 times in turning and regrasping in 1 s. Additionally, we were able to succeed 30 times in turning and regrasping in 10 s, with a success rate of 70%.
