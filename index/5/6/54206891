In this paper we present a system based on the LSA paradigm to improve the performance of a traditional information retrieval system. The proposed system aims to improve both the recall and the precision capabilities of traditional search engines thanks to a semantic query expansion and a subsequent semantic results filtering. A collection of 650 documents has been used to compare the performances of the proposed system with a traditional search engine. Experimental trials show the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
