Welcome to the 6th International Workshop on Challenges of Large Applications in Distributed Environments (CLADE 2008) and to Boston, Massachusetts. 
 
Distributed cyberinfrastructure for the realization of e-Science and e-Business continues to be developed at a rapid pace and across diverse disciplines. This development reinforces the need for effective distributed applications. From sensor data to online data collections to remote visualization, the most challenging problems will be solved by applications that can make effective use of such distributed, heterogeneous resources. This workshop will highlight the successful development, deployment, management and evaluation of large scale applications and scientific workflows in science, engineering, medicine, business, economics, education, and other disciplines, on Grids and other distributed heterogeneous and dynamic computing environments. 
 
In addition, the program includes invited talks by stellar researchers of international reputation from research institutes such as Arizona, Chicago, Minnesota, MIT, Rutgers, and SDSC, and industry such as Intel and Microsoft. CLADE 2008 also features a keynote on autonomic computing paradigms to enable self-* applications. These invited talks cover a wide spectrum of the-state-of-the-art technologies in large-scale computing and applications, including autonomic computing engines for Internet-scale applications, high-productivity computing for datacenters, multicore programming, and scalable computing on open distributed systems. A special talk will investigate "Lessons Learnt from CLADE" for retrospections on the past CLADE experiences and ushering in new era of large-scale applications and environments.
