In this paper, we resolve the one-pass space complexity of L_p sampling for p ε (0,2). Given a stream of updates (insertions and deletions) to the coordinates of an underlying vector f ε R^n, a perfect L_p sampler must output an index i with probability |f_i|^p/|f|_p^p, and is allowed to fail with some probability δ. So far, for p > 0 no algorithm has been shown to solve the problem exactly using poly(log n)-bits of space. In 2010, Monemizadeh and Woodruff introduced an approximate L_p sampler, which outputs i with probability (1 ± v)|f_i|^p /|f|_p^p, using space polynomial in v^-1 and log(n). The space complexity was later reduced by Jowhari, Saglam, and Tardos to roughly O(v^-p log^2 n log δ^-1) for p ε (0,2), which tightly matches the Ω(log^2 n log δ^-1) lower bound in terms of n and δ, but is loose in terms of v. Given these nearly tight bounds, it is perhaps surprising that no lower bound at all exists in terms of v–not even a bound of Ω(v^-1) is known. In this paper, we explain this phenomenon by demonstrating the existence of an O(log^2 n log δ^-1)-bit perfect L_p sampler for p ε (0,2). This shows that v need not factor into the space of an L_p sampler, which completely closes the complexity of the problem for this range of P. For p=2, our bound is O(log^3 n log δ^-1)-bits, which matches the prior best known upper bound of O(v^-2log^3 n log δ^-1), but has no dependence on v. Finally, we show that a (1± ε) relative error estimate of the frequency f_i of the sampled index i can be obtained using an additional O(ε^-p log n)-bits of space for p < 2, and O(ε^-2 log^2 n) bits for p=2, which was possible before only by running the prior algorithms with v = ε.
