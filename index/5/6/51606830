DL^N is a recent nonmonotonic description logic, designed for satisfying independently proposed knowledge engineering requirements, and for removing some recurrent drawbacks of traditional nonmonotonic semantics. In this paper we study the logical properties of DL^N and their relationships with the KLM postulates. We use various versions of the KLM postulates to deepen the comparison with related work, and illustrate the different tradeoffs between opposite expressivity requirements adopted by each approach.
