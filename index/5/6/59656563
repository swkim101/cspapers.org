For nearly four decades, the annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing has been a forum for the presentation of some of the most significant advances in the theory of computing. It is a pleasure to be able to take part in continuing this tradition. The 78 papers in this volume were presented at the 38th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), held May 21--23, 2006 in Seattle, and sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT). In addition to the papers, the symposium also featured two invited talks, by Prabhakar Raghavan (Yahoo! Research) and Russell Impagliazzo (UC San Diego).The papers at the conference were selected by the program committee from among 288 submissions. The program committee's initial discussions were carried out electronically; following this, the committee met at Columbia University January 20-21 to decide on the final set of accepted papers. In keeping with longstanding convention, the papers at the conference have not been formally refereed, and it is expected that more extended versions of most of them will be published in journals.From among many outstanding contributions, the committee selected Irit Dinur's paper, "The PCP Theorem via Gap Amplification," as the recipient of the Best Paper Award. The Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award was shared by two papers: "Extractors for a Constant Number of Polynomial Min-Entropy Independent Sources" by Anup Rao, and "Narrow Proofs May Be Spacious: Separating Space and Width in Resolution" by Jakob Nordstrom.
