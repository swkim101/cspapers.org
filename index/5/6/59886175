This paper outlines an approach toward computationally investigating the processes involved in reasoning about the knowledge states of other cognitive agents. The approach is Fregean and is compared with the work of McCarthy and Creary. We describe how the formalism represents the knowing of intensional individuals, coreferentiality, iterated propositional attitudes, and we describe plans to test, the scheme in the domain of speech act recognition.
