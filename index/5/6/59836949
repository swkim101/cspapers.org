In electrostatographic copying apparatus, a device for stripping copy sheets from an arcuate photoreceptor imaging surface comprising a stripping element having minor bearing surfaces only adjacent its leading and trailing ends and arranged to be pivotably connected to a support element at a first pivot point equidistant the bearing surfaces, and a support element pivotably mounted about a second pivot point and arranged to urge the stripping element towards the arcuate surface, the first pivot point lying at or closely beyond a tangent of the arcuate surface originating opposite the leading edge when in use, and the second pivot point lying at or closely beyond a line extending through the leading edge and the first pivot point.
