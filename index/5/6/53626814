In this paper we present a method for extracting IsA assertions (hyponymy relations), AtLoca-tion assertions (informing of the location of an object or place), LocatedNear assertions (informing of neighboring locations), CreatedBy assertions (informing of the creator of an object) and MemberOf assertions (informing of group membership) automatically from Japanese Wikipedia XML dump ﬁles. These assertions would be suitable for introduction to the Japanese part of the ConceptNet common sense knowledge ontology. We use the Hyponymy extraction tool v1.0, which analyzes deﬁnition, category and hierarchy structures of Wikipedia articles to extract IsA assertions and produce an information-rich taxonomy. From this taxonomy we extract additional information, in this case AtLocation, LocatedNear, Cre-atedBy and MemberOf types of assertions, using our original method. The presented experiments prove that we achieved our research goal on a large scale: both methods produce satisfactory results, and we were able to acquire 5,866,680 IsA assertions with 96.0% reliability, 131,760 AtLoca-tion assertion pairs with 93.5% reliability, 6,217 LocatedNear assertion pairs with 98.5% reliability, 270,230 CreatedBy assertion pairs with 78.5% reliability and 21,053 MemberOf assertions with 87.0% reliability. Our method surpassed the base-line system in terms of both precision and the number of acquired assertions.
