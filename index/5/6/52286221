Typical robot force control architectures have a positive force feedback loop to decouple robot dynamics from contact dynamics. Due to the noisy profile of force measurements, it is common to filter force signals by low pass filters. This paper shows that, when force feedback is filtered, robot and environment dynamics are no longer decoupled, affecting force control performance. Additionally, the perceived stiffness from the force control perspective, is correlated with the robot effective mass. To cope with this issue, a force based stiffness estimation strategy that also includes the inertial properties (effective mass) in the estimation algorithm is proposed, allowing to adapt control gains based on the robot effective mass. In this way, the perceived stiffness can be seen as a control optimization parameter, rather than a well defined physical property. Simulation and experimental results with a 1-DoF robot and 7-DoF manipulator, respectively, validate the estimation strategy, showing better force control results with the perceived stiffness in the control loop, as compared to the real environment stiffness.
