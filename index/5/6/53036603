The goal of hashing is to learn a low-dimensional binary representation of high-dimensional information, leading to a tremendous reduction of computational cost. Previous studies usually achieved this goal by applying projection or quantization methods. However, the projection method fails to capture the intrinsic data structures, and the quantization method cannot make full use of complete information by its strategy of partitioning original space. To combine their advantages and avoid their drawbacks, we propose a novel algorithm, termed as representative points quantization (RPQ), by using the representative points defined as the barycenters of points in the hyperoctants. To settle the problem of exponential time complexity with the growth of the coding length, for long hashing codes, we further propose a parallel RPQ (PRPQ) algorithm, by separating a long code into several short codes, re-coding the short codes in different low dimensional subspaces, and then concatenating them to a long code. Experiments on image retrieval tasks demonstrate that RPQ and PRPQ can well capture the main topology structure of data, showing that our algorithm achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods.
