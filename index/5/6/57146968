The TACKLE system is used to teach algorithmics and programming using sound software engineering principles like specificationwise correctness, topdown design, etc. Its tutoring strategy is based on Anderson's model-tracing methodology. Although Anderson's systems constrain the student in his/her program development, we show here that it is possible to use that methodology in a student-controlled, less constraining environment, without lowering its effectiveness and without losing the benefits of the underlying software engineering principles. This paper explains the particular problems encountered and presents the mechanisms used in TACKLE to deal with them.
