This paper describes use of Dublin Core metadata on the Exploit Interactive web magazine to provide enhanced searching services. A lightweight approach has been used which makes use of commercially available software. This approach provides a demonstration of the benefits of use of Dublin Core and shows how commercially-available software can be used to enable the benefits to be easily deployed without needing significant software development expertise.
