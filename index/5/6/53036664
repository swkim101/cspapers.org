As users implicitly express their preferences to items on many real-world applications, the implicit feedback based collaborative filtering has attracted much attention in recent years. Pairwise methods have shown state-of-the-art solutions for dealing with the implicit feedback, with the assumption that users prefer the observed items to the unobserved items. However, for each user, the huge unobserved items are not equal to represent her preference. In this paper, we propose a Multiple Pairwise Ranking (MPR) approach, which relaxes the simple pairwise preference assumption in previous works by further tapping the connections among items with multiple pairwise ranking criteria. Specifically, we exploit the preference difference among multiple pairs of items by dividing the unobserved items into different parts. Empirical studies show that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.
