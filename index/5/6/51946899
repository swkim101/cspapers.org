We consider Designer Experience (DX) in the context of user experience and explain how we break experience down into its physical, cognitive and contextual aspects. We use this to develop an explanation of the challenges to understanding older users’ experiences and look at methods we have employed to increase our understanding. We focus on video creation, its similarity to therapeutic role play and its potential to facilitate DX. We conclude by speculating about the potential role of iterative participatory design in DX, particularly hard challenges to DX in the domain of design with older users and some of DX’s possible limitations.
