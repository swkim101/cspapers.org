It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the First International Symposium on Social and Community Intelligence (SCI), associated with the International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp) 2011. The mission of the symposium is to provide an international forum for the discussion of challenges in the fields of SCI, including theoretical studies, practical issues, emerging technologies and applications. SCI gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of revealing the individual/group behaviors, social interactions, as well as community dynamics (e.g., city hot spots, traffic jams) by mining the digital traces left by people while interacting with cyber-physical spaces. 
 
The call for papers attracted 14 submissions from Asia, America and Europe. The program committee accepted 8 papers that cover a variety of topics, including Intelligent Social/ Community Services, Social Data Aggregation and Analysis, and Social Communication. In addition, the program includes two invited papers. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers in the SCI area.
