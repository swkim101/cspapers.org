Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) implement platform-independent data exchange with efficient and reliable messaging mechanism, what is the key technology of distributed systems integration. The traditional messaging middleware based on a specific platform or development tools, it has been unable to achieve in a loosely coupled manner, lack of adequate scalability and flexibility, it is difficult to meet the demand of system integration variability. This paper designs and implements a service-oriented messaging middleware Service-Oriented Message Queue (SOMQ). Characteristics of the model is the messaging middleware system according to service-oriented architecture is divided into different functional services that are independent of each other, and can according to the need to minimize the cost function combined. And SOMQ architecture is designed based the model, and the design and implementation of the system of internal modules are given.
