This paper significantly advanced the hybrid measurecorrelate-predict (MCP) methodology, enabling it to accou nt for the variations of both wind speed and direction. The advance d hybrid MCP method used the recorded data of multiple referen ce stations to estimate the long-term wind condition at the tar get wind plant site with greater accuracy than possible with dat a from a single reference station. The wind data was divided in to different sectors according to the wind direction, and the M CP strategy was implemented for each wind sector separately. T applicability of the proposed hybrid strategy was investig ated using four different MCP methods: (i) linear regression; (i i) variance ratio; (iii) artificial neural networks; and (iv) support vector regression. To implement the advanced hybrid MCP methodology, we used the hourly averaged wind data recorded at six stations in North Dakota between the years 2008 and 2010. The station Pillsbury was selected as the target plantsite. The recorded data at the other five stations (Dazey, Galesbur y,
