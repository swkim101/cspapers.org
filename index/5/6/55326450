This paper shows a comparison of two parallel algorithms for video compression that use predictive load balancing. One algorithm uses an exhaustive estimation of movements and the other one has an adaptive scheme. These algorithms are based on the H.264 standard of video compression and they are constructed using a Group of Pictures (GOP) level of parallelization. These algorithms are evaluated to determine their speedup when they are executed with a different number of nodes in a cluster processing videos of different types and resolutions. This evaluation is used for determining the equation that is used for calculating the number of nodes required to obtain a video compression in real time.
