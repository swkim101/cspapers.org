The field of otolaryngology has always looked towards technology for advances in medical therapeutics. The anatomical contours and complexities of this region, as well as the delicate structures and proximity of these to each other, pose diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical challenges. The use of endoscopes, for example, revolutionized the management of sinus disease. The introduction of the da Vinci surgical system and the application of robotics within head and neck surgery has been one of the most exciting developments within the field of head and neck surgery in the recent past.
