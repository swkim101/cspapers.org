Full-duplex (FD) wireless can significantly enhance spectrum efficiency but requires tremendous amount of self-interference (SI) cancellation. Recent advances in the RFIC community enabled wideband RF SI cancellation (SIC) in integrated circuits (ICs) via frequency-domain equalization (FDE), where RF filters channelize the SI signal path. Unlike other FD implementations, that mostly rely on delay lines, FDE-based cancellers can be realized in small-form-factor devices. However, the fundamental limits and higher layer challenges associated with these cancellers were not explored yet. Therefore, and in order to support the integration with a software-defined radio (SDR) and to facilitate experimentation in a testbed with several nodes, we design and implement an FDE-based RF canceller on a printed circuit board (PCB). We derive and experimentally validate the PCB canceller model and present a canceller configuration scheme based on an optimization problem. We then extensively evaluate the performance of the FDE-based FD radio in the SDR testbed. Experiments show that it achieves 95dB overall SIC (52dB from RF SIC) across 20MHz bandwidth, and an average link-level FD gain of 1.87x. We also conduct experiments in: (i) uplink-downlink networks with inter-user interference, and (ii) heterogeneous networks with half-duplex and FD users. The experimental FD gains in the two types of networks confirm previous analytical results. They depend on the users' SNR values and the number of FD users, and are 1.14x-1.25x and 1.25x-1.73x, respectively. Finally, we numerically evaluate and compare the RFIC and PCB implementations and study various design tradeoffs.
