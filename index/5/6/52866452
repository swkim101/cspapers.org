The purpose of this panel is to discuss the significant new tool that designers now have available for automating many tasks now performed manually. This tool is the robot. Robots are universal manipulators. They are programmable, multifunctional, and have already been applied to a variety of tasks from playing checkers and decorating candy to spray painting, welding, and even ship loading. Most current robots come in two flavors: the six degrees of freedom, fixed location arm such as those produced by Cincinnati Milicron, Unimation, and IBM; and the mobile variety, such as the Heath HERO and the University of Tennessee MERV. Both flavors are useful in the design automation process. Perhaps the arm will also do my drawing or typing of specifications and the mobile robot will bring my coffee and the parts to build my design. There are many issues which should be addressed in using robots in design automation. Cost justifications must be made. Comparisons of robots to other methods, such as hard automation which may have been used for years and with which workers are familiar, must be made. Selection of robots and perhaps the CAD/CAM support equipment must be made. Planning must be done and redone to make the robot installation smooth and effective. However, the carrot at the end of this stick is greater consistency and productivity. This will lead to a lower cost, higher quality product, which is the bottom line. It is my pleasure to introduce the distinguished panelists, each of whom is actively engaged in robotics in design or maintenance. These experts in robotics bring views from a variety of applications. Universities and industries, designers, manufacturers, and users are represented.
