DEVise is a data exploration system that allows users to easily develop, browse, and share visual presentation of large tabular datasets (possibly containing or referencing multimedia objects) from several sources. The DEVise framework is being implemented in a tool that has been already successfully applied to a variety of real applications by a number of user groups.
Our emphasis is on developing an intuitive yet powerful set of querying and visualization primitives that can be easily combined to develop a rich set of visual presentations that integrate data from a wide range of application domains. While DEVise is a powerful visualization tool, its greatest strengths are the ability to interactively explore a visual presentation of the data at any level of detail (including retrieving individual data records), and the ability to seamlessly query and combine data from a variety of local and remote sources. In this paper, we present the DEVise framework, describe the current tool, and report on our experience in applying it to several real applications.
