This paper presents a low energy AES encryption core targeting for hardware security implementation in IoT systems. The proposed AES core architecture employs the improved shared S-box scheme with 32-bit datapath and low switching activity shift-row operation. Consequently, the proposed AES encryption core can provide good tradeoff with the area of 4.3 kgates and the energy consumption of 4 pJ/bit in 32 nm CMOS technology library.
