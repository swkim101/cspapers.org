The number of channels in recent sensor systems, such as neural recorders and imagers, has been increasing exponentially, and their data sizes have necessitated wider bandwidth for data transmission, resulting in larger power consumption for communication. Although data compression is useful to overcome this issue and is commonly implemented after analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), some issues still remain, namely the increased analog frontend (AFE) circuits, which are proportional to the required channel counts, and requirements of higher throughput in the digital data compression circuit. We propose a mixed-domain AFE circuit design approach that has the potential to achieve a small area and low-power consumption for such multichannel sensor systems. We introduce two design examples: a time-domain analog compressed sensing (CS) encoder and a stochastic-domain discrete cosine transform (DCT) processor. The measurement and simulation results demonstrate their effectiveness in terms of power and area efficiency.
