This volume contains the 25 research papers and abstracts for keynote addresses that were presented at the 2004 ACM SIGSOFT Twelfth International Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE-12). The symposium was held on November 2-4, 2004 in Newport Beach, California. 
 
The International Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering is a forum for presenting new research results that address challenges in developing software systems. It draws on work from academic, government, and industry research organizations. The symposium is open to a wide range of topics and research methods, but it only accepts papers that are judged to clearly present significant, relevant, and correct results. The research papers were selected by the program committee from 170 submissions. Each paper was reviewed by at least three program committee members and many received additional reviews. A two-day committee meeting was held in Edinburgh, Scotland where all papers were considered; the selection of papers to be presented at the symposium was made at that time by the committee as a whole. Comments from reviewers were returned to all authors of submitted papers. 
 
The program chair and general chair thank Debra A. Brodbeck for her extensive organizational and publicity work, Ginger Ignatoff, Donna Baglio and Erin Dolan for providing support from the ACM, Lisa Tolles at Sheridan Printing for making proceedings arrangements, and Richard van de Stadt for his prompt and flexible administration of CyberChair.
