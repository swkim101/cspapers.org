A rolling parallel printer in which a pressure element is driven through a swiveling motion each printing cycle and a pressure segment thereof rolls off a line of type. The pressure element is connected to a mechanical linkage which minimizes the sweep of travel of the pressure element, while maintaining the pressure element sufficiently far from the type in a rest position to facilitate reading of the printed matter.
