The goal of this workshop is to encourage discussion and sharing of ideas and research results on social media engagement. We aim to promote interdisciplinary research and exchange of ideas in this area, not only between industry and academia, but also between different fields (e.g., computer science, mathematics, physics, psychology, sociology, cultural anthropology, etc.). In particular, we would like to discuss approaches to address some of the serious research challenges we face in devising engagement metrics, in developing methodologies, and in understanding how different technical approaches can be used to enhance our understanding of user behavior in social media.
