Change appears to be the only constant in the field of ICT and what was treated as advanced feature few years ago is today old-fashioned. If dealing with such rapid change in the field is increasingly difficult and complex, it is even more complicated when one tries to simplify the concepts and processes and define the learning system's model and the features that would contribute to a more effective teaching. As part of the research team engaged in creating a Learning Content Management System (LCMS) for our university, we wanted to start our project with a comparative study in the field of LCMSs. Lately a lot of research has been done in comparing and evaluating LCMSs. We went through more than 20 research papers which were published in the last decade about this issue, ant try to define the demand of key features in a LCMS and the changing scheme of these demands through time. By this we hope we can define present demand and features in order to include them in our future LCMS.
