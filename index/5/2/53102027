As an important application of smart home, the smart keys, which can record the locking information of users, are quite useful in our daily lives and guarantee the security of our houses and properties. The existing techniques for supporting smart keys either require to change the locks or need a large amount of sensory data to build a complex model, so that they will cost too much money or energy, and are not very practical in the real applications. Therefore, we propose a sensing-free smart key handle, named as sKey, in this demo. Compared with the existing techniques, our sKey does not depend on any detection model, and thus no resources will be consumed for sensory data acquisition and transmission during using sKey. Besides, our sKey has high recognition precision, and is quite cheap and easy to deploy according to our analysis and experimental results.
