A manually actuated Jack Hammer or impacting device includes a cylindrical, relatively thin wall anvil tube having an anvil projecting radially from adjacent its lower end; a cylindrical, relatively thick wall hammer tube telescoped downwardly over the anvil tube for end engagement with the anvil; a recoil spring arranged between upper ends of the tubes; and a pair of operator handles fixed to the hammer tube. The lowerend of the anvil tube may be fitted with an improved tool holder or left open to receive a post or pile to be driven; and one of the operator handles is fitted within an improved lock for selectively holding the tubes in telescoped relationship.
