This paper focus on two level hierarchical scheduling where several real-time applications are scheduled by the fixed priority algorithms. The application with its real-time tasks is bound to a server which can be modeled as a sporadic task with special care for the schedulability analysis. Different scheduling policies and servers can be applied for hierarchical fixed priority systems, this paper gives a closer review of schedulability analysis for applications and tasks when the global and local schedulers of a system are fixed priority.
