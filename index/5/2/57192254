This paper investigates the precoding design for cooperative multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) muticell wireless networks with full-duplex base stations (BSs). The precoding design problem is to maximize the network energy efficiency (EE) under transmit power constraints. To handle the non-concave-convex fractional programming, we adopt the combination of the successive convex programming (SCP) method and Dinkelbach approach for a numerical iterative algorithm. By numerical simulations, we investigate the convergence characteristic of the iterative algorithm for the EE maximization under different transmit power budgets. We also examine the EE and spectral efficiency (SE) for the EE maximization and conventional SE maximization methods for various transmit power budgets under the predefined self-interference and co-channel interference levels.
