for implementing the online control of product development process in Micro-Plant, an integration control platform is proposed based on web service technology. Professional software such as G2, GAMS, Matlab, are wrapped as web services based on multi-agent technology, and the web service named Data_Service is given to implement the data communication among different web services, then we can control and optimize the product development process in Micro-Plant. Finally the practicability and validity of the integration control platform are verified through the application in the product development of Nipagin ester.
