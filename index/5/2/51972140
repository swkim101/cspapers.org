Along with the rapid growth of Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) applications and their penetration into many industry sectors, real-time wireless networks (RTWNs) have been playing a more critical role in providing real-time, reliable and secure communication services for such applications. A key challenge in RTWN management is how to ensure real-time Quality of Services (QoS) especially in the presence of unexpected external and internal disturbances. Most prior work takes a centralized approach for handling disturbances, which is slow and subject to single-point failure, and does not scale. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents a fully distributed packet scheduling framework called FD-PaS. FD-PaS aims to provide guaranteed fast response to unexpected disturbances while dropping a minimum number of packets for meeting the deadlines of all critical tasks. To combat the scalability challenge, FD-PaS incorporates several key advances in both algorithm design and data link layer protocol design to enable individual nodes to make on-line decisions locally without any centralized control. Our extensive simulation and testbed results have validated the correctness of the FD-PaS design and demonstrated its effectiveness in providing fast response for handling disturbances.
