In order to meet the requirement of highly efficient analysis of Gerber files of PCB, and accurate drawing of more graphic output primitives from the Gerber file, this paper presents an efficient method for parsing the information of graphic primitives from the Gerber file and drawing them as output images. The data arrangement and analysis method of five kinds of graphic output primitives such as ellipse, arc, sector, regular polygon and round rectangle are proposed to realize the drawing of those common graphic output primitives of PCB. In order to ensure the complete extraction and preservation of Gerber file information, using regular expressions to extract data and using dynamic arrays to store data. And also, improved GDI rendering method improves the efficiency of data processing and the accuracy of analysis and drawing. This Gerber file parsing and drawing technology are more practical and can meet the needs of actual industrial applications.
