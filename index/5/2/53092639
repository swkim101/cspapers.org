Many-to-all communication is a prerequisite for many applications and network services, including distributed control and data replication. However, current solutions do not meet the scalability and latency requirements of emerging applications. This paper presents Mixer, a many-to-all broadcast primitive for dynamic wireless mesh networks. Mixer integrates random linear network coding (RLNC) with synchronous transmissions and approaches the order-optimal scaling in the number of messages to be exchanged. To achieve an efficient operation in real networks, we design Mixer in response to the theory of RLNC and the characteristics of physical-layer capture. Our experiments demonstrate, for example, that Mixer outperforms the state of the art by up to 3.8x and provides a reliability greater than 99.99 % even at a node moving speed of 60 km/h.
