Precise prediction of users' behavior is critical for users' satisfaction and platforms' benefit. A user's behavior heavily depends on the user's general preference and contextual information (current location, weather etc.). In this paper, we propose a succinct hierarchical framework named Hierarchical Hybrid Feature Model (HHFM). It combines users' general taste and diverse contextual information into a hybrid feature representation to profile users' dynamic preference w.r.t context. Meanwhile, we propose an n-way concatenation pooling strategy to capture the non-linear and complex inherent structures of real-world data, which were ignored by most existing methods like Factorization Machines. Conceptually, our model subsumes several existing methods when choosing proper concatenation and pooling strategies. Extensive experiments show our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three real-world data sets.
