Analyzing public attitudes plays an important role in opinion mining systems. Stance detection aims to determine from a text whether its author is in favor of, against, or neutral towards a given target. One challenge of this task is that a text may not explicitly express an attitude towards the target, but existing approaches utilize target content alone to build models. Moreover, although weakly supervised approaches have been proposed to ease the burden of manually annotating largescale training data, such approaches are confronted with noisy labeling problem. To address the above two issues, in this paper, we propose a Topic-Aware Reinforced Model (TARM) for weakly supervised stance detection. Our model consists of two complementary components: (1) a detection network that incorporates target-related topic information into representation learning for identifying stance effectively; (2) a policy network that learns to eliminate noisy instances from auto-labeled data based on off-policy reinforcement learning. Two networks are alternately optimized to improve each otherâ€™s performances. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model TARM outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.
