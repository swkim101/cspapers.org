In computing a scene description from an image, a useful intermediate representation of a scene object is given by the orientation and area of the constituent surface facets, termed the Extended Gaussian Image (EGI) of the object. The EGI of a convex object uniquely represents that object. We are concerned with the computational task of reconstructing the shape of scene objects from their Extended Gaussian Images, where the objects are restricted to convex polyhedra. We present an iterative method for reconstructing convex polyhedra from their Extended Gaussian Images.
