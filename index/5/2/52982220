In this paper, we present a wearable kinesthetic I/O device, which is able to measure and intervene in multiple muscle activities simultaneously through the same electrodes. The developed system includes an I/O module, capable of measuring the electromyogram (EMG) of four muscle tissues, while applying electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) at the same time. The developed wearable system is configured in a scalable manner for achieving 1) high stimulus frequency (up to 70 Hz), 2) wearable dimensions in which the device can be placed along the limbs, and 3) flexibility of the number of I/O electrodes (up to 32 channels). In a pilot user study, which shared the wrist compliance between two persons, participants were able to recognize the level of their confederate's wrist joint compliance using a 4-point Likert scale. The developed system would benefit a physical therapist and a patient, during hand rehabilitation, using a peg board for sharing their wrist compliance and grip force, which are usually difficult to be observed in a visual contact.
