Rising interest in production systems has led to a number of research efforts aimed at increasing their execution speed. The bottleneck in current implementations is the matching required during each production cycle. CUPID is a multiprocessor architecture designed to execute OPS5 matching using DRete, a distributed version of the Rete matching algorithm. This paper describes CUPID and the DRete algorithm with emphasis on correctness and effectiveness in exploiting parallelism in the match operation. The Monkey and Bananas program was executed on a CUPID simulator running the DRete algorithm. The results show that on a technology-independent comparison basis, and in measured execution speed, that the CUPID/DRete combination is several times faster than a commercial uniprocessor, a VAX 11/785, running compiled OPS83.
