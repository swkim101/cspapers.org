In (industrial) design projects, digital and non-digital aspects are often seen as two separate design 'tracks'. Due to advances in our social and technological context, the hard boundary between the digital and the non-digital is fading. This is a challenge for the designer since he needs to be creative with digital technology without necessarily having a technical background. Using the lillidot method introduced in this paper an exploration was done concerning the feasibility of creating a low fidelity design "kit" in order to facilitate the infusion of digital aspects in design.
