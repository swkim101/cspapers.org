This demonstration shows a novel virtualization architecture, called Multi-Purpose Access Point (MPAP), which can virtualize multiple heterogenous wireless standards based on software radio. The basic idea is to deploy a wide-band radio front-end to receive wireless signals from all wireless standards sharing the same spectrum band, and use separate software base-bands to demodulate information stream for each wireless standard. Based on software radio, MPAP consolidates multiple wireless devices into single hardware platform, and allows them to share the same general-purpose computing resource. Different software base-bands can easily communicate and coordinate with one another. Thus, it also provides better coexistence among heterogenous wireless standards. As an example, we demonstrate to use non-contiguous OFDM in 802.11g PHY to avoid the mutual interference with narrow-band ZigBee communication.
