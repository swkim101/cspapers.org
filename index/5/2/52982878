In this demonstration, we introduce Face/On, an embedded feedback device that leverages the contact area between the user's face and a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display (HMD) to provide rich haptic feedback in virtual environments (VEs). Head-worn haptic feedback devices have been explored in previous work to provide directional cues via grids of actuators and localized feedback on the users' skin. Most of these solutions were immersion breaking due to their encumbering and uncomfortable design and build around a single actuator type, thus limiting the overall fidelity and flexibility of the haptic feedback. We present Face/On, a VR HMD face cushion with three types of discreetly embedded actuators that provide rich haptic feedback without encumbering users with invasive instrumentation on the body. By combining vibro-tactile and thermal feedback with electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), Face/On can simulate a wide range of scenarios and benefit from synergy effects between these feedback types.
