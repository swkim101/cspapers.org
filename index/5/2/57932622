A data warehouse is an integrated set of data, derived basically from operational data to use in decision making strategy and business intelligence using (OLAP) techniques. Most of the creation of data multidimensional data warehouses is done manually, but it is a very complex and takes a long time and usually has a risk of fail. In addition, a set of complex mappings must be performed. Despite this, there is no noticeable efforts has been done in order to find a practical solution structured to resolve the issue. To overcome, the proposed method presents a new strategy to automate the multidimensional design of Data Warehouses; this algorithm uses an enterprise schema of an operational database as a starting point to design data warehouse schema. As a result, the user has to choose the candidate schema which meets the system requirements.
