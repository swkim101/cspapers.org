We design multi-unit auctions for budget-constrained bidders in the Bayesian setting. Our auctions are supplymonotone, which allows the auction to be run online without knowing the number of items in advance, and achieve asymptotic revenue optimality. We also give an efficient algorithm for implementing our auction by using a succinct and efficiently implementable characterization of supplymonotonicity in the Bayesian setting.
