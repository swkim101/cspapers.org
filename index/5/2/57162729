We welcome you to The 5th ACM HotPlanet Workshop in conjunction with ACM SIGCOMM 2013. 
 
The last decade has seen a rapid, planet-scale growth in deployment and usage of smart mobile devices, ambient sensors, smartphone applications and advanced communication technologies. nThis era has prompted for large-scale, planet-wide data collection, storage, processing and dissemination technologies, advancing our knowledge about human behaviour and interactions at a planetary scale. Evolution of such technologies and methodologies, in addition to the high investments in Internet of things (IoT) deployments in Asia, has inherently led to a number of security, privacy and ethical issues as well as new systems, networking, and application challenges. 
 
In the 5th ACM HotPlanet workshop, we bring together networking, wireless, mobile computing and systems research to understand the challenges ahead and advance the dialogue on topics related to large-scale measurements and big data analytics centred around individuals. We are delighted to present an exciting interdisciplinary program this year, including a number of cuttingedge measurement, large scale analysis, mobility, and sensing papers. Our keynote speaker, Nic Lane from Microsoft Research Asia, is delivering a vibrant keynote speech on the state-of-the-art of smartphone sensing and large-scale population guided sensing research. A 3-minute madness session for presenting novel and thought-provoking ideas is also included. To conclude, leading experts of the research community are entertaining a panel discussion on the latest and future developments in the areas of planet-scale sensing, measurement and data mining systems. 
 
We hope you will enjoy the discussions, the exciting activities, and interesting papers in the program. We wish to thank the authors for submitting excellent papers, and the Technical Program Committee for the hard job of reviewing several high quality submissions.
