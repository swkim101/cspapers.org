Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) aims to build an appropriate machine learning model for any unseen dataset automatically, i.e., without human intervention. Great efforts have been devoted on AutoML while they typically focus on supervised learning. In many applications, however, semisupervised learning (SSL) are widespread and current AutoML systems could not well address SSL problems. In this paper, we propose to present an automated learning system for SSL (AUTO-SSL). First, meta-learning with enhanced meta-features is employed to quickly suggest some instantiations of the SSL techniques which are likely to perform quite well. Second, a large margin separation method is proposed to fine-tune the hyperparameters and more importantly, alleviate performance deterioration. The basic idea is that, if a certain hyperparameter owns a high quality, its predictive results on unlabeled data may have a large margin separation. Extensive empirical results over 200 cases demonstrate that our proposal on one side achieves highly competitive or better performance compared to the state-of-the-art AutoML system AUTO-SKLEARN and classical SSL techniques, on the other side unlike classical SSL techniques which often significantly degenerate performance, our proposal seldom suffers from such deficiency.
