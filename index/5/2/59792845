This paper shows how to use an on-the-fly verification algorithm, that verifies the equivalence of labeled transition systems, for the verification of the input output conformance (ioco) of input output labeled transition systems. Since ioco is usually used for testing there are several requirements on the input output labeled transition system (IOLTS) that are used for test generation. We show how to take care of these requirements during the on-the-fly verification. Thus the presented approach can be applied to IOLTSs that do not initially fulfill these requirements. Finally, we discuss the evaluation of a prototype implementation on the datalink protocol.
