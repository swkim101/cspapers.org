It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2012 International Workshop on Practical Issues and Applications in Next Generation Wireless Networks (PINGEN) in conjunction with ACM MOBICOM 2012, ?stanbul, Turkey, August 26, 2012 ACM Symposium on General Subjects Information & Technologies -- PINGEN'12. 
 
The mission of this workshop is to focus on design and deployment issues of next generation wireless infrastructures, potentially made up of heterogeneous access technologies, supporting a wide range of applications and user needs in a coherent and unified manner. PINGEN'12 brings together people from different research areas, and provides a forum to exchange ideas, discuss solutions, and share experiences among researchers, professionals, and application developers both from industry and academia in all aspects of next generation wireless networks. 
 
The call for papers attracted 13 submissions from Asia, Europe and the United States, including the encouraged submissions redirected by ENMS'12. The program committee accepted 9 papers that cover a variety of topics, including mobile data offloading techniques, smart power grids, M2M data transfer and channel estimation, allocation schemes for LTE networks. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers. 
 
In addition, the workshop also features a keynote speech by Dr. Coskun Sahin, the CTO of Avea -- the sole GSM 1800 mobile operator of Turkey, on "Mobile Era: Trends, Challenges and Opportunities for Mobile operators". Avea is the only mobile operator in the country which holds a state recognized R&D center certificate. We anticipate that Dr. Sahin's address will shed light onto the dynamics of R&D activities in the sector and, in this regard, will provoke valuable insights into the future of mobile operator business.
