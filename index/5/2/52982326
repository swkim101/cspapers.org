Different from the ordinary apparatus and plug-in devices on bikes, this research brings up a novel system called SaFePlay+, Smart Footwear Platform Plus. The system includes a pair of knee motion sensing module and smart pressure and motion sensing insole, analyzed module and interactive App. SaFePlay+ can immediately collect lower limbs information of users. Moreover, through the novel algorithm of wearable power analyzer, it can help users to understand their body condition in order to adjust the posture, raise the efficiency and avoid sports injury. Through the verification of the apparatus, it shows that our method can get good cadence and power performance.
