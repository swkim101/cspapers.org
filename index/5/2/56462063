Latest research and technology development have been focusing on improving the performance and the efficiency of intelligent and automated machines / systems used in human services, factories , transportation means, space exploration and may others applications. As the tech world is shrinking rapidly, industries are seeking to miniaturize the devices to the level of nano-machines /nanorobots without compromising their efficiency. Scientists have made significant progress in nanoroboics research field but have not officially released their new products. On the other hand, they opened a new world of discoveries, possibilities and applications in different fields such as military defense, medicine, industry, space exploration, energy. In this article, we will present the role of nanotechnology and nanostructures in energy harvesting systems used in robots to be able to sense and adapt heat, light, sounds, surface texture and chemicals from the environment, as well as to move, communicate and perform complex calculations.
