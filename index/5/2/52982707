This paper presents a technique enabling distributed batteryless near-field identification (ID) between two passive radio frequency ID (RFID) tags. Each conventional ultra-high-frequency (UHF) RFID tag is modified by connecting its antenna and chip to a reed switch and then attaching a magnet to one of the reed switch's terminals, thus transforming it into an always-on switch. When the two modules approach each other, the magnets counteract each other and turn off both switches at the same time. The coabsence of IDs thus indicates a unique interaction event. In addition to sensing, the module also provides native haptic feedback through magnetic repulsion force, enabling users to perceive the system's state eyes-free, without physical constraints. Additional visual feedback can be provided through an energy-harvesting module and a light emitting diode. This specific hardware design supports contactless, orientation-invariant sensing, with a form factor compact enough for embedded and wearable use in ubiquitous computing applications.
