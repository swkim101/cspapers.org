Byzantine Generals protocols enable processes to reliably broadcast messages in the presence of faulty processes. These protocols are run in a system of consists of <italic>n</italic> processes, <italic>t</italic> of which are faulty. The protocols are conducted in synchronous rounds of message exchange. We show that, without using cryptography, for <italic>t</italic> = <italic>n</italic>/(3 + <italic>δ</italic>), there is a randomized protocol with <italic>&Ogr;</italic>(<italic>lg n</italic>) expected number of rounds. If we allow cryptographic methods, then, for <italic>t</italic> = <italic>n</italic> / (2 + <italic>δ</italic>), there is a randomized protocol with &Ogr;(<italic>lg n</italic>) expected number of rounds. This is an improvement on the lower bound of <italic>t</italic> + 1 rounds required for det … … previous result of <italic>t</italic>/<italic>lg n</italic> expected nu rounds for randomized protocols.
