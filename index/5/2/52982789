We present a textile sensor, capable of detecting multi-touch and multi-pressure input on non-planar surfaces and demonstrate how such sensors can be fabricated and integrated into pressure stabilized membrane envelopes (i.e. inflatables). Our sensor design is both stretchable and flexible/bendable and can conform to various three-dimensional surface geometries and shape-changing surfaces. We briefly outline an approach for basic signal acquisition from such sensors and how they can be leveraged to measure internal air-pressure of inflatable objects without specialized air-pressure sensors. We further demonstrate how standard electronic circuits can be integrated with malleable inflatable objects without the need for rigid enclosures for mechanical protection.
