Most of the Ceramic SMEs face problems with numerical and chemical aspects of glaze calculations. These problems arise for the differentiations of the available in the market raw materials and the need to combine the existing ones in order to produce a non problematic glaze (changing a frit for another) and with low toxicity. The presented work is a solution for Ceramic enterprises to overcome these problems and produce quality products by learning how to build the desired glazes using the available in the market raw materials. This publication describes a glaze calculation software based on the Seger Method enhanced with advanced features, developed in a friendly and easy to use graphical interface were the ceramists can create recipes, mix recipes between them, upload images of the outcomes, search for existing recipes, and simulate the results changing a number of parameters (e.g. temperature). It is a useful methodology that undertakes to perform a great deal of the required calculations, helping the ceramists to learn how to make recipes following international standards and mixing different materials for the development of cost effective quality products.
