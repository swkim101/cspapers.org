Hypothesis / aims of study Different hormonal pathways play a role in urine production through their role in water and sodium homeostasis. Changes in the levels of these hormones can thus affect diuresis, and this in turn lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). However, there are indications that other hormones such as the sex hormones have an influence in these pathways. For example, several studies have shown a beneficial effect of hormone substitution therapy on the number of nocturnal voids, while others contradict this. The aim of this study is to evaluate changes in diuresis and LUTS in postmenopausal patients, before and after hormonal substitution therapy (HST).
