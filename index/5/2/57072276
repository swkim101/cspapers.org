The uneven distribution of node energy consumption leads network to premature failure under LEACH protocol for wireless sensor network. For such problem, this paper presents a comprehensive algorithm. The residual energy will be taken into account when the cluster head is selected, and then multi-hop is used for forwarding in the process of transferring data. This achieves balanced distribution of network energy effectively. Simulation results show that the improved algorithm can prolong network lifetime, which is significantly better than LEACH protocol.
