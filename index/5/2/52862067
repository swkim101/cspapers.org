This paper describes the implementation and performance of SPRINT, an interactive system for printed circuit board design developed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). Topics discussed include the placement subsystem, the routing subsystem consisting of an interactive manual router, an automatic batch router, and a via elimination program, as well as the structure of the design file around which the entire system is centered.
