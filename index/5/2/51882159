We introduce the feasible arm identification problem, a pure exploration multi-armed bandit problem where the agent is given a set of Ddimensional arms and a polyhedron P “ tx : Ax ď bu Ă R. Pulling an arm gives a random vector and the goal is to determine, using a fixed budget of T pulls, which of the arms have means belonging to P . We propose three algorithms MD-UCBE, MD-SAR, and MD-APT and provide a unified analysis establishing upper bounds for each of them. We also establish a lower bound that matches up to constants the upper bounds of MDUCBE and MD-APT. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets.
