See-through-wall imaging radar is considered to be a remarkable application of ultra-wideband communication since it facilitates the observation of moving objects through wall or behind the doors. In this topic, an array of Vivaldi antenna for see-through-wall imaging application will be proposed to operate from 1 GHz to 4 GHz frequency band. The genetic optimization of HFSS is implemented to illustrate the radiation characteristics such as gain, axial ratio, return loss, VSWR, bandwidth and radiation patterns. The characteristics of this mentioned structure will be studied and simulated using HFSS software. In addition, the study of Wilkinson power divider for supplying power to antenna elements is also included.
