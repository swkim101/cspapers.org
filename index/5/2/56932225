Our work done during each stages of CaO dissolution from waste liquid is introduced. Through comparison of experimental data, reasons are found for all previous failure in soda ash dissolution by using waste liquide and a two-step ash dissolution process is put forward. Small-scale test proves that active calcium oxide in lime cream can reach 180-200tt. Test on production proves successful and application follows. Concentration of calcium chloride in waste liquid can be increased by more than 10 g/l. National patent has been applied for it.
