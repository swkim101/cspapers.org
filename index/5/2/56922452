The importance of experimental research in the field of wirel ess networks is well understood. So far researchers have either built their own testbeds or accessed third-party controlled test bed ∗ or used publicly available traces † for evaluation. While immensely useful all these approaches have their drawbacks. While bui lding own test beds requires cost and effort, third-party control led test beds do not replicate real network deployments. On the other hand , the publicly available traces are often collected using differ ent software and hardware platforms, making it very difficult to compare r esults across traces. As a result, observations are often inconsis te t across different networks, leading researchers to draw potential ly conflicting conclusions across their own studies. To facilitate meaningful analysis of wireless networks and protocols, we need a way to collect measurement traces across a wide variety of network deployments, all using a consistent set of measurement metrics. Widespread multi-faceted data col lecti n will provide multiple viewpoints of the same network, enabl ing deeper understanding of both self and exterior interferenc e properties, spectrum usage, network usage, and a wide variety of other fa ctors. Furthermore, data collected in this manner across a variety of heterogeneous network types, such as university, corporat e, and home environments, will facilitate cross-comparison of observ ed network phenomena within each of these settings.
