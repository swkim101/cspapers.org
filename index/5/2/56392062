At some depth below the surface, the circular orbits become so small that motion is negligible. This depth is called the “Wave Base”. Wave base can be regarded equal to one-half the wavelength (λ/2) measured from still water level (Figure 1). Only wave length controls the depth of the wave base, so the longer the wave, the deeper the wave base. The decrease of orbital motion with depth has many practical applications. For instance, submarines can avoid large ocean waves simply by submerging below the wave base. Even the largest storm waves will go unnoticed if a submarine submerges to only 150 meters [1]. Floating bridges and floating oil rigs are constructed so that most of their mass is below wave base, so they will be unaffected by wave motion. In fact offshore floating airport runways have been designed using similar principles. Additionally, seasick scuba divers find relief when they were submerged into the calm, motionless water below wave base [1]. Therefore, deep water defines as depth more than λ/2. The hydrodynamic forces of ocean surface wave on the submerged bodies are studied in a number of fields of engineering such as:
