“Many-core” systems based on the Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture have brought into the fore-front various opportunities and challenges for the deployment of real-time systems. Such real-time systems need timing guarantees to be fulfilled. Therefore, calculating upper-bounds on the end-to-end communication delay between system components is of primaryinterest. In this work, we identify the limitations of an existing approach proposed by [1] and propose different techniques to overcome these limitations.
