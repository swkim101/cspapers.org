Graph rewriting-based model processing is a widely used technique for model transformation. Model transformations often need to follow an algorithm that requires a strict control over the execution sequence of the transformation steps. Therefore, in Visual Model Processors (VMPs) the execution order of the transformation steps is crucial. This paper introduces the visual control flow support of Visual Modeling and Transformation System (VMTS). VMTS Visual Control Flow Language (VCFL) uses stereotyped activity diagrams to specify control flow structures and Object Constraint Language (OCL) constraints to choose between different control flow branches. This work discusses the termination properties of VCFL and provides algorithms to combine model transformation steps as well as to support the termination analysis of VCFL transformations.
