The Orthogonal Vectors problem ($\textsf{OV}$) asks: given $n$ vectors in $\{0,1\}^{O(\log n)}$, are two of them orthogonal? $\textsf{OV}$ is easily solved in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time, and it is a central problem in fine-grained complexity: dozens of conditional lower bounds are based on the popular hypothesis that $\textsf{OV}$ cannot be solved in (say) $n^{1.99}$ time. However, unlike the APSP problem, few other problems are known to be non-trivially equivalent to $\textsf{OV}$. 
We show $\textsf{OV}$ is truly-subquadratic equivalent to several fundamental problems, all of which (a priori) look harder than $\textsf{OV}$. A partial list is given below: 
($\textsf{Min-IP}/\textsf{Max-IP}$) Find a red-blue pair of vectors with minimum (respectively, maximum) inner product, among $n$ vectors in $\{0,1\}^{O(\log n)}$. 
($\textsf{Exact-IP}$) Find a red-blue pair of vectors with inner product equal to a given target integer, among $n$ vectors in $\{0,1\}^{O(\log n)}$. 
($\textsf{Apx-Min-IP}/\textsf{Apx-Max-IP}$) Find a red-blue pair of vectors that is a 100-approximation to the minimum (resp. maximum) inner product, among $n$ vectors in $\{0,1\}^{O(\log n)}$. 
(Approx. $\textsf{Bichrom.-$\ell_p$-Closest-Pair}$) Compute a $(1 + \Omega(1))$-approximation to the $\ell_p$-closest red-blue pair (for a constant $p \in [1,2]$), among $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \le n^{o(1)}$. 
(Approx. $\textsf{$\ell_p$-Furthest-Pair}$) Compute a $(1 + \Omega(1))$-approximation to the $\ell_p$-furthest pair (for a constant $p \in [1,2]$), among $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \le n^{o(1)}$. 
We also show that there is a $\text{poly}(n)$ space, $n^{1-\epsilon}$ query time data structure for Partial Match with vectors from $\{0,1\}^{O(\log n)}$ if and only if such a data structure exists for $1+\Omega(1)$ Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search in Euclidean space.
