In this paper we describe a successful exercise that introduced our MSc students to ‘digital stories’, providing them with a fun learning activity, and which led to public engagement success. We recognise these as three points on a virtuous circle – each positively impacting on the other. Through describing this case study we highlight the need for boundaries to form a creative space. We believe that boundaries are a useful concept to consider for producing successful media interactions. The boundaries described in this paper could be used for other university teaching.
