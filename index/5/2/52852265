Using the robot as a metaphor for assisting students in understanding problem solving in general, the algorithmic process, and the relationship between algorithms and computing agents is not new. While simulated robot environments have existed for many years (e.g. Karel the Robot[3]) it is only recently that the technology for inexpensively supplying undergraduates with real robots has become available. Lego Mindstorms, MIT Handyboards, the Rug Warrior, and others are examples of such systems. Programmable in familiar languages, including C, Ada, and Java, these systems allow for the creative exploration of important computer science concepts. Representing a variety of institution types the panelists will discuss their experiences in using hands-on robot-based projects for illustrating various important computer science concepts.
