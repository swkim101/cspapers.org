Air pollution in a city is the major environmental risk to health. Mobile sensing has become a popular solution in recent years. However, it still suffers from problems such as lack of data and high system uncertainty. This is because that the data amount and distribution vary over time. To address the problems, this paper combines two classic data driven models -- Kriging and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). We adopt the Random Forest Algorithm (RF) to adaptively choose the more accurate models (Kriging or IDW) according to the features we extracted. The experiment based on real world testbed shows our adaptive method achieves up to 30.6% error reduction.
