Nanogami is a bioresponsive garment to visualize the importance of the microbiome on collective wellbeing. The microbiome is the group of bacteria, viruses, and cells that live within and on our bodies. This galaxy of particles makes up more than half of the human body and are noted to be responsible for overall health and mood. From nano - micro sensations, Nanogami's dichromic origami fabric seeks to visualize this micro-galaxy with mood sensing, breath monitoring, and inflatable actuation to assist in ideal homeostasis. Within the concept of extimacy, showing the internal states to the external world, the Nanogami illuminates the microbiome to promote awareness with a self monitoring, mediated textile to provoke wellbeing with real-time visual and haptic feedback.
