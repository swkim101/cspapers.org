DAMP 2007 is an open workshop following on from a by-invitation-only workshop DPLMA 2006: Declarative Programming Languages for Multicore Architectures held on 15 January 2006 in Charleston, SC, USA. Both seek to explore ideas in programming language design that will greatly simplify programming for multicore architectures, and more generally for tightly coupled parallel architectures. The emphasis is on functional and logic programming, but includes ideas that aim to raise the level of abstraction. The goal was to gather together researchers in declarative approaches to parallel programming and to foster cross fertilization across different approaches.
