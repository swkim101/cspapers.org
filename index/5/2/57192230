In recent years, Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) have a wire range of real applications to serve people such as disaster recovery, military, traffic control and smart cities. Due to the dynamic network topology, routing is always a major problem in MANETs. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol, called PRP (Performance Routing Protocol), which allows MANETs to select optimal routes with the highest throughput and the lowest time delay for data transmission. To demonstrate the efficiency of the new proposed protocol, we compare its performance with traditional routing protocols on NS2.
