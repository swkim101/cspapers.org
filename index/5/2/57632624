—This paper presents how the tool TetaSARTS can be used to support the development of embedded hard real-time systems written in Java using the emerging Safety Critical Java (SCJ) proﬁle. TetaSARTS facilitates control-ﬂow sensitive schedulability analysis of a set of real-time tasks, and features a pluggable platform speciﬁcation allowing analysis of systems including the hosting execution environment. This is achieved by approaching the analysis as a model checking problem by modelling the system using the Timed Automata formalism of the model checking tool U PPAAL . The resulting Timed Automata model facilitates easy adjustment of a wide variety of parameters that may be of interest such as processor frequency. This paper demonstrates that TetaSARTS can be used for tuning processor frequency, for conducting control-ﬂow sensitive Worst Case Response Time analysis, and for conducting processor utilisation and idle time analysis.
