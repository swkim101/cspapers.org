Time-Triggered communication is based on generating an offline static schedule that guarantees frame transmissions with reduced latency and low jitter. However, static schedules are not adaptive: if some unpredicted event happens, like a link failure, the schedule is not valid anymore and a new one needs to be synthesized from scratch. This paper presents a novel hot-patching protocol which seeks, after a link failure disconnecting two nodes, to find a new path to reconnect both nodes and restore during run-time the affected part of the schedule. We also introduce the concept of reparability as a desired property of the schedule, which increases the probability of our protocol to succeed. The first evaluation shows that our hot-patching protocol can recover from a link failure consistently in less than 25ms.
