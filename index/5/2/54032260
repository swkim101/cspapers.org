Pupils' progress in the lesson of physical education is the main objective of any teacher, who is constantly looking for the right didactic methods, exercises and organisation forms able to captivate the pupils, motivating them and increasing their performances. That is why the main purpose of this paper was the acquisition and consolidation of the gymnastics-specific motor skills by selecting and applying pedagogical strategies and finding stimulating assessment tools. As a result of the pedagogical experiment proposed, it was found that the training group where the pedagogical strategies were implemented progress was more considerable than in the control group where the teaching methods remained unchanged.
