Algorithms, permitting us to find synchronization-free threads comprised of iterations of perfectly nested uniform and non-uniform loops, are presented. They require an exact representation of loop-carried dependences. To describe and implement the algorithms, the dependence analysis by Pugh and Wonnacott was chosen where dependences are represented in the form of tuple relations. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it permits us to extract more synchronization-free parallelism than that yielded with well-known techniques including the affine partitioning framework. The algorithms proposed have been implemented and verified by means of the Omega project software. Experiments with the Livermore loops are presented.
