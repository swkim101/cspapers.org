In this paper, we developed an auditory display method which improves the comprehension of photograph to apply the support system for person with visual impairment. The auralization method is constructed by object recognition, auditory iconization and stereophonic techniques. Through the experiments, the enhancement of intelligibility and discriminability was confirmed compared to the image-to-speech reading machine method.
