Haptic technology can be used as a tool for learning. Can even the haptic elements in a smartwatch teach a new skill? Here we present a case of using a smartwatch for passive tactile learning. We use the Sony Smartwatch 3 to teach users Morse code while they wear the watch but focus on unrelated tasks. An initial hypothesis forecasted that the stimulation from the smartwatch, typically used for message alerts, would be too subtle to enable haptic learning; however, we find significant improvements in six participants using the technique. Furthermore, we expose participants to two different durations of stimulation and find different results.
