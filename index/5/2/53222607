SIM/61 is a large (3500 lines of Simscript code), highly detailed simulation model of a virtual memory, time-shared, demand paging operating system. SIM/61 provides the capability for parameterized modeling of both hardware and software. The current model contains algorithms for interrupt analysis, task scheduling, I/O scheduling and demand paging.
 This paper reports the results of studies made using SIM/61. The studies fall into two main categories: (1) load and configuration studies and (2) alternate algorithm studies. The approach taken for the former was to establish a fixed load, and measure its performance on various hardware configurations. The results are particularly interesting with respect to the paging capability of various paging device configurations, and various sizes of main memory.
