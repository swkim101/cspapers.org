Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is able to build reliable classifier with very scarce labeled examples by properly utilizing the abundant unlabeled examples. However, existing SSL algorithms often yield unsatisfactory performance due to the lack of supervision information. To address this issue, this paper formulates SSL as a Generalized Distillation (GD) problem, which treats existing SSL algorithm as a learner and introduces a teacher to guide the learner?s training process. Specifically, the intelligent teacher holds the privileged knowledge that ?explains? the training data but remains unknown to the learner, and the teacher should convey its rich knowledge to the imperfect learner through a specific teaching function. After that, the learner gains knowledge by ?imitating? the output of the teaching function under an optimization framework. Therefore, the learner in our algorithm learns from both the teacher and the training data, so its output can be substantially distilled and enhanced. By deriving the Rademacher complexity and error bounds of the proposed algorithm, the usefulness of the introduced teacher is theoretically demonstrated. The superiority of our algorithm to the related state-of-the-art methods has also been empirically demonstrated by the experiments on different datasets with various sources of privileged knowledge.
