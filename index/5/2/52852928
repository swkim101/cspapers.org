The present paper complements the hardware proposal for a fully distributed parallel processor presented in “A Large Scale, Homogeneous, Fully Distributed Parallel Machine, I,” by describing a suitable software structure for its operating system management. It is shown that the most basic operating system functions can be performed on a purely local basis, i.e. in such a fashion that identical pieces of the operating systems are concurrently executed by each of the processing elements.
