Inspired by the inchworm locomotion mechanism, this paper presents our recently developed self-deformable capsule-like robot. The robot has the actuated deformation capability that relies on a novel rigid elements-based morphing structure (REMS) and its soft actuation mechanisms. When the robot deforms, it generates the crawling locomotion behavior and thus friction waves between the robot and contact surface to facilitate the inchworm-like crawling movement. The paper starts reviewing the deformable properties of natural biological entities like capsules, presents state of the art of the current capsule-like robots, and details the bio-inspired design of the self-deformable capsule-like robot by describing the model of robot kinematics and its locomotion mechanism. Both simulation and experimental results validate the excellent performance of this capsule-like robot. The developed self-deformable capsule-like robot has the advantage of crawling on varied surfaces and it also has the capabilities to crawl in a variety of narrow pipes based on the deformation elicited locomotion nature of the robot.
