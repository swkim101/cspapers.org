Computer vision is an attractive solution for uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) collision avoidance, due to the low weight, size and power requirements of hardware. A two-stage paradigm has emerged in the literature for detection and tracking of dim targets in images, comprising of spatial preprocessing, followed by temporal ltering. In this paper, we investigate a hidden Markov model (HMM) based temporal ltering approach. Specically,
