Architectural Tradeoff Analysis Method is a method for evaluation of architecture-level designs and identifies trade-off points between attributes, facilitates communication between stakeholders. ATAM has got the limitations like not a predictor of quality achievement., not deals more quality attributes, Efficiency always depends on the expertise and potential of stakeholders. In this paper we have proposed a system which uses ATAM to predict the risk analysis, with more possible quality attributes. We have used artificial intelligence to predict the risk of the SA based on the Knowledge base of the Stakeholder Experts.
