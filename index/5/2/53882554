The paper examines the simulation of the basic mechanisms of the chess endgame problem solution by man. The experimental results of a psychological investigation into the mechanics of structurisation, generalization, and goal formation of a situation have been presented and a semiotic system of formation of generalised imitation models have been discussed which forme the basis for human decision-making.
