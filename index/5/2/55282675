This paper presents Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) algorithm for solving reactive power problem. A nonlinear decreasing weight factor used to change the fundamental ways of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). To allow full play to the approximation capability of the function of Back Propagation neural network & overcome the main shortcomings of its liability to fall into local extreme value this study proposed a concept of modified PSO algorithm. Back Propagation network jointly to optimize the original weight, threshold value of network and incorporating the PSO algorithm into Back Propagation network to establish a Modified PSO-BP network system. Proposed method MPSO progresses convergence speed and the capability to search optimal value. In order to evaluate the proposed MPSO algorithm, it has been tested on IEEE 30 bus system and compared to other reported standard algorithms and simulation results show that (MPSO) is more efficient than other algorithms in reducing the real power loss & voltage profiles are within the limits.
