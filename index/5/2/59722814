Welcome to ACM MobiCom 2008, the Fourteenth Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, in San Francisco, California, USA. Continuing the tradition as one of the premier conferences in mobile networking, we have an exciting program that includes technical papers, posters, demos and a panel, representing the best of today's research in mobile networking and computing! This year we placed particular emphasis on having a very diverse program that includes papers ranging from modeling of network capacity to experimental systems. 
 
We received 264 paper submissions from 23 countries, out of which 31 papers were accepted. The quality of papers was outstanding, forcing the Technical Program Committee (TPC) to make many hard choices. To select the papers, we employed a three-phase process. First, the TPC selected papers from an access-controlled web site and provided reviews; then, we had an online discussion phase that selected 64 papers for more detailed discussion; finally, we had a TPC meeting in Denver, Colorado to discuss and select the 31 papers for inclusion in the program. The review process was double blind and every paper received at least three reviews, many received four or even five reviews. The technical program includes a wide variety of papers organized into 8 sessions over three days. In addition, we have separate sessions for posters and demonstrations that were selected using an independent process. This year's program also includes two challenge papers that describe new approaches, technologies or visions that can stimulate new research directions. We hope that you will find the MobiCom 2008 technical program helpful in your research.
