In the past decade, multi-agent epistemic planning has received much attention from both dynamic logic and planning communities. Common knowledge is an essential part of multi-agent modal logics, and plays an important role in coordination and interaction of multiple agents. However, existing implementations of multi-agent epistemic planning provide very limited support for common knowledge, basically static propositional common knowledge. Our work aims to extend an existing multi-agent epistemic planning framework based on higher-order belief change with the capability to deal with common knowledge. We propose a novel normal form for multi-agent KD45 logic with common knowledge. We propose satisfiability solving, revision and update algorithms for this normal form. Based on our algorithms, we implemented a multi-agent epistemic planner with common knowledge called MEPC. Our planner successfully generated solutions for several domains that demonstrate the typical usage of common knowledge.
