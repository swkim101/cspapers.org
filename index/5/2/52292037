Copper microwire is an essential metal widely used in micro-electron mechanical systems. Since micro/nano material usually demonstrates unique mechanical properties due to scaling effect, copper microwire mechanical properties need to be investigated for better adhibition. Herein, we propose a nanorobotics manipulation system for copper microwire insitu twisting test. Firstly, a system with six degree-of-freedoms (DOFs) nanorobotic manipulator integrated inside scanning electron microscope (SEM) is introduced. Secondly, a positioning and assembly method for copper microwire specimen are proposed to solve the mismatching problem. Finally, the copper microwire is twisted in-situ and its properties are investigated and analyzed. The copper microwire sample fracture morphology shows a severe plastic deformation and being along with the emergence of deformation twin and intertwine, which exhibit strong scaling effects. This system provides a new method for in-situ twisting test, which paves the way for mechanical characterization inside SEM and benefits the fundamental nanomaterial research immensely.
