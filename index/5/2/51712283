The explosion of interest in KDD and other Data Science/Machine Learning/AI conferences is just one of the many signs that these technologies are no longer confined to the realms of academia and a hand-full of tech companies. As our daily lives seamlessly integrate more and more data-driven applications, people's excitement is tempered by worry about the technologies' potential to disrupt their existence. Having worked for almost 30 years to design and develop these technologies, the KDD community now should examine and debate the impact of Machine Learning & AI on the broader world. Beyond the hype, where do we stand with respect to the dangers? What role can our community play to alleviate concerns around AI taking jobs, or taking over? How can the value derived from data be distributed fairly? Are concerns about inequity well-founded or rather largely problems of perception? What can be done to bring data hunger and data sharing concerns to a level of equilibrium? How do we prepare people to interact with intelligent systems at scale? Can we unleash the incredible responsiveness of the KDD community toward longer-term more impactful projects across sectors that are essential for social good, such as Health, Environmental Sustainability, and Public Welfare.
