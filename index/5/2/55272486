This paper introduces at a high level the concept of Autonomic Robotics based on the Autonomic Computing paradigm with the aim to achieve a systematic means to obtaining self-managing and autonomous robotic software for future space missions. Three specific streams of research within this area are summarised; cooperation between the autonomic robots, an autonomic robotic architecture and the development of middleware for easier and agile software development for such systems.
