An automatic photographic acquisition system to capture images of fingerprints on crime scenes for the public force is developed. For this, we propose a complete system, from the physical acquisition device to the software that automatically yields a 3D reconstruction of the fingerprint, i.e. the fingerprint and the surface on which the print is laid. The proposed technological solution is innovative, as it relies on a single captured color image of the scene, on which structured light is projected. Thus, the system is portable and as easy to use as a standard camera. Since the prototype is not finalized at the present time, our study focuses on the feasibility of the proposed solutions by means of simulations with a raytracer.
