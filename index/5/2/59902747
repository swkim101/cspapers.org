It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the First Workshop on Information and Knowledge Management for Developing Regions, IKM4DR'12. This workshop aims to bring the data management, information retrieval, and knowledge management communities together around questions of technology support for societal development. Our twin goals are to help to identify new applications for existing information and knowledge management technologies in developing regions and to inspire new research on problems that arise in developing region contexts. We anticipate a mix of industrial and academic participation. 
 
The workshop call was focused on three main themes: 
 
Components: Development of tools for low-resource languages that have the potential to transform information and knowledge management for those languages. 
 
Applications: Ways of employing new and existing data management, information retrieval and knowledge management technology to novel and important challenges that arise in the context of developing regions. 
 
Fostering adoption: Working together with partners from developing regions to craft solutions that embed societal expectations and values in ways that make it possible to achieve the envisioned impact. 
 
The call for papers attracted 10 submissions from India, China, Japan, and the United States. The program committee accepted 7 papers that cover a variety of topics, including voice search systems, domain specific search for low-resource languages and several applications in developing regions with respect to content management. In addition, the program includes invited talk on Text Books for Developing Regions, and a keynote speech by Ricardo Baeza-Yates. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers who are looking to bventure in the area of applying technologies for developing regions.
