This paper discusses the detailed design and development of a web based parallel multi-disciplinary optimization (PMDO) framework in the distributed computing environment. This system consists of the HTTP server, the XML parser and the communication module based on TCP/IP, and is built around a computational kernel called the ACES kernel, which provides powerful computation and evaluation capabilities as well as optimization routines specifically designed for engineering purposes. We formulate and subdivide an optimization problem into several sub-problems such that one node is designated as a master which solves the overall problem and the others are distributed to client nodes each of which handles each independent sub-optimization problem. In the iteration to solve the overall optimization problem, the master forwards necessary data to each client for updated values which are the solutions of sub-optimization problems and collects the results from all the client nodes. The master continues the iteration until the optimum is reached. All optimization problems are represented in XML form and provided as input to the master and each client node.Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME
