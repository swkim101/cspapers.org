In this paper, we study a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) based cooperative protocol using the partial relay selection (PRS) technique over Rayleigh fading channel. In the proposed scheme, a source S combines two different data and transmits them to two destinations D1 and D2. While the destination D1 receives data directly from the source S, the destination D2 only receives data with support from one of potential relay selection (RS) in this work which uses selection combining (SC) technique to combine the received data. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, analytical expressions of outage probability and ergodic sum capacity are derived. Finally, we performed Monte Carlo simulations to verify the theoretical analysis.
