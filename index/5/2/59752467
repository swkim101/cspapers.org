This paper introduces a new approach to programming that facilitates the construction and verification of applications. Called "Cumulative Subgoal Fulfillment" (CSF), it implements procedures by fulfilling and accumulating a sufficient set of subgoals. Each code block fulfilling a subgoal must keep invariant all subgoals already fulfilled. Using well-known programming problems, the paper demonstrates that CSF is new and that its simple form facilitates both the creation and checking of code.
