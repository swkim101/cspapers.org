Complex products are increasingly consisting of both software and hardware components which are closely interacting. Thus, modeling tools and processes need to support co-design of software and hardware in an integrated way. Currently, UML is the dominant graphical modeling notation for software, whereas Modelica is the major object-oriented mathematical modeling language for component-oriented modeling of complex physical systems, e.g., systems containing mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents. Here we present the first comprehensive UML-Modelica-SysML integrated modeling environment as a ModelicaML profile integrated in Eclipse. The profile reuses artifacts from the System Modeling Language (SysML) profile, and combines the major UML diagrams with Modelica graphic connection diagrams. Requirement, equation, and simulation diagrams are also supported in an integrated way. Moreover, the availability of the UML-style internal class diagram view for Modelica classes may also ease the understanding of modeling with Modelica for software developers with a UML background.
