A seat in a mass transit vehicle is supported by a shell cantilevered from a side wall of the vehicle interior. The shell comprises a pair of horizontally extending frame members and a trough-shaped structural skin. A blower is mounted within the housing defined by the skin to blow conditioned air through an opening in the bottom of the skin. A deflector is rotatably mounted on the outside of the skin. Vanes on the deflector deflect air blown through the opening in a direction determined by the position to which the deflector has been rotated.
