We describe Paper Code Explorer, a paper based interface for code exploration. This augmented reality system is designed to offer active exploration tools for programmers confronted with the problem of getting familiar with a large codebase. We first present an initial qualitative study that proved to be useful for informing the design of this system and then describe its main characteristics. As discussed in the conclusion, paper has many intrinsic advantages for our application.
