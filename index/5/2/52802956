ACM Fifth International Workshop on Data and Text Mining in Biomedical Informatics (DTMBIO 11) organizers are pleased to announce that the fifth DTMBIO will be held in conjunction with CIKM, one of the largest data and text mining conferences. While CIKM presents the state-of-the-art research in informatics with the primary focus on data and text mining, the main focus of DTMBIO is on biomedical informatics. DTMBIO delegates will bring forth interesting applications of up-to-date informatics in the context of biomedical research.
