This volume contains the papers presented at the tenth annual ACM Workshop on Digital Rights Management (DRM), sponsored by the ACM SIGSAC and held in conjunction with the 17th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CSS). The daylong workshop consisted of informal discussions, invited talks and peer-reviewed technical talks describing recent research contributions, including relatively mature work (regular papers) and more preliminary work-in-progress results (short papers). 
 
As in the past, the workshop provided an international forum that serves as an interdisciplinary bridge between areas that can be applied to DRM, including: cryptography, software, systems architecture and framework design, policy-management as well as various application areas including medical data management and securing program control flows. In addition, this year we were privileged to have two invited talks from different cross-sections of the DRM realm. The first of these was provided by Moni Naor, a leading professor in cryptology at Weizmann Institute of Science and a key contributor to numerous cryptographic techniques. The second invited talk was given by Warren Lieberfarb, an industry visionary on digital media and the former President of Warner Home Video (WHV).
