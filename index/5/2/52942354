This paper presents a structured survey of 119 publications from the proceedings of the International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) from 2013 to 2017. This survey on research methods and purposes is based upon a classification schema used by many others in HCI research. An extra dimension was added to the classification of research methods pertaining to the Research Domains, in order to provide a more insightful overview of the field. An analysis of the research methods and purposes, and domains of ISWC is presented. Additionally, the citation impact of ISWC publications is evaluated and compared over these dimensions. Current tendencies of the research presented at ISWC are identified with focus on the contextual setting of the research. Opportunities for future research at ISWC are identified.
