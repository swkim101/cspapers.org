Using a simulation model, experiments were conducted on various directory organization schemes and their performance implications. In particular we tested the effects of a multiprogrammed environment on system throughput for retrieval operations. Analysis of the results shows that different factors are relevant to performance for the various systems, and that under some circumstances ISAM and hash-coding may lose the advantages they possess over B-trees in a stand-alone environment when multiprogramming is used. Some results of sharing data among simultaneous users are also presented.
