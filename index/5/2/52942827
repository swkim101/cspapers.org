The form factors of current wearable devices are designed and limited to be worn at specifically defined on-body locations (such as the wrist), which can limit the interaction capabilities based on physical constraints in body movement and positioning. We investigate the design of a multi-functional wearable input device that can be worn at various locations on the body and may as well get mounted onto objects in the environment. This allows users to adjust the device's location to different affordances of varying situations and use cases. We present a SnapBand as such a multi-location touch input device that can be quickly snapped to different locations.
