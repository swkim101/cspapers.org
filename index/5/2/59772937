Wireless sensor network is made of small battery powered devices with limited energy resources. The big challenge in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is how to utilize energy efficiently and prolong network lifetime. Hence, energy efficiency is a key issue that needs to be enhanced in order to improve the life span of the network. Many routing protocol have been proposed in an effort to meet this demand. In this routing clustering process a similar method to BCDCP is used. In BCDCP all sensors send the data from CH (Cluster Head) and then to BS (Base Station). BCDCP works well in a small-scale network however not so much in a larger scale network since it uses a lot of energy for long distance wireless communication. To address this problem, we present Clustering Routing Protocol Base on Location Node (CRPBLN) in Wireless Sensor Networks. In this routing we adopt hierarchical structure and multi hop, before clustering is produced. The Cluster Head of each cluster sends the data to a CH Leader Node using multi hop which finally would send the aggregated data to the Base Station. The Simulation results shows that our scheme reduce energy dissipation and prolong network lifetime compared with BCDCP and GPRS.
