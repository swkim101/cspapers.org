The effectiveness evaluation indicators hierarchy of command and control system in joint operations is constructed based on the analysis of the architecture and characteristics. The main methods of effectiveness evaluation are discussed. According to characteristics of the joint operations, the design goal and the scheme are given by using combat-simulationbase method and the experiment framework of effectiveness evaluation for command and control system in the joint operations is designed and implemented.
