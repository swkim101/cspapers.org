The software industry is a minefield. It is littered with dangerous technological fads, waiting to blow up your project. The authors present an object modelled network management project which made it through the minefield. The management system (MS) runs on personal computers. It is aimed, with an attractive price, at small to medium sized networks. Despite this it offers very advanced functionality and incorporates open systems interconnection (OSI) communications technology. The authors describe the functionality of the system, interesting aspects of the design and the story of the project. They specifically discuss the following topics: functions of the system, design features, control of requirements, quality control, project management and cost control. >
