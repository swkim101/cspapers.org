In this paper, we present a large phase range unit-cell for X-band passive transmitarray antennas. The unit-cell is designed by using the combination of cut-circular patches and cut-ring slots. A 3-bit phase resolution has been optimized to provide eight values of the transmission phase with a step of 45°. The bandwidth of −1 dB transmission magnitude reaches 21.3%. A 10x10-element transmitarray based on the unit-cell configuration has been simulated. The transmitarray antenna provides good radiation patterns and a high aperture efficiency of 52.1%.
