In the last few years, a considerable amount of research effort has been put into creating networks of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) and Internet of Drones (IoDs) are the result of such efforts. FANETs assume that the member UAV nodes belong to different users. However, in UAV networks that would find their applications in areas such as agriculture, environment monitoring, crowd surveillance and natural disaster situations, all UAVs would belong to the same organization, creating a private UAV network. The number of UAVs used in private UAV networks is relatively small compared to that of FANETs due to the cost. If the packet routing approaches designed for FANETs are used in such networks, the quality of video transmitted through the network will suffer. This is because, while there can be many neighbors for each UAV in a FANET, the movements of UAVs in a private UAV network may cause some UAVs not to have any neighbors. To overcome this problem, a UAV in such a network needs to be controlled differently and an appropriate method of selecting the next hop node is required. The new approach presented in this paper uses mathematical analysis to find the optimum next hop node in a private UAV network by reducing a global optimization problem to a local optimization problem at each UAV node along the path from the source to the destination. Once the best next hop node is found, the UAVs can be controlled accordingly.
