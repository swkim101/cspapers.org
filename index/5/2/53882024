This study investigated the influence of balance and technique training (BTT) on external knee joint loading and the activation of muscles crossing the knee during anticipated (AnSS) and unanticipated (UnSS) sidestepping. Twenty-eight males participated in a 28 week training intervention implemented adjunct to their regular season training. Twelve completed BTT and 16 completed a ‘sham’ training (ST) intervention. Knee moments and the activation of 8 muscles crossing the knee were collected during AnSS and UnSS prior to and following training. BTT did not influence the activation of the muscles crossing the knee during AnSS or UnSS. Increases in muscle activation were not proportional to 
increases in valgus knee moments during UnSS in both groups. Unanticipated sport tasks should be identified as distinct factors associated with ACL injury risk.
