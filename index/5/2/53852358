Parallel computing environment may be useful for faster and real time shape transformation generation. However, it is difficult to parallelised most of the existing shape transformation algorithms. In this paper, we describe parallelisation of a particular shape transformation algorithm based on the basic shape transformation algorithm. "Master-Slave" model is adopted in parallelising the method with one master node and several slave nodes. Initially, one processor each is assigned to source and target data and slicing of both source and target data takes place until the desired number of steps has been reached. Parallelisation is also incorporated in the next step which is the interpolation phase and then also in surface reconstruction phase. We have shown that the proposed parallel version of the shape transformation algorithm is 'embarrassingly parallel'. The ease of implementing this parallel approach has also been compared to similar efforts in other shape transformation algorithms.
