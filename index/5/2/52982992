The long term evolution/system architecture evolution (LTE/SAE) networks have been shown vulnerable to desynchronization attack. In this attack, the adversary compromises a legitimate evolved NodeB and gains access to the encryption keys. The essential feasibility conditions have not been considered in the existing work. Hence, in this paper, we propose the conditions essential for the occurrence of DA. Through numerical results, we evaluate the feasibility of DA for various network scenarios.
