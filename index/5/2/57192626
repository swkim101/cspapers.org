Estimation of the forest height using Polarimetric SAR interferometry (PolInSAR) images is one of the most promising applications in the field of active microwave remote sensing. The three-stage inversion process has been one of the methods most by used with PolInSAR image for forest height retrieval. However, the method tends to underestimate the forest height due to attenuations of the electromagnetic waves in the ground medium. This paper proposes a modified three-stage method to improve the accuracy of forest height estimation and reduce the computational complexity based on combination of cancellation of scattering mechanism and complex coherence coefficient optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of forest heights.
