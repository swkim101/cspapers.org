This paper presents the research on and development of a robotic system for stripping paint and rust from steel bridges, with the ultimate objective of preventing human exposure to hazardous and dangerous debris (containing rust, paint particles, lead and/or asbestos), relieving human workers from labor intensive tasks and reducing costs associated with bridge maintenance. The robot system design, the key research challenges and enabling technologies and system development are discussed in detail. Research results obtained so far and discussions on some key issues are also presented.
