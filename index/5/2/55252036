This work introduces the design of a lattice array of multi-material compliant mechanisms (LCM) that diverts the impact radial force into tangential forces through the action of elastic hinges and connecting springs. When used as the helmet liner, the LCM liner design has the potential to reduce the risk of head injury through improved impact energy attenuation. The compliant mechanism array in the liner is optimized using a multi-material topology optimization algorithm. The performance of the LCM liner design is compared with the one obtained by expanded polypropylene (EPP) foam, which is traditionally used in sport helmets. An impact test is carried out using explicit, dynamic, nonlinear finite element analysis. The parameters under consideration include the internal energy, the peak linear force, as well as von Mises stress and effective plastic strain distributions. Although there is a small increase in stress and strain values, the simulations show that the maximum internal of the LCM liner design is four times the one of the foam design while the peak linear force is reduced to about half. While the use of the LCM liner design is intended for sports helmets, this design may find application in other energy absorbing structures such as crashworthy vehicle components, blast mitigating structures, and protective gear.Copyright Â© 2017 by ASME
