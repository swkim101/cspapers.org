This paper presents a pulse leakage cancellation technique for fully integration microwave pulse transceiver for range sensing radar applications. The pulse leakage cancellation principle is based on a polarity-reversal time-controlled switch placed at the receiver input. By controlling the polarity and timing of the switch, the receiver can measure and detect both reflected and leakage pulse signals and hence leakage cancellation can be performed. A demonstration of this method is implemented on a 180-nm CMOS transceiver including a microwave damping-pulse transmitter and a receiver. On-chip dipole antennas are integrated into both transmitter and receiver on the same chip. Experimental results with/without reflector are performed to demonstrate the technique. In addition, reflected signals are measured separately from pulse leakage signals in each different distances.
