Pl@ntNet is a large-scale participatory platform and information system dedicated to the production of botanical data through image-based plant identification. In June 2015, Pl@ntNet mobile front-ends moved from classical hand-crafted visual features to deep-learning based image representations. This paper gives an overview of today's Pl@ntNet architecture and discusses how the introduction of convolutional neural networks did improve the whole workflow along the years. (Resume d'auteur)
