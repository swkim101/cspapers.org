This paper, describes a format and grading scheme for a discussion course in Computing Ethics. The teaching of ethics, particularly in a discussion format, can be somewhat problematic in a computer science department where courses tend to be technical and faculty tend to be more comfortable with material presented in a lecture and/or workshop format. Grading of discussion and papers can also be perceived as more difficult or, at least, less grounded in objective criteria. The following describes an approach that attempts to address those particular concerns. The course described was offered in the spring of 2003 when two sections were taught.
