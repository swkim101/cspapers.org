E-textiles that enable distribution of electronic components have advantages for wearable technology, in that functionality, power, and networking can be spread over a much larger area while preserving hand-feel and wearability. However, textile-embedded circuitry often must be machine-washable to conform to user expectations for care and maintenance, particularly for garments. In this study, we evaluate the robustness to home laundering of a previously-developed cut-and-sew technique for assembling e-textile circuits. Alternative surface insulation materials, textile substrate properties, and soldered component joints are evaluated. After around 1000 minutes (16.67 hours) of rigorous washing and drying, we measured a best-case 0% failure rate for component solder joints, and a best-case 0.38 ohm/m maximum increase in trace resistance. Liquid silicone seam sealer was effective in protecting 100% of solder joints. Two tape-type alternative surface insulation materials were effective in protecting bare traces and component attachment points respectively. Overall, results demonstrate the feasibility of producing insulated, washable cut-and-sew circuits for smart garment manufacturing.
