Sleep position is directly related to sleep quality especially in patients with sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or snoring. We propose SleeP-Manager, a wearable embedded system, that is designed to aid Sleep Positional Therapy (SPT). SleeP-Manager with two wristbands monitors the sleep position of the user and gives a vibration feedback when a poor position is detected. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of SleeP-Manager. In order to accomplish this, an additional device of chestband is designed. The chestband provides the true sleep position and also measures the response of users to the vibration feedback. The results indicate that the accuracy of sleep position detection higher than 80%, and the ratio of desired sleep position per night increased significantly by the use of SleeP-Manager. Our questionnaire survey shows the wristband-typed device is most preferred for SPT due to the cost-effectiveness, easy-to-wear, and practicality.
