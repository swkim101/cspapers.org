This article describes preliminary work on a research environment called Virtual Synergy to represent a shared virtual map of an area for multiple autonomous robots by modifying the GameBots 3D multi-agent system. The use of GameBots will allow multiple users to interact with robots and agents at different levels of adjustable or dynamic autonomy. By interacting with the robots as another team member, the users take on different roles to suit the situation: supervisor, peer, mechanic, teleoperator, and spectator.
