The PADTAD 2010 workshop is a two-day event at ISSTA 2010, focusing on techniques and systems that aid in the testing, analysis, and debugging of multi-threaded, parallel and distributed applications and systems. The workshop has a practical and applied emphasis on systems that have been implemented in (at least) prototype form, but also welcomes submissions on teaching related issues on these topics.
