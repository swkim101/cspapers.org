High-recall retrieval --- finding all or nearly all relevant documents --- is critical to applications such as electronic discovery, systematic review, and the construction of test collections for information retrieval tasks. The effectiveness of current methods for high-recall information retrieval is limited by their reliance on human input, either to generate queries, or to assess the relevance of documents. Past research has shown that humans can assess the relevance of documents faster and with little loss in accuracy by judging shorter document surrogates, e.g.\ extractive summaries, in place of full documents. To test the hypothesis that short document surrogates can reduce assessment time and effort for high-recall retrieval, we conducted a 50-person, controlled, user study. We designed a high-recall retrieval system using continuous active learning (CAL) that could display either full documents or short document excerpts for relevance assessment. In addition, we tested the value of integrating a search engine with CAL. In the experiment, we asked participants to try to find as many relevant documents as possible within one hour. We observed that our study participants were able to find significantly more relevant documents when they used the system with document excerpts as opposed to full documents. We also found that allowing participants to compose and execute their own search queries did not improve their ability to find relevant documents and, by some measures, impaired performance. These results suggest that for high-recall systems to maximize performance, system designers should think carefully about the amount and nature of user interaction incorporated into the system.
