In this paper, we introduce the achievement of the flight motion to pass through small opening by the multilinked and transformable aerial robot. Previous works about such motion are based on under-actuated multirotors, indicating that aggressive maneuvering is necessary condition. This involves two crucial problems: i) enough free space for deceleration is necessary, otherwise the robot would collide with unknown obstacle after exiting opening; ii) the multirotor can not traverse the openings that are smaller than the robot body. The proposed transformable aerial robot in our work can solve these problems, since the multilinked model can not only guarantee the near-hover condition during the whole motion sequence, but also slowly traverse relative small openings by changing its form like a snake. We first propose an improved dynamics derivation and flight control method for this multilinked aerial robot based on our previous work. Then, we present the path planning method which takes the flight stability in the near-hover condition into account. Finally we demonstrate the experimental results of the motion to pass through a horizontal and small opening which also involves the borders (the floor and the ceiling).
