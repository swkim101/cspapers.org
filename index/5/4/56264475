Security is a very important aspect of any computing systems, and has become a serious problem since companies and their infrastructure have become distributed in very heterogeneous fashion. In this paper we describe a new security structure for distributed systems. In this structure, security is distributed in the system level and all of the components have their distinct security responsible, which updating by security server. Therefore authorization is changed dynamically and total system polices handled by security server.
