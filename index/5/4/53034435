User data is becoming increasingly available in various domains from the social Web to patient health records. User data is characterized by a combination of demographics (e.g., age, gender, occupation) and user actions (e.g., rating a movie, following a diet). User data analytics is usually based on identifying group-level behaviors such as "countryside teachers who watch Woody Allen movies." User Group Analytics (UGA) addresses peculiarities of user data such as noise and sparsity. This tutorial reviews research on UGA and discusses different approaches and open challenges for group discovery, exploration, and visualization.
