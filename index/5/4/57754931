This paper investigates how individuals react in a situation when an experimenter (human or robot) either tells them to stop in the middle of playing the Jenga game, or accidentally bumps into a table and makes the tower fall down. The mood of the participants and different physiological parameters (i.e., galvanic skin response (GSR) and facial temperature variation) are extracted and analysed based on the condition, experimenter, and psychological questionnaires (i.e., TEQ, TEIQ, RST-PQ). This study was a between participants study with 23 participants. Our results show that multiple GSR parameters (e.g., latency, amplitude, number of peaks) differ significantly based on the condition and the experimenter the participants interacted with. The temperature variation in three regions of interest (i.e., forehead, left, and right periorbital regions) are good indicators of how ready an individual is to react in an unforeseen situation.
