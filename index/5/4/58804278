In this paper, we present an adaptive fault detection scheme for wireless sensor networks. It uses local information from neighboring nodes to dynamically adjust critical parameters in distributed fault detection algorithms, resulting in high performance for a wide range of fault probabilities. Computer simulation shows that the scheme is scalable with the number of faulty nodes except for sparse networks where the average node degree is extremely low.
