This paper presents a method for numerically computing the highest path velocity that a collaborative robot can attain, while complying with safety requirements. The safety requirements are obtained from ISO/TS 15066 that describes a collaborative method called power and force limiting, which specifies safe collisions between humans and robots. In particular, we assume that a path is given and compute the point-wise maximal path velocity that ensures a safe impact, i.e., the paper provides no considerations on the post impact safety.
