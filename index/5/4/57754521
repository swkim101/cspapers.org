Robotic teleoperation is a key technology for a wide variety of fields. Teleoperating a humanoid in particular is essential as it allows the user to act remotely on an interface designed especially for humans, e.g., in a space station, or operating tools and machinery in disaster scenarios. This paper presents a ‘task-relevant’ haptic interface for humanoid teleoperation, which bridges the gap between the task at hand and the balance of the robot. The operator is given command over the humanoid's hands and is informed through haptic cues about the impact of her/his potential actions on the robot’ stability. Moreover, a null-space autonomous controller acts in the operator's null-space to provide her/him with a wider workspace and help in the successful execution of the task. The architecture is designed to top an existing compliance controller for a torque-controlled humanoid robot. Experiments on the humanoid robot TORO are reported to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.
