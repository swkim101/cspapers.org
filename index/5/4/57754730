A method for recovery from the complete loss of the state estimate is presented for autonomous quadcopters. Given an aerodynamic force model, the only measurements used to reinitialize the state estimate by means of a bank of extended Kalman filters are the angular rate and linear acceleration measurements of an IMU. The method is integrated within a complete recovery logic on a quadcopter platform and experimentally evaluated.
