A common characteristic of all ad-hoc networks is that of emergent properties. Intuitively, emergent properties are features that cannot be provided by individual network nodes themselves but instead result from interaction and collaboration among network nodes. In this talk, we present the salient characteristics of these properties and discuss their security implications. Several examples of emergent properties in sensor and ad-hoc networks are discussed including key connectivity, trust establishment, and node replica detection. We conclude with a common theme of current research in security of emergent properties, namely that of a new threat model whereby the adversary may adaptively compromise nodes of a network. We contrast this theme with that of past research that limits an adversary to "man-in-the-middle" attacks and relies exclusively on end-to-end security solutions.
