We tackle the transition feasibility problem, that is the issue of determining whether there exists a feasible motion connecting two configurations of a legged robot. To achieve this we introduce CROC, a novel method for computing centroidal dynamics trajectories in multi-contact planning contexts. Our approach is based on a conservative and convex reformulation of the problem, where we represent the center of mass trajectory as a Bezier curve comprising a single free control point as a variable. Under this formulation, the transition problem is solved efficiently with a Linear Program (LP)of low dimension. We use this LP as a feasibility criterion, incorporated in a sampling-based contact planner, to discard efficiently unfeasible contact plans. We are thus able to produce robust contact sequences, likely to define feasible motion synthesis problems. We illustrate this application on various multi-contact scenarios featuring HRP2 and HyQ. We also show that we can use CROC to compute valuable initial guesses, used to warm-start non-linear solvers for motion generation methods. This method could also be used for the 0 and 1-Step capturability problem. The source code of CROC is available under an open source BSD-2 License.
