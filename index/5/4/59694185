Welcome to PIKM 2008, the 2nd PhD Workshop on Information and Knowledge Management. PIKM 2008 is a forum for graduate students in databases, information retrieval or knowledge management to present their preliminary work and get feedback from experienced researchers. This workshop builds on the success of the PIKM 2007 workshop, the first in the series, held in conjunction with ACM CIKM 2007 in Lisboa, Portugal. 
 
The call for papers attracted 29 submissions from thirteen countries across Asia, Europe, and North America. The program committee accepted 19 high quality submissions (10 as full papers, 9 as poster papers) covering a variety of topics, including database systems, text mining, semantic web, social networks, and human computer interaction.
