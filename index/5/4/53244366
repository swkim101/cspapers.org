This is a video demonstration for a full paper available in MobiSys'14 proceedings http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2594368.2594375. The video demonstrates several forms of authentication on a common tablet, and compares them to our method for gesture-based authentication. Our method measures the security and memorability of user generated free-form gestures by estimating the mutual information of repeated gestures. We show examples of such gestures with high and low mutual information content. We also show what information from each is visible to a shoulder surfing attacker, and describe how our system is resistant to such an attack.
