Understanding Internet traffic dynamics in large cellular networks is important for network design, troubleshooting, performance evaluation, and optimization. In this paper, we present the results from our study, which is based upon a week-long aggregated flow level mobile device traffic data collected from a major cellular operator's core network. In this study, we measure and characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of mobile Internet traffic. We distinguish our study from other related work by conducting the measurement at a larger scale and exploring mobile data traffic patterns along two new dimensions -- device types and applications that generate such traffic patterns. Based on the findings of our measurement analysis, we propose a Zipf-like model to capture the volume distribution of application traffic and a Markov model to capture the volume dynamics of aggregate Internet traffic. We further customize our models for different device types using an unsupervised clustering algorithm to improve prediction accuracy.
