Abstract : A novel method for feature extraction has been applied to a problem of three-dimensional object recognition (Intrator and Gold, 1991). The method is related to recent statistical theory (Huber, 1985; Friedman, 1987) and is derived from a biologically motivated computational theory (Bienenstock et al., 1982). Results of an initial study replicating recent psychophysical experiments (Buelthoff and Edelman, 1991) demonstrated the utility of the proposed method for feature extraction. The authors describe further experiments designed to analyze the nature of the extracted features and their relevance to the theory and psychophysics of object recognition.
