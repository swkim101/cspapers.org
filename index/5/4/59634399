In this work by using free software Maxima, we have derived the Lie classical symmetries of a third order wave equations of KdV type. We have determined the subclasses of this equations which are self-adjoint. By using a general theorem on conservation laws proved by N.H. Ibragimov [4] we find conservation laws associated to Lie symmetries for some of these partial differential equations without classical Lagrangians.
