This volume contains the papers selected for presentation at the 12th Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society (WPES 2013), held in Berlin, Germany, on November 4, 2013, in conjunction with the ACM CCS conference. 
 
In response to the workshop's call for papers, 103 papers were submitted to the conference from 27 different countries. Each paper has been reviewed by three members of the program committee, who considered its significance, novelty, technical quality, and interest for the research and industrial community in their evaluation. The program committee's work was carried out electronically, yielding intensive discussion. Of the submitted papers, the program committee accepted 20 full papers (resulting in an acceptance rate of 19.4%) and 10 short papers for presentation at the workshop. Due to the record number of submissions received this year and to their high technical level, many top quality papers were not selected for publication.
