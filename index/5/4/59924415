An air conditioner louver construction which permits easy insertion of a control wheel into the frame of the louver by virtue of a unique approach, whereupon the control wheel is locked into place by a novel frame structure that permits rotation in each direction and positively prevents inadvertent dislocation of the control wheel from the louver frame, while also providing a reduced complexity and increased air volume in a louver construction.
