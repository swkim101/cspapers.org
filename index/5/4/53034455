Multi-view clustering has received an increasing attention in many applications, where different views of objects can provide complementary information to each other. Existing approaches on multi-view clustering mainly focus on extending Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) by enforcing the constraint over the coefficient matrices from different views in order to preserve their consensus. In this paper, we argue that it is more reasonable to utilize the high-level manifold consensus rather than the low-level coefficient matrix consensus to better capture the underlying clustering structure of the data. Moreover, it is also effective to utilize the sparse coding framework, instead of the NMF framework, to deal with the sparsity issue. To this end, we propose a novel approach, named Multiple Manifold Regularized Sparse Coding (MMRSC). Experimental results on two publicly available real-world image datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches for the multi-view image clustering task.
