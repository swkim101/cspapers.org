The existing sporadic task model is inadequate for real-time systems to take advantage of Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), which has been shown to improve performance in many areas of computing, but has seen little application to real-time systems. A new family of task models, collectively referred to as SMART, is introduced. SMART models allow for combining SMT and real time by accounting for the variable task execution costs caused by SMT.
