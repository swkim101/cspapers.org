We show that the parallax motion resulting from non-nodal rotation in panorama capture can be exploited for light field construction from commodity hardware. Automated panoramic image capture typically seeks to rotate a camera exactly about its nodal point, for which no parallax motion is observed. This can be difficult or impossible to achieve due to limitations of the mounting or optical systems, and consequently a wide range of captured panoramas suffer from parallax between images. We show that by capturing such imagery over a regular grid of camera poses, then appropriately transforming the captured imagery to a common parameterisation, a light field can be constructed. The resulting four-dimensional image encodes scene geometry as well as texture, allowing an increasingly rich range of light field processing techniques to be applied. Employing an Ocular Robotics REV25 camera pointing system, we demonstrate light field capture, refocusing and low-light image enhancement.
