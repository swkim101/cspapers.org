The design process for leg morphology has taken much of its inspiration from the manipulator community, including the concept of maximizing the workspace of a design. In this paper, we define the concept of Effective Dynamic Workspace, which examines the subset of the overall workspace capable of achieving the desired template dynamics. With this new design tool, the leg configuration of a new multi-modal platform BOBCAT is examined and refined. With the refined design, BOBCAT is able to achieve speeds of 2m/s while running and 0.17m/s while climbing a vertical wall.
