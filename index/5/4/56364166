Cooperative working mode is among the important ways to improve the efficiency and quality of ship design. This paper conducts a research on the real-time cooperative working mode for ship design, which is developed by means of compound sharing mode and in which the application of such two modes of transmission as strong link and weak link makes the system real-time and effective. Based on the general design platform, the remotely real-time cooperative ship design is accomplished. Thanks to this mode of design, the ship design cycle could be effectively shortened and correspondingly the cost of design is cut down.
