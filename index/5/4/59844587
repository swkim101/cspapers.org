It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the MobiArch'08 -- The 3rd ACM International Workshop on Mobility in the Evolving Internet Architecture. The workshop builds of the success of the earlier MobiArch workshops through continuing to focus on leading edge issues in Internet Architectures. The focus of MobiArch'08 is on advances in architectures, protocols and emerging technologies to enable mobility and multihoming in the Internet, as well as concepts and designs to support widespread mobility and multihoming in future internetworks. 
 
The workshop will start with a keynote address from Dave Thaler. Dave Thaler is a Software Architect in the Windows Networking group at Microsoft and will provide a very interesting overview of the problems that arise in separating addresses used by routing ("locators") from the identifiers used by applications and higher-layer protocols such as TCP that is very much being driven by the greater mobility, multihoming, and routing scalability issues that are prominent today. 
 
The programme also includes 15 papers focusing on various mobility and architecture issues as well as applications. The programme committee did a marvelous job of reviewing the submitted papers and much thanks is due to them. The workshop also features a panel organized by Jorg Ott from Helsinki University of Technology and entitled How much Mobility do we need? 
 
We hope that you will find this program interesting and thought-provoking and that the workshop will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.
