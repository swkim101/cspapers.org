The fourth ACM international workshop on cloud data management is held in Maui, Hawaii, USA on October 29, 2012 and co-located with the ACM 21th Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). The main objective of the workshop is to address the challenges of large scale data management based on the cloud computing infrastructure. The workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from cloud computing, distributed storage, query processing, parallel algorithms, data mining, and system analysis, all attendees share common research interests in maximizing performance, reducing cost of cloud data management and enlarging the scale of their endeavors. We have constructed an exciting program of seven refereed papers and four invited keynote talks that will give participants a full dose of emerging research.
