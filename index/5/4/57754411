In this paper, Dynamic Dumbbell, a novel robotic device for advanced muscular exercise of upper limb is presented. The type of exercise load is classified and designed in terms of mechanical engineering to be implemented in Dynamic Dumbbell. The exercise load model, which is named as programmable exercise load, is realized by Dynamic Dumbbell. To generate the programmable exercise load, two of compact Planetary-geared Elastic Actuator, which is a rotary Series Elastic Actuator (SEA), are utilized in Dynamic Dumbbell. The SEAs are controlled using high performance force control algorithm. Experimental results verifies the effectiveness of the proposed Dynamic Dumbbell and programmable exercise load.
