We propose a new security measure for commitment pro- tocols, called Universally Composable (UC) Commitment. The measure guarantees that commitment protocols behave like an \ideal commitment service," even when concurrently composed with an arbitrary set of pro- tocols. This is a strong guarantee: it implies that security is maintained even when an unbounded number of copies of the scheme are running concurrently, it implies non-malleability (not only with respect to other copies of the same protocol but even with respect to other protocols), it provides resilience to selective decommitment, and more. Unfortunately, two-party uc commitment protocols do not exist in the plain model. However, we construct two-party uc commitment protocols, based on general complexity assumptions, in the common reference string model where all parties have access to a common string taken from a predetermined distribution. The protocols are non-interactive, in the sense that both the commitment and the open- ing phases consist of a single message from the committer to the receiver.
