In this paper we discuss symmetry reductions and exact solutions of a K(m, n) equation with generalized evolution term, which is of considerable interest in mathematical physics, using the nonclassical method due to Bluman and Cole. We implement the nonclassical method by means of the program ppb.bat by using the software MACSYMA.
