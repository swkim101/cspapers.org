Sequence learning and management have been reported as central features in behavioral studies. Indeed, tasks like route memorization or planning are temporal behaviors and can be hardly modeled without taking the temporal aspect into consideration. On the contrary, classical information processing tools are not very efficient at such temporal processing. In this paper, we shortly review these tools and show that another approach, close to neurobiological modeling, can yield a variety of neuronal mechanisms for several aspects of sequence learning and management.
