This paper presents a face portrait with cartoon stylization painting and associated algorithms with the visual feedback system to paint like a human cartoonist. The robot cartoonist creates the artwork in two stages-cartoon style transformation and robot artist for colorful painting. In the cartoon style transformation stage, it transfers human portrait photos to cartoon style by face detection and alignment, which can effectively decompose the face into individual components then replace by cartoon facial components. In the second stage, the robot uses an eye-in-hand system to obtain five basic colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, white and black) to automatically mix a variety of colors automatically. For painting strategy, we start with the outline of the face, which we use non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) to generate hand-painted strokes. After that, the robot artist will implement painting the facial features. We also demonstrate the success of this proposed research.
