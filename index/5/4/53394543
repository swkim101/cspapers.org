We present highlights from our work on enriching the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), to be released to the community in Fall 2018 as the PDTB-3. We have increased its coverage of discourse relations (from ⇠ 40K to ⇠ 53k), the majority in intra-sentential contexts. Our work on these new relations has led us to augment and/or modify aspects of the annotation guidelines, including the sense hierarchy, and all changes have been propagated through the rest of the corpus.
