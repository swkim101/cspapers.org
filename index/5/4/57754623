Compressing soft-obstacles secondary to a controlled motion task is common for human beings. While these tasks are nearly trivial for teleoperated robots, they remain a challenging problem in robotic autonomy. Addressing the problem is significant. For example, in Minimally Invasive Surgeries (MISs), safely compressing soft tissues ensures the surgical safety and decreases tissue removal, thus dramatically decreases surgical trauma and operating room time, and leads to improved surgical outcomes. In this work, we define the problem of soft-obstacle avoidance and project the safety motion constraints into the task space and the velocity space. We illustrate the significance of addressing this problem in the robotic surgery scenario. We present a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) based solution, which formulates the problem as an inequality constrained optimization problem and solves it in its dual space. The application of the proposed method was demonstrated in the Raven II surgical robot. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is effective in addressing the soft-obstacle avoidance problem.
