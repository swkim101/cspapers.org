A number of systems have been built which integrate the knowledge representations of hypermedia and knowledge-based systems. Experiences with such have shown users are willing to use the semi-formal mechanisms of such systems systems leaving much structure implicit rather than use the formal mechanisms provided. The problem remains that it is hard (1) to encode knowledge in the formal languages required by knowledge-based systems and (2) to provide support with the semi-formal knowledge found in hypermedia systems. Incremental formalization enables users to enter information into the system in an informal or semi-formal representation and to have computer support for the formalization of this information. The domain independent Hyper-Object Substrate (HOS) differs from other systems that integrate hypermedia and knowledge-based system styles of representations in that it enables the incremental addition of formalism to any piece of information in the system. HOS actively supports incremental formalization with a set of tools which suggest new formalizations to be added to the information space. These suggestions are based on patterns in the informally and semi-formally represented information and the existing formalized knowledge in the information space. An important assumption is that suggestions need not be completely accurate to be of general benefit to users. These suggestions provide a starting point which can be edited, thus changing part of of formalization from creation to modification. XNetwork, an environment the process supporting the design of computer networks, is one of several applications that have been created with HOS. Experiences with HOS show that its flexibility for incrementally adding and formalizing information is useful for the rapid prototyping and modification of semi-formal information spaces.
