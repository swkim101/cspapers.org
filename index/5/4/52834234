Time series motif discovery is an important primitive for time series analytics, and is used in domains as diverse as neuroscience, music and sports analytics. In recent years, algorithmic advances (coupled with hardware improvements) have greatly expanded the purview of motif discovery. Nevertheless, we argue that there is an insatiable need for further scalability. This is because more than most types of analytics, motif discovery benefits from interactivity. The two state-of-the-art algorithms to find motifs are STOMP, which requires O(n2) time, and STAMP, which, despite being an O(logn) factor slower, is the preferred solution for most applications, as it is a fast converging anytime algorithm. In favorable scenarios STAMP needs only to be run to a small fraction of completion to provide a very accurate approximation of the top-k motifs. In this work we introduce SCRIMP++, an O(n2) time algorithm that is also an anytime algorithm, combining the best features of STOMP and STAMP. As we shall show, SCRIMP++ maintains all the desirable properties of the original algorithms, but converges much faster, in almost all scenarios producing the correct output after spending a tiny fraction of the full computation time. We argue that for many end-users, this allows motif discovery to be performed in interactive sessions. Moreover, this interactivity can be game changing in terms of the analytics that can be performed.
