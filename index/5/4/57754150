Several approaches are proposed in the literature to calculate the drag force, the electric field and the induced dielectrophoretic force. This paper analyzes the performances of various models for closed loop control of dielectrophoretic systems in comparison with experiments. This article compares their performance in terms of accuracy, computation time, and memory consumption. Four classical approaches are available to calculate the electric field. Their performances are analyzed in the paper. We have shown that combining the dipolar model of dielectrophoresis force with an anisotropic drag force (integrating the wall-effect) provides an interesting ratio precision/computation time. This paper provides an original comparison of several models described in literature whose performances have been compared with experiments.
