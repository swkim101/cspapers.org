The triangular quadrotor is a novel, more efcient conguration of quadrotor aircraft that uses a single large central rotor for lift and three smaller rotors for counter-torque and manoeuvering. Early experiments exhibited a precession eect due to the uncompensated gyroscopics of the main rotor. In this paper we discuss two techniques to x this problem: feedback linearisation and a mechanical apping joint. Simulations indicate that, contrary to expectations, feedback linearisation is not viable due to delays in the control system. The rotor apping approach is shown to be a more eective solution, both in simulation and ight experiments.
