The Mobile Message Passing Interface (MMPI) is a library implemented under J2ME to provide the fundamental functions that can be found in the standard MPI libraries used on Clusters and Parallel Machines. Nodes of a Cluster are usually connected to one another over a very high speed cabled interconnect. Within the mobile domain one does not have the luxury of connecting the devices with cabling, hence the MMPI library was built to take advantage of the Bluetooth capabilities that the majority of current mobile devices feature as standard. Mobile devices inherently have limited processing abilities. The MMPI library alleviates this problem by allowing the processing power of several devices to be used. Thus one can solve problems that a single device would be incapable of doing within a reasonable time frame. This paper discusses how the MMPI library can be applied to the application domain of Bluetooth enabled mobile gaming.
