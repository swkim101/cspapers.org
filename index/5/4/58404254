In a talk entitled "Trajectory Control of Convergent Networks with applications to TSP", Natan Peterfreund (Computer Science, Technion) dealt with the problem of controlling the trajectories of continuous convergent neural networks models for solving optimization problems, without affecting their equilibria set and their convergence properties. Natan presented a class of feedback control functions which achieve this objective, while also improving the convergence rates. A modified Hopfield and Tank neural network model, developed through the proposed feedback approach, was found to substantially improve the results of the original model in solving the Traveling Salesman Problem. The proposed feedback overcame the 2n symmetric property of the TSP problem.
