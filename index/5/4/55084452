This paper explores the feasibility of a Multi-Sensor-Based Predictive Control (MSBPC) approach for addressing backward nonparallel (perpendicular and diagonal) parking problems of car-like vehicles as an alternative to more classical (e.g. path planning based) approaches. The results of a few individual cases are presented to illustrate the behavior and performance of the proposed approach as well as results from exhaustive simulations to assess its convergence and stability. Indeed, preliminary results are encouraging, showing that the vehicle is able to park successfully from virtually any sensible initial position.
