This volume contains the papers selected for presentation at the 13th ACM International Symposium on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM-GIS 2005) in conjunction with the 14th International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (ACM-CIKM 2005) in Bremen, Germany on November 4 and 5, 2005.The mission of this 13th ACM-GIS is to bring together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners carrying out research and development in novel systems based on geo-spatial data and knowledge, and fostering interdisciplinary discussions and research in all aspects of geographic information systems. The symposium will provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation, and applications of GIS.In response to the call for papers, the program committee received 85 submissions, out of which 31 were selected for presentation and included in these proceedings. Each paper was carefully reviewed by at least three members of the program committee and external reviewers. The selection of the ACM-GIS'05 papers was based primarily on their potential to influence future research. In addition, the program committee invited one keynote speaker for additional presentations in the symposium.
