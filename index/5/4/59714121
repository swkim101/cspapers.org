This paper describes a lexical organization in which "senses" are represented in their own right, along with "words" and "phrases", by distinct data items. The objective of the scheme is to facilitate recognition and employment of synonyms and stock phrases by programs which process natural language. Besides presenting the proposed organization, the paper characterizes the lexical "senses" which result.
