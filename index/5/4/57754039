This article studies imitation learning policies that encode task compliance to provide teleoperation assistance for remote manufacturing. The central challenge is how to handle off-nominal situations, such as out-of-sequence work or unplanned obstacles, since the assistance has not been trained to handle such scenarios. In such cases, there is potential for the assistance to degrade-rather than improve-operator performance. This work proposes a method that exploits the learned task compliance to classify persistent human actions as off-nominal, and attenuate assistance in these regions. Applied to a hole-cleaning task with $n$ = 11 subjects, the proposed method shows up to 17% reduction in task completion time and up to 68% reduction in forces in off-nominal situations as compared to assistance without the method. Additionally, the method retains the performance improvements of assistance in nominal operating regimes.
