As different construction organisations evolve and widen their activities they have to define their strategy to manage their organisational knowledge. This involves managing the knowledge gained by different individuals working on different projects. Within the last decade, many researchers and practitioners have come up with many strategies, processes, mechanisms, IT and non-IT tools, in order to capture knowledge from projects and make them part of the overall organisational knowledge. Further, work has also been done to develop strategies in order to reuse that knowledge to new projects by either same individuals or by new personnel. There have been many opportunities whereby new knowledge has been created by using the previous experiences, knowledge, and information by management and employees of an organisation. This paper will present a case study, conducted with a local authority (a public sector client organisation) within the UK to study one of their strategies for knowledge management, including Knowledge Capture, Sharing, and Reuse by their employees as well as by other organisations working to deliver the construction projects as part of framework agreement in the North West of England.
