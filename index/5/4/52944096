1D Eyewear uses 1D arrays of LEDs and pre-recorded holographic symbols to enable minimal head-worn displays. Our approach uses computer-generated holograms (CGHs) to create diffraction gratings which project a pre-recorded static image when illuminated with coherent light. Specifically, we develop a set of transmissive, reflective, and steerable optical configurations that can be embedded in conventional eyewear designs. This approach enables high resolution symbolic display in discreet digital eyewear.
