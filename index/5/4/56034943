Now, the system developers are talking about machines that would have some degrees of awareness. In other words, the machines will have some built-in intelligence as the results of implementing self-awareness computing. One can readily find industrial robots that would reduce their motionâ€™s speed upon detecting the presence of human operators nearby. It is forecasted that there will be about two million units of an industrial robot in operational by the year 2017 [1]. By the same year, all industrial robots should expect to possess functional self-awareness modules.
