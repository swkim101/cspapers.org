Limited perception capabilities underwater shrink the envelope of effective localization techniques that can be applied in this environment. Long-term localization in six degrees of freedom can only be achieved by combining different sources of information. A multiple vehicle underwater localization solution, for localizing an underwater mining vehicle and its support vessel, is presented in this paper. The surface vessel carries a short baseline network, that interact with the inverted ultra-short baseline, carried by the underwater mining vehicle. A multiple antenna GNSS system provides data for localizing the surface vessel and to georeference the short baseline array. Localization of the mining vehicle results from a data fusion approach, that combines multiple sources of sensor information using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework. The developed solutions were applied in the context of the Â¡VAMOS! European project. Long-term real time position errors below 0.2 meters, for the underwater machine, and 0.02 meters, for the surface vessel, were accomplished in the field. All presented results are based on data acquired in a real scenario.
