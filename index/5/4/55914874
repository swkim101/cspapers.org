Voting is one of the important ways to solve the problem of collective decision-making. Previous work assumes that voters are only concerned about their own preference. However, in sequential voting, voters can see the results of voters who voted before them, such externalities naturally arise in sequential voting. This paper considers the externalities in sequential voting which use the traditional Borda counting rules. We establish a voting model to describe the voting strategies of sequential voting with externalities. In our prediction model, an agent will do a prediction in the case that he cannot bring change to the voting result no matter how he changes his preference order, under this circumstance, an agent will vote in accordance with his preference order. The voting model provides a theoretical reference for the actual situation of voting behavior. Keywords-component; Externalities; Strategy Voting; Sequential Voting; Borda rule; Prediction
