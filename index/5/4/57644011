With the growing adoption of Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology, there is a compelling need for an SDN emulator that can facilitate experimenting with new SDN solutions. Unfortunately, Mininet, the de facto standard emulator for software defined networks, fails to scale with network size and traffic volume. To address these limitations, we developed Distributed OpenFlow Testbed (DOT), a highly scalable emulator for SDN. It can emulate large SDN deployments by distributing the workload over a cluster of compute nodes. Moreover, DOT can emulate a wider range of network services compared to other publicly available SDN emulators and simulators. Our demonstration will illustrate several features of DOT including: (i) how easy it is to setup the emulator, (ii) how to deploy a topology using a single configuration file, (iii) how to run a connectivity test to ensure that the emulated network is properly deployed, and (iv) how to control and monitor the emulated components from a centralized location. We will also showcase DOT by emulating two applications: (i) policy based traffic steering through middleboxes and (ii) traffic monitoring.
