The development of the semantic web makes the facilitation of agent communication an issue of increasing importance. It is often assumed that agents are using the same ontology and hence can understand one another, but the dynamic and distributed nature of the semantic web can mean that this is not always a valid assumption. We describe a system that can dynamically discover some ontological mismatches between agents during communication and then reïƒžne them, to enable communication to proceed successfully between these agents.
