One of the more interesting solutions of the Boussinesq equation are the soliton solutions. We previously derived a complete group classification for a generalized Boussinesq (GB) equation. In this paper we first show how the recently free software MAXIMA program symmgrp2009.max derived by W. Heremann can be used to calculate the determining equations for the classical symmetries of the GB equation. Using classical Lie symmetries, we now consider traveling-wave reductions. The corresponding solutions of the generalized Boussinesq equation exhibit solitary waves and bound states.
