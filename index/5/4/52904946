A letter reproduction system using a cellular neural network and oxide semiconductor synapses has been developed and evaluated using logic simulations and actual experiment. Oxide semiconductor devices are used for the synapse elements, whose deteriorating characteristic can be utilized as strength plasticity of synaptic connection based on modified Hebbian learning. In this presentation, first, the structure and operation of the letter reproduction system is explained. Next, it is evaluated using logic simulation, where the dependence of the correction accuracy of the letter reproduction on the conductance variation of the oxide semiconductor synapses is analyzed. Finally, the real operation is confirmed using an actual experiment. This study is a sole solution to actually realize three dimensional structural Artificial intelligence
