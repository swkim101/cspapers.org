This paper proposes an attributed network growth model. Despite the knowledge that individuals use limited resources to form connections to similar others, we lack an understanding of how local and resource-constrained mechanisms explain the emergence of structural properties found in real-world networks. We make three contributions. First, we propose a simple and accurate model of attributed network growth that jointly explains the emergence of in-degree, local clustering, clustering-degree relationship and attribute mixing patterns. Second, we make use of biased random walks to develop a model that forms edges locally, without recourse to global information. Third, we account for multiple sociological phenomena: bounded rationality; structural constraints; triadic closure; attribute homophily; preferential attachment. Our experiments show that the proposed Attributed Random Walk (ARW) model accurately preserves network structure and attribute mixing patterns of real-world networks; it improves upon the performance of eight well-known models by a significant margin of 2.5-10 Ã— .
