Culture, amongst other individual and social factors, plays a crucial role in human-human interactions. If robots should become a part of our society, they should be able to act in culture-specific manners as well. In this paper, we showcase the implementation of a cultural dichotomy, namely individualism vs. collectivism, in a social robots' conversation. Presenting these conversations to human observers from Germany and Japan, we investigate whether the implemented differences are recognized as such, and whether stereotypical culture-specific behaviours that correspond to the observers' cultural background is preferred. Results suggest that the manipulations in behaviour had the intended effect, but are not reflected in personal preferences.
