Grid creates a service oriented marketplace where dynamic service level associations are setup among grid entities i.e. service providers (resources) and service consumers (application programs). Service level associations among grid entities depends upon many parameters such as performance, completion deadlines, reliability, trust and reputation of grid entities etc. In this paper a novel service level association between service provider and service consumer is proposed which depends upon trust and reputation component. Grid service is executed in a cooperative environment where a set of n resources is associated to the requesting application for execution. Resources in the set are included on the basis of their individual reputation and trust component. An overall reputation and trust component of the unit is computed from the reputation and trust of individual resources in the unit and which can be used for the allocation of application to the unit.
