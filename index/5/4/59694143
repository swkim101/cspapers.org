It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Second ACM International Workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental Evaluation and CHaracterization (WiNTECH '07), held in conjunction with ACM MobiCom 2007 conference in Montreal, QC, Canada. WiNTECH was created in response to the growing recognition in the mobile, wireless networking research community of the importance of experimental evaluation of wireless network protocols/applications using realistic testbeds, as well as the characterization of real-world aspects of wireless networking using traces from operational wireless networks. WiNTECH'07 follows the success of the previous year's WiNTECH'06, held in conjunction with MobiCom 2006. We hope this workshop will continue to be an annual forum focusing on research issues of interest to the experimental wireless networking community. 
 
We received a total of 19 regular paper submissions from around the world and 8 submissions for posters and demos. The program you are holding is the result of a rigorous review process involving the program chairs, technical program committee members, and external reviewers (names listed later in this proceeding). Each paper had at least 4 independent reviews from TPC members. Based on these reviews, we selected 11 regular papers, 3 posters and 3 demonstrations. The accepted papers cover a wide range of topics including considerations of the physical layer, hybrid wireless evaluation platforms, experimental studies, wireless testbeds and tools, spanning diverse types of wireless networks such as mesh and sensor networks. In addition, the workshop will feature a keynote speech by Eric Blossom, founder and maintainer of the GNU-Radio project. The talk is titled "GNU Radio as an experimental platform: Current capabilities and future directions".
