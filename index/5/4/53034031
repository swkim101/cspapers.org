Completing knowledge bases (KBs) with missing facts is of great importance, since most existing KBs are far from complete. To this end, many knowledge base completion (KBC) methods have been proposed. However, most existing methods embed each relation into a vector separately, while ignoring the correlations among different relations. Actually, in large-scale KBs, there always exist some relations that are semantically related, and we believe this can help to facilitate the knowledge sharing when learning the embedding of related relations simultaneously. Along this line, we propose a novel KBC model by Multi -Task E mbedding, named MultiE. In this model, semantically related relations are first clustered into the same group, and then learning the embedding of each relation can leverage the knowledge among different relations. Moreover, we propose a three-layer network to predict the missing values of incomplete knowledge triples. Finally, experiments on three popular benchmarks FB15k, FB15k-237 and WN18 are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiE against some state-of-the-art baseline competitors.
