For both historical and practical reasons, the Boolean satisfiability

problem (SAT) has become one of central importance in computer science.

One type of instances arises when the clauses are chosen uniformly

randomly \textendash{} random SAT. Here, a major problem, recently

solved for sufficiently large clause length, is the satisfiability

threshold conjecture. The value of this threshold is known exactly

only for clause length $2$, and there has been a lot of research

concerning its value for arbitrary fixed clause length.



In this paper, we endeavor to study the satisfiability threshold for random industrial SAT. There is as yet no generally accepted model of industrial SAT, and we confine ourselves to one of the more common features of industrial SAT: the set of variables consists of a number of disjoint communities,

and clauses tend to consist of variables from the same community. 



Our main result is that the threshold of random community-structured SAT tends

to be smaller than its counterpart for random SAT. Moreover, under

some conditions, this threshold even vanishes.
