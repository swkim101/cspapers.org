Nonconvex and nonsmooth problems have recently attracted considerable attention in machine learning. However, developing efficient methods for the nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems with certain performance guarantee remains a challenge. Proximal coordinate descent (PCD) has been widely used for solving optimization problems, but the knowledge of PCD methods in the nonconvex setting is very limited. On the other hand, the asynchronous proximal coordinate descent (APCD) recently have received much attention in order to solve large-scale problems. However, the accelerated variants of APCD algorithms are rarely studied. In this paper, we extend APCD method to the accelerated algorithm (AAPCD) for nonsmooth and nonconvex problems that satisfies the sufficient descent property, by comparing between the function values at proximal update and a linear extrapolated point using a delay-aware momentum value. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide stochastic and deterministic accelerated extension of APCD algorithms for general nonconvex and nonsmooth problems ensuring that for both bounded delays and unbounded delays every limit point is a critical point. By leveraging Kurdyka-≈Åojasiewicz property, we will show linear and sublinear convergence rates for the deterministic AAPCD with bounded delays. Numerical results demonstrate the practical efficiency of our algorithm in speed.
