Conservation of our planet’s natural resources is of the utmost importance and requires constant innovation. This project focuses on innovation for one aspect of conservation: the reduction of wildlife poaching. Park rangers patrol parks to decrease poaching by searching for poachers and animal snares left by poachers. Multiple strategies exist to aid in these patrols, including adversary behavior prediction and planning optimal ranger patrol strategies. These research efforts suffer from a key shortcoming: they fail to integrate real-time data, and rely on historical data collected during ranger patrols. With the recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, UAVs have become viable tools to aid in park ranger patrols. There is now an opportunity to augment the input for these strategies in real time. Detection is done on real-time data collected from UAVs. Detection will then be used to learn adversaries’ behaviors, or where poaching may occur in the future, in future work. This will then be used to plan where to fly in the long term, such as the next mission. Finally, planning where to fly next during the current flight will depend on the long term plan and the real-time detections in case a poacher is spotted. Through our collaboration with Air Shepherd, a program of the Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh Foundation, we have already begun deploying poacher detection prototypes in Africa and will be able to deploy further advances there in the future.
