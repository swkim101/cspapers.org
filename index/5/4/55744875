Value Based Requirements' Risk Management (VRRM) Process Model is first of its kind that provides a risk management process for requirements based upon the concept of value. VRRM is never been implemented in commercial environment. This case study aims to validate the VRRM Process Model by implementing it on two separate commercial projects. The first project was executed by a CMMI Level-2 company and other by the company having no standard practices. The implementation of VRRM on two different projects is done in order to validate its compliance with the CMMI and highlight the differences in its execution for both projects. The case study validates the claims possessed by the VRRM Process Model and highlights some problems faced by practitioners during its implementation. Its practicalities are presented in discrete manners to help generalize its use to treat the software requirements in value manners during the risk management process and outcomes are documented to provide a feedback that may be used for making necessary improvements in the process model.
