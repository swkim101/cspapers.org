Capturing a moving object with large momentum by a dual-arm robot is especially challenging because of the requirement of dual-arm coordinated motion planning for tracking the moving object, and the operational force control for contact and momentum transfer. In this paper, we present a dual-arm coordinated motion planning and compliance control method with a unique null-space projected relative Jacobian and relative operational force between the two arms. The proposed method is able to plan dual-arm capturing motion and control the capturing force without disturbing the tracking motion. We have also adopted a direct collocation trajectory optimization method to generate optimal trajectory to decrease the object's momentum with minimum effort. Simulation and experiment of dual-arm robots picking up a moving box on a mobile platform are carried out to verify the proposed method.
