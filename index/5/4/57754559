This work presents a method to increase the peak output speed of surface permanent magnet synchronous machine (SPMSM) motor drives with application in robotics using field weakening control. Contrary to most existing works, the strategy is stateless and operates using only a motor torque reference as input, making it suitable for robotics applications in which reference torque and speed are continuously and rapidly changing. Based on the system dynamics and constraints, we obtain four different operating modes. The strategy is extensively validated using three different experiments, which show an increase in peak velocity of up to 33%. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is effective in extending the dynamic performance and explosive motion capabilities of robots.
