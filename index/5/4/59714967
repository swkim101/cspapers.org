We describe the Degrees of Grounding model, which tracks the extent to which material has reached mutual belief in a dialogue, and conduct experiments in which the model is used to manage grounding behavior in spoken dialogues with a virtual human. We show that the model produces improvements in virtual human performance as measured by post-session questionnaires.
