This video is a demonstration of the work discussed in our full paper available in the MobiSys'15 proceedings. The video illustrates a sensing technology for fine-grained location classification in an urban environment, for enhancing pedestrian safety. Our system seeks to detect the transitions from sidewalk locations to in-street locations, to enable applications such as alerting texting pedestrians when they step into the street. Existing positioning technologies are not sufficiently precise to allow distinguishing a position on the sidewalk from a position in the street, as explored in our previous work. To this end, we use shoe-mounted inertial sensors for location classification based on surface gradient profile and step patterns. This approach is different from existing shoe sensing solutions that focus on dead reckoning and inertial navigation. The shoe sensors relay inertial sensor measurements to a smartphone, which extracts the step pattern and the inclination of the ground a pedestrian is walking on. This allows detecting transitions such as stepping over a curb or walking down sidewalk ramps that lead into the street. We carried out walking trials in metropolitan environments in United States (Manhattan) and Europe (Turin). The results from these experiments show that we can accurately determine transitions between sidewalk and street locations to identify pedestrian risk.
