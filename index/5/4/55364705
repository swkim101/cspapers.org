This paper attempts to explain some basic properties about Petri nets and their relation to directed graphs that can be formal or informal. The related works justifies the reasoning how and why Petri nets are obtained or supported using graphs. The main problem tackled is how graphs can be obtained from Petri nets. Possible solutions that use reduction methods to simplify the Petri net are presented. Different methods to extract graphs from the basic or fundamental Petri net classes are explained. Some examples are given and the findings are briefly discussed.
