Diagnostic Imaging System like X-Ray and CT are widely used in hospitals. And for the reason that health data of patients is stored and transferred digitally, security and privacy on diagnostic imaging systems are of great significance to both patients and hospitals. Although many works on diagnostic imaging system have been studied currently, it's hard to find a detailed analysis on current research progress or a thorough survey on the security controls that should be implemented on diagnostic imaging system. In this paper, we evaluate medical devices from different vendors by the model above. Finally, we conclude the evaluation and analysed the future research directions. The survey of results shows that most of diagnostic imaging systems are under risk and their information security should be further improved.
