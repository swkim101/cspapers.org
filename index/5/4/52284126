In this paper, a teleoperation control of a 7-DoF robot manipulator for Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), which guarantees a safety-enhanced compliant behavior in the null space, is described. The redundancy of the manipulator is exploited to provide a flexible workspace for nurses or other staff (assisting physicians, patient support). The issue with safety and accurate surgical task execution may arise in the presence of human-robot interaction. Based on the implemented impedance control of tele-operated MIS tasks, a safety enhanced constraint is applied on the compliant null space motion. At the same time, the control approach integrates an adaptive fuzzy compensator to guarantee the accuracy of the surgical tasks during the uncertain human-robot interaction. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified with virtual surgical tasks. The results showed that the compliant null space motion is constrained in a safe area, and also that the accuracy of tool tip is improved, providing a flexible and safe collaborative behavior in the null space for human-robot interaction during surgical tasks.
