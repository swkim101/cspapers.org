Human language constantly evolves due to the changing world and the need for easier forms of expression and communication. Our knowledge of language evolution is however still fragmentary despite significant interest of both researchers as well as wider public in the evolution of language. In this paper, we present an interactive framework that permits users study the evolution of words and concepts. The system we propose offers a rich online interface allowing arbitrary queries and complex analytics over large scale historical textual data, letting users investigate changes in meaning, context and word relationships across time.
