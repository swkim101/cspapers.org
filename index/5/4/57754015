This paper is a preliminary exploration of how to solve the dual-manipulator path-planning problem from an energy perspective. A virtual spring is set up between the two manipulator bodies and becomes compressed as they move into the area of danger, thus producing elastic potential energy. The initial paths of the manipulators are modelled as two ends-fixed elastic ropes. The elastic potential energy stored in the virtual spring is distributed between the two elastic ropes in a certain proportion so as to deform them. In this way, the original paths of the two manipulators will deviate toward the direction of their respective bases thereby avoiding any collision crisis that may potentially occur. When the dual-manipulator moves away from the danger area, the elastic potential energy caused by the deviation of the elastic ropes will be converted back into energy stored by the virtual spring, such that the elastic ropes revert to their original state and drive the manipulators back to their initial paths. Simple but representative simulations are established and results of the simulations show the reliability of our proposed method.
