The Information Technology Infrastructure Library V3 (ITIL V3) was published in June 2007. ITIL V3 is a lifecycle model about integrated IT-Service-Management (ITSM) processes, which documents best practice of IT services. It covers the process areas Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Transition, Service Operation and Continual Service Improvement. The extensive process descriptions within the lifecycle model intersect with process descriptions of the software development processes. IT organisations with software development units, as well as data processing centres, face the problem of adopting at least two different process models. This paper demonstrates the overlapping of software methodologies and ITIL V3 processes and makes a recommendation for the coexistence of both philosophies.
