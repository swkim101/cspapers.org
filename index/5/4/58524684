Safety analysis code system of beam transport and core for accelerator driven system (ADS) is developed for the analyses of beam transients such as the change of the shape and position of incident beam. The code system consists of the beam transport analysis part and the core analysis part. TRACE 3-D is employed in the beam transport analysis part, and the shape and incident position of beam at the target are calculated. In the core analysis part, the neutronics, thermo-hydraulics and cladding failure analyses are performed by the use of ADS dynamic calculation code ADSE on the basis of the external source database calculated by PHITS and the cross section database calculated by SRAC, and the programs of the cladding failure analysis for thermoelastic and creep.By the use of the code system, beam transient analyses are performed for the ADS proposed by Japan Atomic Energy Agency. As a result, the rapid increase of the cladding temperature happens and the plastic deformation is caused in several seconds. In addition, the cladding is evaluated to be failed by creep within a hundred seconds. These results have shown that the beam transients have caused a cladding failure.
