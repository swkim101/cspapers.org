With the rapid development of information technology and network infrastructure construction, the online learning system has been changed from traditional face-to-face classroom to speedy information technology. On the past decades, few of researchers have constructed specifically for the principals' attitudes toward online learning. The purpose of this study was to develop a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for the principals in elementary schools and junior high schools. The TAM on this study was framed by six subscales: perceived ease of use, perceived useful planing, perceived useful learning, perceived useful contents, attitudes toward using online learning, and behavioral intentions to manage via online learning. This study would also explore the relationship between online learning and the principals' leadership. At the same time, the study introduced perceived useful planing, perceived useful learning, and perceived useful contents as new factors that reflected the principals' intrinsic belief in online learning acceptance.
