This paper presents a novel method for the control of the elbow joint of the humanoid robot TEO, based on a fractional order PD controller. Due to the graphical nature of the proposed method, a few basic operations are enough to tune the controller, offering very competitive results compared to classic methods. The experiments show a robust performance of the system to mass changes at the tip of the humanoid right arm.
