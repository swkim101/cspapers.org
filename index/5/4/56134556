CHI’15 Workshop 05 ”Collaborating with Intelligent Machines: Interfaces for Creative Sound”, April 18, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Abstract To effectively utilize and collaborate with audio production tools, users (especially novices) must be able to communicate their ideas in the ways that work well for them. However, many artists’ preferred means of interaction are not well aligned with the interfaces of most audio production software. The resulting mismatch can disrupt the flow of ideas and inhibit creativity. A new approach to interface design is required.
