This paper examines the emerging relationship between the US and Japan with respect to Artificial Intelligence and the significant trend towards US-Japan cooperative Al research and development. This trend is underscored by the increasing investment by both nations to develop massive 5th generation computer technology. The importance of the US and Japan's relationship is amplified by these two nations being the world's largest high technology producers and trading partners. One must fully appreciate the future course of events as the two nations open up new markets, estimated at tens of billions of dollars in Al hardware, software and related services by the 1990's. Al has greater implications for collaboration versus ruthless competition, as in other markets, due to the uniqueness of opportunity Al offers the US and Japan for mutual growth. Al will offer unique ways for the US and Japan to grow closer with greater understanding of two otherwise extremely different social and economic systems. This does not diminish the importance of other countries growing closer through Al in this way, but rather demonstrates the greatest example of cooperation with the greatest total economic rewards.
