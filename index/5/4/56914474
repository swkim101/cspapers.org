Virtual Reality (VR) technologies provide novel modes of human computer interaction that can be used to support industrial design processes. The integration can be successful if supported by a method to qualify, select and design the VR technologies according to the company’s requirements in order to improve collaboration in extended enterprises and timesaving. The aim of the present work is the definition of a method to translate the company’s expectations into heuristic values that allow the benchmarking of VR systems. The method has been tested on a real test case.Copyright © 2007 by ASME
