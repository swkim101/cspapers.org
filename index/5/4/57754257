In this paper, we propose a novel method for selective management of muscle fatigue in human-robot co-manipulation. The proposed framework enables the detection of excessive fatigue levels of an individual muscle group while executing a certain task, and provides anticipatory robotic responses to distribute the effort among less-fatigued muscles of human arm. Our approach uses a machine learning technique to enable online predictions of muscle forces in different arm configurations and endpoint interaction forces. The estimated muscle forces are then used for the model-based estimation of muscle fatigue levels. Through optimisation, the fatigue management system can alter the task execution in a way that specific fatigued muscles are offloaded, while at the same time enables the production of task force using muscles with lower levels of fatigue. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it can operate online, and that all the measurements are performed by the robot sensory system, which can significantly increase the applicability in real-world scenarios. To validate the proposed method, we performed proof-of-concept experiments where the task of the human operator was to use a tool to polish an object that was manipulated by the robot.
