Previously, we presented the concept of a novel haptic display device that could generate lateral localized displacement on a human fingertip. This device is characterized by a bundle of haptic pins whose ends gently make contact with a human fingertip. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic model of interaction between haptic pins and finger for investigation of mechanical response of stress or strain on human fingertip under operation of the proposed haptic device. We also conducted preliminary experiment to determine the possible setups that maximizes the sense of partial slippage. The results presented in this paper may help assess human slip perception for the development of haptic display devices.
