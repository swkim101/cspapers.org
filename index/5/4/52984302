Karaoke is a system for low-latency metadata-private communication. Karaoke provides di ff erential privacy guarantees, and scales better with the number of users than prior such systems (Vuvuzela and Stadium). Karaoke achieves high performance by addressing two challenges faced by prior systems. The first is that di ff erential privacy requires continuously adding noise messages, which leads to high overheads. Karaoke avoids this using optimistic indistinguishability : in the common case, Karaoke reveals no information to the adversary, and Karaoke clients can detect precisely when information may be revealed (thus requiring less noise). The second challenge lies in generating su ffi cient noise in a distributed system where some nodes may be malicious. Prior work either required each server to generate enough noise on its own, or used expensive verifiable shu ffl es to prevent any message loss. Karaoke achieves high performance using e ffi cient noise verification , generating noise across many servers and using Bloom filters to e ffi ciently check if any noise messages have been discarded. These techniques allow our prototype of Karaoke to achieve a latency of 6.8 seconds for 2M users. Overall, Karaoke’s latency is 5 × to 10 × better than Vuvuzela and Stadium.
