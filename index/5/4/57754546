Prefabrication of structures is currently used in a limited capacity, due to the lack of flexibility, despite the potential cost and speed advantages. Autonomous flexible reassembly enables structures to be developed which can be continuously and iteratively dis-assembled and re-assembled providing far more flexibility in comparison to single shot pre-fabrication methods. Dis-assembly of structures should be considered when assembling, due to the asymmetry of assembly and dis-assembly processes, to ensure structures can be recycled and re-assembled. This allows for agile development, significantly reducing the time and resource usage during the build process. In this work, a framework for flexible re-assembly is developed and a robotic platform is developed to implement and test this framework with simple Lego bricks. The tradeoffs in terms of time, resource use and probability of success of this new assembly method can be understood by using a cost function to compare to alternative fabrication methods.
