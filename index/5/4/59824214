In October 1958, John McCarthy published one in a series of reports about his then ongoing effort designing a new programming language that would be especially suited for achieving artificial intelligence. That report was the first one to use the name LISP for this new programming language. 50 years later, Lisp is still in use. In October 2008, we celebrated Lisp's 50th birthday. OOPSLA 2008 was an excellent venue for such a celebration, because object-oriented programming benefitted heavily from Lisp ideas and because OOPSLA 2008 took place exactly 50 years after the name Lisp was used publicly for the first time. We had talks by influential Lispers from the past five decades and an interview with John McCarthy himself. We also took a look at the next 50 years of Lisp. This publication contains a collection of extended abstracts of the talks presented at Lisp50.
