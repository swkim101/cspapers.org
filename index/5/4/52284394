Reinforcement learning (RL) allows robots to solve control tasks through interaction with their environment. In this paper we study a model-based value-function RL approach, which is suitable for computationally limited robots and light embedded systems. We develop a diving agent, which uses the RL algorithm for underwater depth stabilization. Simulations and experiments with the micro diving agent demonstrate its ability to learn the depth stabilization task.
