3D radiation source localization is a common task across applications such as decommissioning, disaster response, and security, but traditional count-based sensors struggle to efficiently disambiguate between symmetries in sensor, source, and environment configurations. Recent works have demonstrated successful passive source localization using a bearing sensor called the Compton gamma camera that can image radiation. This paper first presents an approach to mapping the spatial distribution of radiation with a gamma camera to estimate source locations. An active source localization framework is then developed that greedily selects new waypoints that maximize the Fisher Information provided by the camera's range and bearing observations for source localization. Finally the common assumption of a static step size in between waypoints is relaxed to allow step sizes to adapt online to the observed information. The proposed radiation mapping approach is evaluated in 5×4 m2 and 14×6 m2 laboratory environments, where multiple point sources were localized to within an average of 0.26 m or 0.6% of the environment dimensions. The active source localization approach is evaluated in simulation and an adaptive step size yields a 27% decrease in the localization time and a 16% decrease in the distance traveled to localize a source in a 15×15×15 m3 environment.
