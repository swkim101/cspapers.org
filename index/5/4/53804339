Welcome to the proceedings of the 2nd Research in the Large Workshop at UbiComp 2011! 
 
With the proliferation of app stores and the advancement of mobile devices, research that might have only been tested with a dozen participants in the past can now be released to millions. This offers huge opportunities, but also requires adaptations of existing methods in dealing with large deployments and making sense of large data sets. This workshop provides a forum for researchers to exchange experiences and strategies for wide distribution of applications as well as gathering and analyzing large-scale data sets. 
 
This workshop features eight contributions from developers and researchers from both industry and academia with experiences deploying mobile apps on a larger scale and dealing with large data sets. The workshop provides an overview of experiences and challenges in 'research in the large,' while also generating insight in new questions that present themselves when it comes to doing research in this dynamic landscape of app stores, markets, new devices and services. The contributions also share experiences, practical strategies, tips and tricks in dealing with large deployments and big data -- as well as taking advantage of the lessons learned by other researchers in such large-scale studies.
