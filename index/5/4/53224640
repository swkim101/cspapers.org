We study fundamental comparison problems on strings of characters, equipped with the usual lexicographical order~g. For each problem studied, we give a parallel algorithm that is optimal with respect to at least one criterion for which no optimal algorithm was previously known. Specifically, our main results are: ● Two sorted sequences of strings, cent aining altogether n characters, can be merged in O(log n) time using O(n) operations on an EREW PRAM. This is optimal as regards both the runnin g time and the number of operations. ● A sequence of strings, cent -g altogether n characters represent ed by integers of size polynomial in n, can be sorted in O(log n/log log n) time using O(n log log n) operations on a CRCW PRAM. The rurmin g time is opt imal for any polynomial number of processors. ● The minimum string in a sequence of strings containing altogether n characters can be found using (expected) O(n) operations in (expected) time ranging from O(1) on a randomized CRC W PRAM to O(log n log log n) on a deterministic EREW PRAM.
