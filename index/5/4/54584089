Mm-wave radars have an important role to play in field robotics for applications that require reliable perception in challenging environmental conditions. This paper presents an experimental characterisation of the Delphi Electronically Scanning Radar (ESR) for mobile robotics applications. The performance of the sensor is evaluated in terms of detection ability and accuracy, for varying factors including: sensor temperature, time, target’s position, speed, shape and material. We also evaluate the sensor’s target separability performance.
