Many fields of application could benefit from an accurate registration of measurements of different modalities over a known 3D model. However, aligning a 2D image to a 3D model is a challenging task and is even more complex when the two have a different modality. Most of the 2D/3D registration methods are based on either geometric or dense visual features. Both have their own advantages and their own drawbacks. We propose, in this paper, to mutually exploit the advantages of one feature type to reduce the drawbacks of the other one. For this, an hybrid registration framework has been designed to mutually align geometrical and dense visual features in order to obtain an accurate final 2D/3D alignment. We evaluate and compare the proposed registration method on real data acquired by a robot equipped with several visual sensors. The results highlights the robustness of the method and its ability to produce wide convergence domain and a high registration accuracy.
