Software maintenance is the key issue in today's world. Lot of time and money is spent on making changes to existing versions of the software. Software maintenance engineers are forced to take up the extreme task of understanding large and complex software, which were not developed by them. Poor documentation can make understandability more complex and a mind-breaking task. Hence tools that can aid the software engineers to easily understand a given code is the need of the hour. The development of such a system that eases the understandability of software through visualizations forms a major part of this work.
