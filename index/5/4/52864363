Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology is the key issue to realizing high capacity networking infrastructure in meeting the growing traffic and for the next generation optical internet. We addressed an efficient algorithm, known as semilight path (virtual wavelength path) algorithm has been developed which has been applied to several representative networks (ARPA 24 node network, NSFNET) for their performance evaluation with and without wavelength conversion. The same algorithm has been extended to study the WDM network ensuring full guaranteed restoration against single link failure with and without wavelength conversion to determine the required network resources to guarantee full or differentiated reliability.
