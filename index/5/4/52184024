This poster presents a customizable round-tripping UML class diagram plug-in for Eclipse called Green. While this tool was developed primarily with students and instructors in introductory OO computer science courses in mind, its extensible architecture makes it potentially useful to others.Green is a flexible tool: each binary class relationship is implemented as a separate plug-in to the basic tool. The set of relationships supported is therefore easily tailored to the needs of the user. More importantly, the semantics of the relationships can be defined to suit the user. The tool can therefore adapt to the needs of its users.
