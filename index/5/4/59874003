We propose a software architecture (SA) for data centric, interoperable and context aware applications in healthcare, based on ontologies. An instance of such SA has been implemented through a hospital intelligent ward ontology using web semantic tools. The final result is an ontological database, which act as a backbone for running heterogeneous software applications across hospital pervasive computing environments.
