Shadow detection is an important and challenging problem in computer vision. Recently, single image shadow detection had achieved major progress with the development of deep convolutional networks. However, existing methods are still vulnerable to background clutters, and often fail to capture the global context of an input image. These global contextual and semantic cues are essential for accurately localizing the shadow regions. Moreover, rich spatial details are required to segment shadow regions with precise shape. To this end, this paper presents a novel model characterized by a deeply supervised parallel fusion (DSPF) network and a densely cascaded learning scheme. The DSPF network achieves a comprehensive fusion of global semantic cues and local spatial details by multiple stacked parallel fusion branches, which are learned in a deeply supervised manner. Moreover, the densely cascaded learning scheme is employed to refine the spatial details. Our method is evaluated on two widely used shadow detection benchmarks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts by a large margin.
