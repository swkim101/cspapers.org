This work presents an aerial tool towards the autonomous cooperative coverage and inspection of a large scale 3D infrastructure using multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In the presented approach the UAVs are relying only on their onboard computer and sensory system, deployed for inspection of the 3D structure. In this application each agent covers a different part of the scene autonomously, while avoiding collisions. The autonomous navigation of each platform on the designed path is enabled by the localization system that fuses Ultra Wideband with inertial measurements through an Error- State Kalman Filter. The visual information collected from the aerial team is collaboratively processed to create the 3D model. The performance of the overall setup has been experimentally evaluated in realistic wind turbine inspection experiments, providing dense 3D reconstruction of the inspected structures.
