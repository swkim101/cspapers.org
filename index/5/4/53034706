Scholars' homepages are important places to show personal research interest and academic achievement through the Web. However, according to our observation, only a small portion of scholars update their publications and related events on their homepages in time. In this paper, we propose a homepage augmentation technique, which automatically shows the newest academic events related to a scholar on his/her homepage. Specifically, we model the relations between homepages and the events collected from the Web as a complex heterogenous network, and propose an Embedding-based Heterogenous random Walk algorithm, namely EHWalk, to predict the links between homepages and events. Compared with existing embedding-based link prediction algorithms, EHWalk supports more efficient modeling of complex heterogenous relations in a dynamically changing network, which helps link the massive new updated events to homepages precisely and efficiently. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset are conducted and the results show that our algorithm can achieve both good effectiveness and efficiency for real-world deployment.
