The range skyline query retrieves the dynamic skyline for every individual query point in a range by generalizing the point-based dynamic skyline query. Its wide-ranging applications enable users to submit their preferences within an interval of 'ideally sought' values across every dimension, instead of being limited to submit their preference in relation to a single sought value. This paper considers the query as a hyper-rectangle iso-oriented towards the axes of the multi-dimensional space and proposes: (i) main-memory algorithmic strategies, which are simple to implement and (ii) secondary-memory pruning mechanisms for processing range skyline queries efficiently. The proposed approach is progressive and I/O optimal. A performance evaluation of the proposed technique demonstrates its robustness and practicability.
