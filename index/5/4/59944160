We study the set disjointness problem in the most powerful bounded-error model: the number-on-the-forehead model with k parties and arbitrary classical or quantum communication. We obtain a communication lower bound of Omega(âˆš(n)/2k*k) bits, which is essentially optimal. Proving it was a longstanding open problem even in restricted settings, such as one-way classical protocols with k=4 parties (Wigderson 1997). The proof contributes a novel technique for lower bounds on multiparty communication, based on directional derivatives of communication protocols over the reals.
