Activity recognition is central to many motion analysis applications ranging from health assessment to gaming. However, the need for obtaining sufficiently large amounts of labeled data has limited the development of personalized activity recognition models. Semi-supervised learning has traditionally been a promising approach in many application domains to alleviate reliance on large amounts of labeled data by learning the label information from a small set of seed labels. Nonetheless, existing approaches perform poorly in highly dynamic settings, such as wearable systems, because some algorithms rely on predefined hyper-parameters or distribution models that needs to be tuned for each user or context. To address these challenges, we introduce LabelForest 1, a novel non-parametric semi-supervised learning framework for activity recognition. LabelForest has two algorithms at its core: (1) a spanning forest algorithm for sample selection and label inference; and (2) a silhouette-based filtering method to finalize label augmentation for machine learning model training. Our thorough analysis on three human activity datasets demonstrate that LabelForest achieves a labeling accuracy of 90.1% in presence of a skewed label distribution in the seed data. Compared to self-training and other sequential learning algorithms, LabelForest achieves up to 56.9% and 175.3% improvement in the accuracy on balanced and unbalanced seed data, respectively.
