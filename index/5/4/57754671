The use of robots, as a social stimulus, provides several advantages over using another animal. In particular, for rat-robot studies, robots can produce social behaviour that is reproducible across trials. In the current work, we outline a framework for rat-robot interaction studies, that consists of a novel rat-sized robot (PiRat), models of robotic behavior, and a position tracking system for both robot and rat. We present the design of the framework, including constraints on autonomy, latency, and control. We pilot tested our framework by individually running the robot rat with eight different rats, first through a habituation stage, and then with PiRat performing two different types of behaviour - avoiding and frequently approaching. We evaluate the performance of the framework on latency and autonomy, and on the ability to influence the behaviour of individual rats. We find that the framework performs well on its constraints, engages some of the rats (according to the number of meetings), and features a control scheme that produces reproducible behaviour in rats. These features represent a first demonstration of a closed-loop rat-robot framework.
