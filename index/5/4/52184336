We describe (and demonstrate) the execution model of a computing platform where computation is both incremental and data-driven. We call such an approach delta-driven. The platform is intended as a delivery vehicle for semantically integrated software, and thus lends itself to the semantic web, domain-driven development, and next-generation software development environments. Execution is transparent, versioned, and persistent. This technology - still at an early stage - is called domain/object.
