Recently, the Two-Dimensional Principal Component Analysis (2DPCA) model is proposed and proved to be an efficient approach for face recognition. In this paper, we will investigate the incremental 2DPCA and develop a new constructive method for incrementally adding observation to the existing eigen-space model. An explicit formula for incremental learning is derived. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we performed some typical experiments and show that we can only keep the eigen-space of previous images and discard the raw images in the face recognition process. Furthermore, this proposed incremental approach is faster when compared to the batch method (2DPCD) and the recognition rate and reconstruction accuracy are as good as those obtained by the batch method.
