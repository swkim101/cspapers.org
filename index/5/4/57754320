This paper presents the positioning, navigation and awareness (PNA) system developed for the Underwater Robotic Mining System of the !VAMOS! project [1]. It describes the main components of the !VAMOS! system, the PNA sensors in each of those components, the global architecture of the PNA system, and its main subsystems: Position and Navigation, Realtime Mine Modeling, 3D Virtual reality HMI and Real-time grade system. General results and lessons learn during the first mining field trial in Lee Moor, Devon, UK during the months of September and October 2017 are presented.
