A hot water boiler having a dual combustion chamber arrangement capable of burning either solid or fluid fuels, and arranged for acting directly on a heat transfer system generally in direct contact with firebox walls of the combustion chamber arrangement. Disposed atop the combustion chamber arrangement is a heat conserving flue assembly which absorbs heat from smoke and flue gases exhausted from the combustion chamber arrangement and heats a fluid medium which in turn is circulated to the heat transfer means for eventual release for circulation or storage as desired in a residence or other building structure. The heat transfer system includes a fluid containing cavity divided into two parts by a suitable membrane, with pipes being provided penetrating the membrane for permitting transfer of the fluid medium from one part of the cavity to the other, with the heat transfer fluid medium thus being initially heated in the flue assembly, transferred to a first, or uppermost, part of the cavity of the heat transfer system, and subsequently transferred to the lower part of the heat transfer system and discharged entirely from the boiler structure.
