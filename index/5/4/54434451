Identifying adversarial examples is beneficial for understanding deep networks and developing robust models. However, existing attacking methods for image object detection have two limitations: weak transferability---the generated adversarial examples often have a low success rate to attack other kinds of detection methods, and high computation cost---they need much time to deal with video data, where many frames need polluting. To address these issues, we present a generative method to obtain adversarial images and videos, thereby significantly reducing the processing time. To enhance transferability, we manipulate the feature maps extracted by a feature network, which usually constitutes the basis of object detectors. Our method is based on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, where we combine a high-level class loss and a low-level feature loss to jointly train the adversarial example generator. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC and ImageNet VID datasets show that our method efficiently generates image and video adversarial examples, and more importantly, these adversarial examples have better transferability, therefore being able to simultaneously attack two kinds of Â representative object detection models: proposal based models like Faster-RCNN and regression based models like SSD.
