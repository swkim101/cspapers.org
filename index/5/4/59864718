These proceedings contain the papers chosen for publication and presentation at the 14th International Symposium on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, ACM-GIS'06. The conference is held in Arlington, Virginia, on November 10-11, 2006.The goal of this annual symposium is to provide a forum for discussion to researchers, developers and advanced users of geospatial information technology, and to allow interdisciplinary discussions between them.The call for papers led to 125 submissions of abstracts, in turn resulting in 99 full papers submitted. These papers were reviewed by a program committee with 45 members from the spatial data research community, each paper in principle receiving three reviews, or four in case a PC member was amongst the authors. Out of the 99 papers, 31 full papers were accepted.These figures plus the range of topics addressed by the submitted papers proves, we believe, the continued health of the research domain of geographic information systems and technology, and the need to bring its researchers together.
