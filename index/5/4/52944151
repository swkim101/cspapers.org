The Power of Proximity fashion tech collection creates a network between garments to show what users have in common with each other. The collection uses a mesh network to link the garments where pre-processed data taken from social media is stored locally on a micro-controller. Once the garments are connected to the same network they exchange data and an algorithm determines the commonalities between the users. Infrared signalling is used to tell if the wearers are facing each other and when that happens an array of LEDs then displays the level of commonalities. The level changes if the users spend time together. The two garments are knitted from merino wool and cashmere and designed so that the electronics are seamlessly embedded into them to create a soft interface around the body.
