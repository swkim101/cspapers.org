The graduation project is a cornerstone of the academic life, and professional career, of many students, and so whatever time is invested in such a project is truly worthwhile. Furthermore, students' extending themselves beyond their limitations in this endeavor is essential to enhancing the concepts they learned in previous courses. However, managing these projects poses real challenges for them, their supervisors, and the members of the graduation project committee. The purpose of this paper is to improve the ability of all these parties to manage the projects through the use of software that will allow students to organize their tasks and deadlines with minimum effort, enable supervisors to easily keep track of students and their progress, and ultimately permit graduation project committee members to monitor all transactions taking place to ensure that all is well
