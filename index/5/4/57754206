It's a hot summer in 2021 and the blistering sun is shining upon Madrid. You are enjoying some tinto de verano on your terraza. Sizzling in the scorching heat, you are trying to relax. With a simple gesture you call your robotic assistant to help you cool down a little bit. Without further ado, your robot provides some relaxing shade holding a parasol for you, picks up a fan autonomously and starts waving it and the gentle breeze brings you some light relief.
