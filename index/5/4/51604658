Readitopics provides a new tool for browsing a textual corpus that showcases several recent work on topic labeling and topic coherence. We demonstrate the potential of these techniques to get a deeper understanding of the topics that structure different datasets. This tool is provided as a Web demo but it can be installed to experiment with your own dataset. It can be further extended to deal with more advanced topic modeling techniques.
