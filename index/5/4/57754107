For unmanned rescue, observation, and/or research, vehicles with high terrain adaptability, high speed, and highreliability are needed to reach hard-to-reach-locations. In order toextend the areas that can be explored, we propose a method and a robot capableof running on the surface of water without having to bypass the puddles andstreams that exist on uneven terrain. The method that enables the robot to runon the water surface is bio-inspired by the basilisk lizard that can walk on thesurface of water. We developed a blade-type crawler robot with a simple andreliable mechanism, capable of traversing uneven terrain at high speed. Therobot with the method was tested on a real water surface and the resultconfirmed the ability of the robot to run on the water surface.
