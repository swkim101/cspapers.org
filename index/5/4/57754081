This study presents principle of the camber-flat wing structure conversion mechanism, which is inspired by a dragonfly, and its applicability to MAV. The camber-flat wing structure convert mechanism makes MAV flight using asymmetric flapping pattern through control of angle of attack without complicate structure. This mechanism was inspired from the dragonfly's feature that the camber structure of the wing increases the rigidity of wing structure and makes dragonfly has asymmetric flapping pattern. Experimental results show that MAV has asymmetric flapping pattern that can more stable flight performance when hovering flight with a camber structure and superior performance when the forward flight with a flat structure. The average lift force in the camber wing structure was 0.02N, the average thrust force was 0.02N and the average lift force was 0.011N in the flat wing structure at 20 Hz flapping frequency.
