Bridging interaction design and engineering is problematic because design and engineering have different epistemology. With the advent of ubiquitous digital devises the design space has increased which has made it more difficult to rely on sketches of known interaction idioms to convey the design's experiential qualities to stakeholders and engineers. The digital arts rely on programming and appropriation to craft technology that explores artistic problems and to be used in exhibitions and performances. To this end, the digital arts have succeeded in both creating and making, where the community of interaction design and software engineering struggle. With starting point in code as a design material, how can the digital arts facilitate and artisanal approach to the creation of highly interactive digital artefacts with rich experience qualities?
