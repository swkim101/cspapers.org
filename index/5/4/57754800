Emerging robot-assisted endovascular intervention has the potential to reduce X-ray radiations to the operator while enhancing the stability and dexterity of catheter manipulation. Supervised and shared autonomy of endovascular procedures could add further improvements in reduced fatigue and cognitive workloads of the operator, higher success rates of cannulation and improved surgical outcomes. However, robotic path planning for endovascular procedure is challenging due to complex and non-linear flow dynamics inside the vasculature. This paper presents a learning-based robotic catheterization platform addressing those challenges, this approach incorporates path integral reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on dynamic movement primitives (DMP) to enhance catheterization tasks by a customized robotic manipulator. The robotic trajectories were optimized through RL in order to avoid unwanted contacts between the catheter tip and the vessel wall. The proposed methods can adapt to different flow simulations, vascular models, and catheterization tasks. The quality of the catheterization was evaluated with performance metrics. The results show significant refinement of catheter paths by the proposed approach, resulting in shorter overall lengths and fewer contact forces, which can potentially reduce risks in endothelial wall damages, embolization, and stroke. The results support the development of robotic path planning for endovascular procedures as well as designing intelligent, hands-on robotic navigation platforms.
