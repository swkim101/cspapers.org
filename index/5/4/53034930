Aligning users across multiple heterogeneous social networks is a fundamental issue in many data mining applications. Methods that incorporate user attributes and network structure have received much attention. However, most of them suffer from error propagation or the noise from diverse neighbors in the network. To effectively model the influence from neighbors, we propose a graph neural network to directly represent the ego networks of two users to be aligned into an embedding, based on which we predict the alignment label. Three major mechanisms in the model are designed to unitedly represent different attributes, distinguish different neighbors and capture the structure information of the ego networks respectively. Systematically, we evaluate the proposed model on a number of academia and social networking datasets with collected alignment labels. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art comparison methods (+3.12-30.57% in terms of F1 score).
