Model-based user interface development environment promotes the use of complementary declarative models to provide a systematic approach to the description of user interface and its functionality. This paper presents an overview of XSDFE (XML Schema-Driven Form Environment) system providing tools for development of user interfaces based on XML Schema models. The XSDFE system is composed of two subsystems. The Designer subsystem provides functionality for the development of the user interface forms based on the XML Schema models. The Run-time Environment subsystem originating on generic form paradigm supports the execution of user interface forms in run-time.
