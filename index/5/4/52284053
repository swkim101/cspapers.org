Detecting and tracking people is a key requirement in the development of robotic technologies intended to operate in human environments. In crowded environments such as train stations this task is particularly challenging due the high numbers of targets and frequent occlusions. In this paper we present a framework for detecting and tracking humans in such crowded environments in terms of 2D pose ($x,\ y,\ \theta$). The main contributions are a method for extracting pose from the most visible parts of the body in a crowd, the head and shoulders, and a tracker which leverages social constraints regarding peoples orientation, movement and proximity to one another, to improve robustness in this challenging environment. The framework is evaluated on two datasets: one captured in a lab environment with ground truth obtained using a motion capture system, and the other captured in a busy inner city train station. Pose errors are reported against the ground truth and the tracking results are then compared with a state-of-the-art person tracking framework.
