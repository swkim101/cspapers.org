This prototype system demonstrates a novel sentence alignment method for bilingual texts based on adaptive learning and lexical information. The system aligns bilingual text at the paragraph level first and acquires length related statistics for the subsequent sentence alignment process. In addition to lengths, a probabilistic translation lexicon is utilized to further enhance the precision. The system is especially effective in the case of noisy translations produced in either translation direction that may involve different domains.
