Consistency of relevance judgments is a vital issue for the construction of test collections in information retrieval. As human relevance assessments are costly, and large collections can contain many documents of varying relevance, collecting reliable judgments is a critical component to building reusable test collections. We explore the impact of document presentation order on human relevance assessments. Our primary goal is to determine if assessor disagreement can be minimized through the order in which documents are presented to assessors. To achieve this goal, we compare two commonly used presentation orderings with a new ordering designed to aid assessors to more easily discriminate between relevant and non-relevant documents. By carefully controlling the presentation ordering, assessors can more quickly converge on a consistent notion of relevance during the assessment exercise, leading to higher overall judging agreement. In addition, important interactions between presentation ordering and topic difficulty on assessor agreement are highlighted. Our findings suggest that document presentation order does indeed have a substantial impact on assessor agreement , and that our new ordering is more robust than previous approaches across a variety of different topic types.
