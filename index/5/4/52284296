This paper presents a minimally invasive ultrasonic bone cutting tool designed for the da Vinci® research kit (dVRK). An ultrasonic transducer is modelled using finite element software, and correlated with testing results using an impedance analyzer. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is then used to design and analyze the remaining components of the ultrasonic system, in order to maximize system performance. The system is fabricated and mounted to the da Vinci ® research kit system and tested on a cutting phantom.
