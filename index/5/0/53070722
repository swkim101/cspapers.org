Using an Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to autonomously deploy soil sensors enables their installation in otherwise hard to access locations. In this paper, we present a system that integrates a UAS and a digging mechanism which can carry, secure, and install a small sensor into dirt effectively and efficiently. The integrated system includes 1) a low profile, light-weight, inexpensive auger mechanism, 2) a sensor carrying and deploying mechanism with low power consumption, and 3) sensors and software that control and evaluate the auger performance during digging. When tested on a suite of target soils and a target depth of 120mm, the system achieved a success rate of 100% for indoor tests and 92.5% for outdoors, verifying the potential of the approach.
