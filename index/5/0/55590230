--This paper, which focuses on teachers’ perspectives on their reflections about their teaching, discusses teachers’ understanding of reflection as it relates to the context of teacher standards in Indonesia. The research uses a qualitative interpretive approach in which the teachers were the subjects. Classroom observations and interviews were the major data. These experienced teachers did not recognize reflective teaching practices, although they are stated in teacher standards and that teachers are expected to be aware of them. The teachers’ use of reflection was mostly limited to their reflection of students’ work in lessons, not on their teaching practice. Nine dimensions of reflective teaching practice were used as a tool to analyze the teachers’ responses about reflective practice and a typology of reflection categorized these teachers into three types: descriptive, comparative and critical teachers. Only one teacher conducted reflections and was considered a critical reflective teacher. This study has implications for dissemination to teachers in other regions in the future.
