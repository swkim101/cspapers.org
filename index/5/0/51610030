Network embedding has attracted a surge of attention in recent years. It is to learn the low-dimensional representation for nodes in a network, which benefits downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Most of the existing approaches learn node representations only based on the topological structure, yet nodes are often associated with rich attributes in many real-world applications. Thus, it is important and necessary to learn node representations based on both the topological structure and node attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel deep attributed network embedding approach, which can capture the high non-linearity and preserve various proximities in both topological structure and node attributes. At the same time, a novel strategy is proposed to guarantee the learned node representation can encode the consistent and complementary information from the topological structure and node attributes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets have verified the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
