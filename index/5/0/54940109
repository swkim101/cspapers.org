In this paper, a novel perception of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) system called Particle Distribution Algorithm (PDA) is proposed to solve Reactive power problem. In that swarm individual particles are moved away, but discreetly characterize each particle by a field or by distribution & its behaviour absolutely dissimilar from the family of old PSO scheme. The projected PDA has been tested in standard IEEE 30 bus test system and simulation results show clearly the better performance of the proposed algorithm in reducing the real power loss.
