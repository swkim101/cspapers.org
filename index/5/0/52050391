TLS APIs are often complex, leading to developer mistakes. In addition, even with well-written applications, security administrators lack control over how TLS is used on their machines and donâ€™t have the ability to ensure applications follow best practices.

This is both simple for developers to use and allows system administrators to set device policy for TLS. In this article, we both explain and demonstrate how the Secure Socket API works.
