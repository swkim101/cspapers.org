Visual blends are an advanced graphic design technique to draw users' attention to a message. They blend together two objects in a way that is novel and useful in conveying a message symbolically. This demo presents an interactive pipeline for creating visual blends that follows the iterative design process. Our pipeline decomposes the process into both computational techniques and human microtasks. It allows users to collaboratively generate visual blends with steps involving brainstorming, synthesis, and iteration. Our demo allows individual users to see how existing visual blends were made, edit or improve existing visual blends, and create new visual blends.
