Welcome to the 2012 Workshop on Hardware and Architectural Support for Security and Privacy, HASP 2012, in conjunction with MICRO 45. This is the first workshop of HASP. It is intended to bring together researchers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry, to share practical implementations/experiences related to hardware/architectural support for security and privacy, and to discuss future trends in research and applications. The 1st HASP workshop, held 2 December 2012, is organized by University of Houston, University of Princeton, and many volunteers across the world. The workshop covers micro architectural and/or system support for security and privacy protection in the context of embedded systems, sensor networks, mobile devices, and cloud computing. We have received submissions from 14 countries. Due to schedule limitation, we cannot accommodate all the papers that could be accepted. Some of them are certainly of the quality to be accepted by other workshops or conferences with similar scope of interest. Each manuscript was reviewed by at least three reviewers. We are very thankful to the program committee members and reviewers who dedicated their precious time to review the papers. The final workshop program consists of 8 carefully selected papers, with the highest average rankings. These papers address state of the art research problems in physical attacks, site-channel exploits, crypto processor design, security verification and support for identity management in mobile and ubiquitous computing.
