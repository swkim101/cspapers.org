Testing is a typical activity that requires improvements for increasing the productivity of software development. Many test improvement models such as the Testability Maturity Model(TMM) and the Test Process Improvement(TPI) have been proposed. Though these models have been successfully applied to industries, we found these models are not appropriate for applying to our company because they do not consider the issues forced out from embedded software development. This paper introduces our test improvement framework including identified considerations of our company. Our proposed framework reflects characteristics of embedded software testing and unique development process of our product development units. And, this paper also describes the case study which applied the proposed framework to test process of our product development units. From the assessment result, we could identify test activities which have high priority for having high test efficiency. Moreover, we could set up a foundation for improving test process continuously in our organization.
