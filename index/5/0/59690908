Welcome to the first edition of the Workshop on Mobile Opportunistic Networking, MobiOpp 2007. The workshop is co-located with ACM MobiSys 2007 and is sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE. 
 
Opportunistic networking is one of the most exciting evolutions of the Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET) paradigm, in which the assumption of complete paths between data senders and receivers is released. Opportunistic networks enable users' communication in disconnected environments, in which islands of connected devices appear, disappear, and reconfigure dynamically. Opportunistic networks thus encompass the scope of delay or disruption tolerant networks (DTN), and are very suitable to accommodate the pervasive networking view, in which a huge number of devices carried by users and embedded in the environment communicate wirelessly without requiring any pre-existing infrastructure. 
 
The response to the Call for Papers shows that MobiOpp has been particularly well received by researchers working in the field of opportunistic Networks. Specifically, we received thirty-five submissions, addressing topics related to all fields of opportunistic networks. Out of them, the Program Committee selected ten regular papers for presentation in the workshop sessions. In addition, four papers have been selected as short contributions, and will be presented in the Work-in-Progress session. These figures and the quality of the received papers, show that MobiOpp is already seen as a premiere forum for presenting and discussing ideas and results in all the fields of opportunistic networking. 
 
The MobiOpp program also includes a Keynote Speech by Prof. Gaetano Borriello of the University of Washington, and a panel.
