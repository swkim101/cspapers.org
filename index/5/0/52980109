In this paper, a new protocol for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has been proposed, which randomly switches the signal for information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH). However, the information decoder recovers the complete data by utilizing the sparse behaviour of the real world signal, thus not compromising the system performance, unlike the conventional SWIPT protocols such as time switching and power splitting.
