Despite its introduced superiority in pattern recognition, the conventional neural network is yet to cope with the model uncertainty. To tackle this issue, Bayesian neural network, which allows the predictions to equip with model uncertainty, is succinctly reviewed. However, the misspecification of the model prior can lead the posterior to be of no avail. For this, contrast with the conventional informative priors, e.g., Normal and Laplace priors, the suggestion of employing weakly informative priors in Bayesian neural network is put forward for their tolerance of prior misspecification. For empirical datasets with available semantic annotations, the consideration of hierarchical weakly informative priors is further introduced in order to boost the discriminability of the model. A conducted evaluation experiment revealed the effectiveness of hierarchical weakly informative priors over other priors in a hand-written digit classification task.
