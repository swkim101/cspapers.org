We propose a new technique for generating a differential XSL stylesheet from arbitrarily two XML documents. The Document Object Model (DOM) is adopted to express the data structure of XML documents. We propose several algorithms to detect difference information between the two DOM trees. The difference information, which consists of its difference type, position and content, is generated for each differential node by using proposed algorithms. We use the XSL Stylesheet as the format of expressing difference information, and we also propose the way to create XSL Stylesheet from the difference information.
