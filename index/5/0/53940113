The paper proposes some agent-based approach to support the management of spare parts using e-environment. In this approach, we show how to describe an extended enterprise using an organisation model and how to manage the shared resources of the different sites by defining an interaction model. Indeed, an internal architecture of each site based on Multi-Agent System (MAS) foresees a dedicated cognitive agent, whose role is to watch, and even to warn, the cases of under-storage and on-storage of the articles. This operation is done on the basis of the previous consumption. The global architecture ensures the emergence of a balancing of articles availability, capable to avoid situations of going beyond of threshold of storage.
