T his paper was published in 1995 and so it seems early to do a retrospective; in fact, research in simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is still ongoing. The original project began in early 1994. We were beginning to see commercial microprocessors that could issue many instructions per cycle (wide superscalars), but which rarely did so due to dependencies and long memory latencies. In fact, processor utilization seemed to be declining as fast as instruction issue width was increasing.
