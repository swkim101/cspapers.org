In this demo, we present a Social Sensing Edge Computing (SSEC) system that supports real-time task allocation on non-cooperative and heterogeneous edge devices. We evaluate the system on two real-time social sensing applications and demonstrate the energy savings as well as the Quality of Service (QoS) of the SSEC system. The demonstrated framework complements the traditional centralized social sensing solutions by providing a more scalable and responsive computation paradigm.
