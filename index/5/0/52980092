We tend to set ourselves up to thrive in a particular state while ignoring the transitions between states. But there is magic in the transitions; they are where unexpected and interesting things happen. There is an opportunity for our user interfaces to better support the transitions we make. In this talk I will share some of what I have learned from years of productivity research about how to successfully transition between tasks over the course of a day, and reflect on how these findings might be extended to help us understand how we, as academics and practitioners, can successfully transition through the various contexts and roles that we hold in a lifetime.
