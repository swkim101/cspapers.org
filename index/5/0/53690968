Recommending suitable tags for online textual content is a key building block for better content organization and consumption. In this paper, we identify three pillars that impact the accuracy of tag recommendation: (1) sequential text modeling meaning that the intrinsic sequential ordering as well as different areas of text might have an important implication on the corresponding tag(s) , (2) tag correlation meaning that the tags for a certain piece of textual content are often semantically correlated with each other, and (3) content-tag overlapping meaning that the vocabularies of content and tags are overlapped. However, none of the existing methods consider all these three aspects, leading to a suboptimal tag recommendation. In this paper, we propose an integral model to encode all the three aspects in a coherent encoder-decoder framework. In particular, (1) the encoder models the semantics of the textual content via Recurrent Neural Networks with the attention mechanism, (2) the decoder tackles the tag correlation with a prediction path, and (3) a shared embedding layer and an indicator function across encoder-decoder address the content-tag overlapping. Experimental results on three realworld datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.
