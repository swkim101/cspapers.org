The First Workshop on Measurement, Privacy, and Mobility (MPM'12) will gather researchers to discuss novel ideas about measurement, privacy, and mobility. The ever increasing need for our personal data, location, preferences and interests has raised the bar for regulations and techniques to catch up with the privacy and security aspects of such information. In this workshop we aim to discuss systems, methods, policies and techniques that help in profiling, data mining, offering location based services, while making an attempt in improving privacy preservation. 
 
We aim to solicit research papers, work in progress papers and reports from a variety of disciplines, including but not limited to data mining, security, privacy, advertising, epidemics and information dissemination, mobility and location-based data services across academia and industry in order to create a dynamic inter-disciplinary workshop environment.
