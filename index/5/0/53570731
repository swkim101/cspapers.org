Conﬂuo is an end-host stack that can be integrated with existing network management tools to enable monitoring and diagnosis of network-wide events using telemetry data distributed across end-hosts, even for high-speed networks. Conﬂuo achieves these properties using a new data structure — Atomic MultiLog— that supports highly-concurrent read-write operations by exploiting two properties speciﬁc to telemetry data: (1) once processed by the stack, the data is neither updated nor deleted; and (2) each ﬁeld in the data has a ﬁxed pre-deﬁned size. Our evaluation results show that, for packet sizes 128B or larger, Conﬂuo executes thousands of triggers and tens of ﬁlters at line rate (for 10Gbps links) using a single core.
