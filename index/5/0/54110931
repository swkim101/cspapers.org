The ingredients are simple: Chestnut our, olive oil, sugar, raisins and pinenuts. The original receipe does not appear in Artusi's classical cooking book, but it does appear in the very enjoyable and nostalgic book by E. Servi{Machlin SM81]. Incidentally, she is the sister of the Italian logician M. Servi who did some work on the model theory of categories with nite products Ser71]. As it is diicult to nd chestnut our outside of Tuscany, let me give a modiied version of the dish. Take one can of canned, unsweetend chestnut pur ee. Add a third of the can of olive oil and half the can of sugar and mix in a food processor to a homogeneous paste. Add a third of the can of regular our and keep mixing till smooth. Spread the paste on a at cooking sheet, not more than a small nger thick. It is advisable to rub the sheet with margarine or olive oil before spreading the paste. Now stick the pinenuts and raisins into the paste at your liking. Bake medium hot for about 40 minutes (till the paste hardens) but be careful not to burn it. Let cool and break into pieces. Best served with cooee (expresso) and Grappa (di Brunello).
