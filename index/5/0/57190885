In this paper, we study an energy efficient cluster-based multi-hop routing (ECMR) protocol to prolong the network lifetime and improve the data transmission efficiency in wireless sensor networks. The residual energy and transmit power of each cluster head are used to determine the weight factor for Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path in ECMR protocol. Simulations are performed based on OMNeT++ to show that the ECMR protocol outperforms a low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol in terms of energy consumption, network longevity and data transmission efficiency in large scale network size.
