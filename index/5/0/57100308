Because of the complexity of the software development, some software developers may plagiarize source code that comes from other projects or open source software in order to shorten development cycle. Usually the copyist would modify and disguise the source code copied to escape plagiarism detection. So far, most algorithms cant completely detect the source disguised by the copyist, especially cant exactly distinguish between the source code and the plagiaristic code. In this paper, we summarize and analyze the effect of disguised source to the detection process, design the strategy to remove the effect of disguised source, and propose a PDG-based software source code plagiarism detection algorithm. The algorithm can detect the existence of disguised source, so as to find out source code plagiarism. And we propose a heuristic rule to make the detection algorithm have the ability to give the plagiarism direction. Any existing algorithm does not have this function. We prove the availability of the algorithm by experiment.
