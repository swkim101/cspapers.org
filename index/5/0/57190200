We propose an independently biased technique for improving both efficiency and linearity of a cascode GaN HEMT power amplifier at 2.1 GHz. The designed power amplifier achieves power gain of 16.5 dB, output power of 32 dBm at power added efficiency of 66 % for single-tone operation. For two-tone operation with a spacing of 4 MHz, the designed amplifier can achieve a power added efficiency of 35.8 % and a power gain of 19.7 dB at a third order intermodulation distortion of âˆ’35 dBc. These achieved performance makes the designed amplifier to be able to effectively apply to various promising wireless communications applications like Long-Time Evolution (LTE) mobile network or radar and WiFi.
