The creation of wakes, with unique turbulence characteristics, downstream of turbines significantly increases the complexity of the boundary layer flow within a wind farm. In conventional wind farm design, analytical wake models are generally used to compute the wake-induced power losses, wi th different wake models yielding significantly different estimates. In this context, the wake behavior, and subsequently the far m power generation, can be expressed as functions of a series o key factors. A quantitative understanding of the relative i mpact of each of these factors is paramount to the development of more reliable power generation models; such an understandi ng is however missing in the current state of the art in wind farm design. In this paper, we quantitatively explore how the far m
