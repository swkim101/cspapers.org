We introduce an algorithm for autonomous control of multiple fast ground vehicles operating in close proximity to each other. The algorithm is based on a combination of the game theoretic notion of iterated best response, and an information theoretic model predictive control algorithm designed for non-linear stochastic systems. We test the algorithm on two one-fifth scale AutoRally platforms traveling at speeds upwards of 8 meters per second, while maintaining a following distance of under two meters from bumper-to-bumper.
