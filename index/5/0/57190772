In this paper, we study the trade-off between security and reliability for multi-hop cognitive mobile-to-mobile (M2M) networks. In the proposed scheme, a secondary source sends its data to a secondary destination with assistance of multiple secondary relays in presence of a secondary eavesdropper. The secondary transmitters operate on an underlay spectrum access mode where their transmit power must satisfy interference constraints required by primary users. We derive exact closed-form expressions of the end-to-end outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) for the secondary network over double Rayleigh fading channels. Then, simulations are presented to verify the derived expressions as well as to show the trade-off between OP and IP, and the impact of hardware imperfection, the number of hops and the number of primary users on the performance metrics.
