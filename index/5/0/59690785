This paper describes HLA Compliant Network Enabled Distributed Modeling and Simulation Infrastructure Design, which can be used for simulating large, complex distributed networks. HLA is an IEEE standard 1516 for distributed modeling and simulation, whereas Omnet is a tool, which is used to simulate networks (network could be LAN, WAN, or ad hoc network). An HLA layer is wrapped on top of OMNET to make it HLA federate. As an HLA federate Omnet can now communicate with other federates through RTI. RTI acts as an operating system for HLA based simulations. This infrastructure is similar to C4I (Command, Control, Communication and Computer Intelligence) systems. This infrastructure would help to simulate satellite communication, tracking system and Battle Field simulations. Integrating Omnet tool with HLA provide us flexibility and interoperability for simulations.
