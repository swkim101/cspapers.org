In this paper, we propose novel methods suitable for online real time whole body master-slave control with real life-sized humanoid robot. We conducted some dynamic whole body master-slave experiment with life-sized humanoid robot, and we achieved speedier and flexible master-slave operation compared to conventional study. Conventionally, master-slave operations with humanoid robots were available with only the upper body of the humanoid robot, and the COM movement was limited to be static. In our previous study, we introduced LIP model based restrictions to ensure the balance stability. In this study, we extend the safety restrictions by introducing foot landing delay prediction and trajectory smoothing method suitable for real robot. We conducted master-slave tennis swing experiment and high kick motion experiment with life-sized humanoid robot “JAXON”, and we evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed methods and system.
