A catalyst, a process of preparing the catalyst and a method of making polymers and copolymers of 1-olefins with the catalyst in which the catalyst is prepared by producing finely divided particles of chromium metal by a sublimation process and dispersing the sublimate of chromium particles with an organic liquid and providing a mixture comprising the chromium sublimate particles and a support such as silica. The mixture is then heat activated in an oxidizing atmosphere. In another aspect of the invention the chromium sublimate particles and support particles are further modified by having a titanium compound as a part of the mixture of chromium sublimate particles and support particles.
