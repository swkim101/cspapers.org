Recently in-band full-duplex (IBFD) communications, which simultaneously transmit and receive signals on the same frequency band, has been aggressively studied for enhancing the spectral efficiency of wireless networks. The IBFD communications need to properly manage self-interference, which does not appear in traditional half-duplex (HD) communications, and this issue is one of the critical challenges for achieving the efficient IBFD communication systems. The increase in transmission power at user terminals (UEs) improves the quality of the received signal at base stations (BSs), whereas it also increases the self-interference at UEs and then largely impacts the throughput in the bidirectional IBFD (BIBFD) communications. This paper investigates the effect of the UE transmission power to the throughput for the BIBFD communications in cellular networks and then proposes UE transmission power control to improve the system throughput for the BIBFD cellular networks.
