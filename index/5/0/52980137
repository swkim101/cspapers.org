Motivated by applications like Information Centric Networking for the Internet of Things, we study caching policies for the setting where the data being cached is heterogeneous in nature. This heterogeneity is in two aspects, namely, the lifetime of the data and the size of the data. We propose a caching policy which divides the cache into sub-caches, such that each sub-cache is reserved for data of a specific size and lifetime. Via analytical results and simulations, we show that our policy outperforms existing caching policies for heterogeneous data.
