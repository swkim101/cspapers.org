Recent advances in LTE operating in unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U) has grabbed a lot of attention from industry and academia. The duty cycled LTE-U is shown to be fair with Wi-Fi technology by following an ON-OFF cycle for its transmission. However, the effect of LTE-U on the video quality of Wi-Fi users has not been studied in the literature. In this work, we study the video quality performance of a Wi-Fi user in the presence of LTE-U, in a testbed system. Our results show that the parameters that contribute to the video QoE (Quality of Experience) of Wi-Fi users get adversely affected as the fraction of channel utilized by LTE-U increases, but the same is not shown to be true with another Wi-Fi. We found that poor video QoE of Wi-Fi users in the presence of LTE-U is because of a large number of packet collisions and less channel access time due to ON cycle of LTE-U.
