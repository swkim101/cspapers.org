We present PowerBlade, the smallest and lowest power AC plug-load meter that measures real, reactive and apparent power, and reports this data, along with cumulative energy consumption, over an industry-standard Bluetooth Low Energy radio. Achieving this design point requires revisiting every aspect of conventional power meters: a new method of acquiring voltage; a non-invasive, planar method of current measurement; an efficient and accurate method of computing power from the voltage and current channels; a radio interface that leverages nearby smart phones to display data and report it to the cloud; and a retro power supply reimagined with vastly lower current draw, allowing extreme miniaturization. PowerBlade occupies a mere 1" by 1" footprint, offers a 1/16" profile, draws 176 mW continuously, offers 1.13% error on unity power factor loads in the 2-1800 W range and slightly worse for non-linear and reactive loads, and costs $11 in modest quantities of about 1000 units. This new design point enables affordable large-scale studies of plug-load energy usage -- an area of growing national importance.
