This paper describes nonprehensile manipulation realized using the vibration of a plate. A novel manipulation strategy is proposed wherein the three degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of a part are controlled by only one actuator. First, a manipulator driven by a single actuator is introduced. The end effector of this manipulator is a flat plate. The manipulator employs an active-passive hybrid joint mechanism with nonparallel axes. Based on the sinusoidal displacement input to the actuator, the manipulator can generate the velocity of a part omnidirectionally on the plate. Next, simulation results are presented to show that the velocity map of the part varies depending upon the surface friction property of the plate. Further, the control of the rotational behavior of the part on the boundary of two areas with different friction properties by means of the input frequency is shown. Based on this control, a 3- DoF manipulation strategy using a virtual turntable is developed to realize the desired position and orientation of the part. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated via experiments.
