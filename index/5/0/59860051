Based on a logic-oriented mechanism for planning, a language framework, called PLANLOG, is developed, which enables the combination of two styles of programming; what is clearly logical can be written in PLANLOG in a logical way; what is procedural by nature can be expressed in form of plans. Starting with a detailed exposition of our motives, we will subsequently present the basic principles of PLANLOG and discuss the role of plan generation and plan execution. Finally, our vision of PLANLOG is summarized.
