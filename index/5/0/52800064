Stochastic neighbor embedding (SNE) and related nonlinear manifold learning algorithms achieve high-quality low-dimensional representations of similarity data, but are notoriously slow to train. We propose a generic formulation of embedding algorithms that includes SNE and other existing algorithms, and study their relation with spectral methods and graph Laplacians. This allows us to define several partial-Hessian optimization strategies, characterize their global and local convergence, and evaluate them empirically. We achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup over existing training methods with a strategy (which we call the spectral direction) that adds nearly no overhead to the gradient and yet is simple, scalable and applicable to several existing and future embedding algorithms.
