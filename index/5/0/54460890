We propose Scene Graph Auto-Encoder (SGAE) that incorporates the language inductive bias into the encoder-decoder image captioning framework for more human-like captions. Intuitively, we humans use the inductive bias to compose collocations and contextual inference in discourse. For example, when we see the relation ``person on bike'', it is natural to replace ``on'' with ``ride'' and infer ``person riding bike on a road'' even the ``road'' is not evident. Therefore, exploiting such bias as a language prior is expected to help the conventional encoder-decoder models less likely to overfit to the dataset bias and focus on reasoning. Specifically, we use the scene graph --- a directed graph (G) where an object node is connected by adjective nodes and relationship nodes --- to represent the complex structural layout of both image (I) and sentence (S). In the textual domain, we use SGAE to learn a dictionary (D) that helps to reconstruct sentences in the S -> G -> D -> S pipeline, where D encodes the desired language prior; in the vision-language domain, we use the shared D to guide the encoder-decoder in the I -> G -> D -> S pipeline. Thanks to the scene graph representation and shared dictionary, the inductive bias is transferred across domains in principle. We validate the effectiveness of SGAE on the challenging MS-COCO image captioning benchmark, \eg, our SGAE-based single-model achieves a new state-of-the-art 127.8 CIDEr-D on the Karpathy split, and a competitive 125.5 CIDEr-D (c40) on the official server even compared to other ensemble models.
