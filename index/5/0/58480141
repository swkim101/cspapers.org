It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 1st ACM Workshop on Data-intensive Software Management and Minings -- DSMM'09. This year's workshop will be a forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of managing and mining large-scale software repositories, including multi-version source code, bug reports, and development history, in order to support software design, development, and maintenance processes. The program consists of papers that cover a variety of topics, including next generation access control models, engineering and analysis techniques for access control policies and models, and security administration. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech by Brendan Murphy. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers in various fields, including software engineering, databases, and data mining.
