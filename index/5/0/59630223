A scanning apparatus for cross-sectional inspection equipment comprising a rotatable disc supporting an X-ray source and a detector. The rotation of this disc is quickly braked as a coil spring provided on a speed accelerating and reducing means is compressed. The start of rotation of this disc rapidly gains the required rotation speed by the recovering force of the same compressed coil spring. A cable extending from various devices including the X-ray source and the detector provided on the rotatable disc is releasably wound around a hollow drum provided on this disc. The rotation force produced in the rotatable disc by this cable is off-set by a rotation force applied in an opposite direction to this disc.
