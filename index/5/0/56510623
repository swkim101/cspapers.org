A new model based nonlinear iterative learning controller to replicate multiple reference trajectory is presented. The approach consists of a constrained Gauss-Newton numerical optimization algorithm, which is able to inverse a nonlinear system accurately. It uses the moving horizon idea from MPC to improve the computational efficiency. Combined with a class of nonlinear state-space model and an existing nonlinear iterative learning control scheme, this allows accurate tracking control of a nonlinear system. Numerical results are used to illustrate the algorithm.
