The European Robotic Goal-Oriented Autonomous Controller ERGO (http://www.h2020-ergo.eu/) is one of the six space robotic projects in the frame of the PERASPERA SRC (http://www.h2020-peraspera.eu/). Its goal is to provide an Autonomy Framework capable of operating at different levels of autonomy, from tele-operations to full on-board autonomy. Even though it has been originally conceived for space robotics, its domain independent design facilitates its application to any terrestrial robotic system. This paper presents the approach followed, current status and future steps.
