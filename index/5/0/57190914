In this paper, we present a design proposal for compact photonic wavelength filtering device based on nanoplasmonic metal-insulator-metal structure. The results have been accurately studied by using the temporal coupled-mode theory. Numerical simulation method eigenmode expansion propagation simulation has been also used for the overall design process. Simulation results show that the transmission efficiency of the drop filter can be significantly efficient by choosing specifically optimized lengths of rectangular reflection cavities. The proposed structure has an strongly potential for the design of highly efficient ultra-compact integration circuits and as well as optical communication systems.
