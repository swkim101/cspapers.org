Mobile ad-hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile nodes which forms a temporary network without any fixed infrastructure or centralized administration. Mobile ad-hoc networks are widely used in the tactical battlefield, emergency search and rescue missions. They are also well used in civilian ad-hoc situations like conferences and classrooms due to the ease and speed in setting up such networks. The wireless ad-hoc networks are mostly vulnerable to security attacks because of its features like open medium, dynamic topology, lack of centralized management, node mobility, limited physical security, and limited bandwidth. In this paper we simulate black hole attack on Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol. Further the performance of routing protocol AODV is evaluated under these attacks by considering different metrics and scenarios. We have used network simulator 2 (ns-2) to conduct simulations on MANET. Simulation results indicate that the AODV routing protocol suffers from decreased throughput and increased packet losses in presence of black hole attack. (6 pages)
