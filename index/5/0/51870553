This is a theoretical study on the sample complexity of dictionary learning with general type of reconstruction losses. The goal is to estimate a m × d matrix D of unit-norm columns when the only available information is a set of training samples. Points x in R m are subsequently approximated by the linear combination Da after solving the problem min a ∈ R d Φ( x − Da ) + g ( a ) with function g being either an indicator function or a sparsity promoting regularizer. Here is considered the case where
