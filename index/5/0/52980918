This demonstration corresponds to our previous paper, which deals with our finding that a proprioceptive force sensation can be presented by electrical stimulation from the skin surface to the tendon region (Tendon Electrical Stimulation: TES). We showed that TES can elicit a force sensation, and adjusting the current parameters can control the amount of the sensation. Unlike electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), which can also present force sensation by stimulating motor nerves to contract muscles, TES is thought to present a proprioceptive force sensation by stimulating receptors or sensory nerves responsible for recognizing the magnitude of the muscle contraction existing inside the tendon. In the demo, we offer the occasion for trying TES.
