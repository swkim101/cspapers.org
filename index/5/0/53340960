This paper introduces an improved line tracker using IMU and vision data for visual servoing tasks. We utilize an Image Jacobian which describes motion of a line feature to corresponding camera movements. These camera motions are estimated using an IMU. We demonstrate impacts of the proposed method in challenging environments: maximum angular rate ~160 0/s, acceleration ~6m /s2 and in cluttered outdoor scenes. Simulation and quantitative tracking performance comparison with the Visual Servoing Platform (ViSP) are also presented.
