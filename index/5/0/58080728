Virtualization helps developer optimizing potential of their resource. Physical hardware can be represented as software programs in multi-purpose computer. SID is known as framework providing hardware virtualization based on components. Virtual Development Environment for Embedded Software (VDEES) wrapped it inside Eclipse Platform, providing GUI for managing component interactions and creation of custom components. Using VDEES, developers will be helped to write software on top of new virtual components without waiting for the physical components hardware being implemented. It cuts the time, cost and risk to the lowest. Furthermore, VDEES is open source, that way we can enhance and modify as needed.
