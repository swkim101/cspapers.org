Sleep breathing disorder is a serious threat to a large share of the population. This paper presents a low-cost, tiny sensor system based on Volatile Organic Component (VOC) sensing for the detection of sleep apnea/hypopnea. We present two designs, discuss wearability aspects and show that the sensor works similar to gold standard Polysomnography (PSG).
