We propose a method to build thesauri on the basis of grammatical relations The proposed method constructs thesaun by using a hierarchical clustering algorithm An important point in this paper is the claim that thesauri in order to be efficient need to take (surface) case information into account We refer to the thesauri as 'relation-based thesaurus (RBT)' In the experiment four RBTs of Japanese nouns were constructed from 26,023 verb-noun cooccurrences, and each RBT was evaluated fry objective criteria The experiment has shown that the RBTs have better properties for selectional restriction of case frames than conventional ones.
