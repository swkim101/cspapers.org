Accuracy of robots is an important facet in an industrial setting. In this paper, we present a novel kinematic calibration methodology. Traditional calibration techniques require an external metrology device. Unlike those, the presented product here is highly practical in that it does not require a metrology device. The kinematic calibration model is formulated by making use of the robot itself as a metrology device to measure the geometry of a known artifact. The optimal parameters/characteristics of the model are identified using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. Our experimental results show that this new approach provides results comparable to those generated using spatial information provided by a Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM). Using this new approach (GageCAL), the Yaskawa Motoman “MHS-Hi” robot is calibrated. Our experimental testing also indicates that this methodology can be extended to a wide variety of anthropomorphic robots.
