Delivery services are an industry sector that may benefit extremely by the availability of mobile devices and connectivity. Today the support and tight integration of mobile users into the company processes is finally possible using off-the-shelf components. This paper presents the concept and implementation of an application, which is targeted to the domain of delivery services. The complete process, starting from route planning through navigation to delivery confirmation can be supported. The concept of GeoFencing is used to automatically detect different states in the execution of the delivery process in order to trigger context adapted actions like navigation close to target points and delivery confirmation. The system is realized as a GPS-based windows mobile application using a conventional consumer PDA.
