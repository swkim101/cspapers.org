With the rapid development of blockchain technology, blockchain becomes a good platform for execution of smart contracts. However, since smart contracts still have a low performance of transaction processing on blockchain. It can't satisfy real-time requirements in some situations. This paper proposes a parallel smart contract model on blockchain which has a better performance in transaction processing. The challenges with the proposed approach are the implementation of the parallel mode and the solution of synchronization problem of the proposed model. This paper uses multi-thread technology to implement the proposed model where transactions are executed in parallel. Then we propose a transaction splitting algorithm to resolve the synchronization problem. Finally, experimental analysis proves that this parallel model exactly makes a remarkable development of performance in transaction processing.
