We describe the development of a system for recognizing dolphin whistles on the CHAT (cetacean hearing and telemetry) wearable underwater computer system. An Nvidia Jetson TK1 single board computer was installed in the existing chat systems to improve processing power and overall system power efficiency. The inclusion of a GPU allowed the system to recognize in real time dolphin whistles varied in both pitch and time by using a 192khz Fast Fourier Transform for spectral analysis, linear convolution filters for pattern extraction, and dynamic time warping for pattern recognition.
