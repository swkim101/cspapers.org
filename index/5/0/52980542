Presentation slides play an important role in online lecture videos. Slides convey the main points of the lecture visually, while the instructor's narration adds detailed verbal explanations to each item in the slide. We call the link between a slide item and the corresponding part of the narration a reference. In order to assess the feasibility of reference-based interaction techniques for watching videos, we introduce DynamicSlide, a video processing system that automatically extracts references from slide-based lecture videos and a video player. The system incorporates a set of reference-based techniques: emphasizing the current item in the slide that is being explained, enabling item-based navigation, and enabling item-based note-taking. Our pipeline correctly finds 79% of the references in a set of five videos with 141 references. Results from a user study suggest that DynamicSlide's features improve the learner's video browsing and navigation experience.
