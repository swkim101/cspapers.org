Cloud computing allows customers to scale their application to their needs. However, the problem of determining the amount of resources to be leased while still ensuring the quality of services and low cost is a big challenge. In this study, we focused on modeling the problem of auto-scaling virtual machines for multi-tier applications based on game theory. The strategy for auto-scaling resources is based on the Nash equilibrium and QoS parameter of the virtual machines. In the cloud computing environment, there is a need for scalability and high user responsiveness, so we design the algorithm - PSOVM to solve this problem based on PSO algorithm. Metaheuristic algorithms can find the near-optimal results in acceptable time.
