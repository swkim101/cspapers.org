Measurement plays a key role in network operation and management. An important but unaddressed practical requirement in high speed networks is supporting concurrent applications with diverse and potentially dynamic measurement objectives. We introduce *Flow, a switch accelerated telemetry system for efficient, concurrent, and dynamic measurement. The design insight is to carefully partition processing between switch ASICs and application software. In *Flow, the switch ASIC implements a pipeline that exports telemetry data in a flexible format that allows applications to efficiently compute many different statistics. Applications can operate concurrently and dynamically on identical streams without impacting each other. We implement *Flow as a line rate P4 program for a 3.2 Tb/s commodity switch and evaluate it with four example monitoring applications. The applications can operate concurrently and dynamically, while scaling to measure terabit rate traffic with a single commodity server.
