In order to design serious games, attention needs to be paid to the target users. One important application of serious games is the design of games for older adults with dementia. Interfaces and activities in games designed for this group of users should be conducted by considering both the cognitive and physical limitations of these people, which may be challenging. We overcome these challenges by using the advantages of new head mounted display virtual reality (HMD-VR) technology and the knowledge of experts. The results of a preliminary three-week exercise involving participants with dementia shows that our design approach has been successful in achieving an interesting environment and could engage participants in the game.
