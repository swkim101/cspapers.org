User interfaces have special characteristics that differentiate them from other software code. Software metrics suitable for suggesting the quality of other software need significant modification for user interface code. This paper introduces some structural metrics applicable to user interfaces and measurable by a test automation tool. These metrics try to measure the complexity of testing the user interface. Such metrics can be used to estimate required resources to test a certain application.
