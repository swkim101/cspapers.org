This year's Symposium is being hosted by the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill, the nation's first public university. Chapel Hill is a picturesque college town buzzing with cultural and artistic vitality, and is nicknamed the "Southern Part of Heaven," after the title of the 1950 book by William Meade Prince. Chapel Hill is at the western point of the Research Triangle, an area of about 1.5 million people, composed of Chapel Hill, the cities of Durham and Raleigh, and the Research Triangle Park. The area is home to many Fortune 100 firms and leading scientific and technology research facilities, and three universities: Duke University, NC State University, and UNC Chapel Hill. With its restaurants, clubs, bookstores, theaters, coffee houses, street musicians, parks, gardens, and historic homes, Chapel Hill looks forward to welcoming the symposium attendees and treating them to southern culture and hospitality.
