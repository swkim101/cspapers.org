These proceedings contain the papers presented during the Second International Workshop on Random Testing (RT 2007) held in conjunction with the International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2007) in November 2007. Testing is one of the most important techniques for validating and checking the correctness of software systems. It is, however, labour-intensive, slow, and highly reliant on the specialized skills of human testers, in themselves error prone. Its automation is therefore a topic of considerable practical importance; and among the possible techniques, random testing represents an effective means of doing so. Testing methods making use of randomness have been used in a variety of industrial applications, for many types of testing, from unit debug testing, to reliability and performance assessments of complete systems. They have shown to scale up better than most other testing methods. The sheer simplicity of random testing is also of theoretical interest, as an easily modelled baseline with which other testing techniques can be compared. For some years, there has been a revival in interest in this field of research, that motivated the organisation of the First International Workshop on Random Testing in June 2006. Given the success of that first event, it was decided to organise this second instance. We were delighted with the quality and the variety of the paper submissions we received for this workshop. We have papers that cover various innovative aspects of random testing and its applications, presenting both theoretical developments and practical results. We hope that you will enjoy reading these proceedings and encourage you to contribute to the development of this exciting and practically important topic.
