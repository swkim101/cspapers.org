As human gaze provides information on our cognitive states, actions, and intentions, gaze-based interaction has the potential to enable a fluent and natural human-robot collaboration. In this work, we focus on reliable gaze estimation in remote eye tracking based on calibration-free methods. Although these methods work well in controlled settings, they fail when illumination conditions change or other objects induce noise. We propose a novel, adaptive method based on a probabilistic model, which reliably detects glints from stereo images and evaluate our method using a data set that contains different challenges with regarding to light and reflections.
