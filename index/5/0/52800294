Oftentimes, I like to think that what my students learn stems right from my explanations and examples in lecture. But one night of office hours watching them work through an assignment reminds me that most of the learning happens at those key, difficult-yetinescapable points in the assignments. Lecture is left to play its supporting role of explanation and motivation, but in my heart, I suspect that lecture is theater compared to the learning that goes on when the students actually write the code.
