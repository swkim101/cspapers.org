A system for controlling ambient temperature having a valve that adjusts the amount of fluid flow is disclosed. The valve includes a chamber containing thermal-expansive material and a piston which moves outwardly from the chamber to retard fluid flow when the thermal-expansive material is heated. The valve further includes a heater for heating the thermal-expansive material and a thermistor disposed in close thermal-relationship with the heater. Because of this close thermal-relationship, the resistance of the thermistor quickly changes in response to temperature changes in the heater. Since the thermistor is part of an electrical circuit for energizing or de-energizing the heater, ambient temperature is controlled. The system also includes a safety switch for de-energizing the heater in the event an open-circuit appears across the thermistor and is further adapted to control ambient temperature whether the fluid flow consists of hot or cold water.
