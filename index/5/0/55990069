In the basis of empirical research, the viewpoint that is about the old theory of teaching contents and weak experiment teaching in China's universities is proposed. This leads to the phenomenon that the standard of information graduates is not suited to the development of software industry. The data of teaching satisfaction about the software engineering comes from questionnaires of 100 software professionals who have graduated from colleges for 3~5 years in Tianjin. The conclusion that software testing and experimental teaching should be strengthened in the proportion of teaching curriculum is got through the principal components analysis and quaternary graph. It points out a direction for the development of "Software engineering" curriculum. Key words-software engineering; education reform; empirical research
