Recent studies point to an increased focus on metrics / measuring in regard to open access repositories 
(OAR). Whereas historically the display of download figures for popular content was a way of 
promoting an OAR within its respective institution, more recently interest has shifted on how to better 
utilise OAR usage statistics for more formalised purposes. The authors examine the nature of the more 
commonly used web-based repository approaches, identify their major shortcomings, and describe 
recent initiatives to enhance functionality. They then discuss citation analysis and proposals to link this 
to web-based usage statistics, particularly in the context of high-level drivers focused on research quality 
and effectiveness. The paper concludes by outlining opportunities for institutions to engage with new 
metric models.
