Applications that provide location related services need to understand the environment in which humans live such that verbal references and human interaction are possible. We formulate this semantic labelling task as the problem of learning the semantic labels from the perceived 3D structure. In this contribution we propose a batch approach and a novel multi-view frame fusion technique to exploit multiple views for improving the semantic labelling results. The batch approach works offline and is the direct application of an existing single-view method to scene reconstructions with multiple views. The multi-view frame fusion works in an incremental fashion accumulating the single-view results, hence allowing the online multi-view semantic segmentation of single frames and the offline reconstruction of semantic maps. Our experiments show the superiority of the approaches based on our fusion scheme, which leads to a more accurate semantic labelling.
