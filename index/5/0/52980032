Mobile and wearable computing are increasingly pervasive as people carry and use personal devices in everyday life. Screen sizes of such devices are becoming larger and smaller to accommodate both intimate and practical uses. Some mobile device screens are becoming larger to accommodate new experiences (e.g., phablet, tablet, eReader), whereas screen sizes on wearable devices are becoming smaller to allow them to fit into more places (e.g., smartwatch, wrist-band and eye-wear). However, these trends are making it difficult to use such devices with only one hand due to their placement, limited thumb reach and the fat-finger problem. This is especially true as there are many occasions when a user's other hand is occupied (encumbered) or not available. This thesis work explores, creates and studies novel interaction techniques that enable effective single-hand usage on mobile and wearable devices, empowering users to achieve more with their smart devices when only one hand is available.
