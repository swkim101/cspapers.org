The paper purposes the removal of noise in digital gray scale images that often observed in scanned documents. Generally, Data i.e. picture, text can be contaminated by an additive noise during the process of scanning. This methodology prevents this type of noise known as Salt and Pepper noise (SP Noise) which causes white and black spots on the original image. We are designing a new algorithm for removal of these white and black spots after the knowledge of Median Filter, Adaptive Filter and the new proposed algorithm will definitely protect the image from noise and distortion. Firstly, Adaptive Histogram Equalization is done on the original image. Secondly apply Adaptive contrast Enhancement Technique on the resultant image. After Contrast Enhancement we apply filters Such as Homomorphic filtering. These filters are applied sequentially on distorted images for removing the image.
