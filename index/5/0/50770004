A proposed first step in replicating the computational methods used in the brain's neocortex is the development of a feedforward computing paradigm based on temporal relationships among inter-neuron voltage spikes. A "space-time" algebra captures the essential features of such a paradigm. The space-time algebra supports biologically plausible neural networks, as envisioned by theoretical neuroscientists. It also supports a generalization of previously proposed "race logic". A key feature of race logic is that it can be directly implemented with off-the-shelf CMOS digital circuits. This opens the possibility of designing brain-like neural networks in the neuroscience domain and implementing them directly in the CMOS digital circuit domain.
