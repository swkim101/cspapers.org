We propose a novel dual-polarized (DP) spatial modulation (SM) scheme whose performance is enhanced by constellation rotation based precoding. Specifically, the proposed approach provides robustness against Rayleigh/Rician effects and also spatial correlations among transmit antennas. In this technique which is based on phase-rotation of the transmitted symbols according to the active transmit antenna, the average power budget is preserved. The optimum phase rotation values are determined so as to minimize the asymptotic average bit-error rate (ABER). Both theoretical and simulation results indicate significant performance improvements compared to conventional unipolarized (UP) and DP-SM systems.
