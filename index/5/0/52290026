Continuous, easy-to-implement, accurate inference of intended joint angles is important for effectively controlling powered prosthetic devices that can improve the lives and capabilities of upper-limb amputees. Estimation of intended joint angles is difficult because conventional biosignals are not directly related to the intended angle motion. In previous work, we began to address this issue by confirming that both transra-dial amputees and intact subjects, the measured deformation of the muscle bulge on the skin surface change according to the intended wrist joint angle. This paper presents a continuous prosthesis wrist joint control method using this deformation signal. We here verify the effectiveness of the distribution of the muscle bulge for accurate and stable wrist joint angle control in real time. The wrist joint angles were calculated in real time from a muscle viscoelastic model using the previously determined algorithm. We compared the error between measured and estimated angles with a conventional method, the Voigt model, and the KelvinVoigt model. Experimental results obtained for three intact people over three trials of wrist movement tasks gave the accuracy and stability of $7.96\pm 6.16^{\circ}$ when using the Voigt model; this is a similar performance compared to related work using a surface electromyogram. A method for continuously controlling the wrist joint angle for a prosthesis using the distribution of the muscle bulge was thus successfully established.
