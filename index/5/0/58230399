We would like to welcome you to the 2nd ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Home Networks. The goal of HomeNets is to foster discussion on the design and architecture of the future home network. Home network research has started to get some attention recently, but there are still various unanswered questions that need to be addressed to provide a seamless networking experience to typical home users. We hope the attendees will view this workshop as an opportunity to discuss their opinions on the principal challenges of home networking, and the possible solutions. 
 
HomeNets 2011 received 26 submissions. Each paper was carefully reviewed by three members of the Technical Program Committee. The reviewing process led to the acceptance of 12 papers. The papers span many topics including home network management and diagnostics, performance of wireless networks, design concept of Internet access networks, and home network energy and content management. We would like to thank the Technical Program Committee for choosing this interesting set of papers for the workshop. We are also extremely grateful to Technicolor and FIGARO (the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme project no. 258378) for sponsoring the workshop. 
 
We look forward to fruitful discussions in the course of the workshop!
