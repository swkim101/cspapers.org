Automated verification is one of the most successful applications of automated reasoning in computer science. In automated verification one uses algorithmic techniques to establish the correctness of the design with respect to a given property. Automated verification is based on a small number of key algorithmic ideas, tying together graph theory, automata theory, and logic. In this self-contained talk I will describe how this "holy trinity" gave rise to automated-verification tools, and mention some applications to planning.
