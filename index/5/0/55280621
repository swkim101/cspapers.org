Function points have been widely used to measure the functional size and productivity of software by various approaches: structured or object-oriented software methods. But none of these methods have yet been fully automated. All of them still require the involvement of an expert in order to be used correctly. To address this need, this paper describes a new kind of UML-to-FP mapping in order to automatically measure the FP from the combination of class and sequence diagrams based on the IFPUG 4.3.1. The mapping process of UML-to-FP mapping consists of the two main steps: the first identifies the data function types; the second identifies the transaction function types.
