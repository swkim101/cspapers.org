With over 34 billion IoT devices to be installed by 2020, the Internet of Things (IoT) is fundamentally changing our lives. One of the greatest benefits of the IoT is the powerful automations achieved by applying rules to IoT devices. For instance, a rule named "Make me a cup of coffee when I wake up'' automatically turns on the coffee machine when the sensor in the bedroom detects motion in the morning. With large numbers of possible rules out there, a recommendation system is of great necessity to help users find rules they need. However, little effort has been made to design a model tailored for the IoT rule recommendation, which comes with lots of new challenges compared with traditional recommendation tasks. We not only need to re-define "users'' and "items'' in the recommendation task, but also have to consider a new type of entities, devices, and the extra information and constraints brought by them. To handle these challenges, we propose a novel efficient recommendation algorithm, which not only considers the implicit feedback of users on rules, but also takes user-rule-device interactions and the match between rule device requirements and user device possessions into account. In collaboration with Samsung, one of the leading companies in this field, we have designed an IoT rule recommendation framework and evaluated our algorithm on a real-life industry dataset. Experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.
