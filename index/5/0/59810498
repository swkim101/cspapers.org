Sequence alignment is an important problem in computational biology. We compare two different approaches to the problem of optimally aligning two or more character strings: bounded dynamic programming (BDP), and divide-and-conquer frontier search (DCFS). The approaches are compared in terms of time and space requirements in 2 through 5 dimensions with sequences of varying similarity and length. While BDP performs better in two and three dimensions, it consumes more time and memory than DCFS for higher-dimensional problems.
