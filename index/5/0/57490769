In industry software engineers rarely work in isolation. The majority of software engineers work in teams which vary in both size and multidisciplinary emphasis. Group projects can be used throughout an undergraduate course to simulate a working environment and provide students with the transferable skills which will be of value to future employers. Appropriate group working must evolve throughout the course with both increased complexity of technical requirements and also with the devolution of group responsibilities. This paper discusses the issues behind developing students' key transferable skills through the use of group project work and offers a model for software engineering group projects within the educational environment.
