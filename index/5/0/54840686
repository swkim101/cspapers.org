In many application domains such as automotive and aerospace, it is commonplace that only a subset of the application system is subject to strict requirements, as only few applications actually control or interact with critical components. These requirements often include real-time requirements that compel the applications to output the results of their computations within specified time frames. Such real-time applications are commonly categorized as safety-critical, missioncritical, and non-critical depending on the amplitude of the consequences in case of a failure of the application. Typically, a failure or malfunction of a safety-critical application may result in death or serious injury to people, loss or severe damage to equipment or environmental harm, whereas a failure of a mission-critical application may result in a failure of the entire system, but without damaging it nor its embedding environment, and a failure of a non-critical application has no severe consequences.
