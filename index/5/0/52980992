We present the first wireless physical analytics system for 3D printed objects using commonly available conductive plastic filaments. Our design can enable various data capture and wireless physical analytics capabilities for 3D printed objects, without the need for electronics. To achieve this goal, we make three key contributions: (1) demonstrate room scale backscatter communication and sensing using conductive plastic filaments, (2) introduce the first backscatter designs that detect a variety of bi-directional motions and support linear and rotational movements, and (3) enable data capture and storage for later retrieval when outside the range of the wireless coverage, using a ratchet and gear system. We validate our approach by wirelessly detecting the opening and closing of a pill bottle, capturing the joint angles of a 3D printed e-NABLE prosthetic hand, and an insulin pen that can store information to track its use outside the range of a wireless receiver.
