These proceedings contain the papers selected for presentation at the 10th ACM International Symposium on Geographic Information Systems (McLean, VA, USA, November 8-9, 2002). It is the 10th of a series of symposia/workshops that started in 1993 with the aim of bringing together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners carrying out research and development in novel systems based on geo-spatial data and knowledge, and fostering interdisciplinary discussions and research in all aspects of geographic information systems.These papers reflect current trends in the GIS research area. Topics such as spatio-temporal data handling, user interfaces and visualization, data clustering, and raster data handling, still are focuses of interest in the research community. More recent research topics, such as web-based GIS and location-based services (more precisely, novel algorithms and data models), receive a growing interest from both the geoscience and the computer science communities, as illustrated by the number of papers submitted and accepted in this forum. Many of these concepts are illustrated in applications described at the end of these proceedings.We received eighty-one submissions. Each of them was reviewed by at least three referees. The program committee, which was constituted of researchers and practitioners from many different fields within the geospatial arena, selected twenty-eight papers to be presented at the conference.
