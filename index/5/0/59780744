This volume contains the papers and abstracts presented at POPL'03, the Thirtieth Annual ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages. The POPL conference is a forum for presentation of research on the design, foundations, analysis, and implementation of programming languages and programming systems. This year's conference is in New Orleans, Louisiana.A total of 126 extended abstracts were received in response to a call for papers. SIGPLAN policy forbids submission from members of the program committee. Each submission was read by members of the program committee and short reviews were collected and discussed by the committee as a whole. The deliberation led to the selection of 24 papers. Each abstract was judged according to the originality, clarity, innovation, perceived importance, and appropriateness to the expected audience. Due to the format of the conference, many good papers were not selected.In addition to the contributed papers, the POPL'03 program features three invited talks. The invited speakers were selected by the committee to complement and enhance the program of contributed papers.Although submissions were read and evaluated, the papers that appear in this volume may differ in form and content from the submitted abstracts. The conference selection process does not constitute full review of the work. It is expected that many of the papers printed here will be revised and submitted to refereed archival journals for publication.
