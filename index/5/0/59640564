The efficient use of existing software for scientific computing in the context of the new software and hardware technologies, like Web services and multicore systems, imposes a redesign of their software architecture. We describe the path that was followed in the case of an expert system for ordinary differential equations including facilities for parallel computing. The approach can be easily applied to other tools used in scientific computing.
