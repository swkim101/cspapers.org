In this chapter we review various approaches for the convergence of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), identifying strengths and weaknesses, and putting things in perspective. P2P and MANETs are among the most active research topics in pervasive computing. The convergence of P2P networks and MANETs would allow existing P2P applications such as P2P file sharing and P2P streaming to benefit from the ubiquitous connectivity of ad-hoc. A P2P network over an ad-hoc infrastructure is a powerful combination that provides users with means to access different kinds of information anytime and anywhere. Realizing such a system is, however, not straightforward.
