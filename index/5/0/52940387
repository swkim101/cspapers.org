Fitness related wearables have become ubiquitous in the recent past. Nevertheless, short battery life of these devices is still a pressing issue. Limited battery capacity in small form factor and power hungry continuous monitoring of accelerometer have been significant concerns in this regard. To address these issues we propose a novel low-power step counting solution based on an Electromagnetic energy harvesting mechanism. Extremely simple nature of the step counter removes the requirement of any step detection algorithm, thereby reducing the power consumption, while the energy harvester generates a portion of energy requirement prolonging the battery life.
