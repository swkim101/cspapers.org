Although it is generally accepted that semantic knowledge is important to language comprehension, the question remains as to when this knowledge should be applied in the task of machine language understanding. This paper discusses two related results in the filed of Cognitive Neuroscience which suggests humans are activating deep semantic and episodic information early in language understanding. This discussion is followed by a discussion of Direct Memory Access Parsing (DMAP), a text reading approach that leverages existing knowledge and performs integration in the early stages of parsing natural language text. DMAPâ€™s understanding is driven by memory structures, and it maps immediately and directly to existing knowledge. Machine reading is fundamentally about integrating new knowledge gleaned from reading with existing knowledge, and it seems not only efficient, but cognitively plausible for this process to be started early in the parsing of natural language.
