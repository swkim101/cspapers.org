Our research purpose is abstracting computational model from the structure and function as well as collaboration among the biolo58gical cells. Quorum sensing P system means bacteria produce specific signaling molecules spontaneously and sense the change in their concentration. In this paper, we use multicompartmental Gillespie algorithm to model and simulate Vibrio fischeriâ€™s quorum sensing phenomenon. We put forward an algorithm considering communication and synchronization of each reaction space in a multi-environment p system, whose effectiveness is verified by simulation tools such as CellDesigner and Scilab. At last we propose an idea of using this P System into Multi-Agent System.
