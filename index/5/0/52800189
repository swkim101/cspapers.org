JLn 1964 MIT’s Project MAC selected the General Electric Model 635 computer system as the basis for building the Multics time sharing utility computer system [7]. I had participated in the work of the four-person committee that visited computer manufacturers to evaluate the potential of each for achieving the goals of Multics. The basis for this evaluation was the report of the “Long Range Computer Study Group” completed in 1961[21], to which I contributed.
