With the increasing penetration of parallelism into computing, programmers of all stripes need to acquire competencies in concurrent programming. This workshop will concentrate on discussing and disseminating resources for gently introducing parallelism into programmers' skill sets. This workshop, Developing Competency in Parallelism: Techniques for Education and Training brings together two dozen researchers and instructors who have worked to find new ways of introducing programmers to the basics of parallel programming. 
 
We are pleased to have selected two papers from among those submitted, that offer new ways of teaching parallel-programming concepts. Our workshop also includes an unconference session, whose minutes can be accessed through this hyperlink. We will also view demos of multicore programming assignments, and WebMapReduce for CS1. 
 
We are happy that you are able to join us for this exciting workshop, and hope that the ideas you take home with you will enrich the experience of your students.
