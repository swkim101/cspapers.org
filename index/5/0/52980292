The diversified use cases of next-generation mobile networks can be realized by the key concept of Network Slicing that enables mobile network operators to slice a single physical network into multiple virtual network instances optimized to specific services and business goals. Scaling of network slices is required to cope with the resources needed for peak traffic demand. In this paper, we demonstrate scaling of network slices based on the type of network slice such as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) in order to ensure Service Level Agreement (SLA) guarantees of the network slices with the help of our proposed Network Slicing Profiler (NSP) and Network Slice Scaling Function (NSSF) in an ETSI MANO based network slicing framework.
