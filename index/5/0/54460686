This paper aims to implement a facial detection and recognition system through artificial neural network using a video recording as the input. The system will be used to generate a class attendance report that labels the status as either present, late, or absent to the correct student. The system will utilize the raspberry pi module to communicate with the pi camera, which takes the video recording of the class, this recording will be used as an input to the facial detection and recognition in order to determine the student statuses and eventually generate the class attendance. Confusion matrix will be used to measure and visualize the performance of the classifier and the algorithms. The researchers were able to obtain an accuracy of 87.70% for the attendance accuracy.
