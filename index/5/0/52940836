We design and 3D print conductive lines and EMG electrodes on eyeglasses temples. We evaluate the electrical property and the EMG signal quality of the printed components and report line resistance, electrode surface resistance, and EMG signal quality. We found that the signal quality is comparable to non-printed lines and electrodes. Our work shows that 3D printing of conductive lines and electrodes on custom-shaped eyeglasses frames is feasible for chewing monitoring.
