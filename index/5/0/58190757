As IC fabrication capabilities extend down to sub-halfmicron, the signi cance of interconnect delay and power dissipation can no longer be ignored. Existing enhancements to synthesis and physical design tools (such as nonlinear delay modeling, custom wire load models, back annotation of calculated delays, early oorplanning, post-layout re-mapping and resizing) have not been able to solve the problem. It thus remains that tradeo s in logical and physical domains must be addressed in an integrated fashion. Huge business opportunities will be lost unless more revolutionary changes to design ow are made. This panel of experts will address the current split between logic synthesis and physical design and its e ect on the design ow. It will then discuss possibilities for merging the two, or at least bringing them closer together. In particular, issues such as consistent wire load and timing models and algorithms which must be employed across the design ow, EDA standards and common databases to support the integration of layout and synthesis tools, evolving structured design styles that o er lower wiring overhead, interconnect-driven logic synthesis, and timingdriven physical design will be discussed. Finally, the panel will seek to highlight challenges and potential pitfalls that lie ahead.
