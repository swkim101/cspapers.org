Modern automotive grade embedded platforms feature high performance Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to support the massively parallel processing power needed for next-generation autonomous driving applications. Hence, a GPU scheduling approach with strong Real-Time guarantees is needed. While previous research efforts focused on reverse engineering the GPU ecosystem in order to understand and control GPU scheduling on NVIDIA platforms, we provide an in depth explanation of the NVIDIA standard approach to GPU application scheduling on a Drive PX platform. Then, we discuss how a privileged scheduling server can be used to enforce arbitrary scheduling policies in a virtualized environment.
