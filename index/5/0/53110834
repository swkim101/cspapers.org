This workshop addresses the security and privacy issues that have developed as our society has become more interconnected, specifically with respect to multimedia data generated in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Web 2.0/3.0. The word "multimedia" here has expanded beyond its original scope. With the rise of social media and online P2P sharing services, large quantities of multimedia data (e.g., pictures, videos, audio, and computer graphics) are being created and shared constantly. When all these data are stored in a networked environment, many people can connect to it for viewing, sharing, commenting, and storing information. Particularly, multimedia data in IoT networks serves a significant purpose as many people's status, locations, and live actions can be seen, disseminated, tracked, commented on, and monitored in real time. IoT opens up many possibilities for attacks since more people can broadcast themselves and allow their networks and networks' networks to view and share in their lives.
