This is the first year for Wavefront, a new component of SPLASH. Wavefront was created to provide a forum for reporting on innovative work that occurs in the gap between academic computer science research and everyday software engineering. The Wavefront is about the systems that innovative software developers are creating and deploying today.
 In defining Wavefront, we wanted to make sure that its submission process was approachable to practicing software professionals who were unfamiliar with the process of creating and submitting a refereed conference paper. To this end we solicited submission of both complete papers and of extended abstracts for paper proposals. Program committee members shepherded the authors of accepted proposals as they prepared their final conference papers.
 Both full papers and extended abstract proposals were evaluated by the program committee based upon the following criteria: Novelty: The paper presents new applications, system architectures, software designs, user interfaces, development tools, or implementation techniques. Interest: The paper addresses a significant and immediate problem or opportunity. The results in the paper have potential for immediate impact on state-of-the art software development projects. Evidence: The paper presents implemented designs, system case studies, or intriguing observations. Preference will be given to papers based upon deployed systems. Clarity: The paper is clearly written and understandable by practicing software developers. However, shepherding will be available for papers that present good ideas but need help in their presentation.
 The Wavefront committee received a total of twelve submissions, six full papers and six extended abstract proposals. Of these, six papers were accepted including three paper proposals requiring shepherding. In addition, two Wavefront submissions were accepted as SPLASH Experience Reports.
