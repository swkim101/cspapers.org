Displaying three dimensional graphics on last generation mobile devices such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and smart phones is a new and challenging task. Moreover, several additional issues are involved when complex models have to be displayed such as in 3D medical imaging. Medical data models often result by CT (Computed Tomography) or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Image) and the obtained volumetric data sets are processed and displayed by volume rendering techniques. These rendering algorithms require a lot computational power and storage resources not available in nowadays mobile devices. The paper proposes a distributed architecture where a remote rendering server is able to manage complex models and to code a MPEG stream to be sent to the client; the user can visualize and analyze interactively the model by roto-translation commands.
