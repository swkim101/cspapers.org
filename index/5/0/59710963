It's a pleasure to welcome you to OOPSLA 2006, the 21st Annual Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications. OOPSLA is the premier forum for practitioners, researchers, and students in diverse disciplines whose common threads are objects and related technologies. From its inception, OOPSLA has served as an incubator for advanced technologies and practices. Dynamic compilation and optimization, patterns, refactoring, aspect-oriented software development, agile methods, service-oriented architectures and model-driven development (to name a few) all have OOPSLA roots.OOPSLA 2006 continues and strengthens that tradition. It features an exciting roster of researchers and practitioners from around the world coming to showcase their latest work in a highly diverse set of forums that meet the needs of our equally diverse audience. Presentations from invited speakers dovetail with technical papers, practitioner reports, expert panels, demonstrations, formal and informal educational symposia, workshops, and diverse tutorials from world-class lecturers. Bend your head around some out-of-the-box thinking at the ever-popular Onward! track. Discuss late-breaking results with the researchers themselves at poster sessions, which culminate in the Fifth Annual ACM Student Research Competition. Get some hands-on design experience at the expert-mentored DesignFestÂ®. Gather together with like-minded people at Birds-of-a-Feather sessions to discuss shared topics of interest. Or just let us know what's on your mind at the Lightning Talks, where anyone can speak to the community on just about anything at all.
