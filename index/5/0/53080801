Targeted sentiment analysis (TSA) aims at extracting targets and classifying their sentiment classes. Previous works only exploit word embeddings as features and do not explore more potentials of neural networks when jointly learning the two tasks. In this paper, we carefully design the hierarchical stack bidirectional gated recurrent units (HSBi-GRU) model to learn abstract features for both tasks, and we propose a HSBi-GRU based joint model which allows the target label to have influence on their sentiment label. Experimental results on two datasets show that our joint learning model can outperform other baselines and demonstrate the effectiveness of HSBi-GRU in learning abstract features.
