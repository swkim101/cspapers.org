One of the curriculum design problems facing computer science is the pressure to add new courses to cover additional topics. Often there is no curriculum space available. In some cases, the topics are covered more effectively by distributing them among a set of courses.However, when parts of a topic, such as parallel processing or scientific visualization, are distributed among a set of courses, additional problems arise in areas of coordination and consistency of coverage.A curriculum design paradigm is presented which seeks to formalize the distribution of a course in such a way that the integrity of the topics is maintained and documented.
