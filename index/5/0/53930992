This paper, focusing specifically on solutions that strive to extend Healthy Life Years, tackles the problem of predicting and preventing risky situations that might arise when an elderly person lives alone at home. The paper assumes the presence of a monitoring system equipped with a pervasive sensor network and a reasoning engine. The proposed methodology is explained in the context of a very frequent problem: the prevention of falls.
