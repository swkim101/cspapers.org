We present a system that visualizes complex human motion via 3D motion sculptures-a representation that conveys the 3D structure swept by a human body as it moves through space. Our system computes a motion sculpture from an input video, and then embeds it back into the scene in a 3D-aware fashion. The user may also explore the sculpture directly in 3D or physically print it. Our interactive interface allows users to customize the sculpture design, for example, by selecting materials and lighting conditions. To provide this end-to-end workflow, we introduce an algorithm that estimates a human's 3D geometry over time from a set of 2D images, and develop a 3D-aware image-based rendering approach that inserts the sculpture back into the original video. By automating the process, our system takes motion sculpture creation out of the realm of professional artists, and makes it applicable to a wide range of existing video material. By conveying 3D information to users, motion sculptures reveal space-time motion information that is difficult to perceive with the naked eye, and allow viewers to interpret how different parts of the object interact over time. We validate the effectiveness of motion sculptures with user studies, finding that our visualizations are more informative about motion than existing stroboscopic and space-time visualization methods.
