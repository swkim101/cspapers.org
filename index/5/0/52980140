Data-centric networks provide content instead of address (what vs. where) based communication primitives, and have been argued to be the proper candidate for data dissemination in high mobility vehicular networks (e.g., delivering road side accident video clips to affected drivers in both directions). However, current Medium Access Control (MAC) layers filter incoming frames based on destination addresses, not content. The data-centric network community has resorted to MAC broadcast, with high and greatly varying frame loss rates. We propose V-MAC, a data-centric MAC layer that filters frames by content. It supports one to many multicast at MAC level, and ensures a uniform and controllable small frame loss rate across all receivers, despite their varying reception qualities. We have created a V-MAC prototype using Raspberry Pis and WiFi dongles. Experiments under extremely noisy environment show that it reduces frame loss from 50% (broadcast) to less than 10%, and consistently among multiple receivers.
