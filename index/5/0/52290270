The paper describes an estimation and identification procedure that allows to reconstruct the inertial parameters of a rigid load attached to the end-effector of an industrial manipulator. In particular, the proposed method adopts a multirate quaternion-based Kalman filter, fusing measurements obtained from robot kinematics and inertial sensors at possibly different sampling frequencies, to estimate linear accelerations and angular velocities/accelerations of the load. Then, a recursive total least-squares (RTLS) process is executed to identify the load parameters. Both steps of the estimation and identification procedure are performed in real-time, without the need for offline post-processing of measured data.
