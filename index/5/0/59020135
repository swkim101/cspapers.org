This work focuses on highly dynamic distributed systems with Quality of Service (QoS) constraints (most importantly real-time constraints). To that purpose, real-time applications may benefit from code offloading techniques, so that parts of the application can be offloaded and executed, as services, by neighbour nodes, which are willing to cooperate in such computations. These applications explicitly state their QoS requirements, which are translated into resource requirements, in order to evaluate the feasibility of accepting other applications in the system.
