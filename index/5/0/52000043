Fundamental research in visualization is concerned with the impact of presentation on visual perception and understanding [5] [6]. In current Air Traffic Control (ATC) environments, Air Traffic Controllers (ATCo) use several visualization systems: radar views, timelines, electronic strips, meteorological views, supervisions etc... The information displayed is intrinsically temporal: aircraft positions that evolve over time, conflicts between aircraft at a given time, airspace congestions... Each of these visualizations is rich and dynamic: it displays numerous visual entities that move and evolve over time. Furthermore, this considerable volume of information must be understandable with a minimum cognitive workload. As traffic increases and safety criteria become more demanding ATC requires this new kind of visualizations. Our research focuses on the production of new efficient visualizations with temporal data. We characterize a more efficient visualization as one in which a greater volume of information can be perceived and understood with a smaller or equivalent cognitive workload (while at the same time reducing the error rate in the perception of the information).
