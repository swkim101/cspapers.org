Recently there has been a huge interest in performing research on millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Prior work utilize this technology in enabling Gbps wireless links. In contrast, we exploit mmWave technology in designing high-density IoT networks, where there are hundreds of nodes, but each requiring only a Mbps wireless link. However, existing mmWave radios are costly and have high power consumption which makes them unsuitable for IoT sensors. We have built mmPi: a low-cost and low-power mmWave radio that operates as a daughterboard for the Raspberry Pi platform. We believe that mmPi helps advance mmWave research in the IoT domain.
