This paper presents a logic synthesis method for look-up table (LUT) based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We determine functions to be mapped to LUTs by functional decomposition. We use not only disjunctive decomposition but also nondisjunctive decomposition. Furthermore, we propose a new Boolean resubstitution technique customized for an LUT network synthesis. Resubstitution is used to determine whether an existing function is useful to realize another function; thus, we can share the common function among two or more functions. The Boolean resubstitution is effectively carried out by solving a support minimization problem for an incompletely specified function. We can also handle satisfiability don't cares of an LUT network using the technique.
