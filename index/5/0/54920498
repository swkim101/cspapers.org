The current complexity of custom and embedded core or IP integrated electronics demand for a new generation of automated system design and development methods. High-Level Synthesis plays a critical part of such automated methods. However, existing HLS tools are not widely accepted by the engineering community for a number of practical reasons. This article is a practical perspective of such issues, and it analyses the reasons for this. Morever, the article is a useful introduction to the system engineer that wants to consider HLS as part of his everyday system design practice. An alternative HLS toolset is presented that the author has developed and which is based on formal methods, thus it guarandees the correctness of the synthesized hardware and system. The paper completes with conclussions and a number of suggestions about the future directions of HLS technology and what is actually needed by the engineering community.
