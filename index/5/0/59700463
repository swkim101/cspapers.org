In this report, we present methods and techniques for calibrating cameras of the KTH head-eye system, in particular, intrinsic parameters. The intention is to build up look-up-tables for them so that we can index them and no on-the-job calibration is needed. Extension experiments were carried out and results are reported here. M.X.
