Crossed fused ectopia of the kidneys is a rare anomaly and tumours arising in them are rarer still. We report a case of a renal cell carcinoma arising in an L shaped crossed fused ectopic kidney in a 38 year old man for whom a robot assisted nephron sparing surgery was done. Our report highlights the importance of preoperative contrast enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) with arterial 3D reconstruction for preoperative surgical planning and the use of daVinci robot (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in performing the heminephrectomy with utmost precision. We have earlier reported the use of the robot for heminephrectomy in a patient with chromophobe renal cell carcinoma in a crossed fused ectopic kidney and this report highlights the technical aspects of the surgical procedure and establishes the reproducibility of the same.
