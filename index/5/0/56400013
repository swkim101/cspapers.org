With the explosion in the use of mobile technologies, more people can get m-government services. It is related to the interests of many people, so it is necessary to evaluate user satisfaction of the services. Some proposed models fail to evaluate the m-government from the publicâ€™s perspective. The purpose of this study is to create an evaluation model to evaluate user satisfaction of m-government. Based on the theory of SERQUAL and Kano model, an evaluation model was established and the indicators are grouped into five constructs: activity; convenience; friendliness; reliability and responsiveness. Then we conducted a questionnaire survey to test the model. To make the evaluation more objective, we use a quantitative evaluation method, the BP neural network, to develop, test and validate on 14 M-government platforms. And the results confirm that this model can be put into practice. This study has given us a direction to improve the user satisfaction of m-government.
