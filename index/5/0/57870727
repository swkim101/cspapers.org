In many recent computer system designs, hardware facilities have been provided for easing the problems of storage allocation. This paper presents a method of characterizing dynamic storage allocation systems, according to the functional capabilities provided, and the underlying techniques used. The basic purpose of the paper is to provide a useful perspective from which the utility of various hardware facilities may be assessed. The paper includes as an appendix, a brief survey of storage allocation facilities in several representative computer systems.
