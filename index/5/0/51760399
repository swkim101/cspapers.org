Identifying analogies across domains without supervision is an important task for artiﬁcial intelligence. Recent advances in cross domain image mapping have concentrated on translating images across domains. Although the progress made is impressive, the visual ﬁdelity many times does not sufﬁce for identifying the matching sample from the other domain. In this paper, we tackle this very task of ﬁnding exact analogies between datasets i.e. for every image from domain A ﬁnd an analogous image in domain B. We present a matching-by-synthesis approach: AN-GAN, and show that it outperforms current techniques. We further show that the cross-domain mapping task can be broken into two parts: domain alignment and learning the mapping function. The tasks can be iteratively solved, and as the alignment is improved, the unsupervised translation function reaches quality comparable to full supervision.
