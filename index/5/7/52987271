SFSCQ is the first file system with a machine-checked proof of security. To develop, specify, and prove SFSCQ, this paper introduces D ISK S EC , a novel approach for reasoning about confidentiality of storage systems, such as a file system. D ISK S EC addresses the challenge of specifying confidentiality using the notion of data noninterfer-ence to find a middle ground between strong and precise information-flow-control guarantees and the weaker but more practical discretionary access control. D ISK S EC factors out reasoning about confidentiality from other properties (such as functional correctness) using a notion of sealed blocks . Sealed blocks enforce that the file system treats confidential file blocks as opaque in the bulk of the code, greatly reducing the effort of proving data noninterference. An evaluation of SFSCQ shows that its theorems preclude security bugs that have been found in real file systems, that D ISK S EC imposes little performance overhead, and that SFSCQâ€™s incremental development effort, on top of D ISK S EC and DFSCQ, on which it is based, is moderate.
