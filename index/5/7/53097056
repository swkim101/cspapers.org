The information of daily garbage diposal can be used to develop many appealing applications in smart cities. This poster introduces DeepCounter, an automotive sensing system to providing a finegrained spatio-temporal distribution on the amount of disposed garbage bags. In the system, deep learning based image processing is used to automatically count the number of collected garbage bags from the video taken by a camera mounted on the rear of a garbage truck. A prototype system is implemented and experimental evaluation validates the feasibility of our proposal using realistic garbage collection videos in Fujisawa city Japan.
