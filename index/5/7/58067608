Cloud computing is currently on the way to maturing from early prototypes to become a serious platform for production environments. At the same time, however, early adopters complain about serious usability problems as well as insufficient or fluctuating system performance. Even more, different application domains, like web services or scientific computing, have strongly different requirements to clouds as their computing environments. This workshop is investigating the needs and requirements from different, potential cloud application domains, and especially how cloud computing platforms (IaaS, PaaS, and their integration) can be built in order to meet these requirements. The workshop's focus is on building suitable and high-performance cloud computing platforms. We aim to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the technical aspects of cloud computing. The focus of the workshop is on novel, practical, systems-oriented work.
