Nano robots are very tiny machines (too negligible to see through naked eye) designed to perform a specific task whose components are at or close to the scale of a nanometer. Medical nanobots are in the range of nanometer scale (10-9) and the main element used will be carbon nanotubes because of strength and chemical inertness. This paper discloses one of the major application of a nanobot that can be used for human cell, tissue and even organ repair. Since nanobot performs more than one task for repairing a tissue hence there is a need of programming and usage of more than one nanobots. Cell/tissue repair nanobot is more advanced and sophisticated than nanobot that is used in the cancer treatment
