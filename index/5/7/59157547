Computer modeling and simulation are indispensable for understanding the functioning of an organism on a molecular level. We present an implemented method for the qualitative simulation of large and complex genetic regulatory networks. The method allows a broad range of regulatory interactions between genes to be represented and has been applied to the analysis of a real network of biological interest, the network controlling the inititation of sporulation in the bacterium B. subtilis.
