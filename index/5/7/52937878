We can benefit from various services with context recognition using wearable sensors. In this study, we focus on the contexts acquired from sensor data in the nostrils. Nostrils can provide various contexts on breathing, nasal congestion, and higher level contexts including psychological and health states. In this paper, we propose a context recognition method using the information in the nostril. We develop a system to acquire the temperature in the nostrils using small temperature sensors connected to glasses. As a result of the evaluations, the proposed system can detect workload at an accuracy of 96.4%.
