Computer architects put significant efforts on the design space exploration of a new processor, as it determines the overall characteristics (e.g., performance, power, cost) of the final product. To thoroughly explore the space and achieve the best results, they need high design evaluation throughput – the ability to quickly assess a large number of designs with minimal costs. Unfortunately, the existing simulators and performance models are either too slow or too inaccurate to meet this demand. As a result, architects often sacrifice the design space coverage to end up with a sub-optimal product. To address this challenge, we propose RpStacks-MT, a methodology to evaluate multi-core processor designs with high throughput. First, we propose a graph-based multi-core performance model, which overcomes the limitations of the existing models to accurately describe a multi-core processor's key performance behaviors. Second, we propose a reuse distance-based memory system model and a dynamic scheduling reconstruction method, which help our graph model to quickly track the performance changes from processor design changes. Lastly, we combine these models with a state of the art design exploration idea to evaluate multiple processor designs in an efficient way. Our evaluations show that RpStacks-MT achieves extremely high design evaluation throughput – 88× higher versus a conventional cycle-level simulator and 18× higher versus an accelerated simulator (on average, for evaluating 10,000 designs) – while maintaining simulator-level accuracy.
