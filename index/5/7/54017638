Tracking errors generally increased while the vibration magnitude increased, and the error was most responsive to 5 Hz of z-axis vibration [2]. Also tracking performance of vertical vibration have been found that in range of frequencies between 2 and 12 Hz, came with the maximum reduction occurring at the lowest of the frequency range. It can be concluded that the vibration magnitude had a superior consequence on tracking performance than the vibration frequency did [1].
