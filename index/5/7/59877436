Data stream mining gained in importance over the last years because it is indispensable for many real applications such as prediction and evolution of weather phenomena; security and anomaly detection in networks; evaluating satellite data; and mining health monitoring streams. Stream mining algorithms must take account of the unique properties of stream data: infinite data, temporal ordering, concept drifts and shifts, demand for scalability etc. 
 
Learning on streams has followed two threads thus far: mining (classification, clustering, frequent itemset discovery) and probabilistic modeling. In both threads, scholars devise solutions to the above problems. Stream clustering algorithms are more oriented towards scalability and tracing of model changes, while dynamic probabilistic modeling, e.g. dynamic topic modeling, encompasses methods that adapt seamlessly to drifts. At the same time, research on unsupervised stream learning seems to be scattered along the many application areas. Examples of areas that seem to evolve independently are sensor mining, mining on clickstreams and other logs in stream form, topic modeling on document streams, and temporal mining on data that are actually streams. 
 
This workshop brings together scholars working in different areas of learning on streams, including sensor data and other forms of accumulating data. Most of the papers in the next pages are on unsupervised learning with clustering methods. Issues addressed include the detection of outliers and anomalies, evolutionary clustering and incremental clustering, learning in subspaces of the complete feature space and learning with exploitation of context, deriving models from text streams and visualizing them.
