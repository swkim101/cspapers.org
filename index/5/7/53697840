Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are used by various application areas to implement smart data processing and ubiquitous system. In the recent research of parking management system based on wireless sensor networks, adaptive sensing of WSN is not considered where the effective implementation of these distributed computing devices affects the performance of the over-all reliability of the parking management system. This paper proposes an adaptive sensing using the proposed fuzzy wireless sensor implemented in the ubiquitous parking management system. The fuzzy inference system is encoded in the sensor devices for efficient car presence detection. A rule base adaptive module is used to change the fuzzy set values from wireless sensors based on the rules specified by an expert. The prototype implementation of the proposed fuzzy wireless sensors is done in a ubiquitous parking management system simulator.
