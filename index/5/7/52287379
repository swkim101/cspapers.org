In this paper, we present the achievement of aerial grasping by shape adaptive transformation to the object shape, using a novel transformable aerial robot called HALO: Horizontal Plane Transformable Aerial Robot with Closed-loop Multilinks Structure. Aerial manipulation is an active research area and using multiple aerial robots is an effective solution for the large size object. However the cooperation is considered that there are some difficulties such as the synchronized flight control and collision with each other. Then, we focus on the transformable aerial robot with two-dimensional multilinks proposed in our previous works, which can transform to the suitable form for the target object and grasp it. However the transformable aerial robot with the serial-link structure could not achieve stable flight in terms of horizontal position and yaw control due to the low rigidity and large inertia in the case of more than 4 links. Thus, first we construct a novel type of multilinks with closed-loop structure to avoid the deformation and a new link module with a tilted propeller for fully-actuated control. Second, we describe transformation method with closed-loop multilinks. Third, we present the optimization planning method for the multilinks form to be adaptive to the two-dimensional shape of the target object. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate the feasibility of closed-loop aerial transformation and aerial grasping for the large size object.
