The last 20 years have seen dramatic improvements in the performance

of algorithms for Boolean satisfiability---so-called SAT solvers---and

today conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) solvers are routinely

used in a wide range of application areas. One serious short-coming

of CDCL, however, is that the underlying method of reasoning is quite

weak. A tantalizing solution is to instead use stronger

pseudo-Boolean (PB) reasoning, but so far the promise of exponential

gains in performance has failed to materialize---the increased

theoretical strength seems hard to harness algorithmically, and in

many applications CDCL-based methods are still superior. We propose a

modified approach to pseudo-Boolean solving based on division instead

of the saturation rule used in [Chai and Kuehlmann '05] and other PB

solvers. In addition to resulting in a stronger conflict analysis,

this also improves performance by keeping integer coefficient sizes

down, and yields a very competitive solver as shown by the results in

the Pseudo-Boolean Competitions 2015 and 2016.
