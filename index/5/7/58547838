This paper deals with the setting calculation data center (SCDC), which is based on Common Information Model (CIM). The construction consists of data splicing and graphics stitching. The splicing method of the information related to setting calculation gains more attention, especially the operation mode. Further more, it brings up a method called dynamic partitioning to improve calculation efficiency. It gives a proper element range relying on the maximum and the minimum operating modes provided by the grid. We only need to consider the network elements in this range to involve in setting calculation. Out of this range we use a simplified equivalent model. At last, the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm are verified by the result of the practical example and it is reasonable and effective in its application in engineering.
