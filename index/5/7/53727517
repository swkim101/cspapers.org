Based on general principles of robust design and axiomatic design, relationship among robustness, structural parameters, design parameters and uncontrollable factors has been established. Various factors that affect system robustness were analyzed mathematically to determine the relationship between robustness and structural characteristics of the linear system. The relations among functional requirements were also explored. Accordingly, an optimization model was established to determine design parameters. This new robust design approach can be used for linear mechanical system analysis.Copyright Â© 2008 by ASME
