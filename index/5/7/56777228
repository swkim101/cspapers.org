The term live programming is a recent catchphrase for programming systems that abandon the traditional edit-compile-run cycle in favor of a more instantaneous user experience with live feedback on a program's runtime behavior. 
 
The goal of this workshop is to focus on exploring notions and degrees of live programming as they relate to software development, creative activities, learning, and performance. We are interested in techniques, tools, demos, infrastructures, languages design insights, and questions that stimulate interest and understanding in live programming concepts. We hope to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in live programming.
