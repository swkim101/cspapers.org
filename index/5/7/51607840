In many settings just finding a good clustering is insufficient and

an explanation of the clustering is required. If the features used

to perform the clustering are interpretable then methods such as

conceptual clustering can be used. However, in many applications

this is not the case particularly for image, graph and other complex

data. Here we explore the setting where a set of interpretable

discrete tags for each instance is available. We formulate the

descriptive clustering problem as a bi-objective optimization

to simultaneously find compact clusters using the features and to

describe them using the tags. We present our formulation in a

declarative platform and show it can be integrated into a standard

iterative algorithm to find all Pareto optimal solutions to the two

objectives. Preliminary results demonstrate the utility of our

approach on real data sets for images and electronic health care

records and that it outperforms single objective and multi-view clustering

baselines.
