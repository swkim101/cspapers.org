Automation is a technique of automatically controlled operation of an apparatus, process or system by mechanical or electronic devices that takes place of human organs of observation, efforts and decision. To complete the transition, support its new equipment and prepare for new market demands and opportunities, the company needed to re-engineer its process infrastructure to support the additional challenges of Just in time delivery, integrated client support services and competitive price pressures. Central Electronic Fabrication Section is the nodal agency responsible for the fabrication of various electronics packages. Various agencies like Design groups, System Reliability Group, Project, Components Group, PCB Fabrication Facility and Online Quality check etc. interact with this facility for the realization of the electronic hardware. This paper presents the automation in fabrication technique of printed circuit boards. The companyâ€™s goal is to manufacture 12 satellites per year, but they are currently manufacturing 4 to 6 satellites per year. Main reason for this less is unable to manufacture enough printed circuit boards. Hence it is proposed to implement the automated workflow system in Central Electronic Fabrication Section to expedite various activities, optimize the effort by means of HMI, less human intervention and reduce the paperwork. An automated workflow system is a computer system that is used to manage a series of tasks within an organization/process to produce a final outcome. At each stage in the flow, one individual or a group is responsible for a specific task. Workflow software ensures that the individuals responsible for the next task are notified and receive the data to execute their stage of the process.
