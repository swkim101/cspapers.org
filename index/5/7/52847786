The signature generation phase of most DLP-based signature schemes (for instance Schnorr [10], El-Gamal [4] or the newly standardized D.S.A [3]) includes the time-consuming computation of r = g mod p where k is random. This paper introduces a new computational strategy that can apply in this particular context: A batch exponentiation technique which allows the generation of large sets of exponentials without introducing any bias between the ks (that is, the signer can batch-compute the exponentials corresponding to arbitrarily imposed powers -for instance by an external random number generator). Our method offers real improvements over the prior art with various time and memory trade-offs.
