In order to solve the problems of multi-sources data management and multiple models integration, this study employs open source system-Delft-FEWS developed by Deltares in the Netherlands, to conduct flood forecasting in the Huaihe River Basin of China for the first time. The system provides a platform for data handling and is open to connect a wide range of monitored and forecasted weather inputs on the one side and of hydrological and hydraulic models on the other side. The application shows that Delft-FEWS is a useful and efficient tool for flood forecasting in the Huaihe River Basin, China. Particularly, as an open system - joint development approach, Delft FEWS shows a promising potential for application as a open flood forecasting platform in the Huaihe River Basin, which will facilitate probability flood forecasting for the Huaihe River Basin.
