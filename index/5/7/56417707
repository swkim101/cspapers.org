SOA applications are usually built by assembling third-party software services. Even if each single service could offer a contract stating its non-functional properties, enforcing a monitoring policy is needed to detect services overload and consequent contract violations. In this paper we present a monitoring system capable of detecting service state changes. Our experimental results, obtained with a prototype, shows an improvement of 26% of the application response time.
