In conventional partially observable Markov decision processes, the observations that the agent receives originate from fixed known distributions. However, in a variety of real-world scenarios, the agent has an active role in its perception by selecting which observations to receive. We avoid combinatorial expansion of the action space from integration of planning and perception decisions, through a greedy strategy for observation selection that minimizes an information-theoretic measure of the state uncertainty.Â We develop a novel point-based value iteration algorithm that incorporates this greedy strategy to pick perception actions for each sampled belief point in each iteration. As a result, not only the solver requires less belief points to approximate the reachable subspace of the belief simplex, but it also requires less computation per iteration. Further, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves a near-optimal guarantee on value function with respect to an optimal perception strategy, and demonstrate its performance empirically.
