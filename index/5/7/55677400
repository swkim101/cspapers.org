We propose a method for extracting emotional polarities of words: desirable or undesirable. Regarding emotional polarities as spins of electrons, we use the mean field approximation to compute the approximate probability function of the system instead of the intractable actual probability function. Given only two seed words “good” and “bad”, the proposed method extracts 500 emotional polarities with about 75% precision.
