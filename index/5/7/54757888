Vision-based place recognition involves recognising familiar places despite changes in environmental conditions or camera viewpoint (pose). Existing training-free methods exhibit excellent invariance to either of these challenges, but not both simultaneously. In this paper, we present a technique for condition-invariant place recognition across large lateral platform pose variance for vehicles or robots travelling along routes. Our approach combines sideways facing cameras with a new multi-scale image comparison technique that generates synthetic views for input into the condition-invariant Sequence Matching Across Route Traversals (SMART) algorithm. We evaluate the systemâ€™s performance on multi-lane roads in two dierent environments across day-night cycles. In the extreme case of day-night place recognition across the entire width of a four-lane-plus-median-strip highway, we demonstrate performance of up to 44% recall at 100% precision, where current state-of-the-art fails.
