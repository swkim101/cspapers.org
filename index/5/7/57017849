The area of Internet of Things (IoT) is growing and it affects a large amount of users, which means that security is important. Many parts of IoT systems are built with Open Source Software, for which security vulnerabilities are available. It is important to update the software when vulnerabilities are detected, but it is unclear to what extent this is done in industry today. This study presents an investigation of industrial companies in the area of IoT to understand current procedures and challenges with respect to security updates. The research is conducted as an interview study with qualitative data analysis. It is found that few companies have formalized processes for this type of security updates, and there is a need to support both producers and integrators of IoT components. (Less)
