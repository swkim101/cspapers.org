Huang et al.~(STOC 2018) introduced the fully online matching problem, a generalization of the classic online bipartite matching problem in that it allows all vertices to arrive online and considers general graphs. They showed that the ranking algorithm by Karp et al.~(STOC 1990) is strictly better than $0.5$-competitive and the problem is strictly harder than the online bipartite matching problem in that no algorithms can be $(1-1/e)$-competitive. 
This paper pins down two tight competitive ratios of classic algorithms for the fully online matching problem. For the fractional version of the problem, we show that a natural instantiation of the water-filling algorithm is $2-\sqrt{2} \approx 0.585$-competitive, together with a matching hardness result. Interestingly, our hardness result applies to arbitrary algorithms in the edge-arrival models of the online matching problem, improving the state-of-art $\frac{1}{1+\ln 2} \approx 0.5906$ upper bound. For integral algorithms, we show a tight competitive ratio of $\approx 0.567$ for the ranking algorithm on bipartite graphs, matching a hardness result by Huang et al. (STOC 2018).
