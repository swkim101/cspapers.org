"Transition" covers all the activities of converting software source code to other, but still human-readable forms. A process model for software transition is embodied in the widening of a generic transition tool architecture to accommodate not just tool application but also tool implementation and specification. The process model serves adequately to explain the specification, implementation and application of a number of transition tools, as well as to assess and improve the quality of state-of-the-art enabling technology for transition tool development.
