Welcome to the ACM SIGCOMM2007 Conference in Kyoto, Japan! We are proud to host SIGCOMM for the first time in Asia, especially with the increasing importance of global thinking in data communications research. SIGCOMM2007 is a good opportunity for the SIGCOMM community to learn about unique Internet situations in Asia and, at the same time, for Asian researchers to participate in one of the best regarded conferences in the field. To this end, we have arranged a 10Gbps IPv4/IPv6 link to the conference venue and organized six workshops covering hot topics with strong interest in the region. 
 
Kyoto, often called "Japan's heartland", is not simply protecting its old traditions and culture, but is rather building upon the rich traditions of predecessors as a foundation for open domestic and international exchange. With this revolutionary spirit, we have created the SIGCOMM2007 logo based on Japanese calligraphy. We also used a bamboo grove as our conference symbol; you might have noticed that it shows a TCP 3-way handshake over IPv6.
