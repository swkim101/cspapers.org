It is our pleasure to welcome you to the 'Next generation mobile computing for dynamic personalised travel planning' workshop being held at MobiSys 2012. 
 
A key component of current UK and EU transport policy is to provide individuals with 'smarter choices' which, in combination, will 'nudge' them to adopt more environmentally friendly modes. 'Travel Planning' has been a concept that has emerged from the smarter choices research since the 2004 UK government White Paper. This has also taken the form of 'personalised travel planning' where blended measures are demonstrated to individuals in order to highlight the merits of adopting alternative modes of travel. 
 
The provision of dynamic traffic and travel information, particularly for public transport services, has been a key driver in travel planning and the advent of mobile technology now allows much greater visibility of current and future travel options, tailored to the individual's needs. Mobile apps have the potential to take 'personalised travel planning' to another dimension where context sensitive, real-time information can be provided to the individual traveler, directly from source. 
 
The workshop looks at some of the current issues in this area from the travel planning and computing perspectives by bringing together nine presentations grouped into three sessions: -- User needs and implications for dynamic personalised travel planning - Managing and harnessing travel data sets -- Applications for dynamic personalised travel planning. 
 
The sessions will help you understand the future challenges related to personal mobility given current UK and EU policy, and identify the current and future direction of mobile computing for personalised travel management. 
 
We hope that you will find this workshop interesting and thought-provoking and that it will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners.
