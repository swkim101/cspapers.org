Classical logic argumentation (Cl-Arg) under the

stable semantics yields argumentative characterisations

of non-monotonic inference in Preferred Subtheories.

This paper studies these characterisations

under both the standard approach to Cl-Arg, and a

recent dialectical approach that is provably rational

under resource bounds. Two key contributions are

made. Firstly, the preferred extensions are shown

to coincide with the stable extensions. This means

that algorithms and proof theories for the admissible

semantics can now be used to decide credulous

inference in Preferred Subtheories. Secondly, we

show that as compared with the standard approach,

the grounded semantics applied to the dialectical

approach more closely approximates sceptical inference

in Preferred Subtheories.
