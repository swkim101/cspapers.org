Advancements in mobile technology and computing have fostered the collection of a large number of civic datasets that capture the pulse of urban life. Furthermore, the open government and data initiative has led many local authorities to make these datasets pub- licly available, hoping to drive innovation that will further improve the quality of life for the city-dwellers. In this paper, we develop a novel application that utilizes crime data to provide safe urban nav- igation. Specifically, using crime data from Chicago and Philadel- phia we develop a risk model for their street urban network which allows us to estimate the relative probability of a crime on any road segment. Given such model we define two variants of the SAFEPATHS problem where the goal is to find a short and low-risk path between a source and a destination locations. Since both the length and the risk of the path are equally important but cannot be combined into a single objective, we approach the urban-navigation problem as a biobjective shortest path problem. Our algorithms aim to output a small set of paths that provide tradeoffs between dis- tance and safety. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms and their practical applicability.
