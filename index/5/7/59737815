A new algorithm for testing primality is presented. The algorithm is distinguishable from the lovely algorithms of Solvay and Strassen [36], Miller [271 and Rabin [32] in that its assertions of primality are certain (i.e., provable from PeanoÂ·s axioms) rather than dependent on unproven hypothesis (Miller) or probability (Solovay-Strassen, Rabin). An argument is presented which suggests that the algorithm runs with~n time
