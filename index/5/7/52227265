The presented work deals with classification of garment categories including pants, shorts, shirts, T-shirts and towels. The knowledge of the garment category is crucial for its robotic manipulation. Our work focuses particularly on garments being held in a hanging state by a robotic arm. The input of our method is a set of depth maps taken from different viewpoints around the garment. The depths are fused into a single 3D point cloud. The cloud is fed into a convolutional neural network that transforms it into a single global feature vector. The network utilizes a generalized convolution operation defined over the local neighborhood of a point. It can deal with permutations of the input points. It was trained on a large dataset of common 3D objects. The extracted feature vector is classified with SVM trained on smaller datasets of garments. The proposed method was evaluated on publicly available data and compared to the original methods, achieving competitive performance and better generalization capability.
