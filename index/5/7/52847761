As software systems grow in size and use more third-party libraries and frameworks, the need for developers to understand unfamiliar large codebases is rapidly increasing. In this demonstration, we present a tool, Relo that supports users' understanding by allowing interactive exploration of code. As the developer explores relationships found in the code, Relo builds and automatically manages a visualization mirroring the developer's mental model, allowing them to group viewed artifacts or use the viewed items to ask the system for further exploration suggestions.
