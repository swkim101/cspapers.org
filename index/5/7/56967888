When a high-speed railway train enters a tunnel, a compression wave is generated ahead of the train and propagates along the tunnel. The attenuation and distortion of the compression wave in the propagation process from the entrance to the exit of the tunnel are studied numerically by a second-order symmetric TVD scheme, taking both fluid friction and heat transfer through the wall into consideration. Numerical results for several examples are given and compared with the results measured in real high-speed railway tunnels of the Shinkansen line in Japan.
