Geophysical data is the most important material that meteorologists use to model the behaviour of the Earth's atmospheres and oceans. Although most research dedicated to explanation and prediction has been based on the application of a specific statistical or artificial intelligence technique, only a few endeavours have tackled the holistic nature of the subject. One possible way of approaching this target is the application of knowledge discovery techniques. The authors designed the meteorology and data mining environment (MADAME), which resulted in a promising platform for further research being carried out in this area. The work was motivated by a project in which the authors were involved, and which had the objective of establishing the feasibility of forecasting high-intensity rainfall over different areas of the territory of Hong Kong using data mining techniques with a view of improving the existing landslide warning system.
