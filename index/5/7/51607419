We present an interactive decision support system for assisting city infrastructure inter-asset management. It combines real-time site specific data retrieval, a knowledge base co-created with domain experts and an inference engine capable of predicting potential consequences and risks resulting from the available data and knowledge. The system can give explanations of each consequence, cope with incomplete and uncertain data by making assumptions about what might be the worst case scenario, and making suggestions for further investigation. This demoÂ presents multiple real-world scenarios, and demonstrates how modifying assumptions (parameter values) can lead to different consequences.
