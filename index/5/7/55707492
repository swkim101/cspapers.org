Data.Mining is a process of extracting potentially useful information from raw Data, so as to improve the quality of the information service. With the rapid development of the Internet, the size of the data has increased from KB level to TB even PB level; The object of data mining is also more and more complicated, so the data mining algorithm need to be more efficient. Cloud computing can provide infrastructure to massive and complex data of data mining, as well as new challenging issues for data mining of cloud computing research are emerged. This paper introduces the basic concept of cloud computing and data mining firstly, and sketches out how data mining is used in cloud computing; Then summarizes the research of parallel programming mode especially analyses the Map-reduce programming model and it's development platform-Hadoop; finally, overviews efficient mass data mining algorithm based on parallel programming model and mass data mining service based on the cloud computing.
