Dynamic programming is one of important techniques in algorithm design. The permutation graph is a special type of graphs with theoretical significance and practical applications. Many graph problems such as the domination, and independent set problems can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming schemes by exploring the structural properties of permutation diagrams. Most of current algorithm textbooks use the knapsack problem and matrix chain product as examples for teaching this technique. This paper introduces an incremental and comprehensive approach to teaching dynamic programming using permutation graphs.
