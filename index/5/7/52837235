An approach for implementing a "smart" interface to support a relational view of data is proposed. The basic idea is to employ automatic programming techniques so that the interface analyzes and efficiently refines the high level query specification supplied by the user. An interface called SQUIRAL (Smart Query Interface for a Relational Algebra), which was designed using this approach, is described in detail. Several optimization techniques that derive from this approach are discussed.
