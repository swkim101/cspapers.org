The authors present a simple extensible theoretical framework for devising polynomial time approximation schemes for problems represented using natural syntactic (algebraic) specifications endowed with natural graph theoretic restrictions on input instances. Direct application of the technique yields polynomial time approximation schemes for all the problems studied in [LT80, NC88, KM96, Ba83, DTS93, HM+94a, HM+94] as well as the first known approximation schemes for a number of additional combinatorial problems. One notable aspect of the work is that it provides insights into the structure of the syntactic specifications and the corresponding algorithms considered in [KM96, HM+94]. The understanding allows them to extend the class of syntactic specifications for which generic approximation schemes can be developed. The results can be shown to be tight in many cases, i.e. natural extensions of the specifications can be shown to yield non-approximable problems. The results provide a non-trivial characterization of a class of problems having a PTAS and extend the earlier work on this topic by [KM96, HM+94].
