Three-dimensional (3D) shape recognition has drawn much research attention in the field of computer vision. The advances of deep learning encourage various deep models for 3D feature representation. For point cloud and multi-view data, two popular 3D data modalities, different models are proposed with remarkable performance. However the relation between point cloud and views has been rarely investigated. In this paper, we introduce Point-View Relation Network (PVRNet), an effective network designed to well fuse the view features and the point cloud feature with a proposed relation score module. More specifically, based on the relation score module, the point-single-view fusion feature is first extracted by fusing the point cloud feature and each single view feature with point-singe-view relation, then the pointmulti- view fusion feature is extracted by fusing the point cloud feature and the features of different number of views with point-multi-view relation. Finally, the point-single-view fusion feature and point-multi-view fusion feature are further combined together to achieve a unified representation for a 3D shape. Our proposed PVRNet has been evaluated on ModelNet40 dataset for 3D shape classification and retrieval. Experimental results indicate our model can achieve significant performance improvement compared with the state-of-the-art models.
