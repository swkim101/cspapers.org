Model transformation systems are an important contribution to the field of automated software engineering. This paper summarizes the theoretical background implemented in Visual Modeling and Transformation System (VMTS) to validate the topology of the transformation steps. The mathematical formalism is based on the double pushout approach, which is extended to rewriting steps consisting of metamodel elements. Firstly the instantiation relationship is transformed to a homomorphic mapping, then the theorems from DPO approach is applied in conjunction with the validation-related propositions. The theoretical results are accompanied with practical considerations throughout the paper, and the propositions are turned into algorithms to facilitate their applications.
