Learning new knowledge from single instructions and being able to apply it immediately is highly desirable for artificial agents. We provide the first demonstration of spoken instruction-based one-shot object and action learning in a cognitive robotic architecture and briefly discuss the architectural modifications required to enable such fast learning, demonstrating the new capabilities on a fully autonomous robot.
