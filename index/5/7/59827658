Welcome to the Second ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Green Networking! 
 
The energy consumption and environmental impact of networking and communications equipment is of increasing importance to researchers, commercial entities and society at large. The Second ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Green Networking aims to continue the exciting first edition of the workshop, to create a dynamic forum for discussing green networking issues. This year we have expanded the scope of the workshop to also present promising research ideas at the nexus of energy and IT domains and in the field of smarter energy systems. 
 
This year's call for papers attracted 19 submissions on a diverse set of topics ranging from energy harvesting to data center cooling to characterization of smarter homes to photonic coding. The 14 member Technical Program Committee along with a selected group of external experts carefully considered all of the submissions. The committee had assembled a program composed of 8 papers that will be presented during the workshop. The workshop will also feature a keynote talk on Smart Grids and a panel "Green Networking: Tip of the Iceberg or The Polar Bear?" featuring leading academia and industry participants.
