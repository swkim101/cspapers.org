ECU (Electronic Control Unit) plays an important role in automotive electronics development as the core component of the vehicle. There are problems such as large overhead, unbalanced resource allocation in the current AUTOSAR ECU mapping algorithm that's widely adopted. To solve the problems, this paper made improvements on the current algorithm. The algorithm is proved to ensure to keep the balance of the storage and time resource allocation under the constraints of AUTOSAR.
