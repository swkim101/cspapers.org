this article introduces a new model named Message Driven Model (MDM) .It is a widely used architecture model to construct loosely coupled system Inappropriate acquiring and releasing locks among concurrent procedures always lead to dead-lock problems. So the dead-lock problem caused by inappropriate usage of synchronization mechanism in MDM model is introduced. Then several solutions to resolve such dead-lock problem from different dimensions are brought out. These solutions can provide guidelines for the system designers and developers to avoid dead-lock risk during system design and implementation. In this way, the system could be more stable and reliable.
