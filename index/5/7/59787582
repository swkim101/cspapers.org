A sedentary lifestyle contributes to many of today's physical health problems such as obesity. We suggest that fostering kinesthetic literacy addresses this problem through learning: learning to move and moving to learn. In this paper, we present Pushing Pixels, an augmented bodybuilding system for exploring the role of exertion in supporting the development of kinesthetic literacy through reciprocal guidance and motivation, or communal engagement. Our system examines synchronicity in asynchronous participation of a tangible exertion interface where participants can perform at different locations, even at different times. We aim to contribute to the understanding of whole body interaction by exploring the potential of exertion interfaces to support positive effects on physical and emotional wellbeing
