Most existing author disambiguation work relies heavily on feature engineering or cannot use multiple paper relationships. In this work, we propose a network-embedding based method for author disambiguation. For each ambiguous name, we construct networks among papers sharing an ambiguous name, and connect papers with multiple relationships (e.g., co-authoring a paper). We focus on maximizing the gap between positive paper edges and negative edges, and propose a graph coarsening technique to learn global information. Further, we design a clustering algorithm which partitions paper representations into disjoint sets such that each set contains all papers of a unique author. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method is significantly better than the state-of-the-art author disambiguation and network-embedding methods.
