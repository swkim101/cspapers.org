Across a range of subfields, computer scientists and engineers have responded to society's call to safeguard privacy through technology, yielding scientific progress and impressive innovation. As the fields of privacy science and engineering mature, however, it's worth taking a moment to ask what ideas of privacy explicitly or implicitly underlie this work and whether they are meaningful, that is to say, whether they map onto ideas of privacy that provoked societal concerns, in the first place. If not, it is unclear, at best, what ends these scientific efforts are actually serving. In my lecture, I argue that privacy as Contextual Integrity (CI) is meaningful in this sense - philosophically sound while being accessible to formal representation. As such, CI could serve as a much-needed a bridge between technical approaches and ethical and policy approaches. I will identify promising directions for future work based on interesting technical applications of CI that have already emerged.
