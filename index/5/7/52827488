Given a collection<inline-equation><f> <sc>F</sc></f></inline-equation> of subsets of <?Pub Fmt italic>S<?Pub Fmt /italic> ={1,…,<?Pub Fmt italic>n<?Pub Fmt /italic>}, <?Pub Fmt italic>setcover<?Pub Fmt /italic> is the problem of selecting as few as possiblesubsets from <inline-equation> <f> <sc>F</sc></f></inline-equation> such that their union covers<?Pub Fmt italic>S,<?Pub Fmt /italic>, and <?Pub Fmt italic>maxk-cover<?Pub Fmt /italic> is the problem of selecting<?Pub Fmt italic>k<?Pub Fmt /italic> subsets from<inline-equation> <f> <sc>F</sc></f></inline-equation> such that their union has maximum cardinality. Both these problems areNP-hard.   We prove that (1 - <?Pub Fmt italic>o<?Pub Fmt /italic>(1)) ln<?Pub Fmt italic>n<?Pub Fmt /italic> is a threshold below   which setcover cannot be approximated efficiently, unless NP has slightlysuperpolynomial time algorithms. This closes the gap (up to low-orderterms) between the ratio of approximation achievable by the greedyalogorithm (which is (1 - <?Pub Fmt italic>o<?Pub Fmt /italic>(1)) lnn), and provious results of Lund and Yanakakis, that showed hardness ofapproximation within a ratio of <inline-equation><f><fen lp="par"><lim align="r"><op><rf>log</rf></op><ll>2</ll></lim>n<rp post="par"></fen>/2≃0.72</f></inline-equation> ln <?Pub Fmt italic>n<?Pub Fmt /italic>. For max<?Pub Fmt italic>k<?Pub Fmt /italic>-cover, we show an approximationthreshold of (1 - 1/<?Pub   Fmt italic>e<?Pub Fmt /italic>)(up tolow-order terms), under assumption that <inline-equation><f>P≠NP</f><?Pub   Caret></inline-equation>.
