The object of this paper is to study a new control structure for sensorless double-star induction motors (DSIM) dedicated to electrical drives using a two-level voltage source inverter (VSI). The output voltages of PWM inverter can be represented by 8 space vectors in (d, q) plane, two zero vectors and six non-zero vectors which divide the (d, q) plane into 6 regions. Then the amplitude and the rotating velocity of the flux vector can be controlled freely, Both fast torque and optimal switching logic can be obtained. The selection is based on the value of the stator flux and the torque. A novel DTC scheme of double-star induction motors is proposed in order to develop a suitable dynamic. Compared to classical Field Oriented Control (FOC), which necessitates generally three feedback loops with PI regulators, a current-regulated PWM converter, and two coordinate transformations, Direct Torque Control (DTC) uses only a couple of hysteresis comparators to perform both torque and flux dynamic control [1]. The results obtained show superior performances over the FOC one without need to any mechanical sensor.
