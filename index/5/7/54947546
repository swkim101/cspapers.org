-This paper is intended to examine networks made by street vendors in dealing with local government actions affecting their livelihood. The study shows that the local governments dominate the process of decision-making, and governance of street vendors still continues through a top-down approach. The tradition of a centralistic approach compounded by the neo-patrimonial governance in public decision making is not entirely removed yet. The study concludes that creating social capital is essential for survival as a street trader in the urban areas. The more links street vendors have the more likely they are to be able to survive; those who have the least networks with other stakeholders are the most vulnerable.
