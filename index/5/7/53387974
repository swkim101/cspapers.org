Measurable quantitative information ( MQI ) such as 165 cm or 60 kg that applies to the height or weight of an entity is quite common in ordinary language. Such information is abundant in scientiÔ¨Åc journals, technical reports or medical records that it constitutes an essential part of communicative segments of language in general. The processing of such information is thus required for successful language resource management. To facilitate such processing in a normalized way, this paper aims to specify a general markup language QML for the semantic annotation of MQI in language, while making it interoperable with other semantic annotation schemes that have been developed as ISO standards.
