Conversational systems are becoming more and more promising by playing an important role in human-computer communications. A conversational system is supposed to be intelligent to enable human-like interactions. The long-term goal of smart human-computer conversations is challenging and heavily driven by data. Thanks to the prosperity of Web 2.0, a large volume of conversational data become available to establish human-computer conversational systems. Given a human issued message, namely a query, a traditional conversational system would provide a response after proper training of how to respond like humans. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for neural generative conversations: smarter response with a suggestion is provided given the query. We assume that the new conversation mode which proactively introduces contents as next utterances, keeping user actively engaged. To address the task, we propose a novel integrated model to handle both the response generation and the suggestion generation. From the experimental results, we verify the effectiveness of the new neural generative conversation paradigm.
