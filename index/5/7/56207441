In this paper, we introduce the principle and development of the thermal object intelligent adaptive identification software based on the operation data, and discuss the application of the genetic algorithm in system identification. We completed the design of graphics user interface with the help of GUIDE. Using the software for system identification, not only simplifies the identification process, but also can directly reflect the gap between the identification data with the experimental data. Then through a concrete example, we verify the usefulness of the software in the model identification of the thermal object, which is with good project application significance.
