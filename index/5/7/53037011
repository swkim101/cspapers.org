Given a SERP in response to a user-originated query, Moffat et al. (CIKM 2013; TOIS 2017) suggest that C(i), the conditional continuation probability of the user examining the (i+1)st element presented in the SERP, given that they are known to have examined the ith one, is positively correlated with both i and with the user's initial estimate of the volume of answer pages they are looking for, and negatively correlated with the extent to which suitable answer pages have been identified in the SERP at positions 1 through i. Here we first describe a methodology for specifying how C(i) should be defined in practical (as against ideal) settings, and then evaluate the applicability of the approach using three large search interaction logs from two different sources.
