The way in which humans behave, speak and interact is deeply influenced by their culture. For example, greeting is done differently in France, in Sweden or in Japan; and the average interpersonal distance changes from one cultural group to the other. In order to successfully coexist with humans, robots should also adapt their behavior to the culture, customs and manners of the persons they interact with. In this paper, we deal with an important ingredient of cultural adaptation: how to generate robot plans that respect given cultural preferences, and how to execute them in a way that is sensitive to those preferences. We present initial results in this direction in the context of the CARESSES project, a joint EU-Japan effort to build culturally competent assistive robots.
