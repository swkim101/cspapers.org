This paper addresses the problem of low contrast in the images. Acquiring image from low illumination source or due to some other problems the image may have low contrast which results the poor visual effect. In these type of images the different object present cannot be distinguished clearly and may not be effectively used for the desired purpose. For these images there is a need to improve the contrast for a better visual effect. This paper proposed an algorithm that can improve the contrast of the images and preserve the details of the image. This algorithm preserves the details as well as the colors of the object to a larger extent. The algorithm is tested on various images and the result of the test is given.
