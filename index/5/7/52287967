This paper presents LOGOS, a method of spatial verification for visual localization that is robust in the presence of a high proportion of outliers. LOGOS uses scale and orientation information from local neighbourhoods of features to determine which points are likely to be inliers. The inlier points can be used for secondary localization verification and pose estimation. LOGOS is demonstrated on a number of benchmark localization datasets and outperforms RANSAC as a method of outlier removal and localization verification in scenarios that require robustness to many outliers.
