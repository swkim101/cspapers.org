In this paper, we propose novel edge and corner detection algorithms for unorganized point clouds. Our edge detection method evaluates symmetry in a local neighborhood and uses an adaptive density based threshold to differentiate 3D edge points. We extend this algorithm to propose a novel corner detector that clusters curvature vectors and uses their geometrical statistics to classify a point as corner. We perform rigorous evaluation of the algorithms on RGB-D semantic segmentation and 3D washer models from the ShapeNet dataset and report higher precision and recall scores. Finally, we also demonstrate how our edge and corner detectors can be used as a novel approach towards automatic weld seam detection for robotic welding. We propose to generate weld seams directly from a point cloud as opposed to using 3D models for offline planning of welding paths. For this application, we show a comparison between Harris 3D and our proposed approach on a panel workpiece.
