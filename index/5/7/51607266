Psychological stress and depression are threatening people's health. It is non-trivial to detect stress or depression timely for proactive care. With the popularity of social media, people are used to sharing their daily activities and interacting with friends on social media platforms, making it feasible to leverage online social media data for stress and depression detection. In this talk, we will systematically introduce our work on stress and depression detection employing large-scale benchmark datasets from real-world social media platforms, including 1) stress-related and depression-related textual, visual and social attributes from various aspects, 2) novel hybrid models for binary stress detection, stress event and subject detection, and cross-domain depression detection, and finally 3) several intriguing phenomena indicating the special online behaviors of stressed as well as depressed people. We would also like to demonstrate our developed mental health care applications at the end of this talk.
