Many web pages developed today require navigation by visual interaction-seeing, hovering, pointing, clicking, and dragging with the mouse over dynamic page content. These forms of interaction are increasingly popular as developer trends have moved from static, logically structured pages to dynamic, interactive pages. However, they are also often inaccessible to blind web users who tend to rely on keyboard-based screen readers to navigate the web. Despite existing web accessibility standards, engineering web pages to be equally accessible via both keyboard and visuomotor mouse-based interactions is often not a priority for developers. Improving access to this kind of visual and interactive web content has been a long-standing goal of HCI researchers, but the barriers have proven to be too varied and unpredictable to be overcome by some of the proposed solutions: promoting guidelines and best practices, automatically generating accessible versions of pre-exisiting web pages, or developing human-assisted solutions, such as screen and cursor-sharing, which tend to diminish an end user's agency. In this paper we present a real-time, collaborative approach to helping blind web users overcome inaccessible parts of existing web pages. We introduce *Arboretum*, a new architecture that enables any web user to seamlessly hand off controlled parts of their browsing session to remote users, while maintaining control over the interface via a "propose and accept/reject" mechanism. We illustrate the benefit of Arboretum by using it to implement *Arbility*, a browser that allows blind users to hand off targeted visual interaction tasks to remote crowd workers. We evaluate the entire system in a study with 9 blind web users, showing that Arbility allows them to interact with web content that was previously difficult to access via a screen reader alone.
