The functional approach to data base design is introduced. In this approach the goal of design is to derive a data structure which is capable of supporting a set of anticipated queries rather than a structure which "models the business" in some other way. An operational computer program is described which utilizes the functional approach to design data structures conforming to the Data Base Task Group specifications. The automatic programming technology utilized by this program, although typically used to generate procedure, is here used to generate declaratives.
