High temperature will affect reliability and performance of multicore system. In this paper, we propose a temperature-aware task scheduling algorithm for real-time multi-core systems, which combines the DVFS and energy balancing by analyzing workload information and multicore utilization. At first, calculate average utilization ratio of tasks. Secondly, balancing strategy according to the workload is proposed for uniform temperature distribution on the cores. Finally, adapt the HR-2 and DVFS to scheduling tasks in each core. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm obtains a better effect in temperature and energy-saving than other algorithms.
