These proceedings contain the papers selected for presentation at the Fifth ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society, held in association with the 13th ACM Computer and Communications Security Conference, October 30, 2006, in Alexandria, VA (USA).In response to the call for papers, 39 papers were submitted to the workshop. These papers were evaluated on the basis of their significance, novelty, and technical quality. Each paper was reviewed by at least four members of the program committee. The program committee meeting was held electronically. Nine papers were selected for long presentation at the workshop, and seven were selected for short presentation. Papers received correspondingly long or short space in the proceedings as well. The goal was to accommodate as many interesting and high-quality papers as possible given the available time.
