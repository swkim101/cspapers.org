The TELEBRAS Research & Development Center (CPqD-Telebras) has been developing the TROPICO RA System since 1986. TROPICO is a large SPC telephone exchange, the evolution of which has been divided into a series of phases. From the source system, it is possible to produce different equipment configurations whose capacity ranges from hundreds to tens of thousand of subscribers. The technologies used during the TROPICO RA development have been created in CPqD with the main purpose of rationalizing the system development life cycle. The Sysware Technology (P.A. Mannby, 1988), is a guide to the system functional design where the system functions to be provided are identified and described. These include the operational and maintenance (O&M) functions. The O&Mware technology, also used during the functional design phase, aids the designers to describe the O&M functions. All the functions conceived and described are later implemented using the TROPICO software or hardware technology. In order to support these technologies an integrated system development environment was specially conceived. The O&M development environment is part of this integrated environment and backs up the O&Mware technology.<
