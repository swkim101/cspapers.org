A description is given of some research into well specified real-time database systems which permit analysis of the data access requirements of transactions before run-time. This enables one to do all concurrency control at system build time. Moving the concurrency control away from the run-time environment allows deterministic hard real-time scheduling of database transactions in the real-time system. A complete real-time system design and implementation methodology based on this work is presented.
