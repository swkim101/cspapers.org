This paper presents a model-based systems engineering methodology that can be applied to perform a root cause analysis on transient systems. The methodology extends existing root cause analysis best practice by incorporating system modeling and analysis techniques. The methodology is deployed through a detailed 5-step process to understand, identify, assess, FMEA, and validate potential transient system-level root causes. A transient performance reliability analysis for a dual mode refrigeration system is used to demonstrate how the methodology can be applied. The paper also describes a set of success factors for applying the methodology using a phased approach with a large cross-functional team.Copyright Â© 2004 by ASME
