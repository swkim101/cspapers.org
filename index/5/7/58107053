The Cognitive Radio (CR) technology is an efficient solution to spectrum scarcity by share the spectrum with the secondary users on a non-interfering basis. The spectrum prediction can rationalize the spectrum allocation based on previous information about the spectrum evolution in time. Against previous spectrum prediction algorithm lack of timeliness and accuracy, this paper proposes a novel approach for spectrum prediction based on Optimally Pruned Extreme Learning Machine (OP-ELM) which improved the original Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm. This method not only takes the advantage of the ELM extremely fast speed and good precision, but also more robust and generic with additional steps compared with ELM. In order to compare its comprehensive properties to other algorithms, some experiments were designed. The results show that the predictive performance of this new algorithm is more satisfaction than others in spectrum prediction problem.
