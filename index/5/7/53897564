Los Alamos National Laboratory has developed a virtual patient record system called TeleMed which is based on a distributed national radiographic and patient record repository located throughout the country. Without leaving their offices, participating doctors can view clinical drug and radiographic data via a sophisticated multimedia interface. For example, a doctor can match a patient`s radiographic information with the data in the repository, review treatment history and success, and then determine the best treatment. Furthermore, the features of TeleMed that make it attractive to clinicians and diagnosticians make it valuable for teaching and presentation as well. Thus, a resident can use TeleMed for self-training in diagnostic techniques and a physician can use it to explain to a patient the course of their illness. In fact, the data can be viewed simultaneously by users at two or more distant locations for consultation with specialists in different fields. This capability is of enormous value to a wide spectrum of healthcare providers. It is made possible by the integration of multimedia information using commercial CORBA technology linking object-enabled databases with client interfaces using a three-tiered architecture.
