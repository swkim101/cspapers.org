A Kinect-based rehabilitation training assistant system was devised aims to improve the posture accuracy in limbrecovery rehabilitation for stroke patient with hemiplegia. Kinect features in capturing userâ€™s limb node data, and together with rule of weighted Euclidean distance, this system compares obtained data with the stored standard ones, and then to output the data about the accuracy of rehabilitation postures. It is easy to install, simple to use and low in cost, etc. which may well-assist stroke patients with hemiplegia rehabilitation training. KeywordsKinect; rehabilitation training; DTW algorithm
