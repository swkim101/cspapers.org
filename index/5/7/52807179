I would like to thank the International Symposium on Computer Architecture for selecting “A Processor for a High-Performance Personal Computer” for their 25th anniversary anthology. The editors have asked for a retrospective on the history and genesis of the ideas what influenced the thinking, why were certain decisions made, and the like, reported in this paper. By happy coincidence, I (Ken Pier) already wrote and published, in ISCA 10, “A Retrospective on the Dorado, A High-Performance Personal Computer” [l] with detailed answers to those questions. So I’m going to take the opportunity here to write a more historical, personal, anecdotal, and entertaining (I hope) addition to the description in [l], which may be found at http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/memhers/pier/.
