Active learning is an e ective learning approach. In this paper, we present an intelligent agent assisted environment for active learning. The system is to better support studentcentered, self-paced, and highly interactive learning approach. Students' learning-related pro les, such as learning styles and background knowledge, are used in selecting, organizing, and presenting learning materials. A new approach to course content organization and delivery is being developed based on smart instructional components, which can be integrated into a wide range of courses. The system is being implemented using the prevalent Internet, Web, digital library, and multi-agent technologies.
