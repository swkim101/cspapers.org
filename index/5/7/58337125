A discussion is given on a distributed database application within an intelligent network in some detail, and identifiers and specific type of distributed database system being dealt with. She continues then into illustrating the types of demands which are going to be placed on the IN in its future development. Partial replication is clearly the better type of replication scheme to handle the demands of the IN but its use is inhibited by two factors, those of the method to be used to locate data in the system and the method to be used to update data. Neither of these problems yet have adequate solutions. Future research in this area of the IN should aim towards developing a concurrency and replication control algorithm which suitably updates the data in the system, and a system catalogue which quickly and accurately locates information of the required consistency in the system. These are current active distributed database research areas.
