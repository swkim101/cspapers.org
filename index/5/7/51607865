The paper envisions a scientific discipline of fundamental importance comparable to Physics or Biology, reminding that a discipline of such a contour was originally intended by the founders of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI today, however, is far from such an encompassing discipline sharing the respective research interests with at least half a dozen of other disciplines. After the analysis of this situation and its background we discuss the consequences of this splintering by means of selected challenges. We deliberate thereby what could be done to alleviate the disadvantages resulting from the current state of affairs and to leverage AI's current prominence in the public attention to re-engage in the field's broader mission.
