Building the use-case diagram is a very important task since it represents a transition between the requirements and design phases. However, building such diagram is a time consuming process and needs a complete understanding of the requirements. In this paper, we introduce an approach to derive use case diagrams from an event table. This new approach will facilitate and speed the generation process of the use case diagrams. However, this approach will completely depends on the availability of a comprehensive event table which to be built from the available requirements.
