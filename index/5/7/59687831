It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 20th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation -- PEPM'11. This year's workshop program maintains PEPM's tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on partial evaluation and semantics-based manipulation of programs. We continue to base the call for papers on a broad interpretation of program manipulation and carry on the efforts of recent years to expand the scope of PEPM significantly beyond the traditionally covered areas of partial evaluation and specialization. 
 
The call for papers attracted 35 submissions. The reviewing process and program committee discussions were handled by the EasyChair conference management system. Each submission received at least three reviews, on average 4.1 reviewers, by program committee members assisted by external reviews from over 30 external reviewers. After thorough discussion the program committee accepted 14 regular research papers and 1 tool demonstration. We are excited that the program includes invited talks by Charles Consel, Olivier Danvy and Martin Rinard. Both Consel and Danvy were founders of PEPM, and it is an honor to have them returned to celebrate the 20th anniversary of PEPM.
