The development of Rasch measurement model in social science educational measurement has rapidly expanded to other areas of education including technical and engineering fields. This paper is an attempt of a paradigm shift in testing and evaluation in it education towards bio-based Rasch model. It is believed compatibility exist with the fundamental measurement currently used based on Kuhn's explanation on the role of measurement; in particular, Learning Performance Measurement System (LPMS). These cannot be gleaned from textbooks in engineering science or statistics. Taking the paradigm shift, faculty a, in one of Malaysian institution of higher learning has embarked on the application of Rasch model to measure the achievement of it's Course Learning Outcomes (CLO): decision support system, as a pre-requisite stipulated in the newly enacted Malaysia Qualification Framework, 2005 (MQF). Rasch model tabulates the students; i.e. Person and Items on a distribution map (PIDM) which gives a precise overview of the student's achievement on a linear scale for measurement. Comparative analysis against the traditional histogram tabulation and simple mean shows that Rasch measurement was found to give a better exploratory depth in understanding problems in information technology education. Despite the small sample size, the students were clearly categorized according to the respective cognitive skills hence; CLO's which was structured based on bloom's taxonomy. Subsequently, it is possible to extend this approach in assessment of generic skills in students or professionals. This leads to a new paradigm in assessing competency of individuals using Rasch model.
