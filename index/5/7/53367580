A text might give rise to various projections: a writer, a text and a reader projection. Given the (proclaimed) factuality of a text, the overt or hidden attitudes between the various referents can be inferred, as well as the writers opinion and given the readerâ€™s preferences his or her perception of the whole. Moreover, some sentences might even indicate controversial topics if viewed from a common sense perspective. We introduce an approach based on Description Logics that integrates these various perspectives into a joint model.
