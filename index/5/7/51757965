In this paper, we have proposed a fuzzy based decision making component for high volume traffic MPLS networks, by implementing Traffic Engineering, Quality of Service and Multipath routing. The approach explicitly proves to be successful in solving the issues and challenges pertaining to stability, scalability in high volume and dynamic traffic. Furthermore, it will work to handle congestion by higher link utilization and provides efficient rerouting of traffic along with fault tolerance in the network. In this research work, fuzzy calculations are done for fixing the attributes of the MPLS label(s), which is put on particular packet representing the Forwarding Equivalence Class. Fuzzy controller consists of two sub fuzzy systemsLabel Switched Path setup System (LsS) and Traffic Splitting System (TSS). The computation of dynamic status of Load and Delay is utilized by LsS to arrange the paths in preference order. The attained Link Capacity and Utilization Rate are employing by TSS for maintaining congestion free path. The impact of this is to facilitate, we have better decision making for splitting the traffic for different promising paths. This was apparent from the series of traffic scenarios. Observations are obtained using this realization.
