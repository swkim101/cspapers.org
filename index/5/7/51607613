Spectrum-based fault localization (SFL) correlates a system's components with observed failures. By reasoning about coverage, SFL allows for a lightweight way of pinpointing faults. This abstraction comes at the cost of missing certain faults, such as errors of omission, and failing to provide enough contextual information to explain why components are considered suspicious. We propose an approach, named Q-SFL, that leverages qualitative reasoning to augment the information made available to SFL techniques. It qualitatively partitions system components, and treats each qualitative state as a new SFL component to be used when diagnosing. Our empirical evaluation shows that augmenting SFL with qualitative components can improve diagnostic accuracy in 54% of the considered real-world subjects.
