Secure top-k inner product retrieval allows the users to outsource encrypted data vectors to a cloud server and at some later time find the k vectors producing largest inner products giving an encrypted query vector. Existing solutions suffer poor performance raised by the client's filtering out top-k results. To enable the server-side filtering, we introduce an asymmetric inner product encryption AIPE that allows the server to compute inner products from encrypted data and query vectors. To solve AIPE's vulnerability under known plaintext attack, we present a packing approach IP Packing that allows the server to obtain the entire set of inner products between the query and all data vectors but prevents the server from associating any data vector with its inner product. Based on IP Packing, we present our solution SKIP to secure top-k inner product retrieval that further speeds up retrieval process using sequential scan. Experiments on real recommendation datasets demonstrate that our protocols outperform alternatives by several orders of magnitude.
