The Interactive Wiring System (IWS) is a highly interactive graphic application originally developed for the embedding of overflow wires on cards, boards and other high-level packages. It has since been expanded to support component placement, I/O assignment and service net manipulation. The programs were developed for IBM's internal use and are not marketed by IBM. An overview of how IWS interfaces with the IBM Design Automation System (EDS - Engineering Design System) is followed by a brief description of the IWS model. Representative functions are described as seen by the IWS user. Examples of how IWS has impacted the design process at various IBM locations are included. A separate section briefly addresses the display technology implications of some of the graphical display techniques used by IWS. The paper concludes with a brief description of changes being considered to enhance the flexibility of the IWS model for high-level packages and to allow support of chip-level packages.
