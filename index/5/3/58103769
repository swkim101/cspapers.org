The method for performing adjoint-weighted tallies in MCNP is discussed along with the applications of point kinetics, perturbation theory, and nuclear data sensitivities. Future applications and extensions such as localized adjoint-weighted fluxes, more sophisticated kinetics models, higher-order perturbation theory, and temperature coefficients.
