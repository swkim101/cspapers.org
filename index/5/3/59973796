When the terms ubiquitous computing and privacy have been mentioned together in scientific discourse on what the effect of technology is on society (and vice versa), these terms have been mostly presented as a trade off rather than in a positive relation to each other. This does not have to hold for all cases, ubiquitous computing does not necessarily have the side effect of surveillance and breaches of privacy. We are in fact claiming the opposite that, given the right application, ubiquitous computing can actually help to enhance privacy for people.
