Dance is an inherently embodied activity. The dancer is attuned to the effects of the physical world on her own physicality and the relationship of her presence to other dancers. This research is an investigation into artificially intelligent performing agents and robots and how a human dancer can guide the learning and performance of a robot performer. Using Artificial Neural Networks as the bases for the agentâ€™s computational intelligence, performing agents were created that can perform by collaborating with human dancers through robots.
