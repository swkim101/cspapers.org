A shelving assembly with rectangular, formed sheet metal shelves horizontally supported by tubular corner posts has molded snythetic plastic corner block members operative to releasably grip any one of a plurality of peripheral zones spaced along the support posts for selective shelf height adjustment. Each sheet metal shelf is formed with a peripheral skirt terminating in a horizontally inwardly-extending flange portion and vertical corner cut-out portions defining together recesses for receiving the individual corner blocks in close-fitting embracing, relation, the corner blocks also being formed, at outside corners thereof, with vertically-extending, rounded projections receivable in the said skirt cut-out portions to define with said peripheral skirt, flush, rounded corner surfaces. A tapered, vertically-extending opening in each corner block slidingly receives a complementary split-ring taper lock retainer having a cylindrical opening for the reception of a tubular corner post, said split-ring taper lock having an internal, peripheral bead adapted to engage any one of a plurality of complementary grooves spaced along the corner posts for selective shelf height adjustment.
