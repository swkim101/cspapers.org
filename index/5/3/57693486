A trademark of goal motion complexes such as (1a-b) has to do with their Aktionsart or ‘temporal constituency’: they are telic predicates (cf. Vendler 1957, Dowty 1979, Smith 1991, Krifka 1998). This can be shown, in mereological terms, by the fact that they lack the property of divisibility: that is, a (proper) subpart of a goal motion event can no longer be described by the same sentence. Another trademark of these constructions is that the PP element is an optional complement. Evidence that the PP is a complement in both (1a-b) comes from do-so anaphora, VP-fronting, as well as other tests (Baker 1988:239ff, Radford 1988 i.a.). The basic question we will be concerned with in this paper is: Which PPs go with which verbs? An important postulate underlying this paper is that a large part of the selection process between the V and the PP is semantically determined. Section 2 of this paper discusses the factors influencing PP selection in goal motion constructions. Section 3 provides a formal account in the framework of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG, Pollard and Sag 1994). Our account builds on work using lexical inheritance hierarchies to model the syntax/semantics interaction underlying argument structure (Wechsler 1995, 1997; Davis, 2001; inter alia). We follow these accounts in assuming that specific optional PP complements are not selected in the verbal lexical entries, but rather PP’s can be freely appended to the VALENCE-list of a verb. Whether or not a given PP is licensed depends on the compatibility of its semantic content with that of the verb, a compatibility forced by the compositional semantics. In this paper, we refine these accounts in two important ways: first, we show that part of PP selection is also aspectual, motivating an enriched representation of the content; and second, we show that type coercion (Pustejovsky 1995) is required.
