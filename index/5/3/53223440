Translating data and data access operations between applications and databases is a longstanding data management problem. We present a novel approach to this problem, in which the relationship between the application data and the persistent storage is specified using a declarative mapping, which is compiled into bidirectional views that drive the data transformation engine. Expressing the application model as a view on the database is used to answer queries, while viewing the database in terms of the application model allows us to leverage view maintenance algorithms for update translation. This approach has been implemented in a commercial product. It enables developers to interact with a relational database via a conceptual schema and an object oriented programming surface. We outline the implemented system and focus on the challenges of mapping compilation, which include rewriting queries under constraints and supporting non-relational constructs.
