We propose a new variant of the group activity selection problem (GASP), where the agents are placed on a social network and activities can only be assigned to connected subgroups (gGASP). We show that if multiple groups can simultaneously engage in the same activity, finding a stable outcome is easy as long as the network is acyclic. In contrast, if each activity can be assigned to a single group only, finding stable outcomes becomes computationally intractable, even if the underlying network is very simple: the problem of determining whether a given instance of a gGASP admits a Nash stable outcome turns out to be NP-hard when the social network is a path or a star, or if the size of each connected component is bounded by a constant. We then study the parameterized complexity of finding outcomes of gGASP that are Nash stable, individually stable or core stable. For the parameter `number of activities', we propose an FPT algorithm for Nash stability for the case where the social network is acyclic and obtain a W[1]-hardness result for cliques (i.e., for standard GASP); similar results hold for individual stability. In contrast, finding a core stable outcome is hard even if the number of activities is bounded by a small constant, both for standard GASP and when the social network is a star. For the parameter `number of players', all problems we consider are in XP for arbitrary social networks; on the other hand, we prove W[1]-hardness results with respect to the parameter `number of players' for the case where the social network is a clique.
