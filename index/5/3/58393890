This paper presents a method for carrying out a quantitative evaluation of design concepts with incomplete assessment information. When evaluating design solutions, in addition to consideration of product functionality, quality and cost, product life cycle performance such as maintainability should also be evaluated. Product maintainability issues are one of the more difficult design aspects to evaluate in early design stage. This paper describes specific maintainability metrics for evaluating product maintenance of conceptual design alternatives. Because of the uncertainty associated in early stage design evaluation, the varying degree of customer expectation must be incorporated into the evaluation system. Non-traditional fuzzy sets are used to represent expectations of the customer and compare them to design solution parameters. A case study is presented to illustrate the design method.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
