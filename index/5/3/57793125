A technique for real-time recognition of unconstrained Arabic characters is presented. The proposed technique does not require any constraints of the character forms other than limiting them to a reasonable size and orientation. Structural features, which are more suitable for handwritten character recognition, are selected. Structural features that are independent of the writer style, which are called stable features, use a list of integer values (vector) to describe the character. On the other hand CHAIN CODE is used for other structural features (decisive) that are suitable for more variation of the writer style. A suitable clustering technique is chosen to accomplish the classifier procedure. The algorithm can be extended to cursive words after introducing the additional segmentation stage. >
