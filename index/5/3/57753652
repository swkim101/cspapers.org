The maintenance and inspection of the flooded shafts, specially coal ones, is an important environmental problem. There are thousands of shafts of this type in Europe with the danger of pollution, flood and collapse. This paper presents some of the main ongoing works of the EU project STAMS that develop an autonomous underwater robotic system for periodic monitoring of flooded shafts in hazardous and complex conditions. The accurate navigation is very cluttered at 1.000 m depth conditions, where minimum visibility and unexpected obstacles are some of the difficulties to overcome. We are going beyond classical navigation approaches using only few sensor information. Another innovation is the installation of Reference Points (RPs) in the shaft's walls by the robot using a special fixation mechanism. The specially designed cases of the RPs allow to house specific sensors and help in the navigation, and will be used in periodic monitoring and assessment of the mine shafts. The positioning and attachment of these RPs is another contribution of this paper.
