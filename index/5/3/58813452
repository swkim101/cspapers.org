One of the key objectives of Business Process Modelling is to better understand and visualise business processes in order to improve and/or enact them in some IT infrastructure. This modelling perspective becomes more complicated and challenging with the expansion of businesses across geographical boundaries. Further, this necessitates finding technological solutions to execute agile business processes. And, in an effort to enact business process models using distributed technologies, we present a novel framework for translating business processes modelled using Role Activity Diagramming into generic meta-representation with the objective to access, customize and integrate the modelling constructs with functional and non-functional processing artefacts. In this regard we present meta-models to translate coarse to fine grained process model and provide their relevant implementation as a step towards bridging the gap between Business Process Models and Grid-based Service Oriented Architectures (BPMSOA).
