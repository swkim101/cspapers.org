Mining frequent patterns is a general and important issue in data mining. Complex and unstructured (or semi-structured) datasets have appeared in major data mining applications, including text mining, web mining and bioinformatics. Mining patterns from these datasets is the focus of many of the current data mining approaches. We focus on labeled ordered trees, typical datasets of semi-structured data in data mining, and propose a new probabilistic model and its efficient learning scheme for mining labeled ordered trees. The proposed approach significantly improves the time and space complexity of an existing probabilistic modeling for labeled ordered trees, while maintaining its expressive power. We evaluated the performance of the proposed model, comparing it with that of the existing model, using synthetic as well as real datasets from the field of glycobiology. Experimental results showed that the proposed model drastically reduced the computation time of the competing model, keeping the predictive power and avoiding overfitting to the training data. Finally, we assessed our results using the proposed model on real data from a variety of biological viewpoints, verifying known facts in glycobiology.
