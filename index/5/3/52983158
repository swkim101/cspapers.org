We introduce a novel use for desktop 3D printers using actuators equipped in the printers. The actuators control an extruder and a build-plate mounted on a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer, moving them horizontally or vertically. Our technique enables actuation of 3D-printed objects on the build-plate by controlling the actuators, and people can interact with them by connecting interface devices to the 3D printer. In this work, we describe how to actuate printed objects using the actuators and present several objects illustrated by our technique.
