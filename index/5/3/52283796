This paper introduces techniques for mosquito population surveys in the field using electrified screens (bug zappers) mounted to a UAV. Instrumentation on the UAV logs the UAV path and the GPS location, altitude, and time of each mosquito elimination. Hardware experiments with a UAV equipped with an electrified screen provide real-time measurements of (former) mosquito locations and mosquito-free volumes. Planning a trajectory for the UAV that maximizes the number of mosquito kills is related to the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Lawn Mower Problem and, most closely, Milling with Turn Cost. We reduce this problem to considering variants of covering a grid graph with minimum turn cost, corresponding to optimized energy consumption. We describe an exact method based on Integer Programming that is able to compute provably optimal instances with over 1,500 pixels. These solutions are then implemented on the UAV.
