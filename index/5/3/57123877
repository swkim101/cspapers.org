The preliminary Design of any structure requires the analysis of a certain number of solutions until the desired one is found and before one can proceed to the next step of Design. The objective is to be able to see how the change of a certain number of variables influences the desired state of the structure. A neuroshell network was therefore given the job of learning the behavior of the structure (multi span cable stayed bridge) relying on the certain variables set so one can make use of it for the prediction in case of any other combination of these variables.
