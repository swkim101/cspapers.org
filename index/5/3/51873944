We present a comprehensive understanding of three important problems in PAC preference learning: maximum selection (maxing), ranking, and estimating all pairwise preference probabilities, in the adaptive setting. With just Weak Stochastic Transitivity, we show that maxing requires Î©(n) comparisons and with slightly more restrictive Medium Stochastic Transitivity, we present a linear complexity maxing algorithm. With Strong Stochastic Transitivity and Stochastic Triangle Inequality, we derive a ranking algorithm with optimalO(n log n) complexity and an optimal algorithm that estimates all pairwise preference probabilities.
