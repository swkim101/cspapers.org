There has been a recent increase in the number of real-time embedded systems located in networks. Thus, there is a need not only to meet real-time constraints, but also to strengthen security measures. In addition, component-based software development is expected to improve the development of software for embedded systems. This paper proposes a new security framework for component-based embedded systems that focuses on access control between the components.
