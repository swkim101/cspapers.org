Wearable devices are becoming important computing devices to personal users. They have shown promising applications in multiple domains. However, designing interactions on smartwears remains challenging as the miniature sized formfactors limit both its input and output space. My thesis research proposes a new paradigm of Inherent Interaction on smartwears, with the idea of seeking interaction opportunities from users daily activities. This is to help bridging the gap between novel smartwear interactions and real-life experiences shared among users. This report introduces the concept of Inherent Interaction with my previous and current explorations in the category.
