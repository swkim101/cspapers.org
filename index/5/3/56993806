It is a great pleasure to welcome you all to the ACM SIGCOMM 2004 Workshops!We are pleased to present an outstanding program consisting of four workshops: (1) Future Directions in Network Architecture (FDNA); (2) Network and System Support for Games (NetGames); (3) Practice and Theory of Incentives in Networked Systems (PINS); and (4) Network Troubleshooting: Research, Theory, and Operations Practice Meet Malfunctioning Reality (NetTs).Workshops were first introduced as a part of the ACM SIGCOMM week-long Data Communications Festival in 2003 to enhance the ACM SIGCOMM conference technical program; this is the second year for this effort. In response to the call for proposals, we received 6 workshop proposals, 4 of which were accepted. FDNA, the highly successful workshop from 2003, is repeated for the second year. This is the first year for NetGames, PINS, and NetTs; a key feature of all of these workshops is their outreach to other communities. NetGames -- organized for the first time in conjunction with the ACM SIGCOMM conference -- brings together multimedia and gaming community with networking; PINS (organized in collaboration with ACM SIGecom) crosses the boundaries between economics, game theory, and networking; and NetTs exposes challenges in network operations to networking researchers.Organizing such a diverse set of workshops requires a great deal of effort and organization and I want to thank all the members of the SIGCOMM 2004 organizing committee and several volunteers who made it possible. I would like to thank Craig Partridge, Jennifer Rexford, John Wroclawski, and Jim Kurose for their suggestions and help in soliciting exciting workshop proposals. I also thank the SIGCOMM 2004 organizing committee, and in particular, Raj Yavatkar, Jennifer Rexford, Chris Edmondson-Yurkanan and Joe Touch for all the support and guidance they provided throughout the workshop organization process. The local arrangements for the workshops are a result of efforts of Wu-chang Feng. Prashant Chandra, Andreas Terzis, Marcel Waldvogel, and Allyn Romanow handled the web pages, registration, and publicity for the workshops.
