The low cost simulation of real time computer control of power station plant is intended to be used as a training facility to assist engineers in understanding computer control applications that employ CUTLASS. The features incorporated in the PC based system are: high level engineer orientated language; user friendly man-machine interface; facilities to easily access and modify variables within control loop algorithms; real-time graphics display; concurrent multiple scheme real time capability; and suitable interfaces to CEGB plant. Thus the system provides an environment for an engineer to write schemes that can be used to control the real and simulated plant items provided by the CEGB. The response of the system may be observed graphically and it is possible to tune the control algorithms when in use to obtain the desired response. Access is provided to enable the user to manually set variables which are usually hidden within algorithms such as those used for PID control. >
