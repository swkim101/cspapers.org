One of the main objectives of ubiquitous robots is to proactively provide context-aware intelligent services to assist humans in their professional or daily living activities. One of the main challenges is how to automatically obtain a consistent and correct description of human context such as location, activities, emotions, etc. In this paper, a new hybrid approach for reasoning on the context is proposed. This approach focuses on human activity recognition and consists of machine-learning algorithms, an expressive ontology representation, and a reasoning system. The latter allows detecting the inconsistencies that may appear during the machine learning phase. The proposed approach can also correct automatically these inconsistencies by considering the context of the ongoing activity. The obtained results on the Opportunity dataset demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method to enhance the performance of human activity recognition.
