It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2011 Second International Workshop on MapReduce and Its Applications -- MapReduce'11. The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for discussing recent advances, identifying open issues, introducing developments and tools, and presenting applications and enhancements for MapReduce (or very similar) systems. We therefore cordially invite contributions that investigate these issues, introduce new execution environments, apply performance evaluations and show the applicability to science and enterprise applications. 
 
The call for papers attracted 20 submissions from Asia, Canada, Europe, Africa, and the United States. The program committee accepted 9 papers that cover a variety of topics, including novel MapReduce architectures, new fields of its applications.
