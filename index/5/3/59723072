Welcome to SIGMOD 2008! We think you will find both the conference and the setting to be invigorating. The natural timeless beauty of British Columbia will provide a fitting counterpoint to the dynamism of our field in which large scale, high performance, and ever more intelligent database systems are being conceived and deployed. This dynamism is reflected in our (extreme) keynote presentations, tutorials, research papers, demonstrations, industrial papers, and product presentations. The only unfortunate side of our program is that the five parallel session structure may prevent you from hearing every talk in which you are interested. 
 
The conference statistics give an indication of how SIGMOD's selectivity. Out of 435 submitted research papers, we accepted 78; out of 40 submitted industrial papers, we accepted 15; out of 94 demo submissions, we accepted 30; and out of 15 tutorial submissions, we accepted 5. Reviewing is an imperfect art, so we may have rejected some papers that we should have accepted, but we hope the written reviews have helped authors improve their papers for future submissions. 
 
The main methodological innovation in SIGMOD this year has been the repeatability option. Papers submitting experiments were invited to submit code and data to enable the pioneering members of the repeatability committee to verify that the experiments worked as advertised. Any paper satisfying the repeatability criteria will include the sentence "The results in this paper were verified by the SIGMOD repeatability committee." The goal is to count our field among the repeatable sciences and to pave the way for the archiving of code and data. The response to this initiative has been overwhelmingly positive and we look forward to a greater participation by all members of the community in the future.
