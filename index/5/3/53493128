The forecast of hurricane trajectories is crucial for the protection of people and property, but machine learning techniques have been scarce for this so far. We propose a neural network fusing past trajectory data and reanalysis atmospheric images (wind and pressure 3D fields). We used a moving frame of reference that follows the storm center for the 24h tracking forecast. The network is trained to estimate the longitude and latitude displacement of hurricanes and depressions from a large database from both hemispheres (more than 3000 storms since 1979, sampled at a 6 hour frequency). The advantage of the fusion network is demonstrated and a comparison with current forecast models shows that deep methods could provide a valuable and complementary prediction.
