This paper describes and compares the hardware cost analysis of two newly proposed topologies. The fundamental structure of these architectures is outlined t o help define the number of nodes and the number of links in each architecture. This leads to the derivation of the tot al system costs. Simulation and mathematical modeling of these architectures are presented and the cost comparisons are given in a graphical form which highlights the merits and demerits of each topology.
