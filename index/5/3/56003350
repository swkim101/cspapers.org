Currently RFID is a widely used technique in indoor location. Some related technology and algorithms using active tag for indoor location is studied in this paper. Based VIRE algorithm, an improved location algorithm is proposed by the introduction of a correction mechanism called recursive-calibrate to reach a higher accuracy of location. Simulation are also shown here to prove that the accuracy of localization is improved.
