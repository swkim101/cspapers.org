Optical information processing systems have been widely applied, this paper studies the calculation of the amount of a reduction in the use of genetic algorithms to increase the diversity of the sample algorithm to reduce problems caused by the sample dilution with a resampling method, combined with the finite field resampling, resampling constitute a finite field of genetic algorithms. We using surface to capture the dynamics of template update, to prevent inappropriate tracking results into the template set, pending the outcome of the tracking template is added to the first test for cover. Detect occlusion control template updates. Prevent tracking results of drift.
