In recent years, most sports such as Soccer are recorded during the actual game and analysed later on by the coaches for training their teams to perform better in the future. The training can be in several aspects such as avoiding fouls, injuries, improving passes and tactics. Automatic detection/retrieval of such specific events from the video database will be of great assistance to the coaches. In this paper, we analyse Soccer match videos with the objective to detect two events – players playing or falling. Player falling, often leading to injury can be costly for the players’ health and also the team performance as a whole.
