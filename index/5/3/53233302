For the MDA approach to software development to become a reality for distributed enterprise systems, MDA needs to provide both modeling support for middleware-specific concerns and tool support for helping developers refine their designs along such concern-dimensions at different MDA-levels of abstraction. In order to address these issues, the MDA-compliant Enterprise Fondue method proposes a hierarchy of UML profiles as a means for addressing middleware-specific concerns at different MDA-levels of abstraction, along with model transformations to incrementally refine existing design models according to the proposed profiles. Tool support is provided through the Parallax framework, which enables developers to modularize crosscutting concerns into aspect-promoting Eclipse plug-ins.
