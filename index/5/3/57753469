A new flexible fabric actuator realizing three dimensional movements for wearable devices is proposed in this paper. Such actuators must be lightweight and highly flexible, producing movements with high degree of freedom to assist/follow human natural motions. Improving the structure and control system of a fabric actuator from the previous research, the flexible fabric actuator with continuous control is developed. This paper presents new configuration of thin artificial muscles on a flexible rubber swath, a continuous control system to control the fabric actuator smoothly, and control methods to realize six basic movements of human body (forward and backward bends, left and right bends, left and right twists)with less number of muscles. The experiment results indicate the possibility that the proposed fabric actuator woven thin McKibben artificial muscles is a viable technology for use in wearable devices.
