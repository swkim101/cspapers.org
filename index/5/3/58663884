SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) is not a new concept, indeed it is a software design method which is the combination and enhanced version of various existing software methods. It is rapidly gaining ground, especially as a method to solve the common problems of software re-usability and inter-compatibility. For this reason, SOA is considered to be the optimum alternative for responding the new changes in the business environment. For the successful implementation of a SOA-based system, the composition of the services is essential, and service identification and modeling is the essential starting point of successful implementation of SOA systems. On the other hand, it is a fact that there are neither any standards nor standardized methods for business service modeling. Thus this study proposes a service identification and modeling method for deducting services that fit system purposes, and deducts actual services for agent-based purchase management systems.
