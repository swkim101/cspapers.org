This year a record number of papers were submitted directly to ICRA (1981) and to RA-L with the ICRA option (605). This represents an increase of 4% and 48% over last year respectively - clearly the RA-L/ICRA option is growing in popularity. The long-term average is a growth rate of around 60 papers per year. The submission process accommodated, as much as possible, the hardships inflicted on authors by hurricanes and earthquakes in the days prior to the deadline.
