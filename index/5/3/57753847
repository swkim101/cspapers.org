This paper presents orientation planning algorithms respecting the requirements of task space trajectory generation, particularly in robotics applications. The proposed algorithms fulfill the following conditions: (i) permitting to impose constraints at angular velocity and acceleration in addition to orientation at endpoints; (ii) rendering continuous acceleration profiles even when interpolating multiple orientations; and (iii) being computationally fast enough for realtime implementation. The generated spline trajectories are essentially a concatenation of polynomial in time curves parameterized by quaternion coefficients. To impose the unitariness condition critically required for quaternion representation of orientation, we develop an on-line update mechanism which successively reparameterizes the polynomials constructing the spline, towards suppressing distortions that the normalization operation might incur. Experiments on an anthropomorphic robot upper-body are carried out to demonstrate the efficacy and real-time compatibility of the proposed algorithms in comparison with a standard spherical interpolation method.
