It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 4th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Types in Language Design and Implementation -- TLDI'09. The TLDI workshops are a continuation of the Types in Compilation -- TIC workshops, the first of which was held in 1997. This series of workshops brings together researchers from the many areas influenced by types. The role of types in all aspects of language design, compiler construction, and software development has expanded greatly in recent years. Type systems, type analyses, and formal deduction have led to new concepts in compilation techniques for modern programming languages, verification of safety and security properties of programs, program transformation and optimization, and many other areas. The mission of these workshops is to bring together researchers in all these areas to share novel ideas and stimulate interaction and discussion on the ever expanding use of types. 
 
The call for papers attracted 36 submissions. All submissions were rigorously reviewed by at least three program committee members, with further input from more than 30 external reviewers. The program committee accepted 18 research papers and 2 tool demonstrations. The proceedings also include two invited contributions by Umut Acar and Cristina Cifuentes.
