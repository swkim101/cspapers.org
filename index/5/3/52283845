When a space robot accidentally or voluntarily comes in contact with a target object, a workspace shift happens due to exchange of momentum between the objects. The problem of workspace adjustment is addressed herein. A novel controller is derived to simultaneously adjust the workspace and control the end-effector pose. The controller is based on a center-of-mass (CoM) regulation which fixes the workspace in the inertial space while leaving the base free to move, resulting in fuel efficiency. The control is validated on hardware using a robotic simulator composed of a seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm mounted on a 6DOF moving base.
