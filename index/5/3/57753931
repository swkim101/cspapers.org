Vibro-driven robotic (VDR) systems use stick-slip motions for locomotion. Due to the underactuated nature of the system, efficient design and control are still open problems. We present a new energy preserving design based on a spring-augmented pendulum. We indirectly control the friction-induced stick-slip motions by exploiting the passive dynamics in order to achieve an improvement in overall travelling distance and energy efficiency. Both collocated and non-collocated constraint conditions are elaborately analysed and considered to obtain a desired trajectory generation profile. For tracking control, we develop a partial feedback controller for the driving pendulum which counteracts the dynamic contributions from the platform. Comparative simulation studies show the effectiveness and intriguing performance of the proposed approach, while its feasibility is experimentally verified through a physical robot. Our robot is to the best of our knowledge the first nonlinear-motion prototype in literature towards the VDR systems.
