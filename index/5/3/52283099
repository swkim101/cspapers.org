In this paper we address the problem of controlling a robotic system mounted on an actuated floating base for space applications. In particular, we investigate the stability issues due to the low rate of the base control unit. We propose a passivity-based stabilizing controller based on the time domain passivity approach. The controller uses a variable damper regulated by a designed energy observer. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated on a base-manipulator multibody simulation.
