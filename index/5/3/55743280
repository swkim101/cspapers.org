Personnel motivation is an important aspect to consider building a successful organization especially in the highly technological sector as the software engineering is. The paper continues discussion on projects that are established specially to motivate personnel and which were proposed in one of our earlier papers. Here reasons and drivers of those projects are revised. The learning factor is proposed to be used selecting workers to be included into personnel motivating projects. Thereafter some important factors to ensure success are considered. This discussion is continued by describing risks that can occur during those projects or after those are finished and several methods to avoid unwanted consequences are shown.
