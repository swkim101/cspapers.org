This paper presents a hole-filling method for irregular model to restore the geometrical features of the irregular model surface. Fuzzy inference system (FIS) is adopted and is described in detail. The main idea is that the boundary of the hole is first determined and holes of irregular model are repaired by FIS based on human experiences. The experimental results show that the repairing strategy can recover the modelâ€™s shape effectively
