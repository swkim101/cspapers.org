Summary form only given, as follows. Security has become a key feature of connected devices. Indeed, IoT botnets (Mirai, Hajinie, etc.) have shown up. Proofs of concept of worms propagating from device to device have been disclosed. There is in addition a suspicion regarding backdoors in IoT devices (recall Spectre, Meltdown, TL-Bleed, etc.) A key question is thus: "how to secure a connected device?" In this talk, I'll explain what it means for device to be secure, and how to actually design such secure device. In a product, security is actually pervasive, as it encompasses all the steps of the product life cycle. Security also requires a clear formalization to avoid "weakest links." I'll introduce a methodology to secure a device, based on the triangle: security-by-design, test & evaluation, and independent certification.
