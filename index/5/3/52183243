It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Third ACM Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media – SocialNLP’15, associated with WWW 2015. SocialNLP is a new inter-disciplinary area of natural language processing (NLP) and social computing. There are three plausible directions of SocialNLP: (1) addressing issues in social computing using NLP techniques; (2) solving NLP problems using information from social media; and (3) handling new problems related to both social computing and natural language processing.
