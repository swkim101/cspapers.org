This paper presents Mindgame, a reinforcement learning optimized neurofeedback mindfulness system. To avoid the potential bias and difficulties of designing mapping between neural signal and output, we adopt a trial-and-error learning method to explore the preferred mapping. In a pilot study we assess the effectiveness of Mindgame in mediating people's EEG alpha band. All participants' alpha band change towards the desired direction.
