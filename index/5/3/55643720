Smartcards are becoming increasingly popular as a means for personal identification and authentication in many secure application areas such as e-Banking and e-Commerce. Millions of users have a smart card in their pocket without even knowing it. The SecFuNet project proposes solutions for integrating secure microcontrollers in order to develop a security framework for Cloud Computing and virtual environment. This framework introduces, among its many services: authentication and authorization functions for virtual environments, based on Remote Grid of Secure Elements (RG0SE). The objective is to implement an open standard framework, based on smart cards and OpenSSL. This framework provides TLS secure channels for establishing trust relationships among Users, Virtual Machines (VMs), Hypervisor (XEN) and RG0SE. The authentication is done directly between smart cards (owned by users or associated to VM) and SecFuNet Identity Management (IdM). This framework concerns a highly secure authentication with secure microcontrollers allowing users' (or VMs') strong mutual authentication with SecFuNet Services and provides some libraries to the developers. It defines and describes the features and the modules added to OpenSSL in order to supply easily the Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) -described by the ISO 7816 standard -transferred to smart cards.
