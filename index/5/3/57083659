As the scale of modern smart grid gets larger and larger, fast analysis and calculation of power grid is an important research topic now. Starting with analyzing and comparing the traditional power system block methods, a partition strategy is proposed which contains buffer subsystem in each partition. Mutual impedance element in the node impedance matrix could describe the strength of electrical contact between nodes. The buffer subsystem is obtained which has a greater impact on the internal network setting calculation based on electrical contact. Further more, the general rules of buffer subsystem which is suitable for setting calculation have been put forward. At last, it can widely improve the adaptability of setting calculation block computing.
