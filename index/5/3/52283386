In this paper we categorise swarming into four classes, depending on the manner in which swarm members communicate. We identify two of these classes as ready candidates for the provision of communications within tactical defence networks in which radio-frequency communications are highly contested or denied. We demonstrate the feasibility of a swarm-robotics approach to data ferrying from both of these classes using simulation, emulation, and physical swarm robotic platforms within indoor flight facilities. The results show strong alignment between data dissemination capabilities of the simulated and physical systems; we envisage these techniques providing communications between not only troops, but also other swarm robotic platforms, thereby enabling swarm robotics applications and human-swarm interaction within harsh communications environments.
