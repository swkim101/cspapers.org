For wheeled mobile systems, the wheel odometry is an important source of information about the current motion of the vehicle. It is used e.g. in the context of pose estimation and self-localization of planetary rovers, which is a crucial part of the success of planetary exploration missions. Depending on the wheel-soil interaction properties, wheel odometry measurements are subject to inherent errors such as wheel slippage. In this paper, a parameter-based approach for whole-body slip modeling and calibration is applied to a four-wheeled lightweight rover system. Details on the method for slip parameter calibration as well as the system-specific implementation are given. Experimental results from a test campaign on Mt. Etna are presented, showing significant improvements of the resulting wheel odometry measurements. The results are validated during a long range drive of approx. 900 m and discussed w. r. t. the advantages but also limitations of the method within a space exploration scenario.
