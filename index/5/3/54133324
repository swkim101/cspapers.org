The enormous growth of the World Wide Web in recent years has made it important to develop document discovery mechanisms based on intelligent and focused crawling techniques. The next-generation Web, the Semantic Web, that is currently being developed as a meta Web, building on the existing one, changes the classical crawling task. Metadata that is based on ontologies will exist distributed fragments over the Web. Thus, means for the intelligent and ontology-focused metadata discovery are required. In this paper we propose a comprehensive framework for ontology-focused crawling of Web documents and RDF-based relational metadata in parallel. The framework includes means for adding a lexical layer to RDF(S)-based ontologies and metadata, relevance computation strategies, an implementation and an empirical evaluation that has shown promising results.
