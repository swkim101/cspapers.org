It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the ACM HPC-GECO/CompFrame 2007 Workshop. This is the second year that the two organizations, HPC Grid Programming Environments and Components and CompFrame have joined together to organize a workshop on component and framework technologies in high-performance scientific computing, building on earlier independent workshops. This workshop series is intended to foster discussions and build an international community of those who are developing and using such technologies by sharing experiences and ideas in an open forum. 
 
Component and framework technology is already mainstream in desktop and network-based computing environments, but it has lagged in the high-performance computing (HPC) community. The reasons for this stem partly from a general lack of awareness of component concepts in the community, but mostly from the fact that established component models do not adequately support characteristics that computational scientists consider crucial. However, when these issues are addressed, the evidence shows that component and framework approaches can bring to the HPC professionals the same kinds of benefits they already provide to other communities, including: better scaling of software development with the number of developers, easier reuse and interoperability of software, higher productivity in software and application development, and better management of large, complex software systems. 
 
The papers in this year's workshop cover a range of topics important to the development and deployment of component technologies in HPC, including frameworks and architectures, development tools, performance and reliability, communications paradigms, component composition, and scientific applications, and represent but a sampling of the many developments underway in this community.
