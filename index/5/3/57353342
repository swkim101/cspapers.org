At the present day core infrastructure and the whole society is dependent on information technology. IT has, however, caused unexpected and increased troubles in information systems. The economical losses caused by faulty software and failing information systems are enormous. This research estimates the general level of problems based on the number of information system failures reported in the media. Features of nowadays infrastructure, coupled and interconnected systems, require accurate design. However, we found that systems fail too often because of a lack of comprehensive system design and dependability. We found that almost half of problems reported in media relate to issues inside the information systems. Solely one quarter is caused by people and a third of problems are related to environment and community.
