Matchmaking is the basis of doing service discovery and composition. Using ontology semantically express the service of capabilities, correctly match service. Domain ontology and Formal Concept Analysis aim at modeling concept. The role of FCA in ontology engineering is supporting reusing independently developed domain ontology. Evaluating concept similarity identifies the different concepts that are semantically close. In this paper, using concept and attribute of web services to construct the ontology. Also, an ontology based method for assessing similarity between FCA concepts is proposed.
