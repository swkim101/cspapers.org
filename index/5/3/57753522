Lung cancer is the deadliest form of cancer, and early diagnosis is critical to favorable survival rates. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer typically requires needle biopsy. Common lung nodule biopsy approaches either carry significant risk or are incapable of accessing large regions of the lung, such as in the periphery. Deploying a steerable needle from a bronchoscope and steering through the lung allows for safe biopsy while improving the accessibility of lung nodules in the lung periphery. In this work, we present a method for extracting a cost map automatically from pulmonary CT images, and utilizing the cost map to efficiently plan safe motions for a steerable needle through the lung. The cost map encodes obstacles that should be avoided, such as the lung pleura, bronchial tubes, and large blood vessels, and additionally formulates a cost for the rest of the lung which corresponds to an approximate likelihood that a blood vessel exists at each location in the anatomy. We then present a motion planning approach that utilizes the cost map to generate paths that minimize accumulated cost while safely reaching a goal location in the lung.
