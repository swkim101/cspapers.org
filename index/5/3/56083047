This paper aims to offer scientists and engineers some support in their translation of scientific discourse. As a practical branch of English, scientific English has always played important roles in the development of all countries, such as exchanging technological information, accelerating scientific communications, broadening and deepening (bi/) multilateral cooperation across the world. For various reasons, however, problems with the translation of scientific discourse exist in large numbers, which is not conducive to the input of advanced western science and technology into China or the other way. Within the framework of information dualism, namely, “information equivalency” and “information transitivity”, combining the linguistic and extra-linguistic factors, the author of this paper has designed a practical, easyto-handle translation mode for scientific discourse, which should prove to be of great help to scientists with respect to acquiring scientific information, and, accordingly, improving their work efficiency.
