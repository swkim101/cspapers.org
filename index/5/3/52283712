Robots, either made from hard or soft materials, are being used increasingly for unknown object manipulation tasks in unstructured environments. To hold an object firmly and do the required task, the orientation of the object with respect to the robotic hand gripper is one of the necessary key information. Humans can sense the orientation of an object based on vision, kinesthetic sensation, or touch sensation. Similarly, robots shall also be able to estimate grasped object orientation just based on tactile sensing without knowing manipulator kinesthetic or kinematics. Existing sensors are mostly based on vision or rigid inertial measurement units (such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers), which require additional setup and are typically not compliant with the arbitrary surfaces of the unknown obj ects. This paper discusses a new approach for object orientation estimation from a multilayered tactile sensor based on conductive silver ink and conductive fabric. Fabric based sensors are flexible and can confer to both hard and soft surfaces. Experimental results show that the tactile sensor developed is able to estimate the tilt angle without any information about manipulator kinematics.
