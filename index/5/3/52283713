Subretinal injection is a delicate and complex microsurgery, which requires surgeons to inject the therapeutic substance in a pre-operatively defined and intra-operatively updated subretinal target area. Due to the lack of subretinal visual feedback, it is hard to sense the insertion depth during the procedure, thus affecting the results of surgical outcome and hindering the widespread use of this treatment. This paper presents a novel approach to estimate the 3D position of the needle under the retina using the information from microscope-integrated Intraoperative Optical Coherence Tomography (iOCT). We evaluated our approach on both tissue phantom and ex-vivo porcine eyes. Evaluation results show that the average error in distance measurement is $4.7 \mu \text{m}$ (maximum of $16.5 \mu \text{m})$. We furthermore, verified the feasibility of the proposed method to track the insertion depth of needle in robot-assisted subretinal injection.
