A brassiere including a pair of bust supporting cups having an outer panel means and an inner segment, an underbust band assembly, a pair of back band portions, and a pair of shoulder straps connected to the cups and to the back band portions. The generally crescent-shaped inner segments extend from the top of each cup to the lower central area of the cup such that when strain is exerted from the force of the breasts, the inner segments are activated and function to reshape the breast and avoid distorting and misshaping the outer cup panel means.
