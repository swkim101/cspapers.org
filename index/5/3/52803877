Introduction I fiddle with topics in the syllabus, edit demos and presentations and entertain myself with fun slide transitions. And yet, inevitably, I must accept that most of what my students learn and remember from my course comes from the assignments. Great assignments are hard to dream up and time-consuming to develop. With that in mind, the Nifty Assignments session is all about promoting and sharing the ideas and ready-to-use materials of successful assignments.
