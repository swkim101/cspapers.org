Higher Learning Education fails to deliver undergraduates with employability skills. The objective of this research is to identify challenges in the current practice of teaching Software Engineering at the undergraduate level in Requirement Engineering. As a conclusion, the steps of Project-Based Learning (PjBL) are produced as well as mechanism for educators in their delivery to assist students in enhancing their skill. The skills will be enhanced from the elicitation process until the management of requirement which students can easily apply in their employability skills. Future work will discuss on the analysis of the weaknesses in the current Requirement Engineering practices.
