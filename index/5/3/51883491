Humanoidsâ€™ abilities to navigate stairs and uneven terrain make them well-suited for disaster response efforts. However, humanoid navigation in such environments is currently limited by the capabilities of navigation planners. Such planners typically consider only footstep locations, but planning with palm contacts may be necessary to cross a gap, avoid an obstacle, or maintain balance. However, considering palm contacts greatly increases the branching factor of the search, leading to impractical planning times for large environments. In previous work we explored using library-based methods to address difficult navigation planning problems requiring palm contacts, but such methods are not efficient when navigating an easy-to-traverse part of the environment. To maximize planning efficiency, we would like to use discrete planners when an area is easy to traverse and switch to the library-based method only when traversal becomes difficult. Thus, in this paper we present a method that 1) Plans a guiding torso path which accounts for the difficulty of traversing the environment as predicted by learned regressors; and 2) Decomposes the guiding path into a set of segments, each of which is assigned a motion mode (i.e. a set of feet and hands to use) and a planning method. Easily-traversable segments are assigned a discrete-search planner, while other segments are assigned a library-based method that fits existing motion plans to the environment near the given segment. Our results suggest that this segmentation approach greatly outperforms standard discrete planning and that using the library-based method for more difficult segments gives a benefit over using discrete planning.
