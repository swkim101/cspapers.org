Text recognition is one of the key technologies in an intelligent system. By means of highly effective extraction of the 7 typical features of characters, we dramatically shorten the time spent on feature extraction in this research. Then we built a membership function based on multidimensional normal distribution by utilizing normalized eigenvalue; and finally, we applied maximum membership principle (MMP)-based recognition technology to character recognition. The result indicates that this approach has evidently reduced the time and complexity of calculation while it was still able to maintain high accuracy of recognition.
