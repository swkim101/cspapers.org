The speech will first introduce the actions that EU is conducting in the field of Satellite Navigation (Galileo, etc.) and that are the base for the creation of a collaboration centre in Vietnam. Then it will focus on some of the most recent activities that have been jointly carried on by European and Vietnamese institutions in the field of satellite navigation and positioning. In particular, the first results of SEAGAL, a project co-funded by the Galileo Supervisory Authority of the European Commission, will be presented. The project aims to set up a Collaboration Centre on Satellite Navigation in Hanoi aiming at fostering cooperation on technology transfer, research and education between Europe and South East Asia.
