Today electronic communications have become the prime medium for people to express their opinions and influence the policy preferences. One such popular channel reflecting the voice of the masses is electronic petitions. To understand people's perspective on various issues it is important to know what petitions say. However, due to the sheer volume of the petitions it is difficult to process each petition manually. As each petition talks about a different issue, prioritizing on over other is difficult. To alleviate these challenges, we present an end to end system for generating comprehensive and concise summaries from e-petitions. A petition contains multiple aspects, the core problem, evidence(s) in support of the problem and potential solutions. Therefore, it is imperative that an useful summary should contain information about all these three aspects explicitly. To achieve this, our system generates three aspect based summaries for each petition for better understanding. We also introduce a new annotated petition dataset, developed through crowd-sourcing, that served as gold standard. Our model is tested through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
