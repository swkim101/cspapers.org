Performant network management platforms have a distributed architecture of diverse agents, which are highly specialized in monitoring connection nodes, communication links, computing systems, and business applications along with their supporting services. However, managing enterprise networks is mainly characterized by "thresholding" solutions, where device or application events are monitored, logged, and filtered through predefined threshold levels. It seems that the challenge raised by Marshall Rose, author of the Internet management protocol, a few years ago, remains actual (Rose 1993), and that there is still a tremendous need for "thinkers", or management tools that can turn "data into information".
