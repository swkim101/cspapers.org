Efficient network resource utilization is crucial in the field of Virtual Network Embedding (VNE). The diversity of virtual topologies belong to various services providers (SPs) severely affects the efficiency of VNE algorithms and fairness between SPs. To achieve high resource utilization of the physical substrate network and leverage repeatable features in virtual machine deployment, this paper proposes a VNE algorithm with a pre-pruning mechanism to virtual topologies. Before embedding a virtual network of a SP, if the virtual topology is too complex, i.e. has too many virtual nodes or high connectivity, such mechanism will reconfigure the topology to reduce complexity under the premise to guarantee isomorphism. Then the algorithm will felicitously map the virtual network onto substrate network through a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based process. Simulation results show that due to the pre-pruning procedure the algorithm can achieve high revenue to cost ratio and more fairness than traditional VNE algorithms.
