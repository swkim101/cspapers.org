It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the The Fourth ACM Workshop on Security of Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks (SASN 2006), held in Hilton Alexandria Mark Center, Alexandria, VA, USA October 30, 2006. This year's workshop continues its tradition of being one of the premier forums for presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of ad hoc and sensor network security.The program committee accepted 16 papers, 7 30-minute presentation papers and 9 15-minute presentation papers. They cover a variety of topics, including trust, access control, privacy, secure routing, secure data aggregation and transmission, attacks and countermeasures, broadcast authentication and key management. In addition, the program includes a panel on security in ad-hoc and sensor networks. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for security researchers and developers.
