This volume contains the papers prepared for the 31 st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, held 22-26 June 1993 at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The cluster of papers in the final section stems from the student session, featured at the meeting for the 3rd successive year and testifying to the vigor of this emerging tradition.The number and quality of submitted papers was again gratifying, and all authors deserve our collective plaudits for the efforts they invested despite the well-known risks of submitting to a highly selective conference. It was their efforts that once again ensured a Meeting (and Proceedings) reflecting the highest standards in computational linguistics, offering a tour of some of the most significant recent advances and most lively research frontiers.In an effort to increase the fairness of reviewing, we opted for "blind" reviewing this year. Also, to reduce the load upon program committee members to a more humanly manageable level, to curtail frantic last-minute searches for specialist reviewers, and to allow more methodical, uniform, interactive reviewing of submissions, the size of the program committee was expanded this year to include 22 members besides the chair. The load was still heavy, but the committee members performed their duties in an exemplary fashion; in the five-week reviewing period which culminated in the one-day program committee meeting, they spared no efforts to arrive at detailed, accurate and principled assessments, and at the best possible program for the Meeting.
