Current caches are not adequate for vector operations. A new kind of support for vector operations, called prefetch unit, is designed to improve the performance of the scalar (SISD) processors. The prefetch unit can be used for any SISD architecutre and also for many kinds of MIMD architectures. It may run in parallel and asynchronously with other parts of processor. It keeps trace of the history of memory references, and initializes rarely any superfluous prefetches.
