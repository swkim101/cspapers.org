This paper presents a class library dedicated to digital image processing which provides resources for essential digital image processing operations. Besides its practical value, the class library is used to teach both object-oriented software engineering methodology and digital image processing. The resulting module can be accessed from independent specialized applications through its public interface while its implementation details are perfectly encapsulated. First of all it is used as the inner part of an integrated environment designed for students and researchers in the field of digital image processing. This software component was built aiming for both portability and extendibility. It contains attributes and methods that allow for a wide range of digital image processing algorithms: point and geometric operations; filter, edge detection, segmentation and texture operations; and fast Fourier transforms, discrete cosine transforms, and wavelet and Gabor transformations. All these can be used for image enhancement, restoration, compression, analysis, and synthesis.
