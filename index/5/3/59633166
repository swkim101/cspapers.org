Model-Driven Engineering and Component-Based Software Engineering are two major software engineering technologies used to develop complex software applications and systems. They raise the level of design abstraction, enable the construction of software systems from large software building blocks, and hold considerable promise of large-scale reuse. This paper describes a design framework that aims to further improve software design automation and validation by seamlessly integrating domain-specific modeling and software components. Pilots of this framework with service providers in the domain of mobile services showed substantial improvement in software development productivity.
