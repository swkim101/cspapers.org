The article introduces essential method to realize the high accuracy and velocity FIR filter by FPGA. Proposes the FIR filter optimization scheme design of serial shifts based on FPGA. Avoided the shortcoming of the traditional parallel algorithm module taking the massive hardware resources . And give 11-order and 8-bits low pass filter design as the specific research object. Realized the partial functions which the traditional numeral FIR filter cannot.May adjusts the filter exponent number conveniently and suits different application.
