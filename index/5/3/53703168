The Thompson Sampling exhibits excellent results in practice and it has been shown to be asymptotically optimal. The extension of Thompson Sampling algorithm to the Switching Multi-Armed Bandit problem, proposed in [13], is a Thompson Sampling equiped with a Bayesian online change point detector [1]. In this paper, we propose another extension of this approach based on a Bayesian aggregation framework. Experiments provide some evidences that in practice, the proposed algorithm compares favorably with the previous version of Thompson Sampling for the Switching Multi-Armed Bandit Problem, while it outperforms clearly other algorithms of the state-of-the-art.
