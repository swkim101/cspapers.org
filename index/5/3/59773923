SWAN project (Adaptive and Navigating Web Server) aims to design adaptive web servers for on-line multimedia information systems about nautical publications. It is a joined project between the IASC laboratory and a private company called Atlantide. The project is funded by the west region council and supported by the French naval hydrographic and oceanographic service. In on-line information systems, users used to only access a fragment of information space according to their current goal. User’s goals can provide navigation help. In our framework, user modelling is based on stereotypes and more precisely on prototypical user’s tasks and on user’s class. It also uses a domain model, an individual user’s model and the navigation context features. The content and presentation adaptation is achieved by the user’s class. The task model is used to design navigation processes, to define views of hyperspace. The task model structures the information access to make the navigation easier. A task determines the relevant portion of the domain model available in a particular geographical area - due to the structural organisation of nautical publications. The goals of adaptation, adaptation technologies, user features, strategy to define spatial views depend on the current task.
