Visual active tracking (VAT) aims at following a target object by autonomously controlling the motion system of a tracker given visual observations. In this paper, we propose a novel method which adopts an asymmetric dueling mechanism for learning visual active tracking, namely AD-VAT. In AD-VAT, the target and the tracker are mutual opponents, i.e. , the tracker manages to lockup the target, and the target tries to escape from the tracker. In the implementation, both the tracker and the target are approximated by deep networks, and their policies that map environment observations to control actions can be learned via reinforcement learning in an end-to-end manner. The tracker and the target are asymmetric in observations, network structures and reward functions. Different from the tracker, the target is modeled with a tracker-aware network, i.e. , besides its own observation, the tracker’s observations and actions are also fed as input to the network. In addition, it learns to predict the tracker’s reward as an auxiliary task. We argue that such an asymmetric adversarial mechanism is able to learn a stronger target, which vice versa induces a more robust tracker. The experimental results, in both 2D and 3D environments, demonstrate that the proposed method leads to a faster convergence in training the tracker and more robust tracking behaviors in different testing scenarios.
