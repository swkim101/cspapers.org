This paper describes the design of a new integrity risk prediction/monitoring methodology for robot localization that uses feature extraction and data association algorithms. The work specifically addresses incorrect association faults when employing a local nearest neighbor data association algorithm. This approach is more efficient and easier to implement than previous work. The methodology is tested in simulation, showing that the computed upper bound on integrity risk is a performance metric capable of providing warnings when the safety of the system cannot be guaranteed.
