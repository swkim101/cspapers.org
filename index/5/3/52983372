Edge clouds are an attractive platform to support latency-sensitive applications by providing computations on servers deployed close to end-users. These servers aim to employ MPTCP to leverage multiple connections including wireless over a public network. In this paper, we show that the default MPTCP design does not adequately support reliability in these environments, which makes it unfit for use in edge clouds. We propose RAMPTCP, an extension to MPTCP which focuses on adding reliability over network paths.
