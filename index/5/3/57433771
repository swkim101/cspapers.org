We describe a means of sharing the DSA signature function, so that two parties can efficiently generate a DSA signature with respect to a given public key but neither can alone. We focus on a certain instantiation that allows a proof of security for concurrent execution in the random oracle model, and that is very practical. We also briefly outline a variation that requires more rounds of communication, but that allows a proof of security for sequential execution without random oracles.
