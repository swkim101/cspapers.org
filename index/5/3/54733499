There is an emerging focus on real-time data stream analysis on mobile/ubiquitous devices. A wide range of data stream processing applications are targeted to run on mobile handheld devices with limited computational capabilities such as patient monitoring, driver monitoring, providing real-time analysis and visualization for emergency calls, optimization of logistics for courier pick-up and delivery etc. In this paper, we present the first generic toolkit for mobile data mining. The Open Mobile Miner (OMM) toolkit is easy to use, can be deployed on a range of mobile devices, is extensible and can be customized for application specific needs. A video of the system in operation for three different settings is available at: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~shonali/OMM/OMMVideoDemo. asf and can be viewed using Windows Media Playerâ„¢.
