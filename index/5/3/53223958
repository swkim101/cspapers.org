Our main result is a reduction from worst-case lattice problems such as SVP and SIVP to a certain learning problem. This learning problem is a natural extension of the 'learning from parity with error' problem to higher moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the learning problem implies a <i>quantum</i> algorithm for SVP and SIVP. A main open question is whether this reduction can be made classical.Using the main result, we obtain a public-key cryptosystem whose hardness is based on the worst-case quantum hardness of SVP and SIVP. Previous lattice-based public-key cryptosystems such as the one by Ajtai and Dwork were only based on unique-SVP, a special case of SVP. The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous cryptosystems: the public key is of size <i>Õ</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) and encrypting a message increases its size by <i>Õ</i>(<i>n</i>)(in previous cryptosystems these values are <i>Õ</i>(<i>n</i><sup>4</sup>) and <i>Õ</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>), respectively). In fact, under the assumption that all parties share a random bit string of length <i>Õ</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>), the size of the public key can be reduced to <i>Õ</i>(<i>n</i>).
