It is claimed sedentariness is as much a threat to long- term health as smoking or unhealthy eating, and is not mitigated by bursts of physical activity. Desk bound office workers are particularly vulnerable to this risk, given the inherently sedentary nature of their roles. To tackle this problem in HCI, we have focused largely on smartphones apps whilst embracing a general trend towards automating data collection of behavior. We argue that placing technologies in the environment, leveraging ambient displays and Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs), can offer a more effective approach for tackling sedentary behaviors in an office environment. We include a brief design of a device we intend to use to evaluate these ideas.
