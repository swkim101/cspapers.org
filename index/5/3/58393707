This volume contains all papers presented at the 11th Annual ACM DRM Workshop 2011, sponsored by the ACM SIGSAC and held in conjunction with the 18th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CSS) in Chicago, USA. The full-day workshop consisted of informal discussions, invited talks and peer-reviewed technical talks describing recent research contributions to the area of Digital Rights Management. 
 
As in previous years, the DRM workshop provided an interdisciplinary bridge between different research areas that span the landscape of DRM, including cryptography, system security, law and economy. This year we were delighted to have two invited talks, one covering legal aspects of DRM, given by Bruce Boyden from the Marquette University Law School, and one covering technical aspects, given by Brendan Traw from Intel. In addition, the DRM workshop featured two sessions containing technical contributions on novel DRM applications and on technological foundations. 
 
We hope that you will find this program interesting and that the workshop will provide you with opportunities to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.
