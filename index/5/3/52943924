Wearable toolkits simplify the integration of micro-electronics into fabric. They require basic knowledge about electronics for part interconnections. This technical aspect might be perceived as a barrier. We propose YAWN, a bus-based, modular wearable toolkit that simplifies the interconnection by relying on a pre-fabricated three-wire fabric band. This allows quick reconfiguration, ensures washability, and reduces the number of connection problems.
