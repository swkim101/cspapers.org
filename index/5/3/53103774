Conventional IoT infrastructure deployments require complex configurations and management at the sensor devices, gateway and the backend levels. We have developed a smart ontology-driven IoT platform which can significantly improve the scalability and efficiency of the deployment and management of large-scale IoT infrastructures. The platform provides a unified ontology management layer across the sensor devices, IoT gateway and IoT backend. It also provides a virtualization-based IoT gateway which supports the interoperability of sensor devices with heterogeneous network protocols.
