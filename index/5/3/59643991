It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 3rd International Workshop on Collaborative Information Retrieval (CIR2011). The first workshop focused on broad topics and sought to establish a vocabulary for discussion about collaborative information seeking, to identify work practices and disciplines that might benefit from collaborative information seeking, and to establish a community of researchers with related interests. The second workshop built on the previous results, and focused on issues of communication and awareness in support of collaborative information seeking. In this third workshop we focus on algorithmic and other software issues related to collaborative information seeking. We would like to explore a variety of algorithms for mediating collaboration, look at the design of frameworks and toolkits to support collaborative information seeking, and also to examine how different user interface elements can be used to support associated activity.
