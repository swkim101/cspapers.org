Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology is emerging as the most promising solution to meet the multi-fold demand increase for mobile data. Very short wavelength, high directionality, together with sensitivity to rampant blockages and mobility, however, render state-of-the-art mmWave technologies unsuitable for ubiquitous wireless coverage. In this work, we design and implement UbiG - a mmWave wireless access network - that can deliver ubiquitous gigabits per second wireless access consistently to the commercial-off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11ad devices. UbiG has two key design components: (1) a fast probing based beam alignment algorithm that can identify the best beam consistently with guaranteed latency in a mmWave link, and the algorithm scales well even with a very large number of beams; and (2) an infrastructure-side predictive ranking based fast access point switching algorithm to ensure seamless gigabits per second connectivity under mobility and blockage in a dense mmWave deployment. Our IEEE 802.11ad testbed experiments show that UbiG performs close to an "Oracle" solution that instantaneously knows the best beam and access point for gigabits per second data transmission to users.
