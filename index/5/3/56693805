For several years now there has been a general discontent with the process of designing and producing software and the quality of the products delivered. This is one of the most important problems currently facing the software community at large. A response to this crisis has been the emergence of the discipline called Software Engineering. Modern software engineering activities work in concert towards the achievement of preset software engineering goals (maintainability, correctness, reusability, etc.) that, if attained, will lessen the effects of the software crisis. A number of software engineering principles have already been identified that contribute to the achievement of these goals: modular decomposition, encapsulation, step-wise refinement, information hiding, etc.
