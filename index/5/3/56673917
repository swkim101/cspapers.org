Veins/SUMO ecosystem, capable of modeling and simulating RIS-based mmWave communications in a vehicular environment. We exploit CoopeRIS to perform an initial feasibility study, highlighting the challenges ahead and the performance RISs need to deliver in order to enable this type of communication. In addition we propose a method to combine multiple RIS configurations into a single one to enable multi-user service delivery, showing its performance via CoopeRIS. The insights we presents within this work show the potential of such simulation framework and thus how the community can build further research work on top if it.
