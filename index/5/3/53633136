This paper presents an approach to promote the integrity of perception systems for outdoor unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) operating in challenging environmental conditions (presence of dust or smoke). The proposed technique automatically evaluates the consistency of the data provided by two sensing modalities: a 2D laser range finder and a millimetre-wave radar, allowing for perceptual failure mitigation. Experimental results, obtained with a UGV operating in rural environments, and an error analysis validate the approach.
