User's behavioral biometrics are promising as authentication factors in particular if accuracy is sufficiently guaranteed. They can be used to augment security in combination with other authentication factors. A gesture-based pattern lock system is a good example of such multi-factor authentication, using touch dynamics in a smartphone. However, touch dynamics can be significantly affected by a shape of gestures with regard to the performance and accuracy, and our concern is that user-chosen patterns are likely far from producing such a good shape of gestures. In this poster, we raise this problem and show our experimental study conducted in this regard. We investigate if there is a reproducible correlation between shape and accuracy and if we can derive effective attribute values for user guidance, based on the gesture-based pattern lock system. In more general, we discuss a guided approach to behavioral authentication.
