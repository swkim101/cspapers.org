Supervised learning methods are widely used in sentiment classification. However, when sentiment distribution is imbalanced, the performance of these methods declines. In this paper, we propose an effective approach for imbalanced sentiment classification. In our approach, multiple balanced subsets are sampled from the imbalanced training data and a multi-task learning based framework is proposed to learn robust sentiment classifier from these subsets collaboratively. In addition, we incorporate prior knowledge of sentiment expressions extracted from both existing sentiment lexicons and massive unlabeled data into our approach to enhance the learning of sentiment classifier in imbalanced scenario. Experimental results on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving imbalanced sentiment classification.
