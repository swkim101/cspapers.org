A new type of timed alternating finite automata (TAFA) called omega deterministic timed alternating finite automata (立-DTAFA) is described. DTAFA and 立-DTAFA are synchronous and parallel computational models used for modeling real-time constraints computations and developing software systems. These models are extended with a finite set of mutually exclusive real-valued clocks on events which trigger the state transitions of the automaton. We consider some well-known automata-theoretic properties of TAFA, and investigate those properties in the case of 立-DTAFA. We then show that, unlike timed finite automata (TFA) and TAFA, 立-DTAFA are closed under all Boolean operations, including the complementation. Moreover, we show that the addition of alternation, timing, and determinism to finite automata increase their expressive and descriptional parallel power, as measured by the size of the automaton which has immediate practical applications in software and real-time systems.
