The continuous decrease in the cost of mobile devices and mobile Internet has triggered an exponential growth of overall IP devices, which has consequently increased the demand for network mobility (NEMO), which is required to ensure seamless connectivity of the mobile devices with the Internet on the go. To support this growing demand, the concept of nested-NEMO has evolved over the past few years. However, due to the inherent architecture of nested-NEMO, it is inefficient in terms of hand-off delay and throughput which hinder it to deploy as a highly scalable network. In this paper, we address the scalability issue of nested-NEMO and propose a hierarchical node attachment process for the mobile devices. The performance of the proposed mechanism has been evaluated where we computed the hand-off delay and throughput and observed that the proposed mechanism supports a considerable degree of scalability as compared to the existing nested network mobility architecture.
