The communication process in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) is susceptible to interference, which leads to higher latency and Bit Error Ratio (BER). The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) polling to collect data has been used to provide reliable transmission of data and extend the network lifecycle. The target events underwater are random appeared. In order to effectively capture the target event, an algorithm for the AUV polling to collect data with online prediction is proposed, namely RCAP (Reliable Collection based on AUV with Prediction). Firstly, the polling objects to AUV should be determined. The clustered network structure is established. The cluster head will be polled by the AUV to transfer the data from the cluster. Secondly, the forecast model is build. The first N rounds of data collected are the historical data. Using the historical data, the data of the N+1th round is predicted based on the regression method. Then, the N+1 to 2N rounds of data are used to calibrate the predicted values, and the prediction model is optimized. Finally, the AUV polling trajectory would be plan. All the cluster head have storage threshold. According to the data volume prediction of each cluster head, the AUV polling objects of each round can be determined to maximize the amount of data collection and to improve network efficiency. The simulation results show that the algorithm can adapt to the prediction of target events in a variety of distributions. Especially, when the target events obey the linear distribution, compared with AAEERP, RCAP has a great optimization in network energy consumption, throughput, data transmission efficiency. It increases nearly 10% throughput especially.
