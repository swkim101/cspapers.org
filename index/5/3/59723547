Recently, there has been great progress in computing optimal strategies in large extensive games.But there are still many games where computing an equilibrium remains intractable, mostly due to the size of the game tree.In many of them, such as no-limit poker, huge game tree size is caused by too many actions available in informationsets. We show that it's possible to limit number of used actions in Nash equilibirum.We bound this number by a private information and show how to compute this Nash equilibirum.
