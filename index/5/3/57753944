In this work, we present a novel technique to automatically generate satisfying and violating traces for a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formula. STL is a logic whose formulas are interpreted over real-valued signals that evolve over dense time, which is a natural setting for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications. However, the process of developing appropriate STL requirements can be difficult and error prone. In this work, we provide a method to assist designers in the development of STL requirements for CPS applications. Our technique automatically encodes a given STL formula into a satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) formula in an appropriate theory. Satisfying and violating traces for the STL specification can be obtained by solving satisfiability problems on the encoded SMT formulas. In particular, models returned by the SMT solver correspond to traces that satisfy/violate the STL formula, thus offering a window into the types of behaviors specified by the formula. We demonstrate how the method can be used to debug problems with STL requirements, and we evaluate the performance of the method on a collection of requirements developed for CPS applications.
