In this paper, we study the task of image retrieval, where the input query is specified in the form of an image plus some text that describes desired modifications to the input image. For example, we may present an image of the Eiffel tower, and ask the system to find images which are visually similar, but are modified in small ways, such as being taken at nighttime instead of during the day. o tackle this task, we embed the query (reference image plus modification text) and the target (images). The encoding function of the image text query learns a representation, such that the similarity with the target image representation is high iff it is a ``positive match''. We propose a new way to combine image and text through residual connection, that is designed for this retrieval task. We show this outperforms existing approaches on 3 different datasets, namely Fashion-200k, MIT-States and a new synthetic dataset we create based on CLEVR. We also show that our approach can be used to perform image classification with compositionally novel labels, and we outperform previous methods on MIT-States on this task.
