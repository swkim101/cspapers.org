Mobile robots are increasingly being used to assist with active pursuit and law enforcement. One major limitation for such missions is the resource (battery) allocated to the robot. Factors like nature and agility of evader, terrain over which pursuit is being carried out, plausible traversal velocity and the amount of necessary data to be collected all influence how long the robot can last in the field and how far it can travel. In this paper, we develop an analytical model that analyzes the energy utilization for a variety of components mounted on a robot to estimate the maximum operational range achievable by the robot operating on a single battery discharge. We categorize the major consumers of energy as: 1.) ancillary robotic functions such as computation, communication, sensing etc., and 2.) maneuvering which involves propulsion, steering etc. Both these consumers draw power from the common power source but the achievable range is largely affected by the proportion of power available for maneuvering. For this case study, we performed experiments with real robots on planar and graded surfaces and evaluated the estimation error for each case.
