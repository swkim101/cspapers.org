It is envisioned that the next generation of robots will work in heterogeneous production lines by efficiently interacting and collaborating with human co-workers. To enable a natural collaboration between robots and operators, robots should also understand and recognize the actions of the operators. For this purpose, an automated process to program industrial robots needs to be developed. In this paper we present a teaching by demonstration method based on semantic representations that enables a standard industrial robots to be flexible, modular and adaptable to different production requirements. The proposed semantic-based method is able to re-use the knowledge obtained from household demonstrations to accelerate the teaching of unknown tasks in industrial settings such as packing oranges. Furthermore, the proposed method is able to automatically understand the actions of the operator during their interaction. This new learning method enables non-experts operators to intuitively program robots new tasks.
