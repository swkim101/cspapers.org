We look to create a leading indicator to relate the trend-of-change of the post-release defect density for two consecutive releases of a software product. We propose a rational form in which the ratio of changes of each identified internal quality factor appears as a multiplicative term either at the numerator or at the de-nominator. For a collection of factors identified as interrelated to refactoring, the best formulation is found experimentally by exhaustive enumeration. In the case study that involves a maintenance phase to bring the post-release defect densities of two suites of tools down to within the organizationâ€™s upper limit, the proposed leading indicator correctly generated the desired negative correlation with the trend of changes in postrelease defect density.
