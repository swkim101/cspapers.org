Concurrency bugs widely exist and severely threaten system availability. Techniques that help recover from concurrency-bug failures during production runs are highly desired. This paper proposes BugTM, an approach that leverages Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) on commodity machines for productionrun concurrency-bug recovery. Requiring no knowledge about where are concurrency bugs, BugTM uses static analysis and code transformation to insert HTM instructions into multi-threaded programs. These BugTMtransformed programs will then be able to recover from a concurrency-bug failure by rolling back and re-executing the recent history of a failure thread. BugTM greatly improves the recovery capability of state-of-the-art techniques with low run-time overhead and no changes to OS or hardware, while guarantees not to introduce new bugs.
