Hundreds of billions of small screws are assembled in consumer electronics industry every year, yet reliably automating the screwdriving process remains one of the most challenging tasks. Two barriers to further adoption of robotic threaded fastening systems are system cost and technical challenges, especially for small screws. An affordable intelligent screwdriving system that can support online stage and result classification is the first step to bridge the gap. To this end, starting from a state transition graph of screwdriving processes and a labeled screwdriving dataset (1862 runs of M1.4 screws) on multiple sensor signals, we develop classification algorithms and perform sensor reduction. Fast and accurate result classifiers are developed using linear discriminant analysis, while a wrapper method for feature subset selection is used to identify the optimal feature subset and corresponding sensor signals to reduce cost. A stage classifier based on decision tree is developed using the optimal sensor subset. The stage classifier achieves high accuracy in realtime prediction of various stages when augmented with the state transition graph.
