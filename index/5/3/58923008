Mathematical modeling, simulation and control of an underwater robot are a very complex task due to its nonlinear dynamic structure. In this paper, the authors present kinematic and dynamic modeling of an underwater robot with two rotating thrusters. Through a virtual environment implemented in MATLAB and LabVIEW, the performance of the proposed robot under real operating conditions was demonstrated.
