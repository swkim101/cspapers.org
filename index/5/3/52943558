The University of Minnesota Mechanical Engineering Department, in collaboration with the Theater Arts & Dance Department, designed and built smart material actuated angel wings for the theater production of Jos√© Rivera's play Marisol. The design challenge coordinated aesthetic, structural, mechanical, and electrical requirements for a successful theatrical effect. The aesthetic design drew influence from Baroque Catholic art and 90's grunge fashion for dramatic effect. The wing structure was inspired by the skeletal structure of swan wings, which resulted in the design of a Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloy (SMA) actuated mechanical linkage that mimicked the shape and motion of swan wings. A hidden electrical circuit with a simple pushbutton switch provided the actor with control over the wing movement. The unique design constraints that came with designing a mechanism for theatrical use, along with the close collaboration between the two departments, led to a successful wearable mechanism with dramatic stage effect.
