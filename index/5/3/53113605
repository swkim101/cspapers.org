The development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies in recent years brings us unprecedented opportunities for innovations in the power industry. This demo abstract introduces our research and practice with Pavatar - IoT for the power industry. Pavatar includes a series of system deployments in the core sections of Global Energy Internet (GEI), for the purposes of automatic surveillance and remote diagnosis of ultra-high-voltage converter stations (UHVCSs). Pavatar incorporates technologies like lower-power or battery-free sensing, cross-technology communication, edge computing, machine learning, and enhances the user experience with 3D virtual reality. The deployed system significantly reduces the manpower cost and enhances the operational efficiency of the UHVCS.
