It is our pleasure to welcome you to the first Changing Landscapes in HPC Security workshop. This is the first workshop that we have tried to put together so I would like to thank the authors, publishers and reviewers for their tolerance of our somewhat confused direction over the past few months. 
 
The field of HPC security is in a state of profound transition. As systems continue to grow in terms of complexity and performance, we find ourselves facing new (and old) challenges. While hardware tends to take the spotlight, from a security perspective the increasing complexity and automation in system and application software will probably create an unfortunate growth industry for attackers. The blurring lines between core systems and surrounding infrastructure are equally interesting. As the definition of what constitutes HPC expands to include cloud computing, 100G networking, cross-site integration, and web 2.0 based interfaces for job submission and reporting, the complexity of the aggregate system increases dramatically while the need for timely and accurate decision making about user activity remains unchanged. This growing complexity is balanced against a backdrop of routine user and application attacks, which remain surprisingly effective over time. 
 
To address these issues we are suggesting a surprisingly non-technical solution: communication between systems operations, security operations and security research groups. Operations folks need the tools and ideas from the research community to address issues of complexity and analysis. Research needs to proactively reach out to operations and ask for data in a clear and methodologically sound manner.
