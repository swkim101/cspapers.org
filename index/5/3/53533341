Focusing on the revision of the movement link in the annotation scheme, tagged <moveLink> , this paper presents a systematic way of converting the ﬁrst ofﬁcial edition of ISO-Space to its second edition with revisions required at the speciﬁcation levels, both abstract and concrete. Even after the loss of its status as an ISO standard, the ﬁrst edition is still expected to be compatible with the second edition at least at the level of semantics.
