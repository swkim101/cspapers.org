This research presents a re-engineering workbench and architecture that allows for legacy system written in procedural languages to be migrated to new object oriented platforms. This methodology allows for specific design and quality requirements of the target migrant system to be considered during the re-engineering process through an iterative and incremental process. The migration process recovers an object model from the procedural code and incrementally refines it by taking into consideration the design requirements for the migrant system.
