This paper presents the design of generic codec for testing Web application. Codec is a necessary part of TTCN-3 test system which transfers from TTCN-3 template data and SUT (the system under test) input data, and from SUT output data to TTCN-3 template data. The generic codec needs to transform TTCN-3 template into URL request string, analyzing the Web page, and then extract the Web page. Because of conscious of the Web pages with large volume of data and noise data, the multi-level parsing and composition strategy has been presented in this paper. Experiments show that the strategy works well and could save much codec development effort.
