This paper describes the development of a whole-body robotic simulator of an elderly person for evaluating robotics devices for nursing care. To improve the quality of life of the elderly persons, physical assistance such as transfer, movement, and bathroom assistance is important. It is also important to reduce the workload of caregivers in an aging society. In recent years, assistive robotic devices for nursing care have been developed and commercialized for such purposes. However, such devices have not become popular in the care facilities yet. One of the reasons is that it is still difficult to evaluate the effects of the devices on the care receivers and caregivers. In particular, it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the effect of the devices on the human body from the viewpoint of safety and comfort. We have developed a whole-body robotic system to simulate the pose and motion of the elderly persons. The purpose of this system is to realize quantitative physical evaluation of robotics devices for nursing care of the human body. The experimental results of the preliminary evaluation of assistive robotic devices are also presented.
