Six-sigma has been invented by Motorola Company in 1986. Since that time, it has been widely used in the manufacturing. The success stories of applying six-sigma in manufacturing during the last years have encouraged the practitioners and researchers to explore the applicability of six-sigma in software industry. For the applicability of six-sigma in software engineering, some researchers came up with good results, while the others came up with a number of uncertainties on applying six-sigma to software engineering. In this paper, we will discuss these two opinions to present a clear view of both of them.
