Existing adaptive robot control laws typically require an engineering choice of a constant adaptation gain matrix, which often involves repeated and time-consuming trial and error. Moreover, physical consistency of the estimated inertial parameters or the uniform positive definiteness of the estimated robot mass matrix cannot in general be guaranteed without nonsmooth corrections, e.g., projection to the boundary of the feasible parameter set. In this paper we present a natural adaptive control law that mitigates many of these difficulties, by exploiting the coordinate-invariant differential geometric structure of the space of physically consistent inertial parameters. Our approach provides a more generalizable and physically consistent adaptation law for the robot parameters without significant additional computations compared to existing methods. Simulation results showing markedly improved tracking error convergence over existing adaptive control laws are provided as validation.
