In order to improve long term durability of bioprosthetic heart valve, we analyze and compare stress distribution of bioprosthetic heart valve leaflets with different thickness under the same load. We will establish the elliptical leaflets models via computer aided design. Based on the parametric models of the heart valve, three kinds of thickness (0.3 mm, 0.4 mm, and 0.5 mm) of BHV is analyzed by us and finite element analysis is used to simulate the mechanical performance of HBV during the diastolic phase. We can conclude that the bioprosthetic heart valve leaflet with different thickness has a significant effect on the dynamic behavior of the bioprosthetic heart valve. According to the whole loading process, we can conclude that the thickness of the elliptical valve leaflet with 0.4 mm is better than others. The finite element analysis on the HBV could provide reliable and useful testimony for the HBV manufacturing and optimizing.
