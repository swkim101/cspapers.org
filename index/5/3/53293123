Mean field modeling is a popular approach to assess the performance of large scale computer systems. The evolution of many mean field models is characterized by a set of ordinary differential equations that have a unique fixed point. In order to prove that this unique fixed point corresponds to the limit of the stationary measures of the finite systems, the unique fixed point must be a global attractor. While global attraction was established for various systems in case of exponential job sizes, it is often unclear whether these proof techniques can be generalized to non-exponential job sizes. In this paper we show how simple monotonicity arguments can be used to prove global attraction for a broad class of ordinary differential equations that capture the evolution of mean field models with hyperexponential job sizes. This class includes both existing as well as previously unstudied load balancing schemes and can be used for systems with either finite or infinite buffers. The main novelty of the approach exists in using a Coxian representation for the hyperexponential job sizes and a partial order that is stronger than the componentwise partial order used in the exponential case.
