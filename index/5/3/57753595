Skin surface wounds due to burns, surgeries and chronic illness affect millions of people worldwide. Tissue engineering has become an increasingly popular treatment, but it is a highly manual process. Increasing the automation in tissue engineering could increase the rate of treatment for patients and improve outcomes. We present an initial investigation into an automated in-situ treatment. In our proposed method, a 3D machine vision system detects a skin wound to be treated and then determines the 3D point set corresponding to the wound. The 3D point set is then passed to path planning algorithm for a robot manipulator to move an ink-jet nozzle over the wound and fill the cavity with quick-curing/gelling fluids such collagen and other biomaterials and cell growth promoters. This paper details initial results and experimental validation of each of the proposed steps.
