The development of switching systems is time and cost consuming. A report is given on a project within the SIEMENS Corporation where object-oriented techniques were used to develop a switching system for broadband ISDN. Some important components of system software and how their support for object-orientation should look like are discussed. One of these is an operating system that acts as an runtime system for object-oriented features. The effects of this support are shown by some typical applications for switching systems. Another system component is an analysis tool offering a novel type of object-specific trace mechanism. As an introduction to the topic the most important object-oriented terms are defined. The particular requirements in the area of switching systems e.g. real time constraints and concurrency are discussed. >
