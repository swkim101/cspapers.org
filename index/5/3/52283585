This paper describes the dynamic modeling and locomotion control of a two-link underactuated brachiating robot traversing a flexible cable. A multi-body system comprised of a two-link robot, a flexible cable, and coupling soft junctions is modeled dynamically. This model is used to formulate an energy-minimizing optimal control strategy that includes the effects of cable vibration induced by robot locomotion. Optimized trajectories and control torque profiles are obtained via multiple-shooting and parametric trajectory approaches. Simulation results show that these optimal torque profiles result in energy-efficient continuous brachiation over a flexible cable. Additional studies examine how the optimal torque profiles change depending on the robot's initial position along a catenary cable.
