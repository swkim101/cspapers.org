In software product line engineering, families of similar products are developed instead of single ones. The systems produced as part of a family differ in the features they include. To ease the simultaneous design of multiple systems, methods to write a formal specification of a complete product line have been proposed. This paper shows how a TLA+ specification of a system family can be written, based on the representation of the family by a featured transition system. The specification of correctness properties of system families in TLA+ and their verification with the TLA+ model checker TLC are considered.
