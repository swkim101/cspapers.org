In this paper, we propose to solve the directed graph embedding problem via a two stage approach: in the first stage, the graph is symmetrized in one of several possible ways, and in the second stage, the so-obtained symmetrized graph is embeded using any state-of-the-art (undirected) graph embedding algorithm. Note that it is not the objective of this paper to propose a new (undirected) graph embedding algorithm or discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing ones; all we are saying is that whichever be the suitable graph embedding algorithm, it will fit in the above proposed symmetrization framework.
