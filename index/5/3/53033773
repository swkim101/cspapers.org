The accurate prediction of users' future topics of interests on social networks can facilitate content recommendation and platform engagement. However, researchers have found that future interest prediction, especially on social networks such as Twitter, is quite challenging due to the rapid changes in community topics and evolution of user interactions. In this context, temporal collaborative filtering methods have already been used to perform user interest prediction, which benefit from similar user behavioral patterns over time to predict how a user's interests might evolve in the future. In this paper, we propose that instead of considering the whole user base within a collaborative filtering framework to predict user interests, it is possible to much more accurately predict such interests by only considering the behavioral patterns of the most influential users related to the user of interest. We model influence as a form of causal dependency between users. To this end, we employ the concept of Granger causality to identify causal dependencies. We show through extensive experimentation that the consideration of only one causally dependent user leads to much more accurate prediction of users' future interests in a host of measures including ranking and rating accuracy metrics.
