Modern microcontrollers come with a selection of clock sources that have widely differing frequencies and power consumptions. For applications whose workloads vary over time, dynamically changing the clock can provide significant energy savings. The varying constraints of embedded hardware environments and the complex interactions of multiprogrammed systems makes this approach burdensome to do in application logic. Power Clocks orchestrates energy optimizing clock management in the kernel, obviating the need for application involvement while still achieving acceptable performance for typical workloads. This poster describes Power Clocks's design and presents preliminary results.
