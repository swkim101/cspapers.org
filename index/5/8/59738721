We explore shared encounters mediated by technologies. We investigate aspects that influence the interactions between people and people, and people and their surroundings when technology (a responsive digital screen) is embedded in the physical surroundings in selected locations in the city. In particular, we highlight the importance of space and the role of place in providing temporal and spatial mechanisms facilitating various social interactions and shared encounters.
