In addition to reducing the environmental footprint, smart energy monitoring systems today should reduce operating costs, provide insights on energy consumption, and manage load distribution. This involves monitoring the overall energy consumption of a facility and the individual energy consumption of each device. This is usually done by using multiple energy meters. Minion, a hand sized energy auditing device, has the ability to analyze multiple devices' energy consumption without the need of multiple energy meters. This allows valuable actionable insights for non-intrusive energy management solution. Minion captures voltage and energy signatures at microsecond intervals and uses machine learning techniques to identify the individual assets used and the patterns of their consumption. Minion enables energy transparency, energy savings of up to 30%, predictive maintenance and asset health monitoring, This provides accurate and rapid analysis of multiple energy signatures at any given point.
