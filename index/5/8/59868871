In this paper we propose a design and implementation for efficient semi-synchronous replication solution using iSCSI for disaster recovery. We replicate the data at block level to bring in efficiency. Further we use features of database application which helps in reducing the complexity and improving the performance of the disaster recovery solution. This paper concentrates on the detailed design and implementation of block level semi-synchronous replication solution. The paper also presents the overhead of the solution on the naive IP SAN.
