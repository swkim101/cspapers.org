In this paper, the problem of selecting from among a set of alternatives using multiple, potentially conflicting criteria is discussed. A number of approaches are commonly used to make these types of decisions in engineering design, including pair-wise comparisons, ranking methods, rating methods, weighted sum approaches, and strength of preferences methods. In this paper, we first demonstrate the theoretical and practical flaws with a number of these commonly employed methods. We then present a method based on the concept of hypothetical equivalents and expand the method to include hypothetical inequivalents. We demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the various decision making approaches using an aircraft selection problem. The design of a research laboratory is used to demonstrate the method of hypothetical equivalents further.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
