Designers often search for some design examples from other Web pages for reference or reuse in their design work. In order to make this possible, we first need a database that stores such Web page layouts. We propose an approach that populates a database with design examples, specifically layout examples. Our approach first crawls the Internet to retrieve Web pages, which are then mined. We especially describe how we applied the frequent subtree mining algorithm. We also show preliminary results of applying our approach.
