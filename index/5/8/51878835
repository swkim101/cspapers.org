We propose to tackle the problem of end-to-end learning for raw waveform signals by introducing learnable continuous time-frequency atoms. The derivation of these filters is achieved by defining a functional space with a given smoothness order and boundary conditions. From this space, we derive the parametric analytical filters. Their differentiability property allows gradient-based optimization. As such, one can utilize any Deep Neural Network (DNN) with these filters. This enables us to tackle in a front-end fashion a large scale bird detection task based on the freefield1010 dataset known to contain key challenges , such as the dimensionality of the inputs data (> 100, 000) and the presence of additional noises: multiple sources and soundscapes.
