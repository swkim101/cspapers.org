We present a low-drift visual odometry algorithm that separately estimates rotational and translational motion from lines, planes, and points found in RGB-D images. Previous methods estimate drift-free rotational motion from structural regularities to reduce drift in the rotation estimate, which is the primary source of positioning inaccuracy in visual odometry. However, multiple orthogonal planes are required to be visible throughout the entire motion estimation process; otherwise, these VO approaches fail. We propose a new approach to estimate drift-free rotational motion jointly from both lines and planes by exploiting environmental regularities. We track the spatial regularities with an efficient SO(3)-manifold constrained mean shift algorithm. Once the drift-free rotation is found, we recover the translational motion from all tracked points with and without depth by minimizing the de-rotated reprojection error. We compare the proposed algorithm to other state-of-the-art visual odometry methods on a variety of RGB-D datasets (including especially challenging pure rotations) and demonstrate improved accuracy and lower drift error.
