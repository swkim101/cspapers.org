Past research suggests that individuals' experience and task training are the factor to software review performance. However, there is no empirical evidence in the software review literature to show how individuals' experience, task training and performance are connected. As results, the aim of this paper is to presents the important relationships between individuals' experience, task training and software review performance. A laboratory experiment was conducted in autumn 2003 at The University of New South Wales in Australia. One hundred and ninety-two volunteer university students were employed. Subjects were required to detect defects from a design document. The main findings include (1) role experience has a positive effect on performance; (2) working experience in the software industry has a positive effect on performance; (3) task training has no significant effect on performance.
