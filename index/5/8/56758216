Currently, the performance problems of software systems gets more and more attentions. Among various diagnosis methods based on system traces, principal component analysis (PCA) based methods are widely used due to the high accuracy of the diagnosis results and requiring no specific domain knowledge. However, according to our experiments, we have validated several shortcomings existed in PCA-based methods, including requiring traces with a same call sequence, inefficiency when the traces are long, and missing performance problems. To cope with these issues, we introduce a segmentation based online diagnosis method in this poster.
