The NBS Protocol Performance Laboratory is developing enhanced protocol mechanisms for OSI class 4 transport that will improve the throughput efficiency achieved on a satellite channel. A selective acknowledgement mechanism has been shown to improve throughput efficiency by as much as 34%. Several alternative expedited data mechanisms have demonstrated throughput efficiency improvements as great as 38%. Most of the protocol mechanism enhancements considered require only minor changes to the international standard OSI transport protocol.
