In this paper we describe how a single Khepera II robot was used for an assignment in a senior level course on graphical user interface implementation. The assignment required each student to implement a graphical user interface for remotely controlling a Khepera II robot. From the author's point of view, the focus of the project was how to efficiently and effectively allow the 35 students enrolled in the course to have access to the robot for the purposes of testing and debugging. Furthermore, two of the students were enrolled through the distance education program and were remotely located. The intent was to see if an assignment making use of the robot would stimulate student interest, and whether it could be done with a minimal investment in hardware, lab, and instructor resources. The students were surveyed at the conclusion of the assignment in order to assess the effectiveness of the assignment. The results of this survey are presented, along with plans for future work.
