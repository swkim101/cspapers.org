Different from classic recommendation problems, event recommendation generally faces the problems of heterogenous online and offline social relationships among users and implicit feedback data. In this paper, we present a baysian probability model that can fully unleash the power of heterogenous social relations and efficiently tackle with implicit feedback characteristic for event recommendation. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of our method.
