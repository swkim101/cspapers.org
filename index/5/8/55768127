The introduction of robotics has opened a new era in general and digestive surgery. Several advanced procedures are now performed with the robotic technique providing superior dexterity to surgeons while maintaining the profile of safety and benefits of minimally invasive surgery for patients. Pancreatic surgery, one of the last area of resistance to minimally invasive surgery, has not been spared by this surgical revolution. An increasing number of studies provided by high volume institutions have proven the safety and feasibility of robotics for pancreatic surgery. Pancreaticoduodenectomy, one of the most advanced surgical procedures in abdominal surgery, represents the most common type of pancreatic resection performed by robotic approach. The safety and feasibility is at present well demonstrated but its advantages over open and laparoscopic surgery and its long term oncologic outcomes are still to be proven in prospective studies. 
This article reviewed the current experience of robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy reported in the international literature evaluating its safety, feasibility, short and long term outcomes. 
The increasing number of reports dealing with this topic proven the growing interest of digestive surgeon for this approach which certainly will constitute the approach of choice for minimally invasive pancreatic surgery in the next future.
