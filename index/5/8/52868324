This paper presents a combinatorial polynomial-time algorithm for minimizing submodular functions, answering an open question posed in 1981 by Grotschel, Lov asz, and Schrijver. The algorithm employs a scaling scheme that uses a ow in the complete directed graph on the underlying set with each arc capacity equal to the scaled parameter. The resulting algorithm runs in time bounded by a polyno- mial in the size of the underlying set and the length of the largest absolute function value. The paper also presents a strongly polynomial version in which the number of steps is bounded by a polynomial in the size of the underlying set, independent of the function values.
