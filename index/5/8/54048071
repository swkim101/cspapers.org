Nowadays privacy is a key issue and enterprises have adopted various strategies to protect customers privacy and to make public their privacy policies. This paper presents a conceptual model for the definition and enforcement of privacy policies. The model is described by means of UML and it provides a clear and simple way for representing privacy policies. Furthermore, the model supports different ways for enforcing privacy policies by defining when the controls are to be done and what actions need to be performed. Finally, the paper introduces a small example in order to better explain the proposed approach.
