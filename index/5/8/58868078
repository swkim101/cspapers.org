Recently e-learning become the main target of university and educational organisation with the increasingly advancement of Internet technology. There are multiple techniques that can be adopted by developers to make e-learning more attractive and excitement. Many studies developed guiding principle to pursue so that the users can practice new and effective learning experience. Examples of these principles are thought-provoking question; interesting fact, learning guidance to help learners encode information for longterm storage, uses combinations of variety of multi-modal elements (text, graphics, speech, earcons and avatar) and clear feedback. Therefore this study demonstrated four games based learning interfaces taken into account the guidelines mentioned, with focus on multi-modal feature incorporated in helping trigger off learner interest. The outcomes presented in this paper showed potential effect on the user performance through measurement of effectiveness attribute within each game.
