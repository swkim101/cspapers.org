The web applications developed are often poorly structured and poorly documented. Maintaining such systems is problematic. This paper presents an approach to recover the architecture of such systems, in order to make maintenance more manageable. The approach extracts the structure of web applications and shows the interaction between their various components. The recovery process uses a set of extractors to analyze the source code of web applications. The extracted data is manipulated to reduce the complexity of the architectural diagrams. Developers can use the extracted architecture to gain a better understanding of web applications and to assist in their maintenance.
