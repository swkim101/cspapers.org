The latest development of computer vision has made exciting progress and tremendous impact in our daily lives. In this exciting era of technological advances, deep learning has gained huge popularity as a powerful tool for solving a lot of computer vision problems, and has added a great boost to this

already rapidly developing field. Conventionally, the connection between different vision tasks is fragile. For example, low-level image processing and high-level vision tasks are usually coped with separately. However, the inherent relation of feature representations among various tasks should be effectively utilized rather than omitted. My research focuses on connecting low-level image processing and high-level vision via deep learning. Specifically, my goal is to design deep learning mechanisms that can efficiently and effectively learn features from low-level image processing and use them to improve the performance of high-level vision tasks.
