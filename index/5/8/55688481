High space cost and ignoring synonyms in STC (Suffix Tree Clustering algorithm) are challenges for search results clustering. Aiming at these challenges, this paper proposes a WordNet-based suffix tree clustering algorithm (WNSTC). WNSTC can construct a suffix tree containing WordNet synsets. When constructing the suffix tree, WNSTC looks every feature word up in WordNet database. If the feature word is included in WordNet, its synsets will be added into corresponding node. The node in the suffix tree may be a set of words (strings) with similar meaning instead of a single word (string). Experiments executed on data sets show that WNSTC has better clustering quality and smaller suffix tree size than original STC algorithm.
