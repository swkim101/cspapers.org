Sparsity promoting norms are frequently used in high dimensional regression. A limitation of Lasso-type estimators is that the regulariza-tion parameter depends on the noise level which varies between datasets and experiments. Esti-mators such as the concomitant Lasso address this dependence by jointly estimating the noise level and the regression coefficients. As sample sizes are often limited in high dimensional regimes, simplified heteroscedastic models are customary. However, in many experimental applications , data is obtained by averaging multiple measurements. This helps reducing the noise variance, yet it dramatically reduces sample sizes, preventing refined noise modeling. In this work, we propose an estimator that can cope with complex heteroscedastic noise structures by using non-averaged measurements and a con-comitant formulation. The resulting optimization problem is convex, so thanks to smoothing theory, it is amenable to state-of-the-art proximal coordinate descent techniques that can leverage the expected sparsity of the solutions. Practical benefits are demonstrated on simulations and on neuroimaging applications.
