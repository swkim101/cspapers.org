In many applications, the main part of the computations may be encapsulated in compute-bounds kernels. Achieving high performance on compute-bound primitives at a low hardware cost has become an important challenge. OPAC was designed as the basic cell of a floating-point coprocessor dedicated to the execution of compute-bound kernels. Due to efficient hardware mechanisms for controlling and sequencing a pipeline performance close to a floating-point multiply-add percycle per cell is reached on applications such as solving linear systems, FFTs correlations in a microprocessor environment.
