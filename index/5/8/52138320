This paper proposes a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) language model that combines probability distributions computed not only from a final RNN layer but also middle layers. This method raises the expressive power of a language model based on the matrix factorization interpretation of language modeling introduced by Yang et al. (2018). Our proposed method improves the current state-of-the-art language model and achieves the best score on the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2, which are the standard benchmark datasets. Moreover, we indicate our proposed method contributes to application tasks: machine translation and headline generation.
