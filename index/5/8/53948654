We approach the design of security-critical distributed applications with task-level fault-tolerant techniques. We focus on the impact of fault tolerance on secure message communication, which was seriously overlooked before. Fault-tolerant techniques, e.g., task re-execution and active replica, are leveraged to tolerate faults in task executions, while cryptography is deployed to protect the confidentiality of messages delivered over the communication media. The design problem is to minimize the schedule length and security vulnerability of the application, subject to given fault-tolerant constraints. We then propose a multi-objective optimization method to find the best solutions. Initial experiments indicated the efficiency.
