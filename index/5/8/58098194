In this paper, topology optimization of structure subject to design-dependent loads is studied. The position and direction of the design-dependent loads will change as the shape and topology of structure changes during optimization iteration. A potential function is introduced to locate the surface boundary. Design sensitivity analysis is derived. Examples from the proposed method are presented.Copyright Â© 2005 by ASME
