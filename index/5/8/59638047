In this paper, we present a programming language approach for the assembly of arbitrary two-dimensional shapes by decentralized, identically-programmed agents. Our system compiles a predetermined global shape into a program that instructs these agents to grow the shape via replication and location-based control mechanisms. In the global-to-local compilation phase, an input shape is decomposed into a network of covering-discs. The disc network parameterizes the agent program, a biologically-inspired framework allowing agents to amorphously produce the shape using replication and local interaction. Our system is robust to random agent failure, and regenerates in the event of region death.
