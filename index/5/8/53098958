Cross-technology interference (CTI) from dense and prevalent wireless has become a primary threat to low-power IoT. This paper presents G-Bee, a CTI avoidance technique that uniquely places ZigBee packet on the guard band of ongoing WiFi traffic, which effectively safeguards the packet from WiFi interference. Such design ensures reliable ZigBee communication even under saturated WiFi traffic where traditional ZigBee is considered inoperable. Technical highlight is in lighweight WiFi guard band capture mechanism using ZigBee PHY layer samples directly accessible in various commercial ZigBee chip. Another exclusive feature of G-Bee is spectrum-synchronized low duty cycling - by utilizing guard bands of periodic WiFi beacons, active slots are effectively synchronized to spectrum availability (i.e., guard band) for significant delay improvement. Extensive evaluations on our prototype system demonstrates G-Bee PRR over 95% where legacy ZigBee drops to below 15% under significant interference with hundreds WiFi users and reduction of low duty cycle delay by 87.5%, all of which are achieved with a light computational overhead of 0.3%.
