We develop a logic-based technique to analyse finite interactions in multi-agent systems. We introduce a semantics for Alternating-time Temporal Logic (for both perfect and imperfect recall) and its branching-time fragments in which paths are finite instead of infinite.Â  We study validities of these logics and present optimal algorithms for their model-checking problems in the perfect recall case.
