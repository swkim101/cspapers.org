Modern lightweight dual-arm robots bring the physical capabilities to quickly take over tasks at typical industrial workplaces designed for workers. Low setup times – including the instructing/specifying of new tasks – are crucial to stay competitive. We propose a constraint programming approach to simultaneous task allocation and motion scheduling for such industrial manipulation and assembly tasks. Our approach covers the robot as well as connected machines. The key concept are Ordered Visiting Constraints, a descriptive and extensible model to specify such tasks with their spatiotemporal requirements and combinatorial or ordering constraints. Our solver integrates such task models and robot motion models into constraint optimization problems and solves them efficiently using various heuristics to produce makespan-optimized robot programs. For large manipulation tasks with 200 objects, our solver implemented using Google’s Operations Research tools requires less than a minute to compute usable plans. The proposed task model is robot-independent and can easily be deployed to other robotic platforms. This portability is validated through several simulation-based experiments.
