A brush bristle cleaning system (10) which includes a handle member (16) adapted to be held in one hand of a user. The handle member (16) passes in a longitudinal direction (18). A first wire element (20) extends in an arcuate closed contour and is secured to the first handle member (16) on one end thereof. A first helical wire element (24) defining a plurality of first helical loops (26) pass around a portion of the closed contour of the first wire element (20). A second wire element (30) which extends in the longitudinal direction (18) is secured to the handle member (16) on a first end and is secured to the first wire element (20) on a second end thereof. A second helical wire element (36) passes around the second wire element (30) and defines a plurality of second helical loops (38). A brush (12) having brush bristles (14) is either longitudinally moved or transversely contacted with the helical loops of (38) and (26) to provide a cleansing action for the bristles of (14). A receptacle (44) is provided wherein the first wire elements (20) and second wire elements (30) may be releasably mounted for capturing a material being displaced from the brush bristles (14).
