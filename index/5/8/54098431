It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 10th Internet Measurement Conference. This year's conference continues IMC's tradition of being the premier venue for dissemination empirical research results providing insight into how the Internet operates in practice, as well as disseminating new methodologies for increasing our understanding of networked systems. In putting together this year's program we explicitly tried to uphold IMC's best traditions, such as encouraging reappraisal of previous results, fostering papers that assess emerging uses (or mis-uses) of the Internet and including a broad variety of topics. Per usual, the program is a mix of long and short papers to encourage both deep treatment of topics and early exposure to fresh ideas. 
 
This year's IMC program spans three full days and includes a record 47 papers (24 long papers and 23 short papers). The program was chosen by a highly skilled and dedicated program committee of 23 people. This year we received 211 submissions which represents a 16% increase over 2009. Interestingly, long submissions held fairly steady (110 this year vs. 115 last year) while the number of short submissions increased dramatically (101 this year vs. 68 last year). The review process proceeded in four steps. In the first round all papers were reviewed by two PC members which led to 125 papers being carried forward. The second round consisted of one additional review (and more in some specific cases). The PC then engaged in an online discussion which identified 11 papers that were "pre-accepted" and 61 papers to discuss at the PC meeting. The final decisions were made at the PC meeting which was held in Berkeley in July and attended by the vast majority of PC members. In certain cases we consulted with external reviewers for their expertise, however, this was a rare exception and nearly all reviews were conducted by the PC members themselves.
