This paper describes the design of a high dynamic range (HDR) six-axis force/torque sensor. The sensor is composed of a high-rigidity flexure element detecting large force and a low-rigidity flexure element detecting small force. The overload on the low-rigidity flexure element is prevented by an overload protection mechanism. An HDR measurement is achieved by combining the outputs of the two flexure elements. A loading test for the designed sensor is performed, and the results indicate that the six-axis sensor measures force with a dynamic range from 0.01N to 1000 N.
