Ear devices, such as noise-canceling headphones and hearing aids, have dramatically changed the way we listen to the outside world. We re-envision this area by combining wireless communication with acoustics. The core idea is to scatter IoT devices in the environment that listen to ambient sound and forward it over their wireless radio. Since wireless signals travel much faster than sound, the ear-device receives the sound much earlier than its actual arrival. This "glimpse" into the future allows sufficient time for acoustic digital processing, serving as a valuable opportunity for various signal processing and machine learning applications. We believe this will enable a digital app store around human ears.
