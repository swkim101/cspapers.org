By the development of the system domain model it is hoped that a greater conceptual and theoretical clarity may be brought to understanding the complex and multifaceted nature of pervasive and ambient computer games. This paper presents a conceptual model, the system domain model, to illustrate domain areas that exist in a console, pervasive or ambient game. It is implicit that the regions that the systemic domain model describes are contextually dependent. By developing this model it is possible to more fully understand the gaming application area for game technologies and in particular the pervasive and ambient games. Further implications of this model are discussed with specific instances of games that are designed to promote behavioural change, in particular with regards to health.
