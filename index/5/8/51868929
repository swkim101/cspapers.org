State-of-the-art relation extraction approaches are only able to recognize relationships between mentions of entity arguments stated explicitly in the text and typically localized to the same sentence. However, the vast majority of relations are either implicit or not sententially localized. This is a major problem for Knowledge Base Population, severely limiting recall. In this paper we propose a new methodology to identify relations between two entities, consisting of detecting a very large number of unary relations, and using them to infer missing entities. We describe a deep learning architecture able to learn thousands of such relations very efficiently by using a common deep learning based representation. Our approach largely outperforms state of the art relation extraction technology on a newly introduced web scale knowledge base population benchmark, that we release to the research community.
