Developing mobile software solutions in order to enhance learning in University environments by using the new mobile communication technology is becoming a very popular research focus. However there is a lack of research on the instruction method that should be used in the development of mobile learning software as a very important factor in the learning process and in the software engineering process. In this paper we investigate, develop and analyses a mobile software solution in using the Task Based Learning model. The research focuses on the developed software solution and reviews learning modeling approach focusing on task based learning that from the findings is concluded as the best approach for mobile learning. For testing purposes developed is a software prototype called M-Learn and its analyses has been investigated and recommendations for developing similar software solutions have been defined.
