This paper studies the need within a geographically dispersed, virtual, interdisciplinary institute, the IBBT, how the collaboration within this organization could be enhanced by looking into the current collaboration practices. The IBBT performs research and supports ICT innovation in the region of Flanders and acts as a central institute between different research groups located at five different cities. Therefore a combination of four methods in different phases of data collection was applied to create a mixed method participatory User Centered Design approach with specific attention to the appropriation of current social tools. This research is targeted at understanding the different research groups of the IBBT and finally supplying the organization with suggestions and solutions to improve the collaboration between the different research partners. Through our approach we get an overview of the current practices and CSCW-tools used within the research groups themselves and in the collaboration with other IBBT research groups and external partners. They lead to the formulation of a set of needs and requirements to how the groups see their future activities facilitated by a set of tools. The mixed use of methods is evaluated at the end regarding their successful complementary use in pursuit of these requirements. Author Keywords Virtual teams, interdisciplinary collaboration, CSCW,
