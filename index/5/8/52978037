Current VR headsets are tethered to computers which limits mobility and poses a tripping hazard. Delivering VR content over a wireless link is challenging due to the high data rates and stringent time delivery requirements. Millimeter wave communication at 60 GHz (WiGig) can meet these requirements, but, it is unreliable due to blockages and beam misalignments. In this poster, we present an idea of using both WiFi and WiGig interfaces to transmit the VR content. We divide a video frame into tiles and prioritize the tiles in the user's field of view. Based on the wireless link conditions, the tiles are encoded with varying qualities and transmitted over either WiFi or WiGig interface. We formulate an optimization framework to deliver the VR video with high reliability and low latency.
