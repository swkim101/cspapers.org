A leading cause of unpredictable application performance in distributed systems is contention at the storage layer, where resources are multiplexed among concurrent data intensive workloads. We target the shared storage cache, used to alleviate disk I/O bottlenecks, and propose a new caching paradigm to improve performance. We present the virtual I/O cache, a dynamic scheme that manages a limited storage cache resource. Application behavior and the performance of a chosen replacement policy are observed at run time, and a mechanism is designed to avoid suboptimal caching.
