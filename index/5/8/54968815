Mobility assistance robots (MARs) provide support 
to elderly or patients during walking. The design of a safe 
and intuitive assistance behavior is one of the major challenges 
in this context. Here we present work on two modes of physical 
Human-Robot interaction; one where the human in is direct 
contact with the MAR, e.g. by holding some handles, and the 
other where the human releases the handles whilst the MAR 
has to follow him/her from the front, i.e. contactless. 
For the first mode, we present an integrated approach 
for the context-specific, on-line adaptation of the assistance 
level of a rollator-type MAR by gain-scheduling of low-level 
robot control parameters. A human-inspired decision-making 
model, the Drift-Diffusion Model, is introduced as the key 
principle to gain-schedule parameters and with this to adapt 
the provided robot assistance in order to achieve a human-like 
assistive behavior. The MAR is designed to provide a) cognitive 
assistance to help the user follow a desired path as well as 
b) sensorial assistance to avoid collisions with obstacles while 
allowing for an intentional approach of them. 
For the second mode, an intention-based assistive controller 
for allowing the robot to follow a human while moving in the 
front is analysed. This task is particularly challenging in indoor 
environments, as there are situations that are undecidable, 
namely in junctions. We describe a novel local kinodynamic 
planner which concurrently detects discrete routes and continuous 
motion paths. An intention recognition algorithm is also 
detailed, along with tests in a T-Junction.
