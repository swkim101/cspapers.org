Gaining insight into human personality and its impact on human behavior is very valuable in many applications, such as web information credibility prediction. In this paper, we explore using weighted ML-kNN model for automatic recognition of personality traits of web users, based on a given composition text. After extracting features through analysis of the content of user’s Essays statues updates, we discretize contiguous attribute using Kohonen’s feature-map algorithm, and assign weight to extracted features based on information entropy. The Essays dataset is partitioned into training dataset and test dataset. For a given test user, the weighted distance between test user and training user is calculated, and based on which the nearest neighbors are identified. The personality traits of test user are then predicted by using ML-kNN algorithm. Our experiment on the Essays dataset shows expected positive results.
