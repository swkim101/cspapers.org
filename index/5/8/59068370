Biological experiments are published in a series of online databases. Due to the inherent complexity of these experiments, their conclusions can be contradictory. This causes the databases to be inconsistent, which creates problems for human users. Previous work looked at creating a system based on Argumentation to resolve this issue. This work presents an evaluation of that system, focusing on the effectiveness of its presentation of arguments and the result of the argumentation process. The work shows that the system can be understood by users, even though their presentation preferences vary substantially.
