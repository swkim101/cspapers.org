Red-black relaxation in classical planning allows to interpolate between delete-relaxed and real planning. Yet the traditional use of relaxations to generate heuristics restricts relaxation usage to tractable fragments. How to actually tap into the red-black relaxation's interpolation power? Prior work has devised red-black state space search (RBS) for intractable red-black planning, and has explored two uses: proving unsolvability, generating seed plans for plan repair. Here, we explore the generation of plans directly through RBS. We design two enhancements to this end: (A) use a known tractable fragment where possible, use RBS for the intractable parts; (B) check RBS state transitions for realizability, spawn relaxation refinements where the check fails. We show the potential merits of both techniques on IPC benchmarks.
