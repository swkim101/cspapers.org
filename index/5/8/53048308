From offices to public spaces, dynamic multi-surface environments that can leverage the devices that users carry with them are becoming more common. However these environments are often implicit and therefore hard to discover, as are the multi-device interactions that they support. This position paper outlines the challenges that designers of multi-surface environments face to improve service discoverability, to support interactions that leverage users' devices, and to provide software tools to design and develop cross-devices applications.
