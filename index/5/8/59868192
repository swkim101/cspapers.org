In this paper we describe a productionand genreindependent approach to developing interactive and reconfigurable screen media narratives made with recorded essence. It is founded on a declarative language for the representation of interactive narratives called Narrative Structure Language (NSL). A complete software system for authoring and delivery and a number of productions realised with it, some in the public domain, validated the approach. This paper focuses on NSL and the authoring component of the software system.
