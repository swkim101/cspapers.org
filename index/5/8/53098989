Real-time emotion detection has being attracted to human attention recently. Recognizing the inner emotion not only assists people to communicate and understand with each other, but also prevents the occurrence of the serious diseases (e.g., autism) and the emergency (i.e., child abuse, sexual invasion). Existing works usually adopt the professional and cumbersome devices to learn the emotions, and therefore limited in the daily usage. In this work, we design a pervasive and wearable device E-See that enables to recognize the emotion in real time. The prototype of the device is deployed in a microcomputer currently, and it can be resized as a small button worn on the collar or extend as a platform to detect the real-time emotion.
