With the amount of data has been rapidly growing over recent decades, binary hashing has become an attractive approach for fast search over large databases, in which the high-dimensional data such as image, video or text is mapped into a low-dimensional binary code. Searching in this hamming space is extremely efficient which is independent of the data size. A lot of methods have been proposed to learn this binary mapping. However, to make the binary codes conserves the input information, previous works mostly resort to mean squared error, which is prone to lose a lot of input information [11]. On the other hand, most of the previous works adopt the norm constraint or approximation on the hidden representation to make it as close as possible to binary, but the norm constraint is too strict that harms the expressiveness and flexibility of the code. In this paper, to generate desirable binary codes, we introduce two adversarial training procedures to the hashing process. We replace the L2 reconstruction error with an adversarial training process to make the codes reserve its input information, and we apply another adversarial learning discriminator on the hidden codes to make it proximate to binary. With the adversarial training process, the generated codes are getting close to binary while also conserves the input information. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both supervised and unsupervised hashing applications and achieves a new state of the arts result on many image hashing benchmarks.
