The aggregate server method is an approximate, iterative technique for analyzing the delays programs encounter while waiting for entry into critical sections, non-reentrant subroutines, and similar software structures that cause processing to become serialized. The method employs a conventional product form queueing network comprised of servers that represent actual I/O devices and processors, plus additional aggregate servers that represent serialized processing activity. The parameters of the product form network are adjusted iteratively to account for contention among serialized and non-serialized customers at each physical device.
