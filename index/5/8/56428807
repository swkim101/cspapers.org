Edible oil quality is related to people healthy,existing technology can't realize the convenient and fast detection.This paper studied on the basis of the interdigital capacitance sensor,based on the dielectric constant measurement principle ,used to detect edible oil electrical parameter.Useing capacitance AD7746 digital conversion chip,at the same time AD7746 utilizes I 2 C serial interface protocol and communicates with micro controller PIC18F452 single chip, achieving capacitance data acquisition and processing,form a shortcut edible oil detection system of high accuracy in real time.
