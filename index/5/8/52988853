We present Maelstrom, a new system for mitigating and recovering from datacenter-level disasters. Maelstrom provides a trafﬁc management framework with modular, reusable primitives that can be composed to safely and ef-ﬁciently drain the trafﬁc of interdependent services from one or more failing datacenters to the healthy ones. Maelstrom ensures safety by encoding inter-service dependencies and resource constraints. Maelstrom uses health monitoring to implement feedback control so that all speciﬁed constraints are satisﬁed by the trafﬁc drains and recovery procedures executed during disaster mitigation. Maelstrom exploits parallelism to drain and restore independent trafﬁc sources efﬁciently. We verify the correctness of Maelstrom’s disaster mitigation and recovery procedures by running large-scale tests that drain production trafﬁc from entire datacenters and then retore the trafﬁc back to the datacenters. These tests (termed drain tests) help us gain a deep understanding of our complex systems, and provide a venue for continually improving the reliability of our infrastructure. Maelstrom has been in production at Facebook for more than four years, and has been successfully used to mitigate and recover from 100+ datacenter outages.
