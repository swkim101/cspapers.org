In this paper, we describe a novel nonlinear control strategy for the closed-loop control of extensible continuum robots. Previous attempts at controlling continuum robots have proved difficult due to the complexity of their system dynamics. Taking advantage of a previously developed dynamic model for a three-section, planar, continuum manipulator, we develop an adaptation-based control law. We present simulation results of a set-point tracking between a rigid-link control device and an extensible continuum manipulator. Experimental results of the controller implemented on a six degree-of-freedom continuum robot are also presented.
