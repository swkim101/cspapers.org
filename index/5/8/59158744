Understanding fashion images has been advanced by benchmarks with rich annotations such as DeepFashion, whose labels include clothing categories, landmarks, and consumer-commercial image pairs. However, DeepFashion has nonnegligible issues such as single clothing-item per image, sparse landmarks (4∼8 only), and no per-pixel masks, making it had significant gap from real-world scenarios. We fill in the gap by presenting DeepFashion2 to address these issues. It is a versatile benchmark of four tasks including clothes detection, pose estimation, segmentation, and retrieval. It has 801K clothing items where each item has rich annotations such as style, scale, view- point, occlusion, bounding box, dense landmarks (e.g. 39 for ‘long sleeve outwear’ and 15 for ‘vest’), and masks. There are also 873K Commercial-Consumer clothes pairs. The annotations of DeepFashion2 are much larger than its counterparts such as 8× of FashionAI Global Challenge. A strong baseline is proposed, called Match R- CNN, which builds upon Mask R-CNN to solve the above four tasks in an end-to-end manner. Extensive evaluations are conducted with different criterions in Deep- Fashion2. DeepFashion2 Dataset will be released at : https://github.com/switchablenorms/DeepFashion2
