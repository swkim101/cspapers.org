We propose OmniEyeball (OEB), which is a novel interactive 360째 image I/O system. It integrates the spherical display system with an omnidirectional camera to enable both capturing the 360째 panoramic live streaming video as well as displaying it. We also present its unique application for symmetric 360째 video communication by utilizing two OEB terminals, which may solve the narrow field-of-view problem in video communication. In addition, we designed a vision-based touch detection technique as well as some features to support 360째 video communication.
