This research presents novel algorithms for online multi-robot exploration to achieve full coverage of unknown environments. The focus has been on using small teams of basic robots with limited capabilities and restricted communication. We show the performance compared to other algorithms through simulation and physical robot experiments. We also conducted theoretical analysis to show the algorithms provide a guarantee of full coverage.
