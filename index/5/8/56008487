Distributed search is an important processing to solve problems in distributed cooperative systems. As fundamental research of distributed cooperative problem solving, distributed constraint optimization problems (DCOPs) have been studied. For the DCOPs, exact distributed search algorithms that are based on pseudotrees have been proposed. In the search algorithms, tree-searches and dynamic programming methods are performed using an order of variables defined by the pseudo-trees. However, analyzing the behaviors of search algorithms is relatively difficult due to the distributed processing. In this study, we show a representation of the essential computation contained in search algorithms based on pseudo-trees. Using the representations of the computation, a basic algorithm that contains a relatively clear data-flow of the processing is composed. This representation can be considered a basis of analyzing the dependency of the processing and deriving actual distributed algorithms.
