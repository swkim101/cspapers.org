Every time I re-use a handout, I look it over and make a few little "improvements". I play around with code demos and entertain myself with different slide transitions. However, inevitably, I return to the conclusion that most of what my students learn in my course comes from the assignments. Great assignments are hard to dream up and time-consuming to develop. With that in mind, the Nifty Assignments session is all about promoting and sharing the ideas and ready-to-use materials of successful assignments.
