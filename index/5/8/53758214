This paper reviews the development of subject information gateways within the UK Higher Education community. The paper describes the eLib programme, which was responsible for the development of a range of gateways. The progression of several gateways from relatively simple catalogues of Internet resources to subject communities incorporating supplementary search engines is outlined. The paper concludes with suggestions for future developments for the gateways.
