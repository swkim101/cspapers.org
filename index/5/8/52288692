In this paper, we adapt the Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) method proposed in [1] to efficiently handle the case of spherical and two revolute joints, this kind of joints is very common in modern robotic systems. The new formulations provide more tight motion bounds, thus increase the success rate of checking collision-free paths. We also propose an extension to get the minimum distance to obstacles along a path, this information is primordial as it allows sampling-based motion planning techniques to sort collision-free paths according to their minimum clearance. We have integrated our implementation into a sampling-based motion planning technique and validated it through simulation and on the real Baxter research robot. The experiments revealed that the method not only does not miss any collision between the robot and the obstacles, but also the minimum distance extension provides the path with the maximum clearance at no additional computational cost.
