In industries, measuring the parameters of machines is still a tedious process which is carried out by some human personnel. This paper mainly focuses on the remedial measures made to reduce human interaction with machines by using Industrial monitoring robot. This robot is hanged over the ropes to measure the parameters of machines in aerial mode. During its travel, the robot collects the parameters from the machines and transmits to control room using ZIG-BEE protocol. The control room interface with the robot is designed using MATLAB GUI model. MATLAB GUI interface shows the parameter readings from the robot and plotted in graph. The robot mainly observes temperature, smoke, toxic gases, Light intensity, defect in manufacturing machines, security purposes using cameras. Any abnormal change in the parameters can be viewed in the graph and remedial measures can be made immediately without any delay, this prevents machine damage to a greater extent. This robot is also used to indicate hazardous conditions like fire, leakage of pipes etc. to the control room using buzzers.
