This project seeks to generate small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) flight paths that are broadly understood by the general population and can communicate states about both the sUAS and its understanding of the world. Previous work in sUAS flight paths has sought to communicate intent, destination, or emotion of the system without focusing on concrete states (e.g., low battery, landing, etc.). This work leverages biologically-based flight paths and experimental methodologies from human-human and human-humanoid robot interactions to assess the understanding of avian flight paths to communicate sUAS states to novice users. If successful, this work should inform: the human-robot interaction community about the perception of flight paths, sUAS manufacturers on how their systems could communicate with both operators and bystanders, and end users on ways to communicate with others when flying systems in public spaces. General design implications and future directions of work are suggested to build on the results here, which suggest that novice users gravitate towards labels they understand (draw attention and landing) while avoiding more technical labels (lost sensor).
