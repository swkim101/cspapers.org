We design a Practical and Privacy-Aware Truth Discovery (PPATD) approach in mobile crowd sensing systems, which supports users to go offline at any time while still achieving practical efficiency under working process. More notably, our PPATD is the first solution under single server setting to resolve the problem that users must be online at all times during the truth discovery. Moreover, we design a double-masking with one-time pads protocol to further ensure the strong security of users' privacy even if there is a collusion between the cloud server and multiple users.
