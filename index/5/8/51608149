Over the last decades Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers based on

conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) have developed to the point

where they can handle formulas with millions of variables. Yet a

deeper understanding of how these solvers can be so successful has

remained elusive. In this work we shed light on CDCL performance by

using theoretical benchmarks, which have the attractive features of

being a) scalable, b) extremal with respect to different proof search

parameters, and c) theoretically easy in the sense of having short

proofs in the resolution proof system underlying CDCL. This allows for

a systematic study of solver heuristics and how efficiently they

search for proofs. We report results from extensive experiments on a

wide range of benchmarks. Our findings include several examples where

theory predicts and explains CDCL behaviour, but also raise a number

of intriguing questions for further study.
