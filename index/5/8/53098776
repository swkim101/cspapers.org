Air pollution is a major cause of health problem in urban areas. Vehicles are the major sources of the current air pollution in urban cities. In this work, we proposed a pollution monitoring system for vehicles using IoTs. This system measures the real-time pollution generated by vehicles on road. This paper describes the design of the system for sensing the pollution using sensor, arduino, smart phone and mobile applications for displaying the personalize air pollution information for individual vehicle. We evaluate the proposed approach on real-data experiment and it shows some preliminary results.
