Motivated by a high demand for automated inspection of civil infrastructure, this work presents an efficient design and development of a tank-like robot for structural health monitoring. Unlike most existing magnetic wheeled mobile robot designs, which may be suitable for climbing on flat steel surface, our proposed tank-like robot design uses reciprocating mechanism and roller-chains to make it capable of climbing on different structural shapes (e.g., cylinder, cube) with coated or non-coated steel surfaces. The developed robot is able to pass through the joints and transition from one surface to the other (e.g., from flat to curving surfaces). Taking into account several strict considerations (including tight dimension, efficient adhesion and climbing flexibility) to adapt with various shapes of steel structures, a prototype tank-like robot integrating multiple sensors (hall-effects, sonars, inertial measurement unit, Eddy current and cameras), has been developed. Rigorous analysis of robot kinematics, adhesion force, sliding failure and turn-over failure has been conducted to demonstrate the stability of the proposed design. Mechanical and magnetic force analysis together with sliding/turn-over failure investigation can serve as an useful framework for designing various steel climbing robots in the future. The robot is integrated with cameras and Eddy current sensor for visual and in-depth fatigue crack inspection of steel structures. Experimental results and field deployments confirm the adhesion, climbing, inspection capability of the developed robot.
