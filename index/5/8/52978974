We demonstrate a haptic feedback method to generate multiple virtual textures on analog buttons of the gamepad. The method utilizes the haptic illusion evoked from proper haptic cues in respect of the analog button's movement to change the perceived physical property of the button. Two types of analog buttons, joystick and trigger button on the gamepad is augmented with localized haptic feedback. We implemented two virtual textures for each type of analog button, and these textures could be programmatically controlled reflecting the dynamic game situations. We also demonstrate a two-player shooter game to show the dynamic texture representation of customized gamepad could enrich the game experience.
