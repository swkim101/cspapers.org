Micro-assembly is a challenging issue for automation due to particularities of micro-world physics and limitations on sensors. Consequently, most applications are human-operated often with basic joystick-like interfaces. Beside being nonintuitive, these solutions do not provide their users with a meaningful insight into the microworld. This paper proposes a novel intuitive remote handling interface, using a classical hand-held assembly tool as a paradigm. The master device is a portable instrumented tweezers with one active degree of freedom. Its spatial motion, tracked by optical means, controls the slave kinematics while its pinch commands the slave robot's microgripper and provides haptic feedback. Different coupling strategies using position or speed variables are demonstrated.
