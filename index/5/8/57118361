The third international workshop on Search-Driven Development: Users, Infrastructure, Tools and Evaluation (SUITE 2011) focuses on exploring the notion of search as a fundamental activity during software development. As software development is a process of both information creation and information gathering, software developers are constantly engaged in activities that search for the pertinent information to solve their problems at hand. The information needs of software developers range from those related to code (writing, changing, fixing, communicating code) to process (design) and people (colleagues). SUITE is a workshop series that seek to understand and find solutions to address such a wide range of software developers' information needs. 
 
The goal of the workshop is to identify the search driven nature of software development as a key research topic. Topics related to search driven development range from core technical issues to human aspects. Therefore, SUITE 2011 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with diverse interests and backgrounds in Software Engineering, Human Computer Interaction, Information Retrieval etc. SUITE 2011 aims to attract and foster a community of researchers who are interested in understanding and fulfilling various information needs during software development. SUITE 2011 will be a venue to discuss the problems and state-of-the-art; share ideas and results; and, set future directions in the area of Search-Driven development.
