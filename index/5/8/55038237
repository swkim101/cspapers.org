Aiming at the subjectivity and ambiguity problems of historical seismic intensity determination, a k-means clustering determination method combined with ant algorithm is proposed in this paper. Intensity features are extracted based on the latest historical seismic intensity table and the quantization process of historical earthquake records is dynamically adjusted by using exponential fitting method. The sensitivity problem of initial cluster centers in k-means clustering is resolved by using ant algorithm. Simulation results prove that the proposed method has high accuracy and practicality.
