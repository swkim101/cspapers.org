We present advanced data structures and algorithms for fast and high-quality global and detailed routing in modern technologies. Global routing is based on a combinatorial approximation scheme for min-max resource sharing. Detailed routing uses exact shortest path algorithms, based on a shape-based data structure for pin access and a two-level track-based data structure for long-distance connections. All algorithms are very fast. We demonstrate their superiority over traditional approaches by a comparison to an industrial router (on 32nm and 22nm chips). Our router is over two times faster, has 5% less netlength, 20% less vias, and reduces detours by more than 90%.
