OF THE THESIS Large Scale Circuit Partitioning With Loose/Stable Net Removal And Signal Flow Based Hierarchical Clustering by Sung Kyu Lim Master of Science in Computer Science University of California, Los Angeles, 1997 Professor Jason Cong, Chair In this thesis, we present an e cient large-scale circuit partitioning algorithm called FMLSRb that combines a signal ow based Maximum Fanout Free Subgraph (MFFS) clustering and iterative improvement based Loose and Stable net Removal (LSR) partitioning. The MFFS based clustering approach [CLL+97] generalizes the existing MFFC decomposition method [CD93] from combinational to sequential circuits, which enables us to handle cycles in circuits naturally and make hierarchical clustering and declustering possible. We also study the properties of the nets that straddle the cutline carefully and introduce the concept of loose and stable nets. The LSR based partitioning approach does not require lookahead capability such as LA3 [Kri84] or locality promoting enhancement such as LIFO bucket [HHK95], which are necessary for most existing iterative improvement based partitioning algorithms. The FM-LSRb algorithm has achieved the best cutsize result among all the iterative improvement based partitioning algorithms reported in the literature. In particular, it outperforms the state-of-the-art GMetis [AHK96], LA3-CDIP [DD96], and CLIP-PROPf [DD96] by 9.7%, 12.7%, and 7.1%, respectively. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art noniterative improvement partitioning algorithms Paraboli [RDJ94] and FBB [YW94] by 30.0% and 17.2%, respectively. viii
