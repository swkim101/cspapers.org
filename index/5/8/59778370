The ACM CIKM08 Workshop on Web Information and Data Management (WIDM 2008) is the tenth in a series of workshops on Web Information and Data Management held in conjunction with the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). The objective of the workshop is to bring together researchers, industrial practitioners, and developers to study how Web information can be extracted, stored, analyzed, and processed to provide useful knowledge to the end users for various advanced database applications. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for all experts in the field. 
 
The call for papers resulted in the submission of 53 papers from 22 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, China, Chile, France, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. 
 
Starting from 2005, the workshop has a one-day schedule. All papers were thoroughly reviewed by the program committee and external reviewers. This year, the program committee accepted 20 papers, resulting in a competitive 38% acceptance rate. The 20 accepted papers were divided into 4 sessions: "Data Mining and Clustering", "System Issues", "Web 2.0 and Social Networks", and "Ranking and Similarity Search".
