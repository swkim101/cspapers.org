It is well known that sensors using strain gauges have a potential dependency on temperature. This creates temperature drift in the measurements of six axis force torque sensors (F/T). The temperature drift can be considerable if an experiment is long or the environmental conditions are different from when the calibration of the sensor was performed. Other in situ methods disregard the effect of temperature on the sensor measurements. Experiments performed using the humanoid robot platform iCub show that the effect of temperature is relevant. The model based in situ calibration of six axis force torque sensors method is extended to perform temperature compensation.
