Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) has proven to be a viable solution to the challenges related to abstraction mismatches between the problem and solution spaces. In many cases, DSM assists in the generation of final products from high-level models that are specific to a domain in terms of abstractions and representation. This automation is possible because both the language and generators are tailored for one domain. This paper introduces DSM and describes the related workshop at SPLASH 2012 (23-24 October 2012, Tuscon, AZ).
