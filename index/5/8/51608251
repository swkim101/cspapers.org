Multi-view clustering has played a vital role in real-world applications. It aims to cluster the data points into different groups by exploring complementary information of multi-view. A major challenge of this problem is how to learn the explicit cluster structure with multiple views when there is considerable noise. To solve this challenging problem, we propose a novel Robust Auto-weighted Multi-view Clustering (RAMC), which aims to learn an optimal graph with exactly k connected components, where k is the number of clusters. â„“1-norm is employed for robustness of the proposed algorithm. We have validated this in the later experiment. The new graph learned by the proposed model approximates the original graphs of each individual view but maintains an explicit cluster structure. With this optimal graph, we can immediately achieve the clustering results without any further post-processing. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm the superiority and robustness of the proposed algorithm.
