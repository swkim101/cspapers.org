It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the ninth edition of the International Workshop on Dynamic Analysis (WODA 2011). WODA has a history of bringing together researchers and practitioners working in all areas of dynamic analysis to discuss new issues, share results and ongoing work, and foster collaborations. 
 
Seven papers were selected for presentation out of the sixteen submissions. In addition, the program includes an invited talk by Ben Liblit.
