Advising farmers and managing schedules of farming activities by Muda Agricultural Development Authority (MADA) are manually done by publishing notices on notice boards for each area. MADA staff also broadcast farming scheduling information to farmers using mobile loud speaker while driving through each area. Currently, farmers depend on weather forecast information such as local weather websites, and TV and radio weather forecast for planning of farming activities. Weather forecast is important to farmers because adverse weather conditions would affect the farming activities. Currently, no computerized support application that can replace the manual method of helping the farming community to manage their daily farming activities and provide accurate weather forecast information is available. Our proposed platform, GreenEve2Peace is designed to advise farmers on paddy planting acivities as well as to manage farming activities by providing inexpensive and fast delivery of information to farmers
