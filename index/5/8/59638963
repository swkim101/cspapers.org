The past several years have seen much progress in the area of propositional reasoning and satisfiability testing. There is a growing consensus by researchers on the key technical challenges that need to be addressed in order to maintain this momentum. This paper outlines concrete technical challenges in the core areas of systematic search, stochastic search, problem encodings, and criteria for evaluating progress in this area.
