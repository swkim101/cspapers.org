On behalf of the MICRO organizing committee, we are very pleased to welcome you to Istanbul, Turkey, for the 35th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-35). Istanbul is a jewel of a city, combining the magnificent historical treasures of past civilizations with the life of a modem metropolis.Over the years, MICRO has proved itself to be the premier technical forum on microarchitecture, and this year is no exception: MICRO-35 will feature outstanding keynote speeches by Tilak Agerwala (Vice President, Systems, IBM Research) and by Justin R. Rattner (Intel Fellow and Director, Microprocessor Research, Intel Labs). The MICRO-35 technical program, as usual, will be of very high quality. This year, we had 150 papers submitted (another record for MICRO), out of which 36 were accepted. MICRO-35 includes six tutorials on exciting topics of current interest: asynchronous and partially asynchronous microprocessor design, thermal management in microprocessors, compilation for the Itanium, network processors, and microarchitecture simulation tools. There will also be four cutting-edge workshops on the topics of EPIC architectures and compilers, media and stream processors, multithreading, and application-specific processors.We have encouraged students to attend MICRO-35 and to submit papers. We created a new Student Advocate position this year with the goal of ensuring that we are providing the right opportunities for the students who will become the next generation of researchers in our field. We are very grateful to Haldun Hadimioglu for serving in this position. We will be offering many travel grants for students and junior faculty, thanks to the generous support MICRO-35 has received this year. There will also be best student paper and best student presentation awards in MICRO-35's technical program. The ACM and IEEE have graciously agreed to provide free memberships to the award-winning student authors.
