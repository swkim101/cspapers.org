Most Internet-sites are subjected to a huge portion of load from casual visitors who use and view free content, to an extent that the performance of paid users often degrades. Giving such a situation can we device schemes without increasing infrastructure, such that the requests can be distinguished at application-level i.e. based on user type or business functionality or both? Currently, the application servers that host business logic do not have differential Quality of Service (QoS) support. With this in mind, we build a prototype QoS infrastructure on the open-source application server JBoss 2.4. The paper will describe the architectural components in building the differential QoS infrastructure present the appropriate theoretical background and empirical observations with the QoS infrastructure. This idea can be effectively applied in the Enterprise context to give a quantifiable performance boost in-terms of throughput and response times for preferred request classes.
