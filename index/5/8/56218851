We investigate the role that geometric, textual and visual features play in the task of predicting a preposition that links two visual entities depicted in an image. The task is an important part of the subsequent process of generating image descriptions. We explore the prediction of prepositions for a pair of entities, both in the case when the labels of such entities are known and unknown. In all situations we found clear evidence that all three features contribute to the prediction task.
