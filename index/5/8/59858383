Learning outcomes of software engineering-based courses require assessors to design assessment questions matching defined cognitive levels. This is to ensure students who take software engineering courses are assessed effectively and are imparted with the right level of knowledge and skill-sets. This paper outlines the application of Bloom's Taxonomy in software engineering assessment and the matching of assessments with learning outcomes. Sample questions are given and categorized according to the relevant Bloom's Taxonomy levels. This paper aims to assist software engineering teaching and learning; and improve the quality of software engineering assessment.
