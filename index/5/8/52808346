Decentralized and unstructured peer-to-peer networks such as Gnutella are attractive for certain applications because they require no centralized directories and no precise control over network topology or data placement. However, the flooding-based query algorithm used in Gnutella does not scale; each query generates a large amount of traffic and large systems quickly become overwhelmed by the query-induced load. This paper explores, through simulation, various alternatives to Gnutella's query algorithm, data replication strategy, and network topology. We propose a query algorithm based on multiple random walks that resolves queries almost as quickly as Gnutella's flooding method while reducing the network traffic by two orders of magnitude in many cases. We also present simulation results on a distributed replication strategy proposed in [8]. Finally, we find that among the various network topologies we consider, uniform random graphs yield the best performance.
