"Seldom was any knowledge given to keep, but to impart; the grace of this rich jewel is lost in concealment." -- Bishop Hall At the SIGCSE Symposiums in 2007 and 2011, we presented panels in which seasoned teachers shared the teaching tips we wished we'd known before starting our careers. The difference from earlier "Teaching Tips" panels was that our suggestions were meant to be hidden gems less often highlighted by our colleagues or by some of the best-known teaching resources. We clustered these tips into categories: Grading, Lecturing, Office (hours), Staff (mentoring), Exams (authoring & administering), Labs (authoring & running), Section (TA-led discussion), Projects (and homework; authoring & supporting), Classroom (organization, interactions, and incentives), Personal (fostering relationships), and Meta (advice spanning categories). The sessions were received quite well, and the audience contributed many of their own teaching tips throughout the presentations. This year, we're presenting a "High School edition", and have invited inspirational teachers from a broad variety of schools. The position statements that follow offer a random sampling of two of these "hidden" pearls; presenters will share many more during the session, and time will be provided for audience participation. We'll endeavor to capture all the tips for the online collection.
