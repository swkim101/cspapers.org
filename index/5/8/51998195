Research in human teamwork shows that a key element of fluid and fluent interactions is the interpretation of implicit verbal and non-verbal cues in context. This poses an issue to robotic platforms, however, as they have historically worked best when controlled through explicit commands that have employed structured, unequivocal representations of the external world and their human partners. In this work, we present a framework for effectively grounding situated and naturalistic speech to action selection during human-robot collaborative activities. This is accomplished by maintaining and incrementally updating separate “speech” and “context” models that jointly classify a collaborator's utterance. We evaluate the efficacy of the system on a collaborative construction task with an autonomous robot and human participants. We first demonstrate that our system is capable of acquiring and deploying new task representations from limited and naturalistic data sets, and without any prior domain knowledge of language or the task itself. Finally, we show that our system is capable of significantly improving performance on an unfamiliar task after a one-shot exposure.
