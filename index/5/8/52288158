Ahstract- This paper presents a new method to generate vibration free rest-to-rest (RTR) trajectories for configuration dependent dynamic systems, such as robots, cranes or machine tools. The new method named 3-Segmented Input Shaping is based on a combination of the widely known Input Shaping method and a new trajectory segmentation strategy for piece wise shaping of the trajectory. The new segmentation strategy facilitates the capability of accounting for variations in system dynamics during motion by shaping acceleration and deceleration profiles with individual frequencies. In this paper the new segmentation strategy is used in combination with the bang-coast-bang (BCB) trajectory. The generated trajectories are described in closed form, hence requires no optimization and thereby provides strong computational performance. The new method is verified by numerical simulations and detailed analysis and shows great potential in vibration-free RTR trajectory generation for systems with configuration dependent dynamics.
