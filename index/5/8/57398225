b this paper we present a case for using new power-aware metn.cs for determining routes in wireless ad hoc networks. We present five ~erent metriw based on battery power consumption at nodw. We show that using th=e metrics in a shortest-cost routing algorithm reduces the cost/packet of routing packets by 5-30% over shortwt-hop routing (this cost reduction is on top of a 40-70% reduction in energy consumption obtained by using PAMAS, our MAC layer prtocol). Furthermore, using these new metrics ensures that the mean time to node failure is increased si~cantly. An interesting property of using shortest-cost routing is that packet delays do not increase. Fintiy, we note that our new metrim can be used in most tradition routing protocols for ad hoc networks.
