Object class labelling is the task of annotating images with labels on the presence or absence of objects from a given class vocabulary. Simply asking one yes-no question per class, however, has a cost that is linear in the vocabulary size and is thus inefficient for large vocabularies. Modern approaches rely on a hierarchical organization of the vocabulary to reduce annotation time, but remain expensive (several minutes per image for the 200 classes in ILSVRC). Instead, we propose a new interface where classes are annotated via speech. Speaking is fast and allows for direct access to the class name, without searching through a list or hierarchy. As additional advantages, annotators can simultaneously speak and scan the image for objects, the interface can be kept extremely simple, and using it requires less mouse movement. As annotators using our interface should only say words from a given class vocabulary, we propose a dedicated task to train them to do so. Through experiments on COCO and ILSVRC, we show our method yields high-quality annotations at 2.3x âˆ’14.9x less annotation time than existing methods.
