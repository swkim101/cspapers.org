Herein, we survey a number of the latest Organic User Interfaces (OUIs) and discuss how these novel designs can be adopted to help build the next generation of domestic ubiquitous environments (smart homes). Our focus is specifically on domestic spaces, considering how surrounding surfaces (walls, floors, tables and ceilings) and interior objects (furniture, home accessories, appliances and fixtures) can, and might, through the use of smart materials, become organic and adaptive user interfaces that may interactively and reactively change their colours, textures, or physical appearances. We believe that the future of HumanBuilding Interaction (HBI) will utilize OUIs to enhance user experience in domestic spaces in a way that adapts living environments to fit inhabitantsâ€™ idiosyncratic and personal preferences. Moreover, we begin to sketch out a few of the challenges to building digitally interactive furniture and objects such as supporting sustained user engagements over time and designing for daily use with both meaningful digital and physical representations.
