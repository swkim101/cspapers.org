The effective operation of free enterprise in creating the envisioned information service industry is dependent on three accomplishments: 1. The restructuring of our information processing industry to provide a clear separation among costs for computing, communications, and the development of information services. 2. The wide use of multi-access system concepts so that information services may share in the use of computer installations, and so their cost of construction is reasonable. 3. The development of public, message-switched communications services with adaquate provisions for information security.
