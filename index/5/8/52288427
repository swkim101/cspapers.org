Path clustering has found many applications in recent years. Common approaches to this problem use aggregates of the distances between points to provide a measure of dissimilarity between paths which do not satisfy the triangle inequality. Furthermore, they do not take into account the topology of the space where the paths are embedded. To tackle this, we extend previous work in path clustering with relative homology, by employing minimum homology area as a measure of distance between homologous paths in a triangulated mesh. Further, we show that the resulting distance satisfies the triangle inequality, and how we can exploit the properties of homology to reduce the amount of pairwise distance calculations necessary to cluster a set of paths. We further compare the output of our algorithm with that of DTW on a toy dataset of paths, as well as on a dataset of real-world paths.
