Pairwise learning refers to learning tasks with the associated loss functions depending on pairs of examples. Recently, pairwise learning has received increasing attention since it covers many machine learning schemes, e.g., metric learning, ranking and AUC maximization, in a unified framework. In this paper, we establish a unified generalization error bound for regularized pairwise learning without either Bernstein conditions or capacity assumptions. We apply this general result to typical learning tasks including distance metric learning and ranking, for each of which our discussion is able to improve the state-of-the-art results.Â
