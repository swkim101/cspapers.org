The concept of hierarchical scheduling is widely used for scheduling complex real-time systems that are composed of a number of components. In the conventional hierarchical scheduling framework, targeting hard real-time systems, the size of processor capacities assigned to components is derived based on the worst case execution times of tasks. In this paper, we present our ongoing work on bringing the notation of probabilistic execution times in the context of hierarchical scheduling and deriving probabilistic component processor requirements. When dealing with soft real-time systems, this approach can eliminate the unaffordable pessimism that exists in worst-case timing analyses.
