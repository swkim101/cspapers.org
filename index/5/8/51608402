Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent and transmit information in spikes, which is considered more biologically realistic and computationally powerful than the traditional Artificial Neural Networks. The spiking neurons encode useful temporal information and possess highly anti-noise property. The feature extraction ability of typical SNNs is limited by shallow structures. This paper focuses on improving the feature extraction ability of SNNs in virtue of powerful feature extraction ability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs can extract abstract features resorting to the structure of the convolutional feature maps. We propose a CNN-SNN (CSNN) model to combine feature learning ability of CNNs with cognition ability of SNNs. Â The CSNN model learns the encoded spatial temporal representations of images in an event-driven way. We evaluate the CSNN model on the handwritten digits images dataset MNIST and its variational databases. In the presented experimental results, the proposed CSNN model is evaluated regarding learning capabilities, encoding mechanisms, robustness to noisy stimuli and its classification performance. The results show that CSNN behaves well compared to other cognitive models with significantly fewer neurons and training samples. Our work brings more biological realism into modern image classification models, with the hope that these models can inform how the brain performs this high-level vision task.
