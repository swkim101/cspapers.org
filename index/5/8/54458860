On behalf of the Organizing Committee, I would like to welcome you to the 28th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference. We have selected a diverse, exciting program this year, and I trust you will find several items of interest, whether you are attending in person or reading the proceedings. ACSAC is about more than just sitting through a presentation or reading a paper however, and I would encourage you to interact with your peers in the security field, and strive to improve the state of security in our world. Don't be afraid to challenge old ideas, suggest new ones, or improve upon the status quo. Use ACSAC as an opportunity to learn, participate, network, and make a difference!
