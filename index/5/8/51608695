In order to address the overfitting problem caused by the small or simple training datasets and the large model’s size in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a novel Auto Adaptive Regularization (AAR) method is proposed in this paper. The relevant networks can be called AAR-CNNs. AAR is the first method using the “abstraction extent” (predicted by AE net) and a tiny learnable module (SE net) to auto adaptively predict more accurate and individualized regularization information. The AAR module can be directly inserted into every stage of any popular networks and trained end to end to improve the networks’ flexibility. This method can not only regularize the network at both the forward and the backward processes in the training phase, but also regularize the network on a more refined level (channel or pixel level) depending on the abstraction extent’s form. Comparative experiments are performed on low resolution ImageNet, CIFAR and SVHN datasets. Experimental results show that the AAR-CNNs can achieve state-of-the-art performances on these datasets.
