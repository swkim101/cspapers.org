In his SIGCSE 2007 keynote, Grady Booch exhorted us to share the "passion, beauty, joy and awe" (PBJA) of computing. This led to sessions that have provided a forum for sharing: What we've done: Highlighting successful PBJA initiatives the presenters have undertaken or seen and wish to trumpet; What we should do (curriculum): Pointing out where our curriculum is lacking in PBJA, and how to fix it; How we should do it (pedagogy): Sharing how a change in attitude/focus/etc. can make strides to improving PBJA.
 This year we've gathered educators whose intro class numbers are exploding or who have instituted very creative and successful paths into the major. In this panel we will explore best practices in these crucial early years, in terms of extolling the PBJA of computing.
