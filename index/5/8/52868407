The paper presents a methodology for the simulation of massive number of device-level transient faults. Fault injection locations and the gate around those locations are extracted and evaluated with SPICE. The extracted sub-circuits are exercised exhaustively while fault-injections are performed. Faulty behavior at the outputs of each sub-circuit is recorded in a dictionary, along with the associated input vector, fault-injection time, and location. The recorded logical errors are injected concurrent transient simulator is developed to allow simultaneous evaluation of a massive number of fault-injections, in a single simulation pass. The methodology is illustrated by a case study of MC68000 microprocessor.
