It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 5th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Types in Language Design and Implementation -- TLDI'10. The TLDI workshops are a continuation of the Types in Compilation -- TIC workshops, the first of which was held in 1997. Initially biennial, TLDI is now an annual workshop. This series of workshops brings together researchers working in all programming paradigms and areas influenced by types. The role of types in all aspects of language design, compiler construction, and software development has expanded greatly in recent years. Type systems, type-based analyses, and reasoning frameworks have led to new concepts in compilation techniques for modern programming languages, verification of safety and security properties of programs, program transformation and optimization, and many other areas. The mission of these workshops is to bring together researchers in all these areas to share novel ideas and stimulate interaction and discussion on the ever expanding use of types. 
 
The call for papers attracted 15 submissions from Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The program committee accepted 8 papers that cover a variety of topics, including typed compilation, low-level code, static analysis, and typed semantics.
