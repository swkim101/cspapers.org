We present a non-speculative solution for a coalescing store buffer in total store order (TSO) consistency. Coalescing violates TSO with respect to both conflicting loads and conflicting stores, if partial state is exposed to the memory system. Proposed solutions for coalescing in TSO resort to speculation-and-rollback or centralized arbitration to guarantee atomicity for the set of stores whose order is affected by coalescing. These solutions can suffer from scalability, complexity, resource-conflict deadlock, and livelock problems. A non-speculative solution that writes out coalesced cachelines, one at a time, over a typical directory-based MESI coherence layer, has the potential to transcend these problems if it can guarantee absence of deadlock in a practical way. There are two major problems for a non-speculative coalescing store buffer: i) how to present to the memory system a group of coalesced writes as atomic, and ii) how to not deadlock while attempting to do so. For this, we introduce a new lexicographical order. Relying on this order, conflicting atomic groups of coalesced writes can be individually performed per cache block, without speculation, rollback, or replay, and without deadlock or livelock, yet appear atomic to conflicting parties and preserve TSO. One of our major contributions is to show that lexicographical orders based on a small part of the physical address (sub-address order) are deadlock-free throughout the system when taking into account resource-conflict deadlocks. Our approach exceeds the performance and energy benefits of two baseline TSO store buffers and matches the coalescing (and energy savings) of a release-consistency store buffer, at comparable cost.
