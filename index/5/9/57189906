Generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) is a flexible block structured multi carrier modulation scheme and is the foremost contender for 5G physical layer. This transmission scheme reduced unwanted out-of-band (OOB) radiations emission at the cost of adding non-orthogonality, which in turn increased the bit error rate (BER). The usage of discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSSs) as prototype filters named as Multitaper GFDM (MGFDM) was found to improve the orthogonality of the system. In this paper, real time transmission of MGFDM is carried out using software defined radio (SDR) by implementing various channel estimation and synchronization algorithms. We employed all the correction algorithms using a windowed preamble to satisfy low OOB requirements. However, the high speed performance of MGFDM system is heavily effected by jitter noise, since it results in improper sampling instances. This article underlines the jitter noise power reduction using oversampling with the supported mathematical expressions and simulations. We observed that the integer oversampling would mitigate the noise power in linear fashion by increasing the sampling rate. The proposed theory is validated using National instruments (NI) universal software radio peripheral (USRP) 2953R hardware interfaced with Labview software.
