Three dimensional perception has drawn significant attention recently partly due to the success of Kinect and 3D lidar such as Velodyne. Although quite successful, they still have some limitations such as limited sensing range or high costs prohibiting them for small-scale outdoor applications. This paper presents a novel 3D scanning system by integrating a continuously rotating laser head with an omni-directional vision which offers a full 360â—¦ field of view with sweeping range measurements. An extrinsic calibration procedure is also proposed, in which point correspondences are being used instead of calibration object. Key benefits of the proposed system are 1) the capability to provide full 3D measurements after each revolution and 2) a real-time texture based 3D mapping. The paper presents the experimental results of prototype hardware for 3D point cloud generation with texture and feature detection. An open source implementation of real-time point cloud generation is also made available.
