In this paper, we consider backscatter modulation-based radio-frequency identification (RFID) communication with energy harvesting tags. In this regard, we consider the effects of energy harvesting on amplified backscattering and evaluate the average read probability of the RFID tags over fading channel scenarios. We then propose a heuristic transmit power policy optimization algorithm for the backscatter modulated signals at the active RFID tags. Both theoretical and simulation results which are in tight agreement with each other show that the use of active tags with energy harvesting capabilities significantly improve the average read probability performance of RFID communication.
