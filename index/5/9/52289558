Safety is essential for robots in unknown environments, especially when there is physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). Control over energy, or passivity, is an effective safety mechanism. However, when the control algorithm is implemented in a discrete-time computer, computation and communication delays readily lead to loss of passivity and to instability. In this paper, a way to make the actuators aware of the energy that they inject into the system is presented. Passivity and stability are then always guaranteed, even in situations of total communication loss. These Embedded Energy-Aware Actuators are a model-free passivity and safety layer that make complex robotic systems dependable, well-behaved and safe. The proposed method is validated in simulation and experiments.
