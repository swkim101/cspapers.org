In this work we investigate and present preliminary results for two methods for luminescence imaging of photovoltaic (PV) modules in outdoor conditions, with the aim of choosing the most suitable method for implementation on a drone PV plant inspection system. We examined experimentally both electroluminescence (EL) and photoluminescence (PL) PV module imaging methods under natural light conditions, and determined that fast pulsed EL imaging with InGaAs detector cameras can yield reasonably accurate results under daylight conditions. Moreover, we formulated the necessary requirement for a PL light source, which would allow PL imaging of modules under daylight conditions.
