Welcome to ACM MobiHoc 2010, the 11th ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing! ACM MobiHoc is the premier international symposium dedicated to addressing challenges emerging from wireless ad hoc networking and computing. The mission of the symposium is to bring together researchers and practitioners from a broad spectrum of wireless networking research to present the most up-to-date results and achievements in the field. 
 
As in previous years, the paper selection process was highly competitive. The call for papers attracted 157 submissions from Asia, Canada, Europe, and the United States. All papers were reviewed through a double blind review process. Each paper was reviewed by at least three program committee members not connected with the authors; most papers received four reviews and for some papers even five reviews were written. After the online-discussion phase, the top 57 papers were selected to be discussed in detail at the TPC meeting. The TPC meeting took place at Microsoft Research in Redmond on May 27 and 28, 2010 and 26 papers were selected for inclusion in the technical program. 
 
The technical program covers a variety of topics, including mobility, modeling and analysis, routing and forwarding, scheduling, security, sensor networking, and spectrum allocation. Wehope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for mobile networking researchers and practitioners. We hope that you will find this program interesting and thought-provoking and that the symposium will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.
