We consider the classic problem of scheduling jobs with precedence constraints on a set of identical machines to minimize the weighted completion time objective. Understanding the exact approximability of the problem when job lengths are uniform is a well known open problem in scheduling theory. In this paper, we show an optimal algorithm that runs in polynomial time and achieves an approximation factor of (2 + ) for the weighted completion time objective when the number of machines is a constant. The result is obtained by building on the lift and project approach introduced in a breakthrough work by Levey and Rothvoss [15] for the makespan minimization problem.
