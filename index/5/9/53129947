Deforming a cable to a desired (reachable) shape is a trivial task for a human to do without even knowing the internal dynamics of the cable. This paper proposes a framework for cable shapes manipulation with multiple robot manipulators. The shape is parameterized by a Fourier series. A local deformation model of the cable is estimated on-line with the shape parameters. Using the deformation model, a velocity control law is applied on the robot to deform the cable into the desired shape. Experiments on a dual-arm manipulator are conducted to validate the framework.
