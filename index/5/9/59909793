The ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Databases and Social Networks (DBSocial) aims to disseminate results founded on database research and practice that advance the state-of-the-art in the observation, management, and analysis of inherently networked data that results primarily from social phenomena. In particular, DBSocial is intended to foster a discussion about the role that the database community should play in the area of social network research. As such, DBSocial welcomes papers whose approaches are fundamentally centered on theoretical foundations and best practices in databases and very closely related areas such as data mining and information retrieval
