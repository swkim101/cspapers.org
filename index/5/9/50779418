Dockless shared bikes, which aim at providing a more flexible and convenient solution to the first-and-last mile connection, come into China and expand to other countries at a very impressing speed. The expansion of shared bike business in new cities brings many challenges among which, the most critical one is the parking chaos caused by too many bikes yet insufficient demands. To allow possible actions to be taken in advance, this paper studies the problem of detecting parking hotspots in a new city where no dockless shared bike has been deployed. We propose to measure road hotness by bike density with the help of the Kernal Density Estimation. We extract useful features from multi-source urban data and introduce a novel domain adaption network for transferring hotspots knowledge learned from one city with shared bikes to a new city. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with various baselines.
