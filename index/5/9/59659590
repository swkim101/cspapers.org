A diagnostic arrangement for controlling the isolation of the cause of fault conditions occurring in a data processor system having a pair of synchronously operating data processors for generating pairs of data signals, monitors the data signals for fault conditions and serves as a communication link between the processors. The arrangement includes an isolation control circuit for causing the pair of data processors to halt their normal processing operations and for causing them to initiate subsequently at least one series of predetermined operations and thus to generate sequentially a series of test signal conditions, a read only memory for storing correct signal conditions, and a matching circuit for comparing at least one of said second test signal conditions from the data processors with the correct signal condition stored in the read only memory to generate a match signal if the compared signal conditions are the same as the correct signal condition. A logic circuit detects a certain predetermined code contained in the correct signal condition stored in the read only memory and in response thereto controls selectively the series of predetermined operations of the data processors so that the data processors can either perform the entire series of operations in an uninterrupted manner, or can be incremented sequentially through a fewer number of the predetermined operational steps.
