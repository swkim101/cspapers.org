The Mobile Adhoc network applications are increasing every day due to the properties like infrastructure less nature, dynamic topology and multihop network. A set of rule that govern which path is to be followed from the source node to destination node is called routing protocol which can be further divided into number of other categories like proactive and reactive. This paper discusses the AODV, a kind of reactive routing protocol, for its study. But MANETs is also vulnerable to number of attacks due to its nature. A lot of work has been done to make it more secure. The work that is addressed in this paper is the selfish node attack and jellyfish attack on AODV routing protocol. The selfish node attack is a kind passive attack in which node does not participate in routing process by not forwarding the packets. And jellyfish attack is the sub type of black hole attack that delays or drops the packets for certain amount of time. This paper studies all the three types of jellyfishattack: Jellyfishreorder attack, jellyfishperiodic dropping attack and jellyfishdelay variance attack. In this work we study the impacts of some of the attacks on network under a short term military rescue mission like scenario. We will do a comparative analysis of three kinds of JellyfishAttacks with selfish Behaviour Attack under AODV routing protocol. The analysis will be made with respect to different network sizes and under the presence of different number of attackers in the network. The impact on the performance will be measured with suitable metrics to understand the nature of different attacks.
