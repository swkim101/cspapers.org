Activity-Based Computing [1] aims to capture the state of the user and its environment 
by exploiting heterogeneous sensors in order to provide adaptation to 
exogenous computing resources. When these sensors are attached to the subjectâ€™s 
body, they permit continuous monitoring of numerous physiological signals. This 
has appealing use in healthcare applications, e.g. the exploitation of Ambient Intelligence 
(AmI) in daily activity monitoring for elderly people. In this paper, 
we present a system for human physical Activity Recognition (AR) using smartphone 
inertial sensors. As these mobile phones are limited in terms of energy and 
computing power, we propose a novel hardware-friendly approach for multiclass 
classification. This method adapts the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
and exploits fixed-point arithmetic. In addition to the clear computational advantages 
of fixed-point arithmetic, it is easy to show the regularization effect of the 
number of bits and then the connections with the Statistical Learning Theory. A 
comparison with the traditional SVM shows a significant improvement in terms 
of computational costs while maintaining similar accuracy, which can contribute 
to develop more sustainable systems for AmI.
