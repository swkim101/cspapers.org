MD5 cryptographic hash function is greatly affected by collision vulnerability and as a result dramatically affects not only the security of the message but most importantly the integrity of the data. In this study, a new method for the padding process of the original message was introduced and additional operations on the internal processes are implemented. The result of the computing simulation indicates that the extension of the message block from 512 to 1024-bit blocks and expansion of the length of the resulting value per round from 32 to 64 bits together with added operations increases the security of the modified message digest hash function. An evaluation on the produced hash value has been conducted using the avalanche effect test that resulted to a value of 56.91 and randomness test to assess the randomization value into which a remarkable output of 56.45 and 55.93 respectively has been obtained into which it has considerably been attested that collision concern has been addressed.
