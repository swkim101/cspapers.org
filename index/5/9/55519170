The traditional process of scale anchoring only set several specific scores as anchoring points. It only causes ambiguous grading results. Furthermore, the skills and abilities used in solving tests, the applied indicators are abstract and obscure. Thus, in this paper, a smoothing method of arbitrary anchoring revised from scale anchoring is proposed to make tests more accurate in distinguishing test levels. It reflects the difficultness of test scores by the sum and hence easily shows the test levels. In addition, a library containing test items is set up to be shared and reused for users. The paper comes out with two conclusions: smoothing method of arbitrary anchoring can represent the levels of test items by all possible score points. Its scale anchoring could indicate exam's difficultness as well as the tester's ability of passing the test; the test items library could provide references for teachers doing proposition and give students a better adaptive learning environment.
