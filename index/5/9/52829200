We demonstrate E-Gesture, a collaborative architecture for energy-efficient gesture recognition on a hand-worn sensor device and an off-the-shelf smartphone that greatly reduces energy consumption while achieving high accuracy recognition under dynamic mobile situations. E-gesture employs a novel gesture segmentation and classification architecture carefully crafted by studying sporadic occurrence patterns of gestures in continuous sensor data streams and analyzing energy consumption characteristics in both sensor and smartphone.
