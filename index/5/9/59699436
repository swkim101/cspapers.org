Data analytics has the potential to be a transformer of scientific research, and data-driven business decisions. By effectively analyzing huge volumes of data, scientific research can be transformed from hypothesis-driven to data-driven, where forming scientific hypotheses will be aided by discovering patterns in vast quantities of data. For most technology companies that operate on a Web scale, analyzing customer data can provide insights on customer behavior, and lead to answers for critical business decisions. 
 
Cloud computing has emerged as a cost-effective and elastic computing paradigm. Cloud infrastructures scale to massive numbers of commodity computing nodes and provide adaptive provisioning without prohibitive initial investments. Data analytics has the potential to be a significant cloud application, and to constitute a large fraction of the workload of modern data centers. Designing the infrastructures and systems for data management in the new computing environments remains an open challenge.
