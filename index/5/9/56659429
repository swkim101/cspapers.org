The Fifth Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure in Statistical Translation (SSST-5) was held on 23 June 2011 following the ACL HLT 2011 conference in Portland, Oregon. Like the first four SSST workshops in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, it aimed to bring together researchers from different communities working in the rapidly growing field of structured statistical models of natural language translation.
