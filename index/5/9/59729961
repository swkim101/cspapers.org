It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the workshop on Search in Social Media (SSM 2008), co-located with CIKM 2008. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together academic and industry researchers in information retrieval and social media to consider the following questions: How should we search in social media? What are the needs of users, and models of those needs, specific to social media search? What models make the most sense? How does search interact with existing uses of social media? What works and what does not? 
 
The call for papers attracted 22 submissions, of which 10 papers were accepted as regular papers, and four papers were accepted as position papers. In addition, the program includes a panel on the future of search in social media, and a keynote speech by Andrew Tomkins, Chief Scientist of Search at Yahoo! on Challenges in Searching Social Media.
