This paper presents methodologies for interoperable annotation of events and event relations across different domains, based on notions proposed in prior work. In addition to the interoperability, our annotation scheme supports a wide coverage of events and event relations. We employ the methodologies to annotate events and event relations on Simple Wikipedia articles in 10 different domains. Our analysis demonstrates that the methodologies can allow us to annotate events and event relations in a principled manner against the wide variety of domains. Despite our relatively wide and ﬂexible annotation of events, we achieve high inter-annotator agreement on event annotation. As for event relations, we obtain reasonable inter-annotator agreement. We also provide an analysis of issues on annotation of events and event relations that could lead to annotators’ disagreement.
