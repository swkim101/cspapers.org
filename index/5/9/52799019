We describe Marquee, a pen-based video logging tool which enables users to correlate their personal notes and keywords with a videotape during recording. We present our observations about coordinating the task of logging in real time and describe the three phase, user-centered approach we took in designing the tool. Our early work explored the functionalities needed by users to successfully create a log. In the second phase we focused on testing our intuitions about logging by conducting user studies with paper mock-ups. In the final phase, we implemented a working prototype system and placed it in a setting to see if it supported people logging in real time.
