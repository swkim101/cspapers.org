This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of PID controller and implementation of PID by the microcontroller of PIC and the use of PWM in the DC controlling processes. First of all we use the PID controller to control a continuous process by using reasonable factors (P, I, D) in PID and PIC (18f452) will help us during this period of time and after that producing an adequate PWM signal for the use of our pomp to take the motor under our control. We have to use an appropriate IC such as L298 which is a motor driver.
