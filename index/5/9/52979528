With the spread of VR experiences using HMD, many proposals have been made to improve the experiences by providing tactile information to the fingertips. However, there are problems, such as difficulty attaching and detaching the devices and hindrances to free finger movement. To solve these issues, we developed "Haptopus," which embeds a tactile display in the HMD and presents tactile sensations to the face. In this paper, we conducted a preliminary investigation on the best suction pressure and compared Haptopus to conventional tactile presentation approaches. As a result, we confirmed that Haptopus improves the quality of the VR experience.
