The emergence of virtualization enabled hardware, such as the latest generation AMD and Intel processors, has raised significant interest in High Performance Computing (HPC) community. In particular, system-level virtualization provides an opportunity to advance the design and development of operating systems, programming environments, administration practices, and resource management tools. This leads to some potential research topics for HPC, such as failure tolerance, system management, and solution for application porting to new HPC platforms. 
 
The workshop on System-level Virtualization for HPC (HPCVirt 2009) is intended to be a forum for the exchange of ideas and experiences on the use of virtualization technologies for HPC, the challenges and opportunities offered by the development of system-level virtualization solutions themselves, as well as case studies in the application of system-level virtualization in HPC.
