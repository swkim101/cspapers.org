We present a fast face detection system that can detect faces rotated to any angle in the image plane. Our system has two major characteristics: 1) It is very fast. On a Pentium4 3GHz machine, the average detection time for faces which can be as small as 20x20 in a QVGA sized image is approximately 0.1 seconds. 2) It has a very low false detection rate. The false detection is less than 3 per 100 images.
