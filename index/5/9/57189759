In this paper, a design of a miniature and frequency tunable antenna is presented. By integrating a new design for thin film varactor base on Barium Strontium Titanate (Ba(1-x)SrxTiO3, BST) and MIM geometry we can achieve a miniaturization rate of 32% with respect to the initial antenna size (operating at 2.25 GHz without the MIM capacitor). On the other hand, the miniaturized antenna shows a frequency tunable rate of 7.2%.
