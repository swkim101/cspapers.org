In this paper, we develop an intelligent parking service based on the wireless sensors for public or private spaces. The low-cost sensor node that will monitor the car park field. The nodes will capture images of the park field and send periodically to the intelligent transport system. The system can be accessed by the mobile devices to perform various management functions, such as finding vacant parking lots, and statistic report. We have implemented a prototype of the service using Open CV library. The service evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our design and implementation of our solution, showing that the proposal service can manage parking places without impairs other services that can be performed in the intelligent transport system.
