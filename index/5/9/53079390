Event detection (ED) and word sense disambiguation (WSD) are two similar tasks in that they both involve identifying the classes (i.e. event types or word senses) of some word in a given sentence. It is thus possible to extract the knowledge hidden in the data for WSD, and utilize it to improve the performance on ED. In this work, we propose a method to transfer the knowledge learned on WSD to ED by matching the neural representations learned for the two tasks. Our experiments on two widely used datasets for ED demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
