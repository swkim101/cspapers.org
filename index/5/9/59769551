It is our great pleasure to present the proceedings of the Third ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security (PLAS 2008), which was held on June 8, 2008 in Tucson, Arizona, United States of America. PLAS 2008 was co-located with the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2008), and was sponsored by IBM Research and Microsoft Research. 
 
The call for papers attracted 24 submissions from leading researchers at locations around the world (compared to 18 submissions in 2006 and 28 in 2007). Overall, the submitted papers were quite strong, and the program committee ultimately accepted 13 papers (compared to 10 papers in 2006 and 14 in 2007), for an acceptance rate of 54% (compared to 56% in 2006 and 50% in 2007). The accepted papers at PLAS 2008 encompass a variety of topics, including: software verification, static and dynamic analysis for security-policy enforcement, information flow, language-based security, and software protection. 
 
This year, ACM SIGPLAN offered to publish the two top papers in a special issue of ACM SIGPLAN Notices. The Program Committee chose the papers A Type System for Data-Flow Integrity on Windows Vista, by Avik Chaudhuri, Prasad Naldurg, and Sriram Rajamani, and Verified Enforcement of Stateful Information Release Policies, by Nikhil Swamy and Michael Hicks.
