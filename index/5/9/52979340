In this paper we outline the design of a mixed-reality system to support object-focused remote collaboration. Here, being able to adjust collaborators' perspectives on the object as well as understand one another's perspective is essential to support effective collaboration over distance. We propose a low-cost mixed-reality system that allows users to: (1) quickly align and understand each other's perspective; (2) explore objects independently from one another, and (3) render gestures in the remote's workspace. In this work, we focus on the expert's role and we introduce an interaction technique allowing users to quickly manipulation 3D virtual objects in space.
