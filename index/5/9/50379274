Many real-time systems are naturally distributed and these distributed systems require not only highavailability but also timely execution of transactions. Consequently, eventual consistency, a weaker type of strong consistency is an attractive choice for a consistency level. Unfortunately, standard eventual consistency, does not contain any real-time considerations. In this paper we have extended eventual consistency with real-time constraints and this we call real-time eventual consistency. Followed by this new definition we have proposed a method that follows this new definition. We present a new algorithm using revision diagrams and fork-join data in a real-time distributed environment and we show that the proposed method solves the problem.
