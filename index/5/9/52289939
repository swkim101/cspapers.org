Sensor guided, automated systems require the composition of various sensors and data processing algorithms to obtain relevant information for performing their task. Many applications have additional requirements such as a certain accuracy, which has to be achieved despite sensor noise and calibration errors. In this paper we model the configuration of perception systems as a planning problem over probabilistic graphical models. We work on a subset of the full configuration space of perceptions systems, specifically the used sensors, data processing algorithms and view poses. Based on a semantic description of the goal, available sensors and data processing algorithms, our system plans perception steps and sensor data fusion autonomously. The planner operates by constructing a factor graph until the accuracy requirements of tasks are fulfilled or unobtainable with the available action set. We validate our approach in an industrial assembly scenario.
