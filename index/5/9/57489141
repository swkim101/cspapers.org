Welcome to the Thirty-Seventh Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, held Wednesday, January 20th, through Friday, January 22nd, 2010, in Madrid, Spain. This proceedings contains 39 contributed papers, selected from 207 submissions. 
 
Like at POPL 2008 and POPL 2009, each slot for a contributed talk at this year's POPL is twenty minutes long. 
 
The program committee members and external reviewers carried out their task with tremendous thoughtfulness and energy. Each paper received at least three reviews and a median of five reviews. We made the reviews available to the authors, who then had two days in which to submit a written response. Finally, the program committee had an intensive one-and-a-half-day meeting in Los Angeles. We permitted submissions from program committee members, subject to the guideline that they would be held to a higher standard than other submissions. We received thirteen PC submissions and we accepted one. 
 
Many in the POPL community look forward to the invited talks as some of the highlights of the meeting. This year we are lucky to be hearing from Neil Gershenfeld (MIT, USA) and Thomas A. Henzinger (IST, Austria).
