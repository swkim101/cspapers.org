CHI’15 Workshop 05 ”Collaborating with Intelligent Machines: Interfaces for Creative Sound”, April 18, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Abstract Sound and its creation are an inherently physical process, yet in the age of digital audio the physical part disappeared. Instead of working with the medium itself as, e.g., with vinyl records, the media player introduced a new level of abstraction. This new abstraction layer, however, rarely made use of our manual skills and instead forced us to work with simple binary buttons. The NIME community has created various interfaces that allow to use our manual skill to a higher extent, but only few of these developments made it to a broad market. With the separation of media player and controller, the DJ world has seen a slow transition from the traditional interfaces, mostly inspired by DJ CD players, towards hardware that supports a more creative approach and integrates features known from electronic music performance interfaces. The possible extensions on the software side are numerous, but they only work if complemented by an adapted physical interface. We present a design space to classify the existing approaches in physical interaction with audio and to discover potential opportunities for extensions.
