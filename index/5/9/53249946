Most popular web browsers include “reader modes” that improve the user experience by removing un-useful page elements. Reader modes reformat the page to hide elements that are not related to the page's main content. Such page elements include site navigation, advertising related videos and images, and most JavaScript. The intended end result is that users can enjoy the content they are interested in, without distraction. In this work, we consider whether the “reader mode” can be widened to also provide performance and privacy improvements. Instead of its use as a post-render feature to clean up the clutter on a page we propose SpeedReader as an alternative multistep pipeline that is part of the rendering pipeline. Once the tool decides during the initial phase of a page load that a page is suitable for reader mode use, it directly applies document tree translation before the page is rendered. Based on our measurements, we believe that SpeedReader can be continuously enabled in order to drastically improve end-user experience, especially on slow mobile connections. Combined with our approach to predicting which pages should be rendered in reader mode with 91% accuracy, SpeedReader achieves average speedups and bandwidth reductions of up to 27 × and 84 × , respectively. We further find that our novel “reader mode” approach brings with it significant privacy improvements to users. Our approach effectively removes all commonly recognized trackers, issues 115 fewer requests to third parties, and interacts with 64 fewer trackers on average, on transformed pages.
