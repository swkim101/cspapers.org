Sense is a responsive garment that visualizes the global phenomenon of coral bleaching. Sense examines the current scientific shift in which technology converges with biology and embody the beauty, power and fragility of nature. This project explores aesthetic territory at the intersection of traditional textile techniques and wearable technologies. In contemporary fashion design, biomimicry inspiration provides alternative ways to express and communicate in the networked, hybrid physical-digital domain, and the urge of dying coral reefs.
