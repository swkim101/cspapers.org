We present a new collaborative visual storytelling platform, Aesop, for direction and animation. Aesop consists of a language parser, human gesture monitoring, composition graphs, dialogue state manager, and an interactive 3D animation software. Aesop thus enables 3D spatial and temporal reasoning which are both essential for storytelling. Our key innovation is to enable conversational AI using both verbal and non-verbal communication, which enables research in language, vision, and planning.
