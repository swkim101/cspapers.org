In my thesis, I develop computational models for an agent providing intelligent decision support (IDS) during human team planning sessions. My focus is on the development of an agent that help a team of human planners reach an agreement and produce high-quality plans prior to plan execution. I intend to develop novel techniques for an IDS agent that can 1) infer the team's intended plan from their planning conversation, 2) predict parts of the plan where the team's shared understanding is weak, and 3) suggest a resolution strategy when plan conflicts occur among teammates.
