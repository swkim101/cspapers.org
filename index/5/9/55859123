In this paper, we describe the KYOTO project, which is a platform for establishing semantic interoperability across languages and cultures. Semantic interoperability is achieved in three ways: through a shared annotation format for representing text, through an interlinked repository of lexical resources and ontologies, and through a uniform system for mining text that enriches lexical resources and extracts new relations based on the ontology. Whereas most efforts focus on separate aspects of semantic interoperability, KYOTO implements a full knowledge cycle for sharing and exchanging knowledge by integrating these different operability layers. Sharing of knowledge as expressed in natural language is the genuine test for semantic interoperability.
