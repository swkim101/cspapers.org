In this paper we propose a new approach for efficient programming of grinding and polishing operation. In the proposed system, the initial policy is performed by a skilled operator and recorded with a passive digitizer. The demonstrated policy comprises both position and force data. The optimal robot execution of the task is provided by applying a virtual mechanism approach, which models the polishing/grinding tool as a serial kinematic chain. By joining the robot and the virtual mechanism in an augmented system, additional degrees of freedom are obtained and redundancy resolution can be applied to optimize the demonstrated motion. Another benefit of the proposed approach is that the same policy can be transferred to different combination of robots and grinding/polishing tools without any modification of the captured motion. The proposed approach requires known contact point between the treated object and the polishing/grinding tool. We propose a novel approach for accurate estimation of this point using data obtained from the force-torque sensor. Finally, the demonstrated path is refined to compensate for inaccurate calibration and different dynamics of a robot and the human demonstrator using iterative learning controller. The proposed method was verified in a real industrial environment.
