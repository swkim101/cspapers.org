In this paper we present an interface based on a recent generative model, the counting grid, here re-introduced in its basic version and largely revised to allow it to deal with large corpora. We show that it is possible to visualize thousands of high order word co-occurrence patterns by only viewing for a few minutes a new embedding we propose for text visualization, browsing and search purposes. We performed preliminary experiments with user tasks such as word spotting, rapid content search and collateral information acquisition
