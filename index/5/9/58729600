The control structure of a question-answering system is derived from a set of basic assumptions. For its design and implementation, a normal algorithmic language is used. The design leads to "symmetric" procedures, the resulting programs use the stack mechanism for recursion to give the correct storage allocation. Two strategies are discussed in more detail: a trivial well-known depth-first strategy and a new one, called flexible decision tree strategy. No linguistic aspects (either syntactic or semantic) of the system are discussed
