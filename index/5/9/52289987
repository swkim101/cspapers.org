This study examines human control of physical interaction with objects that exhibit complex (nonlinear, chaotic, underactuated) dynamics. We hypothesized that humans exploited stability properties of the human-object interaction. Using a simplified 2D model for carrying a “cup of coffee”, we developed a virtual implementation to identify human control strategies. Transporting a cup of coffee was modeled as a cart with a suspended pendulum, where humans moved the cart on a horizontal line via a robotic manipulandum. The specific task was to transport the cart-pendulum system to a target, as fast as possible, while accommodating assistive and resistive perturbations. To assess trajectory stability, we applied contraction analysis. We showed that when the perturbation was assistive, humans absorbed the perturbation by controlling cart trajectories into a contraction region prior to the perturbation. When the perturbation was resistive, subjects passed through a contraction region following the perturbation. Entering a contraction region stabilizes performance and makes the dynamics more predictable. This human control strategy could inspire more robust control strategies for physical interaction in robots.
