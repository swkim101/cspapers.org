The plethora of publicly available data sources has given birth to a wealth of new needs and opportunities. The ever increasing amount of data has shifted the analysts' attention from optimizing the operators for specific business cases, to focusing on datasets per se, selecting the ones that are most suitable for specific operators, i.e., they make an operator produce a specific output. Yet, predicting the output of a given operator executed for different input datasets is not an easy task: It entails executing the operator for all of them, something that requires excessive computational power and time. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel dataset profiling methodology that infers an operator's outcome based on examining the similarity of the available input datasets in specific attributes. Our methodology quantifies dataset similarities and projects them into a low-dimensional space. The operator is then executed for a mere subset of the available datasets and its output for the rest of them is approximated using Neural Networks trained using this space as input. Our experimental evaluation thoroughly examines the performance of our scheme using both synthetic and real-world datasets, indicating that the suggested approach is capable of predicting an operator's output with high accuracy. Moreover, it massively accelerates operator profiling in comparison to approaches that require an exhaustive operator execution, rendering our work ideal for cases where a multitude of operators need to be executed to a set of given datasets.
