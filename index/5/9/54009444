Arti ﬁ cial Intelligence is essential to achieve a reliable human-robot interaction, especially when it comes to manipulation tasks. Most of the state-of-the-art literature explores robotics grasping methods by focusing on the target object or the robot’s morphology, without including the environment. When it comes to human cognitive development approaches, these physical qualities are not only inferred from the object, but also from the semantic characteristics of the surroundings. The same analogy can be used in robotic affordances for improving objects grasps, where the perceived physical qualities of the objects give valuable information about the possible manipulation actions. This work proposes a framework able to reason on the object affordances and grasping regions. Each calculated grasping area is the result of a sequence of concrete ranked decisions based on the inference of different highly related attributes. The results show that the system is able to infer on good grasping areas depending on its affordance without having any a-priori knowledge on the shape nor the grasping points.
