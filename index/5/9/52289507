Small-object detection and avoidance in unknown environments is a significant challenge to overcome for small autonomous vehicles that are generally highly agile and restricted in payload and computational processing power. Typical machine-vision and range measurement based solutions suffer either from restricted fields-of-view or significant computational complexity and are not easily portable to small platforms. In this paper, a novel bio-inspired navigation technique is introduced that is modeled using analogues of the small-field motion-sensitive interneurons of the insect visuomotor system. The proposed technique achieves small-field object detection based on Fourier residual analysis of instantaneous optic flow. The small field signal is used to extract relative range and bearing of the nearest obstacle, which is then combined with an artificial potential function-based low-order steering control law. The proposed sensing and control scheme is experimentally validated with a quadrotor vehicle that is able to effectively navigate an unknown environment laden with small-field clutter. This bio-inspired approach is computationally efficient and serves as a robust, reflexive solution to the problem of small-object detection and avoidance for autonomous robots.
