In order to correctly evaluate semantic technologies,which have become widely adopted in recent years, we need to put evaluations under the scope of a unique software quality model.This paper presents a quality model for semantic technologies. First, some well-known software quality models are described,together with methods for extending them. Afterwards, a new method for extending quality models is proposed and it is then used to define a quality model for semantic technologies by extending the ISO 9126 quality model. Finally, the proposed model is validated by analyzing existing semantic technology evaluations.
