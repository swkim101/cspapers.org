Real data are often with multiple modalities or from multiple heterogeneous sources, thus forming so-called multi-view data, which receives more and more attentions in machine learning. Multi-view clustering (MVC) becomes its important paradigm. In real-world applications, some views often suffer from instances missing. Clustering on such multi-view datasets is called incomplete multi-view clustering (IMC) and quite challenging. To date, though many approaches have been developed, most of them are offline and have high computational and memory costs especially for large scale datasets. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an One-Pass Incomplete Multi-view Clustering framework (OPIMC). With the help of regularized matrix factorization and weighted matrix factorization, OPIMC can relatively easily deal with such problem. Different from the existing and sole online IMC method, OPIMC can directly get clustering results and effectively determine the termination of iteration process by introducing two global statistics. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on four real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed OPIMC method.
