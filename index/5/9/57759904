Given an ideal I and a polynomial f the Ideal Membership Problem (IMP) is to test if f ϵ I. This problem is a fundamental algorithmic problem with important applications and notoriously intractable. We study the complexity of the IMP for combinatorial ideals that arise from constrained problems over the Boolean domain. As our main result, we identify the borderline of tractability. By using Gröbner bases techniques, we extend Schaefer’s dichotomy theorem [STOC, 1978] which classifies all Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) over the Boolean domain to be either in P or NP-hard. Moreover, our result implies necessary and sufficient conditions for the efficient computation of Theta Body Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) relaxations, identifying therefore the borderline of tractability for constraint language problems. This article is motivated by the pursuit of understanding the recently raised issue of bit complexity of Sum-of-Squares (SoS) proofs [O’Donnell, ITCS, 2017]. Raghavendra and Weitz [ICALP, 2017] show how the IMP tractability for combinatorial ideals implies bounded coefficients in SoS proofs.
