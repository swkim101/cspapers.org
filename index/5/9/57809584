This Study aims to develop a pervasive architecture for U-Healthcare monitoring, services management system, and preventive medicine. The IP base Mobile U-Healthcare system employ wearable wireless bio-sensors to gather medical data, which is then transmitted using RFID technology to the user's device, typically a smart phone or a PDA, and directs this information to a local proxy server. The communication of the user devices are patterned to the mobility structure of Hierarchical Mobile Internet Protocol version 6 to optimize the network connection.
