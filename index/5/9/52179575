It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the SIGIR Symposium on Information Retrieval in Practice (SIRIP 2015). The goal of SIRIP is to bring together information retrieval researchers, practitioners, analysts, and consumers, and to achieve knowledge transfer across these boundaries. It is our hope that everyone who attends SIRIP walks away with new understanding and at least one new idea to think about or explore. SIRIP 2015 is held on the third day of the main SIGIR conference, on Wednesday, August 12, 2015, in Santiago, Chile. SIRIP is attended by people registered for the main conference as well as other interested practitioners who chose register for it alone. The SIRIP program consists of three hour and half long sessions that include a mix of invited presentations, refereed papers, and a panel presentation.
