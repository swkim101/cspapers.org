In this demonstration, as an attempt of a new haptic presentation method for objects in virtual reality (VR) environment, we show a device that presents the haptic sensation of the fingertip on the forearm, not on the fingertip. This device adopts a five-bar linkage mechanism and it is possible to present the strength, direction of force. Compared with a fingertip mounted type displays, it is possible to address the issues of their weight and size which hinder the free movement of fingers. We have confirmed that the experiences in the VR environment is improved compared with without haptics cues situation regardless of without presenting haptics information directly to the fingertip.
