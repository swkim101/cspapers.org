An acid of the formula A-COOH)x, or an anhydride thereof, wherein x is an integer of 1 or 2, wherein the acid groups are vicinal if x is 2, and A is phenyl, C2-C10 alkylene, C2-C10 alkenylene, C6-C10 bridged or nonbridged cycloalkylene or cylcoalkenylene, with the proviso that A is C1-C6 alkyl if x is 1, renders ethylene-propylene-nonconjugated diene elastomers more adherent to fibers that have been treated with a resorcinol-formaldehyde-latex dip when said elastomers are cured directly onto said fibers.
