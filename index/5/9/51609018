This paper proposes a shift in how technology is currently being developed by giving people, the users, control over their technology. We argue that users should have a say in the behaviour of the technologies that mediate their online interactions and control their private data. We propose 'partakable technologies', technologies where users can come together to discuss and agree on its features and functionalities. To achieve this, we base our proposal on a number of existing technologies in the fields of agreement technologies, natural language processing, normative systems, and formal verification. As an IJCAI early career spotlight paper, the paper provides an overview of the author's expertise in these different areas.
