Workshop on Experiencing Interactivity in Public Spaces (EIPS), http://www.cs.tut.fi/ihte/EIPS_workshop_ CHI13/papers.shtml Abstract Although there has been a widespread proliferation of large interactive public displays, studies have demonstrated that many of these interactive displays suffer from interaction blindness, which is the inability of passers-by to recognize and explore the interactive capabilities of those surfaces. In this position paper, we put forward the notion of curiosity objects, curiosity-provoking artifacts designed according to five fundamental principles of curiosity. Curiosity objects exploit the curiosity of passers-by to unveil the interactive capabilities of public displays thereby overcoming interaction blindness. Our initial experiment confirmed the interaction blindness problem and demonstrates that introducing a curiosity object into a public space containing an interactive display (i) significantly increases the interactivity with the display and (ii) invokes changes in movement in the spaces surrounding the interactive display.
