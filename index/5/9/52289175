Many recent works have proposed algorithms for information gathering that benefit from multi-robot cooperation. However, most algorithms either employ discretization of the state and action spaces, which makes them computationally intractable for robotic systems with complex dynamics; or cannot deal with inter-robot restrictions like e.g. communication constraints. This paper presents an approach for multi-robot information gathering that tackles the two aforementioned issues. To this end we propose an algorithm that combines in an innovative manner Gaussian processes (GPs) to model the physical process of interest, RRT planners to plan paths in a continuous domain, and a distributed decision-making algorithm to achieve multi-robot cooperation. Specifically, we employ the Max-sum algorithm for distributed multi-robot cooperation by defining an information-theoretic utility function together with a path clustering approach. This function maximizes information gathering, subject to inter-robot communication constraints. We validate the proposed approach in simulations, and in a field experiment where three quadcopters explore a simulated wind field. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
