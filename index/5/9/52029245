The heart of plant biology is to understand the link between a genetic difference and expressed phenotypes. Genotyping now is accomplished with low-cost, high-throughput analyses. However, phenotyping is labor intensive; it has become a restrictive factor in plant biology studies and crop improvement research. Platforms for high-throughput phenotyping, mainly under field settings, are needed to match the genomic information [1-3].
