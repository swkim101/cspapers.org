3D Video synthesis with multi camera is a safety production foundation technique for realization remote control mining in coalface. The combination of the virtual and real, real-time interaction and 3D registration function are used for coalface 3D dynamic image. Scaling the 3D view of the coalface production scene and observing coalface from any angle enhance sense reality to ground user feeling for underground coalface. The study of two-camera visual platforms includes cameras calibration, image processing, stereo matching, 3D reconstruction and movement analysis. Stereo matching techniques are used to solve optical distortion and noise imbalance. Keywords-coalface; augmented reality; 3D image; binocular stereo matching
