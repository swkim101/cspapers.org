A great portion of the formal practice called computer performance evaluation is the application of rules of thumb and proceduralized analysis of model results, specific reports, and data elements based on the experience and knowledge of the practitioner. Expert systems provide a technique to support the analyst in such mundane analyses and allow them to study more complex problems that cannot easily be proceduralized. Rather than replacing performance analysts expert systems provide an opportunity to increase their productivity. The tutorial focuses on a discussion of the fundamental building blocks of expert systems: vocabularies, rules, and policies. A familiar example is used to illustrate using expert systems for analysis of performance results.
