This invention relates to improvements in a slide support structure. The slide surface is comprised of a plurality of curved and straight segments, joined end to end to form the slide surface. The support includes a plurality of bearer support segments corresponding generally to the slide segments. The invention here relates to the spaced bearing connections between the two which allows for relative vertical and horizontal movements to align for and adjust for minor differences in the curvature of the related slide and support segments.
