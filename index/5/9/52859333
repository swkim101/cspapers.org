This paper describes in detail a translation definition language, CONVERT, for specifying the mapping of the instances of source items, which may be components of one or more files, into instances of target data, which may constitute multiple files.The language is designed for the class of users who are familiar with the logical aspects of their data, know what they want to be done, but do not want to be concerned with the details of how to accomplish it. It is high level and non-procedural according to current standards.The language provides very powerful and highly flexible restructuring capability. Although primarily designed for hierarchically structured data, it is applicable to other kinds of data structures as well. It is believed that the language can handle all common processes required in a data translation. Furthermore, the simple underlying concepts enable the users to visualize the translation processes, thus making data conversion a much simpler task. Examples to illustrate the languages' applications are included.
