We introduce two extensions of the $\lambda$ -calculus with a probabilistic choice operator, $\Lambda_{\oplus}^{\mathrm{cbv}}$ and $\Lambda_{\oplus}^{\mathrm{cbn}}$, modeling respectively call-by-value and call-by-name probabilistic computation. We prove that both enjoys confluence and standardization, in an extended way: we revisit these two fundamental notions to take into account the asymptotic behaviour of terms. The common root of the two calculi is a further calculus based on Linear Logic, $\Lambda_{\oplus}^{!}$, which allows us to develop a unified, modular approach.
