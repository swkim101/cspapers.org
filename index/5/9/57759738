The Single Source Replacement Paths (SSRP) problem is as follows; Given a graph G = ( V, E ), a source vertex s and a shortest paths tree T s rooted in s , output for every vertex t ∈ V and for every edge e in T s the length of the shortest path from s to t avoiding e . We present near optimal upper bounds, by providing ˜ O ( m √ n + n 2 ) time randomized combinatorial algorithm 1 for unweighted undirected graphs, and matching conditional lower bounds for the SSRP problem.
