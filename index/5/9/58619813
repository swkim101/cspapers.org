This paper is concerned with the deterministic prediction and the reuse of temporal properties of higher order language real-time applications. It proposes a method to draw out, save, instantiate to specific hard/soft environments and finally to reuse temporal properties of software applications. The conceptual organization of a tool to support such a proposal is shown.
