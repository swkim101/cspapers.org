Geometric deformations in large thin walled components such as airplane shells caused by gravitational influences have to be compensated before assembly. The research objective is to develop a metrology assisted robot based assembly system that detects deformations and compensates them through force controlled movements of the robots. This paper describes the development of a cooperating robot force control for three industrial robots. The control algorithm uses a numerical optimization to take into account the strong mechanical coupling of the robots by the handled component.
