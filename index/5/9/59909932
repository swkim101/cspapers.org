Welcome to the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2003)! The Organizing Committee, as well as the sponsors of CIKM 2003, join me in the desire that this conference will be the opportunity for you to learn, to grow, to share knowledge and skills about information and knowledge management.In twelve years, the world of information and knowledge management has changed greatly. However, the need for information scientists and technologists and practitioners to meet face-to-face and exchange ideas, as well as to welcome new members into our scientific community, is still here. To the extent that we are successful in these goals, CIKM 2003 will have served its purpose.
