Set based analysis is a constraint-based whole program analysis that is applicable to functional and object-oriented programming language. Unfortunately, the analysis is useless for large programs, since it generates descriptions of data flow relationships that grow quadratically in the size of the program.This paper presents componential set-based analysis, which is faster and handles larger programs without any loss of accuracy over set-based analysis. The design of the analysis exploits a number of theoretical results concerning constraint systems, including a completeness result and a decision algorithm concerning the observable equivalance of constraint systems. Experimental results validate the practically of the analysis.
