In last decade, software engineering research increasingly focused on software quality enhancement and evaluation, whereas most of these researches concentrate on the internal/ development perspective. However, users mainly care in the quality of performs intended functions efficiently without knowing how the software product was developed, how it is work from inside, or it is internal quality. The success of software companies is completely depends on the users' satisfaction, which they decide to use a software product or not. Therefore, in software development, strong attention must be given to the user's satisfaction. This study aims to present the quality of the software products from user's perspective. From user's viewpoint, the characteristics of the software product are discussed. Finally, a user's perspective quality model is proposed.
