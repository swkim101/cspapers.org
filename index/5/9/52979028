Communication between screens and cameras has attracted attention as a ubiquitous information source, motivated by the widespread use of smartphones and the increase of public advertising and information screens. We propose embedding matrix barcodes into images projected on displays by utilizing imperceptible color vibration. This approach maintains the visual experience as the barcodes are imperceptible and can be implemented on almost any display and camera for the technology to be pervasive. In fact, the color vibration can be generated by ordinary 60 Hz LCDs and captured by 120 fps smartphone cameras. To illustrate the technology capabilities, we present scenarios of potential practical applications.
