The concepts of the model curriculum for computer science in a liberal arts college [3] and a traditional mathematics major are combined to form a computer science/mathematics major. This major is particularly suited to the mathematics faculty retrained in computer science, and it provides the students with strong preparation for graduate study or employment in computer science. The major's requirements include six computer science courses (the model's introductory and core courses), six mathematics courses, one advanced computer science elective and a year of introductory physics.
