We introduce a novel thought for integrating artists’ perceptions on the real world into neural image style transfer process. Conventional approaches commonly migrate color or texture patterns from style image to content image, but the underlying design aspect of the artist always get overlooked. We want to address the in-depth genre style, that how artists perceive the real world and express their perceptions in the artwork. We collect a set of Van Gogh’s paintings and cubist artworks, and their semantically corresponding real world photos. We present a novel genre style transfer framework modeled after the mechanism of actual artwork production. The target style representation is reconstructed based on the semantic correspondence between real world photo and painting, which enable the perception guidance in style transfer. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can capture the overall style of a genre or an artist. We hope that this work provides new insight for including artists’ perceptions into neural style transfer process, and helps people to understand the underlying characters of the artist or the genre.
