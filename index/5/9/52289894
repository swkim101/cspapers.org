This paper presents preliminary results of a handheld device to assist the insertion of intra-fascicular planar electrodes into a peripheral nervous system. The developed device consists of two units, a nerve holder and an electrode inserter. We introduce design considerations, features, and underlying mechanisms of the device. User tests and animal experiments show that users can easily and accurately adjust the insertion position and direction of nerve electrodes while manipulating the device in 3D, and that planar electrodes are successfully inserted into sciatic nerves of rats. We hope that the proposed device will help neural engineering researchers and scientists to simplify the surgical process and produce consistent experimental results.
