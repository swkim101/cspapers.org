Value elicitation in VBSE is of utmost importance as the whole domain depends on values determined by SCSs. This research aims to clarify value elicitation process with all the necessary details: simplification of SCSs identification process, review and analysis of value dimensions and value elicitation techniques. After all the required analysis, Value Elicitation Framework is proposed that helps in selection and application of appropriate value elicitation technique for a given situation in the project lifecycle. In addition to this proposed framework facilitates the decision making process by introducing the concept of value into it. Validation of VEF is also done by applying the proposed framework on a software project.
