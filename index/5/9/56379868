After the induction of general anaesthesia, the patient was placed in right lateral decubitus, flexed at the waist. An “open” left subcostal access was used to introduce a 12 mm optical trocar. The abdomen was insufflated with CO2 (12 mmHg). Under laparoscopic vision (0° scope) other 4 trocars were introduced: two 8 mm left subcostal trocars for robotic arms describing a semicircle around the left subcostal space with the previous introduced 12 mm optical trocar, one 5 mm and one 12 mm trocars for the first-assistant in a lower left subcostal position. The robot (da Vinci® Si Surgical System, Intuitive Surgical) was placed at the patient’s left shoulder and was docked.
