Most existing VLP approaches require special designed light or receiver, collecting light information or strict user operation (e.g., horizontally holding mobile phone). This incurs a high deployment, maintenance and usage overhead. In this demo, we present RainbowLight, a low cost ambient light 3D localization approach easy to deploy in today's buildings. Our key finding is that light through a chip of polarizer and birefringence material produces specific interference and light spectrum at different directions to the chip. We derive a model to characterize the relation for direction, light interference and spectrum. Exploiting the model, RainbowLight calculates the direction to a chip after taking a photo containing the chip. With multiple chips, RainbowLight designs a direction intersection based method to derive the location. This demo shows our prototype of implementation, with simple photo capturing and deriving location of camera on mobile phone. The evaluation results show that RainbowLight achieves an average localization error of 3.3 cm in 2D and 9.6 cm in 3D for light on, and an error of 7.4 cm in 2D and 20.5 cm in 3D for light off scenario in daytime.
