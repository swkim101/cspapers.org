This article presents a concrete modality of modeling the subclass of computer networks of type Jackson, known as subclass of network with series queues, using temporized stochastic Colored Petri Nets. The model marks out at every moment in network evolution the number of transactions in each network node ni (i = 1, 2), the number of all transactions in network n (n = n1 + n2), and so allows to evaluate the probability distribution p (n1, n2).
