eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is becoming a standard tool for data storage and transmission. Integrating XML into current database systems courses provides students with an understanding of the growing role of XML in data management and manipulation. We have successfully designed and implemented several exercises for a database systems course in the context of a real-world software project that educate students as to how XML relates to current Database Systems course topics.
