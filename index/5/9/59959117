Many of the domains where socially assistive robotics (SAR) can aid people involve the mastery of actions that promote well-being, or health behaviors, by individuals with chronic conditions or disorders. In-home and in-classroom robots can teach new behaviors, encourage generalized learning, and promote patient autonomy that persists beyond the robot-aided intervention. For the near future, it is practical to develop methods and algorithms that anticipate the robotâ€™s limited time with the user, and incorporate it into models of social interactions that encourage user autonomy. The occupational therapy technique of graded cueing provides a framework for appropriately challenging feedback that can be incorporated into a SAR interaction.
