This work presents a new attitude balancing strategy implemented and validated on a quadrupedal robot equipped with a custom hybrid wheel-legged mobility system. The proposed method uses an inverse kinematics solution scheme based on Quadratic Programming optimization to generate full body motions that ensure the desired balancing performances. The strategy generates a compliant behaviour to cope with the applied external forces resulting in a stable and smooth reaction response. Furthermore, the method takes advantage of the robot hybrid wheeled-legged mobility system to provide new motion capabilities and balancing reactions as it will be shown through the paper. Extensive simulation studies on the Centauro robot are presented. Results show the efficiency of the propose method demonstrating significant contribution in the rejection of the applied external disturbances.
