We describe the development and user testing of an ambient display for autonomous vehicles. Instead of providing feedback about driving actions, once executed, it communicates driving decisions in advance, via light signals in passengers" peripheral vision. This ambient display was tested in an WoZ-based on-the-road-driving simulation of a fully autonomous vehicle. Findings from a preliminary study with 14 participants suggest that such a display might be particularly useful to communicate upcoming inertia changes for passengers.
