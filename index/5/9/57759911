We introduce probabilistic extensions of classical deterministic measures of algebraic complexity of a tensor, such as the rank and the border rank. We show that these probabilistic extensions satisfy various natural and algorithmically serendipitous properties, such as submultiplicativity under taking of Kronecker products. Furthermore, the probabilistic extensions enable improvements over their deterministic counterparts for speciﬁc tensors of interest, starting from the tensor (cid:104) 2 , 2 , 2 (cid:105) that represents 2 × 2 matrix multiplication. While it is well known that the (deterministic) tensor rank and border rank satisfy rk (cid:104) 2 , 2 , 2 (cid:105) = 7 and rk (cid:104) 2 , 2 , 2 (cid:105) = 7 [V. Strassen, Numer. Math. 13 (1969); J. E. Hopcroft and L. R. Kerr, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 20 (1971); S. Winograd, Linear Algebra Appl. 4 (1971); J. M. Landsberg, J. AMS 19 (2006)], we show that the probabilistic tensor rank and border rank satisfy (cid:101) rk (cid:104) 2 , 2 , 2 (cid:105) ≤ 6 + 6 7 and (cid:101) rk (cid:104) 2 , 2 , 2 (cid:105) ≤ 6 + 2 3 . By submultiplicativity, this leads immediately to novel randomized algorithm designs, such as algorithms for Boolean matrix multiplication as well as detecting and estimating the number of triangles in graphs. Our algorithms are opportunistic in the sense
