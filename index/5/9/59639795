The 1st international ACM workshop on Interoperability of Heterogeneous Information Systems -- IHIS'05 is organized in conjunction with the 14th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM'05). It is co-sponsored by the INTEROP Network of Excellence and the SEEMseed project in order to connect researchers and to exchange ideas and results in the interoperability domain.Interacting and exchanging information with internal or external partners is a key issue. If companies want to survive in the current market situation, a tight collaboration is needed. A seamless collaboration is, however, only possible if all participating information systems are able to semantically exchange information. The system topographies in today's companies are characterized by a high heterogeneity linked with various data models and formats. Interoperability between systems is therefore a major challenge for enterprises because of the high heterogeneity.Today there are several approaches for creating a unified possibility of accessing heterogeneous information systems. Possible solutions are, for example, found in the domain of merging ontologies, linking or mapping different standards, or in the domain of model interoperability technologies like model morphing or transformation.Ambition of this workshop is to get an overview about current research activities as well as a broad discussion in certain areas of interoperability of heterogeneous information systems. It is proposed to connect research experts from these domains and to exchange ideas and approaches.The IHIS'05 workshop is not to be seen as a one-day-event but as a basis for regular exchange and cooperation of the community as it is the intention of the INTEROP NoE. We therefore intent to keep the participants informed about the results of the workshop and to make the results available for the public and we intend to foster the cooperation between experts during and after the workshop.
