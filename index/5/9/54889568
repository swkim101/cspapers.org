Geographic Information System (GIS) has developed rapidly since it came into being in the 1960s [1]. In recent years, the geographic industry has seen an increasing interest and activity in the deployment of web sites that provide access to geographic content. In this paper, we model a Building Information System (BIS) based on WEBGIS to help the people to manage the buildings. The BIS collects graphic and nongraphic data related to buildings and then transforms this data to a computer platform, stores, queries, analyzes and presents this data to the user with various formats including texts, maps, and web-based views with the aim of increasing the efficiency and progress of building management. SQL Server2000 DataBase is employed in the system.
