Improvement of a combination of mechanical properties of a plate sheet from carbon and low-alloy steel is one of the main tasks of metallurgy. One of the most relevant characteristics of mechanical properties of steel is cracking resistance. Increasing of metal cracking resistance at static and dynamic loads is achieved by means of wellknown methods, such as raising barriers to the movement of a crack, creating conditions for crack splitting, compression fields and other.1âˆ’3 One of the methods of crack braking is barriers in the form of a structure stronger than a matrix. It is realized in thermally reinforced sheet rolling. An objective of the article is to analyze the main types of thermally reinforced steel flat and their working characteristics.
