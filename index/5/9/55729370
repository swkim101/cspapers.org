The healthcare systems require constant monitoring of patients and their records for speedy recovery and also to change the course of tablets at different stages. Most of the healthcare systems are found inefficient in their performance due to human errors in the monitoring of patients who are in the critical care units where human intervention is limited. The obvious reason would also be that the records i.e. the history of the patient may not be available before hand and the doctor will be misguided to prescribe wrong medicines and wrong treatment. Hence, we have come up with the concept of Medical Robot with Electronic health record system-a bridge between the man and the machine, to reduce these errors for effective performance.
