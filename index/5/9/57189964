With the increase demand of a globally interconnected information network, the energy harvesting could be a potential way of prolonging the lifetime of energy constrained devices such as wearable health gadgets, household automation devices, and personal electronics. In this study, a wireless energy harvesting protocol is analyzed for cognitive cooperative relay network (CCRN) with a decode-and-forward relay assistance. An analytical expression for the outage probability of the network is derived subject to the threshold of the instantaneous signal to interference ratio at the receivers of the secondary network. The outage probability is analyzed against the energy conversion efficiency factor η and the transmission time factor α. The results analyze the sensitivity of the outage probability validated also via Monte Carlo simulation. It is shown that the outage probability at the destination of the CCRN network can be below 1%.
