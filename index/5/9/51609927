Person re-identification (REID) is an important task in video surveillance and forensics applications. Most of previous approaches are based on a key assumption that all person images have uniform and sufficiently high resolutions. Actually, various low-resolutions and scale mismatching always exist in open world REID. We name this kind of problem as Scale-Adaptive Low Resolution Person Re-identification (SALR-REID). The most intuitive way to address this problem is to increase various low-resolutions (not only low, but also with different scales) to a uniform high-resolution. SR-GAN is one of the most competitive image super-resolution deep networks, designed with a fixed upscaling factor. However, it is still not suitable for SALR-REID task, which requires a network not only synthesizing high-resolution images with different upscaling factors, but also extracting discriminative image feature for judging personâ€™s identity. (1) To promote the ability of scale-adaptive upscaling, we cascade multiple SRGANs in series. (2) To supplement the ability of image feature representation, we plug-in a reidentification network. With a unified formulation, a Cascaded Super-Resolution GAN (CSR-GAN) framework is proposed. Extensive evaluations on two simulated datasets and one public dataset demonstrate the advantages of our method over related state-of-the-art methods.
