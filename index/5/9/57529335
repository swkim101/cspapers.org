It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 3rd ACM Workshop on Assurable & Usable Security Configuration 2010 (SafeConfig '10) held in conjunction with the 17th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Chicago, IL. 
 
The workshop is focused on the unique challenges of securing a variety of configuration data maintained by enterprise networks. A typical enterprise network might have hundreds of security appliances such as firewalls, IPSec gateways, IDS/IPS, authentication servers, authorization/ RBAC servers and crypto systems. An enterprise network may also have other non-security devices such as routers, name servers, protocol gateways, etc. These must be logically integrated into a security architecture satisfying security goals at and across multiple networks. Logical integration is accomplished by consistently setting thousands of configuration variables and rules on the devices. The configuration must be constantly adapted to optimize protection and block prospective attacks. Also, the configuration must be tuned to balance security with usability. SafeConfig'10 will give researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of security configuration. 
 
The call for papers attracted 25 submissions from Asia, Canada, Europe, and the United States. The program committee accepted 8 regular papers and 4 short papers that cover a variety of topics, including policy management, network and infrastructure configuration, and access control and system configuration. We hope that the proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for security researchers and developers.
