The Rasch measurement model analysis is used in the current paper to better understand the impact of a double degree programme on the engineering students of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. Through the analysis of the Big Five Inventory (BFI) using Rasch Model, data on the distribution of scores are highlighted to represent the condition of the double degree engineering students while they prepare before going to University of Duisburg-Essen. The features of Rasch Model in analysing the BFI items scored by the students are discussed. A comparison between Cronbach reliability and Rasch reliability is also presented. A person-item distribution map (PIDM) is also included to present the data in a more meaningful way.
