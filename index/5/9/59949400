Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) transform the brain activity of a human operator into executable commands that can be sent to a machine, usually a computer or robot, to perform intended tasks. In addition to current biomedical applications, available technology could also make feasible augmenting devices for space applications that could be promising means to improve astronauts' efficiency and capabilities. The implementation of artificial intelligence algorithms into the software architecture of present BMIs will be of crucial importance to guarantee a proper functionality of the device in the highly dynamic and unpredictable space environment.
