Having found that the current Computed Radiography test phantom failed to meet the ASTM E2445-14 standard, a new process was required. The Carestream diagnostics tool, after some changes were made to the Radiographic exposure, met most of the requirements. Full ASTM compliance has been achieved after the development of a further exposure. The full procedure was drafted and tested, followed by independent validation and verification by Radiographic Testing Level 3 personnel.
