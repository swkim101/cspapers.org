Environment plays an important role on the outputs of electronic sensors and systems. Electronic sensors used for very precise measurements perform very well under lab environment [1-2]. Semiconductor technology is very popular and widely used for sensor development as it provides an advantage of low power, high speed, small size integration and their signal processing capability. More often, CAD tools are used (Sze, 1994) which provide simulation and synthesis of semiconductor sensors. The SPICE has built in models for most semiconductor devices but there is scarcity of appropriate models for semiconductor sensors. Modelling of MOSFETs [3-4] requires a deep knowledge of the code structure, subroutines and it is strictly linked to a particular version of SPICE. The simplest PCS is O2 sensitive where the sensitive surface is made up of insulator layer like titanium oxide (TiO2) exposed to an electrolyte solution [5]. A p-type semiconductor and TiO2 insulator are placed into aqueous electrolyte solution where the response of PCS to O2 can be explained in terms of photo catalysis. In the submicron level the thickness of gate oxide is very small in dimension. As the dimension of gate oxide decreases this result in tunnelling of charge carriers which significantly increases the leakage current of MOSFETS and results in the decrease of device reliability [6]. One way to continue reducing dimensions is possible by using materials having much higher permittivity than silicon dioxide.
