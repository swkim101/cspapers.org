The developed tools are used to create a representative volume element (RVE) of cementitious materials and then assess the diffusive properties. The algorithms developed in Combs target a fast placement of the inclusions and a fast generation of the RVE shape and its mesh. Two application cases are considered: the unaltered material diffusivity and the degraded material diffusivity. The first case of application focuses on the description of the capillary porosity. The second application case focuses on the description of the degradation of cementitious material (mineral and porosity) and the diffusive properties associated. The reliability of the analytical effective medium approximations (MT and SC) is confirmed from 3D finite elements (FE) calculations performed on a matrix-inclusions microstructure obtained by RVE generation with Combs. The results also show the need to take into account the percolation behavior.
