Under- and oversaturation can cause severe image degradation in many vision-based robotic applications. To control camera exposure in dynamic lighting conditions, we introduce a novel metric for image information measure. Measuring an image gradient is typical when evaluating its level of image detail. However, emphasizing more informative pixels substantially improves the measure within an image. By using this entropy weighted image gradient, we introduce an optimal exposure value for vision-based approaches. Using this newly invented metric, we also propose an effective exposure control scheme that covers a wide range of light conditions. When evaluating the function (e.g., image frame grab) is expensive, the next best estimation needs to be carefully considered. Through Bayesian optimization, the algorithm can estimate the optimal exposure value with minimal cost. We validated the proposed image information measure and exposure control scheme via a series of thorough experiments using various exposure conditions.
