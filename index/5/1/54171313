Industrial robots have been more and more used in industrial field, because of the advantages of high flexibility, high automation level and low-cost. As robotic technology development and progress unceasingly, higher performance requirements are proposed for the utility of industrial robot. Since six-axis robot is redundant in the machining process, each position of Tool Center Point suits a series of robot configurations. The redundancy problem including how to utilize the redundancy to optimize the posture far away from singularity and joint-limits posture, concurrently guarantee and improve the machining quality. A new performance index is addressed for the combined requirements of singularity and joint-limits avoidance, and it optimizes the robot configurations at joint displacement level. In addition, the low stiffness property is a main limitation to the robot application in the accurate machining. The robotic stiffness performance relates to configuration directly. This paper addresses a stiffness modeling method for machining tasks. A quantitative evaluation index is proposed to stiffness performance and it can be used to optimize configurations further on the basis of kinematics performance optimization.
