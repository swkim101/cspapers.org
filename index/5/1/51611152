We study the problem of learning first-order rules from large Knowledge Graphs (KGs). With recent advancement in information extraction, vast data repositories in the KG format have been obtained such as Freebase and YAGO. However, traditional techniques for rule learning are not scalable for KGs. This paper presents a new approach RLvLR to learning rules from KGs by using the technique of embedding in representation learning together with a new sampling method. Experimental results show that our system outperforms some state-of-the-art systems. Specifically, for massive KGs with hundreds of predicates and over 10M facts, RLvLR is much faster and can learn much more quality rules than major systems for rule learning in KGs such as AMIE+. We also used the RLvLR-mined rules in an inference module to carry out the link prediction task. In this task, RLvLR outperformed Neural LP, a state-of-the-art link prediction system, in both runtime and accuracy.
