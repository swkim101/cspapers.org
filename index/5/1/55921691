A control system of polar coordinates seeker has been modeled, utilizing an angle instruction solution based on full-map plane and nonlinear PID (NLPID) controller based on tracking differentiator (TD) and extended state observer (ESO). The jump of instruction is solved by rolling the full- map coordinate system, accomplishing the optimization of the many-valued instruction of polar coordinates seeker. Then the system uses TD to filter the optimized instruction and to construct its differential signal, and uses differential signal to predict it by linear extrapolation. The two servo channels have same structure, both using optimal control synthesis function of discrete-time system—fhan() function to construct NLPID to drive the electromotor. In the angular velocity feed-back channel, system uses ESO to filter the signal and to estimate the disturbance and compensate it. Simulation results for sight stabilization and target tracking shows that the system's decoupling coefficient and dislocation angle when tracking complicated trace are both small. instruction, this principle uses angle instruction calculated by full-map plane and optimized it by rotating coordinate system of full-map plane. The servo applies nonlinear PID (NLPID) controller based on tracking differentiator(TD), and utilizes extended state observers(ESO) in angular velocity feedback loop (5), accomplishing adaptive control. TD can make dynamic planning and prediction of angular instruction, while angle increment instruction is not fit for dynamic planning because optical axis itself is in great movement. This embodies angle instruction's superiority to angle increment instruction. The control system was simulated in Simulink environment of Matlab. The results displayed that the system's decoupling coefficient is 2.89%, and the dislocation angle during complex target tracking was under 1.4°.
