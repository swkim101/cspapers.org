This paper presents the development of a fish-like magnetically propelled microswimmer fabricated by 3D laser lithography. The microswimmer consists of a head and a caudal fin, just like a natural fish. There is a joint between the head and the fin so that the caudal fin can oscillate around the head to generate thrust, and the oscillation of the fin hardly transfers to the head, which benefits the stable motion of the microswimmer. The caudal fin of the microswimmer is deposited with a layer of 50 nm nickel (Ni) for magnetic actuation. Through applying an oscillating uniform magnetic field, the microswimmer can move along with the direction guided by the external magnetic field. A magnetic control system with permanent magnets is designed to provide such an oscillating uniform magnetic field, where the oscillating frequency and amplitude are controllable. A micro probe operation platform is used to detach the fabricated microswimmers from glass substrate in manufacturing. The proposed magnetically propelled microswimmer can be potentially used as powerful detoxification and biosensing tools for medical diagnosis and treatment in precision medicine.
