There remains an increasing interest in accurate indoor tracking; one such example is the study of human behaviors, especially to understand cognitive decline in older people. However, a solution that is capable of accurate tracking, easy to field deploy and freely available to the research community remains. Further, research studies often focus on localization or high accuracy as opposed to developing a field deployable solution. We demonstrate bTracked, a field deployable tracking system for mobile BLE device bearers using BLE beacon signals. In particular, we exploit, not only range estimations but also pose of the BLE device bearer for tracking. Together with a particle filter and the concept of generic sensor models for generalized indoor environments, we present an online and real-time tracking application of persons. We present a web-based Application for deployment and visualization of spatial tracking information across multiple remote deployment sites.
