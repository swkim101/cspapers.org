In this paper, the performance of the full-duplex decode-and-forward relay system with energy harvesting is analyzed in terms of the outage and symbol error probabilities. We consider the energy replenishing using radio frequency (RF) for the source and the relay nodes through the power beacon (PB) combined with the case of imperfect self-interference cancellation (SIC) at the full-duplex relay. Firstly, the closed-form expression of the exact outage probability of the system over Rayleigh fading channel is derived. Then based on that, the exact expression for the symbol error probability of the system is obtained to evaluate the system performance with different modulation schemes. The Monte-Carlo simulation is used to verify the correctness of the mathematical analysis. From the numerical results, the impacts of the residual self-interference, the time duration for harvesting and the types of modulation are studied.
