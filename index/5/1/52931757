A rainbow $q$-coloring of a $k$-uniform hypergraph is a $q$-coloring of the vertex set such that every hyperedge contains all $q$ colors. 
We prove that given a rainbow $(k - 2\lfloor \sqrt{k}\rfloor)$-colorable $k$-uniform hypergraph, it is NP-hard to find a normal $2$-coloring. Previously, this was only known for rainbow $\lfloor k/2 \rfloor$-colorable hypergraphs (Guruswami and Lee, SODA 2015). 
We also study a generalization which we call rainbow $(q, p)$-coloring, defined as a coloring using $q$ colors such that every hyperedge contains at least $p$ colors. We prove that given a rainbow $(k - \lfloor \sqrt{kc} \rfloor, k- \lfloor3\sqrt{kc} \rfloor)$-colorable $k$ uniform hypergraph, it is NP-hard to find a normal $c$-coloring for any constant $c < k/10$. 
The proof of our second result relies on two combinatorial theorems. One of the theorems was proved by Sarkaria (J.~Comb.~Theory.~1990) using topological methods and the other theorem we prove using a generalized Borsuk-Ulam theorem.
