In this work, we propose a multi-objective optimal scheduling strategy for air-conditioning devices to optimize both energy consumption and thermal comfort for the users. We propose a graph-based modeling for the problem and utilize Johnson's all elementary circuit finding algorithm to obtain the desired solutions. The proposed methodology has been experimented on test cases that mimic real-world scenario, and further, the applicability of Karp's minimum mean cycle algorithm is also studied in this problem set-up.
