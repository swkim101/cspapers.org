A data model, called the entity-relationship model, which incorporates the semantic information in the real world is proposed. A special diagramatic technique is introduced for exhibiting entities and relationships. An example of data base design and description using the model and the diagramatic technique is given. The implications on data integrity, information retrieval, and data manipulation are discussed.
