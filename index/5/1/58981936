We obtain approximation ratio $2(2+\frac{1}{\ell})$ for the (undirected) $k$-Connected Subgraph problem, where $\ell \approx \frac{1}{2} (\log_k n-1)$ is the largest integer such that $2^{\ell-1} k^{2\ell+1} \leq n$. For large values of $n$ this improves the $6$-approximation of Cheriyan and V\'egh when $n =\Omega(k^3)$, which is the case $\ell=1$. For $k$ bounded by a constant we obtain ratio $4+\epsilon$. For large values of $n$ our ratio matches the best known ratio $4$ for the augmentation version of the problem, as well as the best known ratios for $k=6,7$. Similar results are shown for the problem of covering an arbitrary crossing supermodular biset function.
