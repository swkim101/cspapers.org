We present Movelet, a self-actuated bracelet that can move along the user's forearm to convey feedback via its movement and positioning. In contrast to other eyes-free modalities such as vibro-tactile feedback, that only works momentarily, Movelet is able to provide sustained feedback via its spatial position on the forearm, in addition to momentary feedback by movement. This allows to continuously inform the user about the changing state of information utilizing their haptic perception. In a user study using the Movelet prototype, we found that users can blindly estimate the device's position on the forearm with an average deviation of 1.20cm to the actual position and estimate the length of a movemement with an average deviation of 1.44cm. This shows the applicability of position-based feedback using haptic perception.
