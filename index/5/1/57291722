The recognition of the goal a user is pursing when interacting with a software application is a crucial task for an interface agent as it serves as a context for making opportune interventions to provide assistance to the user. The prediction of the user goal must be fast and a goal recognizer must be able to make early predictions with few observations of the user actions. In this work we propose an approach to automatically build an intention model from a plan corpus using Variable Order Markov models. We claim that following our approach, an interface agent will be capable of accurately ranking the most probable user goals in a time linear to the number of goals modeled.
