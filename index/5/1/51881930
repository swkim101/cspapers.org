In the era of the Internet of Things, users desire more valuable services by simultaneously utilizing various resources available in remote devices. As a result, cross-device resource sharing, a capability to utilize the resources of a remote device, becomes a desirable feature to enable interesting multi-device services. However, the existing resource sharing mechanisms either have limited resource coverage, involve complex programming efforts for utilizing multiple devices, or more importantly, incur huge inter-device network traffic. 
 
We propose DynaMix, a novel framework that realizes efficient cross-device resource sharing. First, DynaMix maximizes resource coverage by dynamically integrating computation and I/O resources of remote devices with distributed shared memory and I/O request forwarding. Second, DynaMix obviates the need for multidevice programming by providing the resource sharing capability at the low level. Third, DynaMix minimizes interdevice network traffic by adaptively redistributing tasks between devices based on their dynamic resource usage. By doing so, DynaMix achieves efficient resource sharing along with dynamic plug-and-play and reconfigurability. Our example implementation on top of Android and Tizen devices shows that DynaMix enables efficient cross-device resource sharing in multi-device services.
