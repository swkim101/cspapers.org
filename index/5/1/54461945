This paper deals with an on-line non-destructive inspection system by using hammering sounds based on the combination of support vector machine and a heuristic algorithm. In machine learning algorithms, the perfect performance is hard to attain and it is newly suggested that a heuristic algorithm redeeming this insufficiency is connected to the support vector machine as a post-process. The experimental results show that the combination of support vector machine and the heuristic algorithm attains 100% detection of defective pieces with 18.4% of erroneous determination of non-defective pieces within the upper limit of given processing time.
