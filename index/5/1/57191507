In this paper, two PIFA multi-band antennas are presented. They are placed at two opposite sides of FR4 PCB. First antenna operates at the frequencies of 0.868 MHz, 1.57 GHz and 2.4 GHz, meanwhile another has the resonant frequencies of 1.57 GHz and 2.4 GHz. The obtained bandwidths cover BLE, GPS and LoRa that are the low power wireless communication standard. Thanks to these specifications, the proposed antenna can be used for the small tracking devices. With the dimension of 0.04λ x 0.07λ (λ is the wavelength at frequency of 0.868 MHz), the antennas provide the radiation efficiency higher than -5 dB for using in LoRa, GPS and BLE. The proposed antennas are simulated and optimized by using HFSS software.
