Developing software and managing projects according to a defined process model is widely accepted to minimize dangers of project-failures. Our experience shows that many processes are hardly accepted and often ignored. Managers and developers have different views on a project, with negative impacts on project-performance due to communication lacks that lead to misunderstandings and quality issues. Introducing processes using accepted workingand tool-environments may increase the acceptance of a process by providing a common platform for project operation supporting all the roles that participate in a project. This paper presents a concept for generating such tool-environments directly from a process description. We focus on process elements that can be used to provide additional project management assistance e.g. cockpit-like controlling mechanisms. We discuss our concept using samples from a case study that used the formal structured German V-ModellXT as a source and Microsoft SharePoint 2007 Services and Visual Studio Team Foundation Server as target environments.
