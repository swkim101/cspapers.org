This paper presents an approach to user involvement in product development thathas grown out of a Scandinavian tradition for cooperation with end-users in design. This tradition emphasizes early and continuing end-user involvement, and has over the last decade been applied successfully in several projects. Most of these projects have, however, been research projects or of the type inhouse or contract developmen~ and the claim is often made that this way of involving users is not suited for product development. In this paper I sketch the ideas behind involving users in the design process, and then present and discuss a case of product development in the CSCW area, where more traditional development activities were integrated with intensive cooperation with end-users.
