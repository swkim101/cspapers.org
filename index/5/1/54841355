A system for cooperation of two robot system was developed to solve the problem of shortage of labor and to improve efficiency of field work. A safety model of a robot tractor was proposed for coordination and cooperation of two robots. Each robot has its own pre-determined path, and tracking the path is independent of the other robot. Thus, by controlling the velocity of each robot, the robots can keep a certain shape when working due to radio communication between the two robots. As for headland turn, the two robots turn together as long as they are in a safe condition. Computer simulation was conducted to confirm the effectiveness of this system. The results showed that it is possible for two robots to work safely together applying the developed safety model. Compared with work by a single robot, this system using two robots can improve work efficiency by at least 80 percent.
