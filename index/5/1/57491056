A knowledge base (KB) can be used for collecting, organizing, and searching the knowledge, such as data on software problems. Users of IT services can search problem solutions from the knowledge base which decreases the workload of the service desk. Although KB applications are very useful for customer support, the introduction of KB has been given very little consideration in software engineering research. In our previous paper, the first six phases (identification of stakeholders, process assessment, goal setting, process engineering, knowledge structuring and prototyping) of building a KB were described. This paper presents the final three phases (incremental enhancement and continuous evaluation, deployment and planning the next increment). The research question is: how to establish a knowledge base for a problem management process.
