Robots mounted on an unmanned chaser satellite could be used for performing rendezvous and grasping manoeuvres in order to repair satellites or remove space debris from orbit. Use of manipulators for such purposes is challenging, since the performed task need to be done autonomously, accurately and with high level of robustness. During manoeuvres high disturbances might appear e.g. due to contact between the manipulator arm end-effector and the target spacecraft. In this paper an approach for validation of the robotic subsystem during chaser rendezvous and grasping manoeuvre has been shown. Two type of testbed systems were used: planar air-bearing microgravity simulators and a test-bed system with industrial robots. The proposed approach took advantage of possible replacement of particular subsystem in reference model or reference hardware in specified test-bed system. The list of tests performed are included in the paper.
