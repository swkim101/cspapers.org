The concept of data access and data flow control has a central role in privacy preservation of users in social software. Certain approaches aim at enabling users to control who can access their data, and identifying who is accountable for misconduct. Those approaches are implemented in technological and legal frameworks. Each approach raises many ethical issues. Furthermore, these approaches may conflict with each other. The issues are more complicated when the technological and legal frameworks are compared to each other. Such conflicts raises an open issue of what the appropriate balance would be when implementing the approaches by the two frameworks at once.
