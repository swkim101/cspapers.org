This paper presents a bio-inspired homing strategy applied to the guidance of rotorcraft unmanned aerial systems (UAS). In this approach, a sequence of panoramic snapshots is stored to build a visual route between the home and the goal locations. Navigation back to the initial location consists in reaching each of the memorised snapshot positions, by performing successive local homing steps. For that purpose, a snapshot-based method is used to estimate the rotorcraftâ€™s 3D position and velocity in real-time. This algorithm provides a simple, yet efficient means for describing a visual route, and enabling 3D navigation of a smallsize quadrotor in unknown outdoor environments. Results from closed-loop flight experiments are presented to evaluate the performance of our approach.
