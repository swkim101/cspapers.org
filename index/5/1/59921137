Current tools for interactive knowledge capture have little or no learning aptitude. They are mostly oblivious to the process or strategy that the user may be following in entering new knowledge, unaware of their progress during a session, and ignorant of typical skills expected from a good student. We present an approach to make acquisition interfaces more proactive by extending them with: 1) goals that represent what remains to be learned, 2) strategies to achieve these goals and acquire further knowledge, and 3) awareness of the current status of the body of knowledge learned. The resulting interaction shows that the system is aware of its progress towards acquiring the new knowledge, and moves forward by understanding what acquisition goals and strategies to pursue.
