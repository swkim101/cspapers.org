Internet of Thing (IoT) and the 4th Industrial Revolution are one of the key development trends of todayâ€™s technology. In this trend, multi-core processors are being widely researched and manufactured to replace the single processors especially in IoT devices. However, most embedded software in multi-core devices still use the sequence programming model which does not take advantage of the multi-core processors. Therefore, this paper proposes and develops a method to improve software performance for multi-core processors in IoT devices using the MQTT protocol. This performance improvement method is built based on dynamic threading and balanced data partition in accordance with the characteristics of MQTT.
