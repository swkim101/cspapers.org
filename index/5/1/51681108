Many graph analytics problems can be solved via iterative algorithms where the solutions are often characterized by a set of steady-state conditions.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using a few commonly used graph algorithms, and show that in some cases, the learned algorithm can handle graphs with more than 100,000,000 nodes in a single machine.
