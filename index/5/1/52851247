We propose a novel paradigm for two-way circuit partitioning which minimizes the clock cycle. The replication technique is suggested for feedback loops to minimize the impacts of intermodule delays and the crossing edges when necessary. A flow timing cut is devised to produce partitions which can be guaranteed to achieve clock cycles equal to their lower bound with respect to the partitions using retiming. When the clock cycle optimization is the major objective and feedback loop sizes are not large, we propose an efficient, easy to implement algorithm which still guarantees achieving the lower bound clock cycle with respect to its partition. Experimental results have shown that our algorithms can achieve an average of 15% clock cycle time reduction compared to the best retimed results produced by 20 runs on each test case using a Fiduccia-Mattheyses algorithm.
