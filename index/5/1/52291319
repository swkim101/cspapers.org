In this paper, we present a reactive robot navigation method for a non-holonomic mobile robot taking inspiration from the phenomena observed in magnetic fields. The algorithm is shown to be able to guide mobile robots in arbitrary-shaped convex environment without being trapped in local minima by exploiting the local sensory information without priori knowledge about the environment. A preliminary validation study involving simulation of and experiments with a TurtleBot mobile robot platform show the advantage of the proposed method over existing ones.
