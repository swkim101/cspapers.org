We propose and demonstrate the performance improvement using A-law companding transform for direct detection optical OFDM transmission systems. The demonstration is realized by Monte-Carlo simulation of DCO- OFDM optical transmission system. Performance of the intensity modulation and direct detection system in different operating conditions has been investigated via simulation. The influences of the companding parameter, the modulation index and the nonlinear transmission of the fiber link are also investigated. Simulated results also indicate that this technique is effective in performance improvement for the direct detection optical OFDM systems.
