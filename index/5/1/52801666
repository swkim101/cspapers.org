We demonstrate an indoor localization technique to be presented as a full paper at this MobiSys conference. In that paper, we introduce a new technique for determining mobile phone's indoor location even when Wi-Fi infrastructure is unavailable or sparse. Our technique is based on a new ambient sound fingerprint called the Acoustic Background Spectrum (ABS). This demonstration has two components. First, it shows attendees a live view of the ABS in the demonstration hall. This allows attendees to test the claim that the ABS is stable and robust to transient noise. Attendees can speak or make noise and observe the consequent effect on ABS. In the second demonstration, short sound recordings from various rooms are played on a set of headphones. Simultaneously, a photograph of the room and a plot of the ABS is shown. This demonstrates the ambient sound variations present in a set of sample rooms and allows attendees to test their own ability to distinguish locations based on sound.
