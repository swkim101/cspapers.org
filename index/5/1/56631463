In this paper, we evaluate the use of implicit interest indicators as the basis for user profiling in the Digital TV domain. Research in more traditional domains, such as Web browsing or Usenet News, indicates that some implicit interest indicators (e.g., read-time and mouse movements) are capable of serving as alternative to explicit profile information such as user ratings. Consequently, the key question we wish to answer relates to the type of implicit indicators that can be identified within the DTV domain and the extent to which they can accurately reflect a user's true preferences.
