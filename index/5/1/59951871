Requirements elicitation is a process of seeking, uncovering, acquiring and elaborating requirements for developing a computer-based system. These processes involve communication between customers and developers. Techniques of communication that are normally used includes verbal, written and interpersonal. According to previous researches, there are numerous communication problems occurred between customers and developers during the requirement elicitation process. This study describes a technique for measuring communication gap between customers and developers during requirements elicitation. This technique is constructed by using Iterative Triangulation method. Five variables are proposed in this measurement: input, communication skills, personality, medium and procedures. The evaluation indicates that the proposed technique is able to produce the right measurement of the communication gap between customers and developers during requirements elicitation.
