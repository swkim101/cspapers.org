Herein, we propose "unlimited electric gum," an electric taste device that will enable users to perceive taste for as long the user is chewing the gum. We developed an in-mouth type novel electric taste-imparting apparatus using a piezoelectric element so that the piezoelectric effect is stimulated by chewing. This enabled the design of a device that does not require cables around a user's lips or batteries in their mouth. In this paper, we introduce this device and report our experimental and exhibition results.
