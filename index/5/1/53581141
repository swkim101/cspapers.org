The process to support the decision-making in ubiquitous contexts is very complex but no less relevant. Mechanisms such as automatic negotiation can be used in order to aid parties to reach decisions with quality. However, most of the intelligence that could be generated in the real decision-making process is forgotten. Besides that, if on one hand many group decision support systems force the user with overly complex, demanding and slow configura- tions, on the other hand experience the lack of essential information that could be used to enhance the intelligence of the decision. In this work we (1) propose a set of points related to the decision-making process whose associated knowledge we think to be fundamental to provide more intelligent decisions and with higher quality, (2) a way in which these points can be implemented that will result in a fast, perceptible and usable configuration for the decision- maker and that will also provide reliable information. We have developed a pro- totype where we present a template with all the points that were considered. Throughout this paper we present a selection of images related with that scheme that exemplify in practice the implementation of each point.
