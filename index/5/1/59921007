We are pleased to welcome you to ASPLOS-X in Silicon Valley. We have the opportunity to celebrate both the 10th ASPLOS conference and the 20th year anniversary of ASPLOS since the first conference took place in Palo Alto in March 1982.While much has changed in the computer industry during the past two decades, the interdisciplinary nature of ASPLOS has allowed it to become a premier conference and a vibrant forum for discussing emerging technologies and promoting cross-fertilizing research that encompasses a wide range of areas, including hardware, architecture, compilers, operating systems, networking, and applications. ASPLOS-X is sponsored by ACM Special Interest Groups on Architecture (SIGARCH), Programming Languages (SIGPLAN), and Operating Systems (SIGOPS). In addition, we acknowledge the generous financial support from this year's corporate donors.
