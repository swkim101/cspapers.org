We present REVERT (which stands for RuntimE VErification for Real-Time systems), a new tool to generate monitorsfor real-time systems. REVERT takes specifications written ina new Domain Specific Language (DSL) and automaticallygenerates monitors under the form of complete timed deterministic finite automata (DFA). The generated timed DFA canlater be used to generate code that can eventually be integratedwithin the monitored system.
