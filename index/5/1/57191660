A design of wireless communication system, particularly Media Access Control (MAC) and Physical layer system (PHY) for Factory Automation (FA) system based on Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) communication system, is proposed in this paper. The designed of MAC is synchronous multi-user round-robin transmission protocol. Low overhead Packet Division Multiple Access (PDMA) scheme is utilized for Multi-user Downlink transmission up to 80 MHz, while Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) is employed for the uplink transmission. The designed of PHY system is developed based on a fast and deterministic communication featuring the synchronous multi-user system. For eï¬ƒcient of multi-user transmission in the proposed protocol, the transmission time of the proposed iWLAN with 40 MHz bandwidth can achieve 500% better than PROFINET wireless standard. Furthermore, the implementation results of MAC and PHY layer of the proposed system show that FPGA logic utilization can fit with the target FPGA which is promising for a full implementation and evaluation combining with radio frequency.
