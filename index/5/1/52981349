ZEUSSS (Zero Energy Ubiquitous Sound Sensing Surface), allows physical objects and surfaces to be instrumented with a thin, self-sustainable material that provides acoustic sensing and communication capabilities. We have built a prototype ZEUSSS tag using minimal hardware and flexible electronic components, extending our original self-sustaining SATURN microphone with a printed, flexible antenna to support passive communication via analog backscatter. ZEUSSS enables objects to have ubiquitous wire-free battery-free audio based context sensing, interaction, and surveillance capabilities.
