Transforming products, or more generally transformers, are devices that change state in order to facilitate new, or enhance an existing, functionality. Mechanical transformers relate to products that reconfigure and can be advantageous by providing multiple functions, while often conserving space. A basic example is a foldable chair that can be stowed when not in use, but provides ergonomic and structural seating when deployed. Utilizing transformation can also lead to novel designs that combine functions across domains, such as an amphibious vehicle that provides both terrestrial and aquatic transportation. In order to harness these assets of transformation, the Transformational Design Theory [1] was developed. This theory outlines a set of principles and facilitators that describe and embody transformation for the purpose of systematically assisting the design of transformers. To build on this theory, this paper analyzes a repository of popular transformer toys. Transformer toys are chosen for this study because of their richness in displaying a variety of kinematic aspects of transformation. Through this process, new definitions to describe transformation are garnered and a set of guidelines are developed to further aid designers. The empirical data set of transformer toys is rich in information and provides a basis for application to other fields, such as robotics and consumer products. These insights, in conjunction with the use of storyboarding, create a new method of designing transformers. This paper presents the method and concludes with a validation exercise in the creation of a new transformer toy.Copyright Â© 2009 by ASME
