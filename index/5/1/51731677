A mobile agent is a promising area in distributed systems. It is a new technology for computers to communicate. Despite the multiple benefits of the mobile agent, but there are several obstacles to its spread. The mobile agent protection is one of these obstacles. In this paper a new mechanism has been proposed to protect mobile. The mechanism is called Partial-Mobility Mechanism (PMM). The main idea behind this mechanism is to allow to mobile agents to visit malicious hosts partially by using a One-HopAgent (OHA). OHA is a type of the mobile agent that contains only a task that will be executed in a malicious host. By avoiding the mobile agent to visit the malicious host, PMM completely protects the mobile agentâ€™s secrecy and integrity. PMM has been implemented using .Net framework and C# technologies. Some experiments have been conducted to test the feasibility and performance of the mechanism. Full analysis of the results have been presented and discussed.
