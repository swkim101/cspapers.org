We propose a nonparametric spatio-temporal stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that can learn the underlying dynamics of arbitrary continuous-time systems without prior knowledge. We augment the input space of the drift function of an SDE with a temporal component to account for spatio-temporal patterns. The experiments demonstrate that the spatio-temporal model is better able to fit a real world data set that has complex dynamics than the spatial model, and can also reduce the forecasting error.
