This paper proposes a novel asynchronous differential measurement method to compute the time varying network induced delay which exists in each period of networked control systems. It is independent of the whole networked clock synchronization and can compute the real-time system delay during a single period. System structure is designed as a distributed network control system which consists of a network scheduling manager, many sensors nodes, and many controller/actuator nodes. Network model adopts Master/Slaver communication industrial Ethernet. Finally, a numerical experiment is given to demonstrate that, this method has strong potential to improve the performance of system with network induced delay and proves its validity and effectiveness.
