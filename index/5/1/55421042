Since regression testing technologies are mainly for software systems, there are few research about the access detecting of the auto fare collection system in rail transit. This paper study the multi-level functional modeling, the source code importing of detected object, the historical test information collection, the test of risk assessment of used cases and cluster selection techniques, and integration of those techniques and further study, which aims to put forward a set of complete regression testing method and to implement a suitable regression testing management tool for the access detecting of the automatic fare collection system in rail transit, which is to verify the correctness and feasibility of this method.
