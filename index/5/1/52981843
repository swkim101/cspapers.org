Wireless body area network plays a vital role in real time healthcare applications for collecting and exchanging sensitive and private information of patient's physical conditions. For the trusted communication between involved entities, an effective authentication technique must be applied to ensure privacy and confidentiality. As the wearable devices are resource-constraint, we propose a lightweight mutually authenticated key-agreement scheme for wireless body area networks using simple XOR and one-way cryptographic hash functions. The proposed scheme enables the wearable sensing device to authenticate the mobile terminal and establish a secret session key. We measure the performance analysis of our proposed scheme with other related schemes regarding computational and communication cost.
