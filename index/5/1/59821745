The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) are two of the instruments onboard the NASA-TERRA platform. The objective of this research is to compare MODIS cloud top pressures and MISR cloud top heights over the Caribbean region to evaluate the retrieval accuracy of both instruments. Variations in cloud top measurements show the ability of MISR to acquire cloud top information at high levels of the atmosphere. MISR cloud top heights can be approximately 2 to 4 kilometers higher than MODIS cloud top heights in most of the situations when MISR cloud top heights are higher. Other variations between MODIS and MISR cloud top heights may indicate the retrieval of two different cloud heights over the same area when highest error between MISR and MODIS high clouds vary between 15 and 19 kilometers. This observation may indicate that one of the instruments was detecting a low cloud. Over 9000 meters, MODIS detects higher cloud tops than MISR in 13.98% of the total observed area. But MISR detects higher cloud tops than MODIS in 26.89% of the total observed area. MISR retrieval performance for high clouds is twice the MODIS retrieval performance. MISR and MODIS cloud values coincide in less than 1% of the total observed area and the cloud height value is 14km. Overall results about the observations between MODIS and MISR show that MISR is a better instrument to measure high clouds including optically thin clouds. Future work will incorporate the use of ICESat multi-cloud layer data to validate MISR and MODIS cloud top heights.
