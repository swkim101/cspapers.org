Since License Assisted Access LTE (LAA-LTE) employs a conservative energy detection (ED) threshold for transmission to coexist with Wi-Fi in unlicensed bands, the spatial spectrum reuse of LAA-LTE can be significantly impaired. Such non-flexible thresholding has been introduced mainly due to ED's incapability of differentiating Wi-Fi frames from LTE frames. As a remedy, we design and develop an LAA-LTE transmitter based on a software-defined radio system proposing lightweight but effective Wi-Fi frame detection with which an LAA-LTE device can capture a Wi-Fi preamble by only using LTE's own time-domain samples. Experiments confirm the efficacy of the developed system.
