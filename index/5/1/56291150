If we try to align meaning representations of translated sentences, we are faced with the following problem: even though concepts and relations ought to be independent from specific natural languages, the non-logical symbols present meaning representations in usually resemble language-specific words. In faithful translations, such symbols can be easily aligned. In informative translations (where more information is provided by the target translation), symbols can be aligned by a symbol denoting an inclusion relation. In loose translations, we need a third combinator to combine symbols with similar but not identical meanings. We show how this can be done with several concrete, non-trival English-German translation pairs. The resulting formalism is a first step towards constructing parallel meaning banks.
