Model transformation tools often work at the meta-model level by manipulating instances of metamodel constructs. In our work on enabling automatic test case generation from UML diagrams, we built a tool that converts a sequence diagram to a graph structure. Our tool uses a sequence diagram editor, SeDi, which uses the UML2 Eclipse plugin, which in turn implements the superstructure of the UML 2.0 metamodel. During the tool development process, we faced several challenges that can be attributed to either the UML superstructure or its implementation. In this paper, we illustrate the problems and our solutions.
