This paper discusses various approaches and equipment/robots used for behavioral assessment and improvement of an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) child. These studies are usually conducted for 4-6 weeks period of time. All of these therapies involve a considerable improvement in various features evaluated for an ASD child. The improvement is observed in various parameters evaluated such as joint attention, occlusion, distance from the robot, eye contact, social interaction, communication and many more depending upon the time taken and features chosen for each therapy. Children with autism spectrum disorders have shown a remarkable improvement when brought in interaction with robots by involving in various collaborative plays.
