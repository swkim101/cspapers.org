In this paper, the performance of hybrid radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting amplify-and-forward relaying networks is investigated. Particularly, a base station (BS) communicates with destination via the assistance of a energy-constrained relay over Nakagami-m fading channels. The hybrid RF energy harvesting architecture at the relay, i.e. time switching (TS) and power splitting (PS), is considered in combining manner to power the relay. In order to evaluate the performance of this considered system, the exact closed-form expressions of outage probability and throughput are derived based on the statistical characteristics of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, in order to understand the behavior of this system, we investigate the performance in various system parameters, such as transmit SNR, energy harvesting time, power splitting ratio, and relay location. Finally, the Monte-Carlo computer simulation is provided to validate the correctness of the analytical results.
