Strain wave gears are frequently used in small and medium size industrial robots. In order to describe and quantify friction effects in gearboxes of such type, a structurally simple, yet powerful model is proposed taking into account both speed-and load-dependent friction effects. Moreover, position-dependent disturbances in a robotic joint are considered. An identification procedure is presented that allows to separate the individual components of the model and identify them subsequently. The effectiveness of the model and identification procedure is validated using experimental data gathered from four different robotic joints of varying size. Furthermore, the benefits of improved friction modeling are shown by means of different applications, including smooth lead-through programming and sensorless force control.
