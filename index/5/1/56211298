now well admitted that interconnects introduce delays and consume power and chip resources. To deal with these problems, some studies have been done on performance optimization. However, such techniques are not always based on good criteria for interconnect performance optimizations. We have, therefore, developed a high-level estimation tool based on transistor-level characteristics, which provides fast and accurate figures for both time and power consumption. These results allowed us to determine new key issues that have to be taken into account for future performance optimizations. Table of Contents of the paper
