This work investigates the possibility of using Deterministic Network Calculus to verify real-time constraints in IP based in-car networks. A combination of the Real-Time Calculus toolbox [?] and the Cyclic Network Calculus toolbox [?] has been used to create a model of a switch providing fixed priority/FIFO scheduling. Considerations on how to model such a switch in general and how to create a model in the toolbox are presented. The switch model is validated by inspection and soundness check of results for varying model parameters.
