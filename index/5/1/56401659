This paper presents a novel feature vector generation technique of malware data which retains high classification accuracy over an extended time period. The proposed approach is to combine the features and accumulating these features with intervals over time. Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains constant classification accuracy and with a standard deviation of 0.92 over the extended time period. These results strongly support the hypothesis that it is possible to develop any classification strategy that will work well into the future
