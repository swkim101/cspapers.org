Telecommunication room always need keep appropriate environment temperature for years. This paper presents a green energy saving temperature monitor system for telecommunication room based on Freescale MCF52259 microcontroller and MQX RTOS, which is consist of three parts: temperature sensor array, controller and air conditioners. Controller periodically acquires temperature- measured value of all regions in the room, and processes data using multi-sensor data fusion technique; on this base, controller regulates every region's environment temperature into proper range. According to the result of actual application, the monitor system works reliably and the average energy saving rate reach 29 percent.
