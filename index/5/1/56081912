Instructionwindowsizeis an importantdesignparameter for manymodernprocessor s. Largeinstructionwindows offer thepotentialadvantage of exposinglarge amountsof instruction level parallelism. Unfortunately, naivelyscaling conventionalwindowdesignscansignificantlydegrade clock cycletime, underminingthebenefitsof increasedparallelism. Thispaperpresentsa newinstructionwindowdesigntargetedat achieving the latencytoleranceof large windows with theclock cycletimeof smallwindows.Thekey observation is that instructionsdependent on a long latencyoperation (e.g., cache miss)cannotexecuteuntil that source operation completes.Theseinstructionsare movedout of theconventional,small,issuequeueto a much larger waiting instructionbuffer (WIB). Whenthe long latencyoperation completes, theinstructionsarereinsertedinto theissue queue. In this paper, we focusspecificallyon load cache missesandtheir dependent instructions.Simulationsreveal that, for an 8-way processor , a 2K-entry WIB with a 32entry issuequeuecanachievespeedupsof 20%,84%,and 50%over a conventional32-entryissuequeuefor a subset of theSPECCINT2000,SPECCFP2000,andOldenbenchmarks,respectively .
