As legged robots are sent into unstructured environments, the ability to robustly manage contact transitions will be a critical skill. This paper introduces an approach to probabilistically fuse contact models, managing uncertainty in terrain geometry, dynamic modeling, and kinematics to improve the robustness of contact initiation at touchdown. A discrete-time extension of the generalized-momentum disturbance observer is presented to increase the accuracy of proprioceptive force control estimates. This information is fused with other contact priors under a framework of Kalman Filtering to increase robustness of the method. This approach results in accurate contact detection with 99.3 % accuracy and a small 4-5ms delay. Using this new detector, an Event-Based Finite State Machine is implemented to deal with unexpected early and late contacts. This allows the robot to traverse cluttered environments by modifying the control actions for each individual leg based on the estimated contact state rather than adhering to a rigid time schedule regardless of actual contact state. Experiments with the MIT Cheetah 3 robot show the success of both the detection algorithm, as well as the Event-Based FSM while making unexpected contacts during trotting.
