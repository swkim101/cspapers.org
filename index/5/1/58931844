This paper presents a technique which is being developed for the identification and subsequent classification of abnormal conditions undergone by robots. Initially, our experimental robot collects data under normal conditions. These sensor readings constitute the input of the Global Fuzzy C-means Clustering Algorithm which classifies the gathered data into different clusters. Then, the robot is subjected to a number of disturbances, while the degree of success in the accomplishment of the robot task is evaluated. The number of times that the robot is subject to the conditions represented by each cluster and is able to make progress or not is accumulated by a pair of counters. As a result, the creation of new clusters reveals the existence of abnormal situations and the counter values indicate the potential impact that the conditions represented by a cluster could have on the robot’s mission. Further iterations of the algorithm allow the generation or absorption of clusters, changing the robot’s notion of normal and abnormal. Hence the counter values are mapped to the new clustering configuration maintaining the information about the experience gained by the robot when facing similar conditions to those already experienced. The experimental results have shown the proposed method’s capability to cluster an array of sensorial information into different types of situations experienced by a robot. This classification would facilitate the search for ways to overcome abnormal situations that could have a negative impact on a robot’s performance.
