In this paper, we consider a multi-hop relaying protocol using beacon-assisted energy harvesting. In the proposed protocol, a source encodes its data by Fountain codes, and sends encoded packets to a destination via intermediate relays. An eavesdropper who appears around the destination attempts to receive the encoded packets for the data recovery. For performance evaluation, we derive exact expressions of outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) over Rayleigh fading channels under impact of hardware impairments. Computer simulations are then performed to verify our derivations.
