Significant research progress has been made in intelligent imaging systems, surveillance and biometrics-improving robustness, increasing performance and decreasing cost. As a result, deployment of biometrics, surveillance and intelligent video systems is booming and increasing the impact of these on privacy. For many, networked intelligent video surveillance and biometrics epitomize the invasion of privacy by an Orwellian “big brother”. While tens of millions in government funding have been spent on research improving video surveillance and biometrics, virtually none has been invested in technologies to enhance privacy or effectively balance privacy and security.
