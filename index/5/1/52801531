A novel method is described which adds support for sub-array ordered (tiled) arrays to a conventional MMU. The resulting pages contain two dimensional tiles of data rather than one dimensional strips, making tiled virtual memory transparently available to general purpose application programs. The method is further extended to support sub-arrays with three or more dimensions. The image MMU of the Kodak Prophecy Color Publishing System is shown as a product implementation for color picture arrays.
