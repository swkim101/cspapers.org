We present a wearable soft exoskeleton sleeve based on PGM. The sleeve consists of 4 PGMs is controlled by a computing system and can actuate 4 different movements (hand extension, flexion, pronation and supination). Depending on how strong the actuation is, the user feels a slight force (haptic feedback) or the hand moves (if the users relaxes the muscles). The paper gives details about the system implementation, the interaction space and some ideas about application scenarios.
