User interface software and technologies have been evolving significantly and rapidly. This poster presents a breakthrough user experience that leverages multisensorial priming and embedded interaction and introduces an interactive piece of furniture called Sense.Seat. Sensory stimuli such as calm colors, lavender and other scents as well as ambient soundscapes have been traditionally used to spark creativity and promote well-being. Sense.Seat is the first computational multisensorial seat that can be digitally controlled and vary the frequency and intensity of visual, auditory and olfactory stimulus. It is a new user interface shaped as a seat or pod that primes the user for inducing improved mood and cognition, therefore improving the work environment.
