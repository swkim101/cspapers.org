In this paper, we investigate performance of energy harvesting based two-way relay networks with a power beacon over Nakagami-m fading channels. In particular, we consider a two-way relay network, where two sources exchange information via a wireless powered decode-and-forward (DF) relay. By adopting the time switching (TS) architecture at the relay, the data transmission takes place in three phases. For the proposed network, we derive a new exact closed-form expression for the system outage probability. Monte-Carlo based simulations are perform to characterize the system behaviors as well as to verify the correctness of the analysis results.
