IP-based WSNs has been considered as the emerging solution to develop Internet of things. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has chattered and been standardized IPv6 routing protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL). RPL is the routing protocol recommended for most Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, RPL has some open issue when working with different network topologies and Media Access Control (MAC) protocols. This work shows how topologies and MAC protocols affect on the performance of RPL routing protocol. The performance results will be described in term of latency, packet delivery ratio and average power consumption.
