In this paper, we evaluate performance of user selection methods in a multi-user random wireless network, where one user is served by a base station (BS), and the remaining ones can harvest energy from radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted by BS. Three efficient user selection methods are considered in this paper: random user (RAND), nearest-to-BS user (NEAR) and best user (BEST). For performance evaluation and comparison, we derive expressions of outage probability (OP) and average harvested energy over Rayleigh fading channel. We then perform Monte-Carlo simulations to verify the theoretical results.
