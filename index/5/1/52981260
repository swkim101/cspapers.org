Can natural interaction requirements be fulfilled while still harnessing the "supernatural" fantasy of Virtual Reality (VR)? In this work we used off the shelf Electromyogram (EMG) sensors as an input device which can afford natural gestures to preform the "supernatural" task of growing your arm in VR. We recorded 18 participants preforming a simple retrieval task in two phases; an initial and a learning phase where the stretch arm was disabled and enabled respectively. The results show that the gestures used in the initial phase are different than the main gestures used to retrieve an object in our system and that the times taken to complete the learning phase are highly variable across participants.
