We have successfully developed a prototype of a cost-effective, scalable and QoS provision capable SDN switch for IoT communication. The proposed system, that is based on Raspberry pi 3, uses Raspbian operating system and Open vSwitch software. It is compatible with OpenFlow 1.3 and includes four 100 Mbps Ethernet ports. Thanks to taking the advantages of SDN technology, open source software and low-cost mini-computer platform, the developed SDN switch system has a reasonable cost while it is flexible, scalable and still fully supports advanced network functions, i.e. QoS provisioning. The switching system also can be deployed as a network device with various functions such as hub, switch, router, firewall, â€¦ which is determined by a controlling program installed in the SDN controller. The switch configuration and its performance have been verified by testing experiments. We have, then, also run an experimental demonstration of QoS provisioning scenario with our developed SDN switch for IoT network. The obtained numerical results proved the flexibly QoS provisioning capability of the developed SDN switch. Our switch system can be a promising device for creating flexible and cost-effective IoT communication infrastructure.
