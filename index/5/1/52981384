The IEEE 802.11 standard has become the dominant protocol for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). In a span of 20 years, the speed of these networks has increased from 1 Mbps to more than 1 Gbps. Today's Wi-Fi networks may consist of a variety of client devices, ranging from slow legacy 802.11a/b/g to modern and fast 802.11n/ac devices. We describe preliminary findings from a large-scale study obtained from 448 Google Wifi and Google OnHub access points with 2,975 clients. We focus on characterizing the maximum achievable bitrate of heterogeneous wireless links. We also determine the average physical-layer bitrate used on the down link (AP to client) and compare it with the maximum supported bitrate. We find that about 75% of 802.11n and 50% of 802.11ac client devices operate at 75% of their maximum or more and that the bitrates of the remaining devices can be very far from their maximum. These low bitrates could significantly reduce the throughput of high-bitrate devices.
