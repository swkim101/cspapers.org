The paper describes conditions that influenced the implementation of new technologies in educational organizations for adult learners and presents a project of deployment of ICT assisted learning for underprivileged groups of adults. The aim was to foster quality of teaching and learning and raise digital literacy. Instructional design for adult learners with poor learning skills, collaboration skills and ICT knowledge was formed, and interoperability within different technological conditions, systems and delivery platforms was built. Information communication educational technologies were implemented in three forms: (1) multimedia learning material on a CD-ROM for personal computers without Internet connection, (2) computer supported learning environment for guided self-directed learning, and (3) computer supported collaborative learning environment.
