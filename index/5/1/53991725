In this paper, a new method is proposed to measure the reliability of service composition. The service composition is related to structure and interaction associated. This paper first studies structure associated service composition description language BPEL; while to the service interaction, it models the interactive features by applying Petri Net. It gives the definition of Composited Service Stochastic Petri Net, and builds the reliability evaluation model and method, containing structure and interaction associated service composition evaluation and simplification method. The approach is validated through a case and further research directions are pointed out. Keywords-Service Composition; Petri Net; reliability evaluation
