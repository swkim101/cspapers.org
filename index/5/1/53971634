â€” Robots are fast becoming a part of everyday life. This rise can be evidenced both through the public news and announcements, as well as in recent literature in the robotics scientific communities. This expanding development requires new paradigms in producing the necessary software to allow for the users' particular needs. In this paper we present a novel architectural design of the RAPP framework that attempts to address this issue, developed within the context of the EU funded project RAPP "Robotic Applications for Delivering Smart User Empowering Application". The proposed framework has been designed aiming towards a cloud-based approach to integrating robotic devices and their respective applications. This goal was defined going beyond the up-coming trends in infrastructures, and focusing on alternative approaches to conventional robotic controllers, while at the same time expanding the capabilities of the RAPP framework in a seamless and scaling manner.
