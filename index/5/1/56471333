This paper presents a local navigation strategy for autonomous vehicles in urban environments with an Image Based Dynamic Window Approach (IDWA). Differently from the global navigation techniques, which requires the vehicle localization to perform its movement, the focus here was to solve the navigation problem in local navigation steps. For that, the environment features will be used, performing the road lane following e.g. The DWA performs a reactive obstacle avoidance while trying to reach a goal destination. In this case, reach the goal destination is based on the Image Based Visual Servoing equations for road lane following, which were incorporated into the DWA. The final solution takes into account the car kinematics/dynamics constraints to allow the vehicle to follow the road lane while avoiding obstacles. The results show the viability of the proposed methodology.
