We present the status of an on-going work aiming at introducing symbolic simulation and theorem proving in a design flow that uses conventional description and simulation languages. This paper focuses on the formalization of the cycle simulation semantics of a synchronous subset of VHDL, in the ACL2 logic. The model is executable, and the results of its symbolic simulation can be proven equal to a specified expression.The ACL2 input is produced automatically from the VHDL source, which relieves the designer from an error prone manual translation.
