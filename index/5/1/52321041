Although the principle goal of the <italic>DARPA</italic> Domain Name project is to provide a distributed name resolution mechanism for host names in the <italic>DARPA</italic> Internet, it is envisioned that the domain naming scheme will also support names for mailboxes in a <italic>global</italic> mail system that extends to mail networks beyond the <italic>DARPA</italic> Internet. In addition to overviewing the fundamental ideas behind the domain name scheme and outlining a proposal for using domain names as an umbrella naming system for computer mail, we discuss the administrative and technical problems involved in using domain names in the global mail system.
