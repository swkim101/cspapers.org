Recommending valuable contents for microblog users is an important way to improve users' experiences. As high quality descriptors of user semantics, tags have always been used to represent users' interests or attributes. In this work, we propose a microblog recommendation approach via hypergraph random walk tag expansion and user social relation. More specifically, microblogs are considered as hyperedges and terms are taken as hypervertexs for each user, and the weighting strategies for both hyperedges and hypervertexs are established. Random walk is performed on the weighted hypergraph to obtain a number of terms as tags for users. And then the tag similarity matrix and the user-tag matrix can be constructed based on tag probability correlations and weight of each tag. Besides, the significance of user social relation is also considered for recommendation. Moreover, an iterative updating scheme is developed to get the final user-tag matrix for computing the similarities between microblogs and users. Experimental results show that the algorithm is effective in microblog recommendation.
