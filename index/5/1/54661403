Adaptive Rate Control (ARC) algorithm for distributed congested communication nodes in the area of Sky Train Routes (STR) is proposed. STR is also known by its official name of Bangkok Transportation System Network (BTSnet). The ARC algorithm will improve the delivery of packets (throughput) over STR. STR can be implemented by using the advantages of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET). As Mobile Ad Hoc networks consist of nodes, which are randomly moving in unpredictable pattern. In practice, some communication nodes are congested causing dropped packets. The distributed congestion nodes will reflect the degradation of system performance. Then ARC is applied to those distributed congestion nodes. The ARC algorithm will take number of packets-drop and previous packet delay time into account for the adjustment of transmission rate. Several simulations are performed under the congestion of distributed nodes. The improvement of the proposed algorithm is discussed by comparing ours to performance by a traditional method. Results confirm the improvement rate ranges from 4 % up to 10 %.
