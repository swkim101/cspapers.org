This paper presents the autonomous battery exchange operation for small scale UAVs, using a mobile ground base that carries a robotic arm and a service station containing the battery exchange mechanism. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the means to increase the autonomy and persistence of robotic systems without requiring human intervention. The design and control of the system and its components are presented in detail, as well as the collaborative software framework used to plan and execute complex missions. Finally, the results of autonomous outdoor experiments are presented, in which the ground rover successfully localizes, retrieves, services, and deploys the landed UAV, proving its capacity to extend and enhance autonomous operations.
