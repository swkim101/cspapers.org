Modern FPGAs support the dynamic reconfiguration of their content but they offer no built in resource management. This paper describes how this security implication can be solved by using implicit resource descriptors for each FPGA-module and a Role-Based Access Control Model to describe the security policy. The proposed architecture enforces this security policy by using a single module loader that compares the requested resources with the granted privileges.
