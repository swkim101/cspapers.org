The work presented in this paper is an important step toward a better understanding of a compact hydraulic robotic actuator, based on the Integrated Electro-Hydraulic Actuator (IEHA) developed by Alfayad and Ouezdou [1]. The novel advantage of this actuator is being highly compact and autonomous (no need for central hydraulic source), while keeping a good power to weight ratio. In order to present and develop the working dynamics of this actuator, a highly detailed mathematical model for the system is presented. The proposed model is simulated using MATLAB-Simulink software to identify the effect of the internal system parameters on system dynamics and prepare an input-output test-bed model. Such test-bed model is used to obtain the transfer function of the system and its order. Analysis of the effects of the main parameters was carried out and a lower order of the system was identified. A linear model of the system is derived and validated using system identification technique. Finally, a robust motion controller is applied on the proposed linear model and the simulation results are presented.
