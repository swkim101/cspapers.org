This paper focuses on the design of an auditory signal for the Automatic Number Plate Recognition system of Dutch national police. The auditory signal is designed to alert police officers of suspicious cars in their proximity, communicating priority level and location of the suspicious car and taking into account the auditory environment of the police car. Design goals are formulated and corresponding design principles are applied and tested. Conclusions are drawn and discussed and recommendations for future work are made.
