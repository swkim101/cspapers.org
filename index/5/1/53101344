We consider the problem of tracking and localizing radio-tagged targets, a labor-intensive and time-consuming task necessary for wildlife conservation fieldwork. We design a lightweight sensor system for measurement of radio signal strength information from multiple radio tags. The sensor system is designed to suit low-cost, versatile, easy to operate multi-rotor UAVs. In this demo paper, we demonstrate our Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) sensor system for tracking and locating multiple VHF radio tags.
