In this paper, we present SMART (Sequence Matching Across Route Traversals): a vision- based place recognition system that uses whole image matching techniques and odometry information to improve the precision-recall performance, latency and general applicability of the SeqSLAM algorithm. We evaluate the systemâ€™s performance on challenging day and night journeys over several kilometres at widely varying vehicle velocities from 0 to 60 km/h, compare performance to the current state-of- the-art SeqSLAM algorithm, and provide parameter studies that evaluate the effectiveness of each system component. Using 30-metre sequences, SMART achieves place recognition performance of 81% recall at 100% precision, outperforming SeqSLAM, and is robust to significant degradations in odometry.
