Signals In the present work the problem of optimal bin number selection for equidistant Mutual Information (MI) estimator between electroencephalogram (EEG) and cardiorhythmogram (CRG) is ad-dressed. In the previously developed method the bin number selected based on the finding an optimal bin number on the MI values on the range of bin numbers. With application to the real raw EEG and CRG signals it was found that for closely placed or symmetrical channels of EEG data the method can be applied, and the true value of MI value can be found with proposed method. In application to MI calculation between raw EEG and CRG signals that are not significantly coupled, true MI value cannot be estimated with proposed method for small sample size. Reference 12, fig-ures estimation. Abstract Mutual information (MI) is a measure of the amount of information that one random variable contains about another random variable. It is the reduction in the uncertainty of one random variable due to the knowledge of the other [1]. In order to calculate the MI value between some
