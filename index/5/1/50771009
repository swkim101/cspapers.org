Performance critical transaction and storage systems require fast persistence of write data. Typically, a non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) is employed on the datapath to the permanent storage, to temporarily and quickly store write data before the system acknowledges the write request. NVRAM is commonly implemented with battery-backed DRAM. Unfortunately, battery-backed DRAM is small and costly, and occupies a precious DIMM slot. In this paper, we make a case for dual, byte- and block-addressable solid-state drive (2B-SSD), a novel NAND flash SSD architecture designed to offer a dual view of byte addressability and traditional block addressability at the same time. Unlike a conventional storage device, 2B-SSD allows accessing the same file with two independent byte- and block-I/O paths. It controls the data transfer between its internal DRAM and NAND flash memory through an intuitive software interface, and manages the mapping of the two address spaces. 2B-SSD realizes a wholly different way and speed of accessing files on a storage device; applications can access them directly using memory-mapped I/O, and moreover write with a DRAM-like latency. To quantify the benefits of 2B-SSD, we modified logging subsystems of major database engines to store log records directly on it without buffering them in the host memory. When running popular workloads, we measured throughput gains in the range of 1.2X and 2.8X with no risk of data loss.
