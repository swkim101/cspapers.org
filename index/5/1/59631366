This volume contains 17 research papers and one invited keynote presentation paper, presented at the 2002 ACM SIGSOFT Tenth International Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE-10). The symposium was held on November 20-22, 2002, in Charleston, South Carolina. The research papers were selected by the program committee from 128 full-length submissions. All the keynoters were invited to provide a paper to accompany their talks. Gerard Holzmann, recipient of this year's ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Research Award, accepted our invitation.The International Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering brings together researchers and professionals from academia and industry to discuss new research results and ideas that address challenges in the construction of software systems. Submissions to the Symposium were reviewed by the program committee on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Each paper received at least three reviews. A one-day program committee meeting was held in Orlando, Florida, at which all papers were considered and a consensus was reached on the final selection of papers to be presented. Comments from reviewers were returned to the authors of all submissions.
