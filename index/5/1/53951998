Fog computing is an emerging technology that enables the design of novel time sensitive industrial applications. This new computing paradigm also opens several new research challenges in different scientific domains, ranging from computer architectures to networks, from robotics to real-time systems. In this paper, we present a use case in the human-robot collaboration domain, and we identify some of the most relevant research challenges.
