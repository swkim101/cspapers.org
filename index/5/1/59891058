A learning of an algorithm is difficult for a programming beginner. When a programming beginner checks the program of the same algorithm from books, a website, etc. as a reference, which it is a source code from which they differ will confuse them. If the feature analysis in not an algorithm concept but an example program can be performed, it will become an aid of a beginner's algorithm teaching. Then, we focus on the feature analysis method of the algorithm by the program structure formalized method. In this paper, we propose the classifications method focused on the correspondence between a program structure and its specifications. In addition, we also propose the feature analysis method of a program mechanism. As a result of applying these two analysis methods to a practical example, it was shown that a bubble sort program and an insertion sort program have high specifications traceability. In addition, it was shown that a bubble sort program and a selecting sort program have a simple program mechanism.
