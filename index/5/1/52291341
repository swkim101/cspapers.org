In recent years, vision-based analysis systems of micro-objects in a microchannel have been actively developed. However, it is difficult to focus on high-speed micro-objects in a microchannel because the general height of a microchannel is approximately $10-100\ \mu\mathrm{m}$, whereas the depth of focus of the objective lens is approximately $1-4\ \mu\mathrm{m}$. Therefore, we propose a high-speed well-focused image-capturing microscope, which is a system with an objective lens attached to a vibration machine that moves the focus position rapidly by oscillating it up and down to capture well-focused images using a histogram-based algorithm. The proposed microscope system is verified experimentally to capture well-focused images of moving micro- objects.
