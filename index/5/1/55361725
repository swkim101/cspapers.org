We propose a method based on optimal transport for empirical distributions with Laplacian regularization (LOT). Laplacian regularization is a graph-based regu-larization that can encode neighborhood similarity between samples either on the final position of the transported samples or on their displacement. In both cases, LOT is expressed as a quadratic programming problem and can be solved with a Frank-Wolfe algorithm with optimal step size. Result on domain adaptation and a shape matching problems show the interest of using this regularization in optimal transport.
