In recent years, with the prevalence of social media and smart devices, people causally reveal their locations such as shops, hotels, and restaurants in their tweets. Recognizing and linking such fine-grained location mentions to well-defined location profiles are beneficial for retrieval and recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose DLocRL, a new deep learning pipeline for fine-grained location recognition and linking in tweets, and verify its effectiveness on a real-world Twitter dataset.
