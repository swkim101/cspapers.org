This paper investigates the trade-off between reliability and security for a multi-user cognitive radio (CR) network under joint impact of interference constraint and co-channel interference from primary network. In the proposed method, a joint user and jammer selection method is proposed to enhance the system performance. Moreover, the jammer which is selected from one of the available users can harvest energy from the primary co-channel interference to use for generating artificial noises on the secondary eavesdropper. For performance analysis, we derive exact expressions of outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP), which are validated by computer simulations.
