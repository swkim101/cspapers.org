Visible Light Communication (VLC) which has a mass of applications is getting much attention in both academic field and industry. Specifically, light-to-camera (LTC) communications in which information is transmitted to user through visible light signals; whereas, rolling-shutter camera-based receivers are utilized to capture and decode transmitted signals. In this paper, we present a demonstration of LTC communications system which includes a pair of transmitter and receiver. We have used an Arduino Genuino board to implement VLC transmitters which can transmit the identification (ID) messages to user devices through light-emitting diodes (LEDs)-based front-ends. At the receiver, we have developed an Android application which utilizes the CMOS image sensor (CIS) of the smartphone camera to receive the light signals. Besides, some practical problems of our LTC prototype and their solutions are also introduced in this paper.
