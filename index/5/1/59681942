Wavelet Transform has been successfully used for many problems of seismological research. Its traditional form, based on serial implementation, satisfied the vast majority of requirements. Here we examined the parallel implementation of wavelet transform for the real time azimuth estimation. The performance improvement using parallel implementation is the objective that we seek since the above estimation is a critical part of an earthquake early warning system. Out results indicate that the improvement that we gather by the parallelization of wavelet transform can make a considerable difference on the performance of the early warning system.
