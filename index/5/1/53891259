Consider for example a World Wide Web browser. The primary job of a browser is to convert a stream of bytes into an intelligible display of text and graphics. A series of processing elements may be involved in this transformation. A network interface reads bytes off of the communication channel and passes them on to a document interpreter. The document interpreter adds structure to the stream of bytes, the result of which is an HTML tree; it passes the HTML tree onto a document formatter. The document formatter creates a display tree, which is passed onto the document displayer for display on the output device, usually a computer display monitor.1
