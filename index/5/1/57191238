Single Watermark Embedding (SWE) technique has been proposed in the [9] by Wong et al. SWE is used to embed a watermark bit sequence into digital images using two secret keys. Another technique used Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) which enables an 8 × 8 block of an image to be separated into three frequency bands namely the high, middle and low frequency bands. These frequency bands are considered to embed watermark into. It is better to embed watermark in some coefficients in the middle frequency band due to its insensible visibility. In this paper, an improved single watermark embedding (ISWE) is proposed to create a more powerful watermarking scheme that can give better watermarked image quality and enhance watermark’s robustness against JPEG compression attack.
