To examine creative smart clothing design for sports and fitness a fastest growing wearable market, the current study examined an interactive cycling outfit incorporating solar powered LED sensor lights. The completed garment design contributes to eco-design approaches for sustainability, history of fashion (1890's the Rational Cycling Outfit) and aesthetic appeal of clothing. Semi-transparent Hanji fabrics (made with paper mulberry by Korean traditional paper making techniques) and high-tech trim materials (e.g., 3M reflective strips, stretch air-mesh fabric, fluorescent tape) were used to complete the garment part of the current design. This study will fill the gap in the literature for exploring creative design ideas and techniques to design smart clothing for cycling. The area of current smart clothing research would be beneficial for educators to create impactful new interdisciplinary design programs and course contents by incorporating wearable technology, containing new emerging concepts that can aid students to expand their personal and professional spheres in global industry. For designers and marketers in the wearable technology industry, this study will also suggest future research direction on smart clothing design to address aesthetic aspects desired by consumers. Finally, this design shed new light on the fashion history of the late Victorian fashion through the re-interpretation of the Rational Cycling Outfit.
