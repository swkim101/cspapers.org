The paper describes the design and the results of a manual annotation methodology devoted to enrich the Senso Comune resource with semantic role sets for predicates. The main issues encountered in applying the annotation criteria to a corpus of Italian language are discussed together with the choice of anchoring the semantic annotation layer to the underlying dependency syntactic structure. We describe the two experiments we carried to verify the reliability of the annotation methodology and to release the annotation scheme. Finally, we discuss the results of the linguistic analysis of the annotated data and report about ongoing work.
