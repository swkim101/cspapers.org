Robots are being introduced into our society but their social status is still unclear. A critical issue is if the robot’s exhibition of intelligent life-like behavior leads to the human’s perception of animacy and therefore a hesitance to destroy the robot. This study proposes an experiment that investigates if humans destroy a robot differently depending on the robot’s levels of intelligent life-like behavior.
