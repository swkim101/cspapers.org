Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) coexistence is a very challenging problem, resulting in very strong interference among them, which seriously affects the reliability of communication. The interference is the main performance-limiting factor in wireless networks coexistence, and therefore it is crucial to mitigated. The goal of this paper is to decrease inter-WBANs interference and to increase the transmission success probability or throughput. One of the main determinants of the interference is the network geometry distribution. In this paper, the impact of channel sensing range to IEEE 802.15.4-based coexisting WBANs is analyzed and is optimized according to the nearest nodeâ€™s distance. In addition, we model the system adopting the stochastic geometry Poisson point process and analyze the impact of guard zone size to networks performance. Furthermore, the throughput efficiently achieves higher through optimizing the size of guard zone. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the reasonable setting of the protection area can improve effectively the system throughput, and the guard zone radius has an optimal value, which can make the throughput of the network to reach the maximum value. The energy and spectral efficiency, moreover, have been improved.
