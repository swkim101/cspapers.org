A circular polarization array antenna for cubesat satellite application in X-band ranging from 8.0 to 8.4 GHz is proposed. In this paper, sequential phased rotation principle combined with equal power divider for 4Ã—4 array antenna is introduced. The air gap between top and bottom layer is applied to improve and maintain the gain of antenna. Dual feed technique is used to generate circular polarization for single antenna element which has the same magnitude and 90 degrees phase deviation between two input ports. Moreover, annular gaps are placed on square driver patch to match the antenna impedance. As a result, the achieved bandwidth is covered X-band ranging from 8.0 to 8.4 GHz completely while the axial ratio is less than 3 dB and the total gain of 15.89 dBi is achieved at 8.2 GHz.
