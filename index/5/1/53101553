Target material identification is playing an important role in our everyday life. This paper introduces a device-free target material identification system, implemented on ubiquitous and cheap commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi devices. The intuition is that different materials produce different amounts of phase and amplitude changes when a target appears on the line-of-sight (LoS) of a radio frequency (RF) link. However, due to multipath and hardware imperfection, the measured phase and amplitude of the channel state information (CSI) are very noisy. We thus present novel CSI pre-processing schemes to address the multipath and hardware noise issues before they can be used for accurate material sensing. Comprehensive real-life experiments demonstrate that we can identify 10 commonly seen liquids at an overall accuracy higher than 95% with strong multipath indoors.
