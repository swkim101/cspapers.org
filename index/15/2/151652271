This paper entails some ideas of how students' ecological intelligence is constructed through ethnopedagogy and ecopedagogy within the process of teaching and learning at schools in Indonesia. This paper is expected to draw provide some inspiration to high school teachers in the area of social sciences, such as Social Studies, History, and Sociology, to explore and make the best use of local wisdom values in order to support students' ecological intelligence. Ethnopedagogy and ecopedagogy were utilized during the process as both are considered as forms of educational approaches and practices. Ethnopedagogy specifically refers to a form of educational approaches and practices based on local wisdom. In ecopedagogy, however, such approaches and practices are not only specifically based on local wisdom, but also on various aspects directed to gain understanding, awareness, and life skills corresponding to environmental preservation matters (Kahn, 2008). In the author's view, ecological intelligence, as an aptitude to understand, realize, and actualize the significance of living in harmony with the nature, can be supported by both pedagogical forms. This paper will put forward the local wisdom of Sundanese traditional community in West Java Province consisted in the folklores especially related to the methods of preserving forest's natural condition, water source, and local food consumption. Such local wisdom is promoted and developed as learning materials to provide students with ecological intelligence related to understanding, awareness, and competence for significant preservation of forest and water resource. Local wisdom is also explored and integrated into the curriculum to construct students' awareness as green consumers or those favoring local products over the global ones.
