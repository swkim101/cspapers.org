We present two novel solutions for multi-view 3D human pose estimation based on new learnable triangulation methods that combine 3D information from multiple 2D views. The first (baseline) solution is a basic differentiable algebraic triangulation with an addition of confidence weights estimated from the input images. The second, more complex, solution is based on volumetric aggregation of 2D feature maps from the 2D backbone followed by refinement via 3D convolutions that produce final 3D joint heatmaps. Crucially, both of the approaches are end-to-end differentiable, which allows us to directly optimize the target metric. We demonstrate transferability of the solutions across datasets and considerably improve the multi-view state of the art on the Human3.6M dataset.
