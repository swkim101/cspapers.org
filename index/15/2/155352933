The current growth of research and application development in robotics has triggered many efforts in robot standardization led by international, technical and professional associations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). As robotics is a fast-pace changing domain, the development of robotic standards needs to be adapted to that fieldâ€™s requirements. Hence, we propose in this paper a new standard development methodology which could be applied when producing new IEEE standards such as P7007, the IEEE Ontological Standard for Ethically Driven Robotics and Automation Systems.
