Modern aircraft heavily rely on several wireless technologies for communications, control, and navigation. Researchers demonstrated vulnerabilities in many aviation systems. However, the resilience of the aircraft landing systems to adversarial wireless attacks have not yet been studied in the open literature, despite their criticality and the increasing availability of low-cost software-deﬁned radio (SDR) platforms. In this paper, we investigate and demonstrate the vulnerability of aircraft instrument landing systems to wireless attacks. We analyze the instrument landing sys-tem (ILS) waveforms’ and show the feasibility of spooﬁng such radio signals using commercially-available SDR, causing last-minute go around decisions, and even missing the landing zone in low-visibility scenarios. We ﬁrst show that it is possible to fully and in ﬁne-grain control the course deviation indicator, as displayed by the ILS receiver, in real-time , and demonstrate it on aviation-grade ILS receivers. We analyze the potential of both an overshadowing attack, and a lower-power single-tone attack. In order to evaluate the complete attack, we develop a tightly-controlled closed-loop ILS spoofer. It adjusts the adversary’s transmitted signals as a function of the aircraft GPS location, maintaining power and deviation consistent with the adversary’s target position, causing an undetected off-runway landing. We demonstrate the integrated attack on an FAA certiﬁed ﬂight-simulator (X-Plane)incorporating a spooﬁng region detection mechanism, that triggers the controlled spooﬁng on entering the landing zone to reduce detectability. We systematically evaluate the performance of the attack against X-Plane’s AI-based au-toland feature, and demonstrate systematic success rate with offset touchdowns of 18 meters to over 50 meters. Finally, we discuss approaches towards secure and efﬁcient aircraft landing systems
