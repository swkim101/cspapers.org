In most emergencies, people use social media platforms to publicly share information. Such data, from multiple sources is extremely useful for emergency response and public safety: the more knowledge that is gathered, the better the response can be. When an emergency event first occurs, getting the right information as quickly as possible is critical in saving lives. When an emergency event is ongoing, information on what is happening can be critical in making decisions to keep people safe and take control of the particular situation unfolding. In both cases, first responders have to quickly make decisions that include what resources to deploy and where. In this talk, I will describe challenges in emergency response and how a computational platform that leverages public data can address them. A platform to detect emergency situations and deliver the right information to first responders has to deal with ingesting thousands of data points per second: sifting through and identifying relevant information, from different sources, in different formats, with varying levels of detail, in real time, so that first responders and others can be alerted at the right level and at the right time. I will describe technical challenges in processing vast amounts of heterogenous data in real time, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary research and a human-centered approach to address problems in emergency response. I will give specific examples and discuss relevant research topics in Machine Learning, NLP, Information Retrieval, Computer Vision and other fields.
