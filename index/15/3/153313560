It is our great pleasure to welcome you to Emoji2019: The 2 International Workshop on Emoji Understanding and Applications in Social Media at WWW 2019. With the rise of social media, emoji has become a popular and an indispensable form of online communication. Emojis have been widely used to enhance the sentiment, emotion, and sarcasm expressed online. As emojis offer a primary method for more expressive online communication, it is essential to investigate how they can be used to improve computer-mediated communication. However, the ability to automatically process, derive meaning, and interpret text fused with emoji is challenged by the pictorial nature of emoji, the fact that the same emoji may be used in different contexts to express different meanings, and that in different cultures and communities over the world the same emoji representation may be interpreted differently. This makes it especially difficult to apply traditional Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze them. The Emoji2019 workshop seeks to provide a forum to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry in the areas of computer science, social network analysis and mining, natural language processing, computational linguistics, human-computer interaction, and computational social sciences to discuss high-quality research and emerging applications, to exchange ideas and experience, and to identify new opportunities for collaboration towards solving the above challenges.
