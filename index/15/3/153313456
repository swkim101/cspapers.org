Many data intensive applications that use machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques depend on humans providing the initial dataset, enabling algorithms to process the rest or for other humans to evaluate the performance of such algorithms. There are, however, practical issues with the adoption of human computation and crowdsourcing at scale in the real world. Building systems data processing pipelines that require crowd computing remains difficult. In this tutorial, we present practical considerations for designing and implementing tasks that require the use of humans and machines in combination with the goal of producing high quality labels.
