As a successful decentralized online peer production system, Wikipedia has a large number of users participating in selfassigned tasks based on their interest. Participants often coordinate on the tasks about editing an article through the article’s talk page discussions. Researchers analyze Wikipedia talk page discussions for various aspects such as coordination [13], conflict management [1], emotion [8], leadership [12], the relationship between Wikipedia article’s talk page discussion and the article editing activity [5], etc. Besides talk page discussions, Wikipedia’s deletion discussions have also caught researchers’ attentions. In Wikipedia, there are four mechanisms with respect to deleting an article from the web site: speedy deletion, proposed deletion, BLP Deletion, and deletion discussion. Deletion discussion mechanism is designed for controversial articles that the deletion needs to be discussed to reach a conclusion. Also, if a proposed article cannot be tagged with one of the first three mechanisms, it will be tagged for deletion discussion. Researchers have explored various factors of the deletion discussion process and outcome. For example, [19] examined voting behavior in deletion discussions, with a specific emphasis on how early opinions in the debate affect later voices. [6]
