Containerized web-applications have gained popularity recently due to the advantages provided by the containers including light-weight, packaged, fast start up and shut down and easy scalability. As there are more than 267 cloud providers, finding a flexible deployment option for containerized web-applications is very difficult as each cloud offers numerous deployment infrastructure. Benchmarking is one of the eminent options to evaluate the provisioned resources before product-level deployment. However, benchmarking the massive infrastructure resources provisioned by various cloud providers is a time consuming, tedious and costly process and is not practical to accomplish manually. In this demonstration, we present Smart Docker Benchmarking Orchestrator (SmartDBO), a general orchestration framework that automatically benchmarks (deploys and executes) users' containerized web-applications across different cloud providers while meeting the constraints of budget and deployment configurations. SmartDBO aims to answer two questions: (i) how to automate the benchmarking of containerized web-application across multi-cloud environments?, (ii) how to maximize the diversity in a benchmarking solution which covers maximum numbers of cloud providers and types of provisioned infrastructures without exceeding users' budgets? We evaluate all the features of SmartDBO using SimplCommerce and TPC-W executing across Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure.
