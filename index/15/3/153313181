The last decades have shown us a growing interest in different fields of how interactive art transforms the position of the viewer into a participant and how audiences engage and relate to interactive artwork. This article presents a visual analysis of the content shared on Instagram by the audience of Default â€“an interactive art installation presented in Santiago, Chile in 2017. The analysis shows that people reacted and engaged differently with various aspects of the installation, as shown by the strategies they used to share it. We argue that the analysis of the visual content of Instagram posts opens avenues to understanding the relationship between installation and audience, giving clues on the audience experience and, therefore, providing feedback for developers, who could use them in the design process of future installations.
