It is estimated that merely 4% of the world's population reside on US soil. Remarkably, 43% of the entire population of prominent websites are hosted in the United States (Fig. 1). Even though most data content on the Web is unstructured, the US government has had big contributions in producing and actively releasing structured datasets related to different fields such as health, education, safety and finance. Aforementioned datasets are referred to as Open Government Data (OGD) and are aimed at increasing the structured data pool in conjunction with promoting government transparency and accountability. In this paper, we present a new system “OGDXplor” which processes raw OGD through a well-defined procedure leveraging machine learning algorithms and produces meaningful insights. The novelty of this work is encompassed by the collective approach utilized in developing the system and tackling challenges. First by addressing arising challenges due to data being collected and aggregated from heterogeneous sources that otherwise would have been impossible to acquire as a comprehensive unit. moreover, classification and comparisons are drawn on a much finer level that we refer to as zone level. Zones are the areas encompassed and defined by zip codes and are seldomly used in classifying and extracting insights as presented here. OGDXplor facilitates comparing and classifying zones located in different cities or zones within an individual city. The system is presented to end-users as a web application allowing users to elect zones and features relevant to their use case. Results are presented in both chart and map formats which aids the decision-making process.
