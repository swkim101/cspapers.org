Credibility research in the social sciences has a long history that may be particularly informative to today's efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation online. This keynote address will discuss the ways in which credibility has been studied in the disciplines of communication and psychology, including both how this notion has been conceptually and operationally defined. Key research findings will be presented with the aim of understanding what kinds of computational algorithms, tools, systems, and applications for tackling misinformation and disinformation are more versus less likely to be effective. This will help to answer a very important yet often overlooked question, which is: To what extent is misinformation a problem of information or a problem of human information processing? The answer to this question is crucial for both software developers and designers of educational intervention efforts to minimize the negative societal impacts of fabricated news and information flowing over the Internet and on social media. • Applied computing∼Psychology
