TweetSenti is a system for analyzing the sentiment of an entity in tweets. A sentence or tweet may contain multiple entities, and they do not always have the same sentiment polarity. Therefore, it is necessary to detect the sentiment for a specific target entity. This type of target-dependent (entity level) sentiment analysis has become attractive and has been used in many applications, but it is still a challenging task. TweetSenti employs a new approach for detecting the entity level sentiment. Our model splits a sentence into a left context and a right context according to the target entity, and it also exploits two different types of word embeddings to represent a word, the general word embedding and the sentiment specific word embedding. A hybrid neural network is used to capture both the sequence and structure information of the two sides of the target entity. The sequence information is learned by attention-based bi-directional LSTM models. The structure information is captured by multi-context CNN models. Based on this algorithm, we built a web-based application that users can interact with and analyze an entity's sentiment in Twitter at real-time.
