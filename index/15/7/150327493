Received Aug 9, 2017 Revised Oct 20, 2017 Accepted Nov 4, 2017 This paper proposes the design and control strategy for a four degrees-of-freedom spatial cable-suspended parallel robot for pick and place operations. Pick and place is a repetitive task requiring payload changes for the movement to pick-up the object, and the movement to the final pose to release the manipulated object. In this paper, a new robust control strategy has been proposed, together with proper trajectories for the required operation. The control strategy consists on the system decoupling and linearization by means of a feedforward term and a cascade PD controller. The main advantage of the proposed solution is that its design can be scalable in size spanning from centimeters to meters with a relatively good positioning accuracy. Finally, simulations are reported to show the overall performances of the proposed configuration for pick and place operations with a medium size manipulator. Keyword:
