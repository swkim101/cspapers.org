The security of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is a major concern and intrusion detection systems (IDS) are used to ensure this security. Model-based IDSs rely on the CPS model to detect abnormal behaviors. In this article, a model-based IDS rule generator is proposed, which converts a system model into anomaly-based IDS rules. In addition, the effectiveness of the rules generated is proven by a case study.
