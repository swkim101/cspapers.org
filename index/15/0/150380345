MAAS as a mobility model leans on the idea that a gap between private and public transport systems needs to be bridged as well as on a city, intercity, national and supranational level. The current situation is felt problematic due to the fragmented tools and services often organized in silos to meet a traveler needs to undertake a trip. One of the major concerns designing any platform system like Mobility as a Service is where to start modeling and how to express the notion of the platform system in some language that is understandable for all stakeholders of the platform system. Understandability buttresses the expectation of stakeholders whether some design will probably implement the intended platform services enabling users to actually buy and or use the platform system for what ever purpose. Building on the economic theories of two-sided markets and mechanism design we introduce the concept of value nets extending the Contract Protocol Net. Value net modeling offers a precise abstract representation which provides in the detailed informational requirements in a canonical form and it connects i.e. implements the abstract notion of Service Oriented Architecture characterizing systems without loss of crucial informational elements.
