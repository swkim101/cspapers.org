The results of an international Delphi poll on information linguistics which was carried out between 1982 and 1983 are presented.As part of conceptual work being done in information science at the University of Constance an international Delphi poll was carried out from 1982 to 1983 with the aim of establishing a mid-term prognosis for the development of "information linguistics". The term "information linguistics" refers to a scientific discipline combining the fields of linguistic data processing, applied computer science, linguistics, artificial intelligence, and information science. A Delphi poll is a written poll of experts - carried out in this case in two phases. The results of the first round were incorporated into the second round, so that participants in the poll could react to the trends as they took shape.
