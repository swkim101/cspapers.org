Product pages on e-commerce websites often overwhelm their customers with a wealth of data, making discovery of relevant information a challenge. Motivated by this, here, we present a novel framework to answer both factoid and non-factoid user questions on product pages. We propose several question-answer matching models leveraging both deep learned distributional semantics and semantics imposed by a structured resource like a domain specific ontology. The proposed framework supports the use of a combination of these models and we show, through empirical evaluation, that a cascade of these models does much better in meeting the high precision requirements of such a question-answering system. Evaluation on user asked questions shows that the proposed system achieves 66% higher precision1 as compared to IDF-weighted average of word vectors baseline [1].
