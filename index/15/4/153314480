This half-day tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to web stream processing, including the fundamental stream reasoning concepts, as well as an introduction to practical implementations and how to use them in concrete web applications. To this extent, we intend to (1) survey existing research outcomes from Stream Reasoning / RDF Stream Processing that arise in querying, reasoning on and learning from a variety of highly dynamic data, (2) introduce deductive and inductive stream reasoning techniques as powerful tools to use when addressing a data-centric problem characterized both by variety and velocity, (3) present a relevant use-case, which requires to address data velocity and variety simultaneously on the web, and guide the participants in developing a web stream processing application.
