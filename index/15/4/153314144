With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs), point of interest (POI) recommendation has become an important way to meet users' personalized demands. The aim of POI recommendation is to provide personalized recommendation of POIs for mobile users. However, traditional POI recommendation systems cannot satisfy users' personalized demands. The reason is that the traditional POI recommendation system cannot recommend the next POI to a user based on the user's context information. Also, the traditional POI recommendation system provides no real-time guarantee on performance. In this demo, we propose a novel real-time next POI recommendation system named R2SIGTP which provides more personalized real-time recommendation compared with existing ones. Our system has the following advantages: 1) it has real-time performance; 2) it uses a unified approach to integrate geographic and preference information; 3) it considers the feedback of each single user to provide more personalized recommendation. We have implemented our system. R2SIGTP is easy to use and can be used by the mobile terminal's browser to recommend the next POI to the user in real-time based on the automatically identified user location and current time. The experimental results on real-world LBSNs show that R2SIGTP's performance is satisfactory.
