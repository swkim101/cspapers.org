In this keynote we describe progress in work that our research teams have been doing over the past years, including advances in difficult problems in artificial intelligence, on building large-scale computer systems for machine learning research, and, in collaboration with many teams at Google, on applying our research and systems to dozens of Google products. Our group has open-sourced the TensorFlow system [2], a widely popular system designed to easily express machine learning ideas, and to quickly train, evaluate and deploy machine learning systems. We then highlight some of our research accomplishments, and relate them to the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Engineering Challenges for the 21st Century. This is joint work with many people at Google.
