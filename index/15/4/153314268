Developing instructions for microtask crowd workers requires time to ensure consistent interpretations by crowd workers. Even with substantial effort, workers may still misinterpret the instructions due to ambiguous language and structure in the task design. Prior work demonstrated methods for facilitating iterative improvement with help from the requester. However, any participation by the requester reduces the time saved by delegating the workâ€”and hence the utility of using crowdsourcing. We present TaskMate, a system for facilitating worker-led refinement of task instructions with minimal involvement by the requester. Small teams of workers search for ambiguities and vote on the interpretation they believe the requester intended. This paper describes the workflow, our implementation, and our preliminary evaluation.
