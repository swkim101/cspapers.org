It is our great pleasure to welcome you to The Web Conference 2019 PhD Symposium. The goal of the PhD Symposium is to provide a supportive atmosphere for mid-career PhD students to present and receive feedback on their ongoing work. Students get an opportunity to present and discuss their problem statements, goals, methods and results. The symposium aims to provide students with useful guidance on various aspects of their research from established researchers and other PhD students, working in areas related to the World Wide Web. Finally, the symposium also aims to enable PhD students to interact with other participants and potential collaborators in order to stimulate an exchange of ideas, suggestions and experiences.
