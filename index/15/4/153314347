The goal of this work is to systematically extract information from hacker forums, whose information would be in general described as unstructured: the text of a post is not necessarily following any writing rules. By contrast, many security initiatives and commercial entities are harnessing the readily public information, but they seem to focus on structured sources of information. Here, we focus on the problem of analyzing text content in security forums. A key novelty is that we use user profiles and contextual features along with transfer learning approach and also embedding space to help us identify and refine information that we could not get from security forum with trivial analysis. We collect a wealth of data from 5 different security forums. The contribution of our work is twofold; (a) we develop a method to automatically identify through the forums malicious IP addresses (b) we also propose a systematic method to identify and classify user-specified threads of interest into four categories. We further showcase how this information can inform knowledge extraction from the forums. As the cyber-wars are becoming more intense, having early accesses to useful information becomes more imperative to remove the hackers first-move advantage, and our work is a solid step towards this direction.
