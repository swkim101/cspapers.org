It is a streaming world: a new generation of Web Applications is pushing the Web infrastructure to evolve and process data as soon as they arrive. However, the Web of Data is not appealing to the growing number of Web Applications demanding to tame Data Velocity. To solve these issues, we need to introduce new key abstractions, i.e., stream and events. Moreover, we need to investigate how to identify, represent and process streams and events on the Web. In this paper, we discuss why taming Velocity on the Web of Data. We present a Design Science research plan that builds on the state of the art of Stream Reasoning and RDF Stream Processing. Finally, we present our research results, for representing and processing stream and events on the Web.
