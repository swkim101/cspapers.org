Deep Learning has shown significant results in various domains. In this tutorial, we provide conceptual understanding of embedding methods, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We present fashion use case and apply these techniques for modeling image, text as well as sequence data to figure out user profiles, give personalized recommendations tailored to changing user taste and interest. Given the image of a fashion item, recommending complementary matches is a challenge. Usersâ€™ taste evolves over time and depends on persona. Humans relate objects based on their appearance and non-visual factors of lifestyle merchandise which further complicate recommendation task. Composing outfits in addition necessitates constituent items to be compatible - similar in some but different in other aspects.
