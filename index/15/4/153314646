This workshop focuses on intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and e-Commerce. NLP and information retrieval (IR) have been powering e-Commerce applications since the early days of the fields. Today, NLP and IR already play a significant role in e-Commerce tasks, including product search, recommender systems, product question answering, machine translation, sentiment analysis, product description and review summarization, and customer review processing. With the exploding popularity of chatbots and shopping assistants – both textand voice-based – NLP, IR, question answering, and dialogue systems research is poised to transform e-Commerce once again.
