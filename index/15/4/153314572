Most recommendation algorithms produce results without humans-in-the-loop. Combining algorithms with expert human curation can make recommendations much more effective, especially in hard-to-quantify domains like fashion. But it also makes things more complicated, introducing new sources of statistical bias and challenges for traditional approaches to training and evaluating algorithms. Humans and machines can also disagree, further complicating the design of production systems. In this talk I'll share lessons from combining algorithms and human judgement for personal styling recommendations at Stitch Fix, an online personal styling service that commits committed to its recommendations through the physical delivery of merchandise to clients.
