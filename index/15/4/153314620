The inclusion of tracking technologies in personal devices opened the doors to the analysis of large sets of mobility data like GPS traces and call detail records. This tutorial presents an overview of both modeling principles of human mobility and machine learning models applicable to specific problems. We review the state of the art of five main aspects in human mobility: (1) human mobility data landscape; (2) key measures of individual and collective mobility; (3) generative models at the level of individual, population and mixture of the two; (4) next location prediction algorithms; (5) applications for social good. For each aspect, we show experiments and simulations using the Python library ”scikit-mobility” developed by the presenters of the tutorial.
