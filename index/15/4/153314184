Automated detection of text with misrepresentations such as fake reviews is an important task for online reputation management. The dataset of customer complaints - emotionally charged texts which are very similar to reviews and include descriptions of problems customers experienced with certain businesses â€“ is presented. It contains 2746 complaints about banks and provides clear ground truth, based on available factual knowledge about the financial domain. Among them, 400 texts were manually tagged. Initial experiments were performed in order to explore the links between implicit cues of the rhetoric structure of texts and the validity of arguments, and also how truthful/deceptive are these texts.
