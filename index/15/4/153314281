Hypermedia is increasingly used in Web service design, particularly in Web of Things and Linked Data systems: the dynamic and open nature of these systems requires components to be deployed and to evolve independently from one another, which makes the use of static Web APIs that are manually integrated by developers simply impractical (in any such systems). This evolution raises new challenges: to discover, consume, and integrate hypermedia APIs at runtime, clients have to become increasingly autonomous in pursuit of their design goals. Such autonomous systems have been studied to a large extent in research on multi-agent systems (MAS). To consolidate the evolution of hypermedia APIs, it is now necessary to have comprehensive discussions on integrating hypermedia systems and MAS, which we call Hypermedia MAS.
