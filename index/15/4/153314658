This study explores an online fact-checking community called politicalfactchecking on reddit.com that relies on crowdsourcing to find and verify check-worthy facts relating to U.S. politics. The community embodies a network journalism model in which the process of finding and verifying check-worthy facts through crowdsourcing is coordinated by a team of moderators. Applying the concepts of connective journalism, this study analyzed the posts (N = 543) and comments (N = 10, 221) on the communityâ€™s Reddit page to understand differences in roles of the community members and the moderators. A mixed-method approach was used to analyze the data. The authors also developed an automated argument classification model to analyze the contents and identify ways to automate parts of the process. The findings suggest that a model consisting of crowds, professionals, and computer-assisted analysis could increase efficiency and decrease costs in news organizations that involve fact-checking.
