It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the AW4City 2019 5 International Workshop on Web Applications and Smart Cities. This year’s fifth AW4City version follows up the success of the previous four events and emphasizes on the contribution of web applications and Apps to urban mobility. In the era of cities and under the UN 2030 Agenda for sustainable growth, cities are making an important shift regarding thinking of compact cities and they develop sustainable mobility plans. Issues like parking, traffic congestion and safety, sharing transportation and smart parking are among the topics where governments and the industry direct smart services, while data collection and analysis enable government’s fast –or even real-timedecision-making for alternative transportation means’ deliberation, public transportation changes, urban planning etc., and new business models appear that utilize platforms and data. Additionally, new types of business in transportation appear (e.g., that utilize sensors and big data), while things’ transportation is another challenge that cities have been started phasing.
