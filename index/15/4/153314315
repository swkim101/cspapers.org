This paper is a progress report on our recent work on two applications that use Linked Data and Distributed Ledger technologies and aim to transform the Greek public sector into a decentralized, trusted, intelligent and linked organization. The first application is a re-engineering of Diavgeia, the Greek government portal for open and transparent public administration. The second application is Nomothesia, a new portal that we have built, which makes Greek legislation available on the Web as linked data to enable its effective use by citizens, legal professionals and software developers who would like to build new applications that utilize Greek legislation. The presented applications have been implemented without funding from any source and are available for free to any part of the Greek public sector that may want to use them. An important goal of this paper is to present the lessons learned from this effort.
