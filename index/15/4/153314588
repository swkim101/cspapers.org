Historically, most of the focus in the knowledge graph community has been on the support for web, social network, or product search applications. This paper describes some of our experience in developing a large-scale applied knowledge graph for a more technical audience with more specialized information access and analysis needs â€“ the air traffic management community. We describe ATMGRAPH, a knowledge graph created by integrating various sources of structured aviation data, provided in large part by US federal agencies. We review some of the practical challenges we faced in creating this knowledge graph.
