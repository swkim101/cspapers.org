The need for social innovation is clear: From climate change to income inequality to geopolitical upheaval and terrorism, the difficulties confronting us are unprecedented not only in their variety but also in their complexity. At the same time, today’s public policy practices and tools are not sufficient. Increasingly, it is clear, we need not only new solutions but new methods to arriving at solutions. Data and data science will become more central to meeting these challenges and to social innovation, philanthropy, international development and humanitarian aid. From the analysis of satellite imagery to mapping poverty to using Facebook data to track the global digital gender gap, “Data Science for Social Good” provides great promise. Data from corporate actors (e.g. mobile phones data, remote sensing, satellite imagery) as well as data from digital traces generated by the pervasiveness of the Web in combination with state-of-the-art knowledge generated by data science can be synergically exploited to solve issues around many social problems and support global agencies and policymakers in implementing better and more impactful policies and interventions.
