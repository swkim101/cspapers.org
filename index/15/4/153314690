Increased polarization and partisanship have become a consistent state of politics, media, and society, especially in the United States. As many news publishers are perceived as “biased” and some others have come under attack as being “fake news”, efforts to make such labels stick have increased too. In some cases (e.g., InfoWars), the use of such labels is legitimate, because some online publishers deliberately spread conspiracy theories and false stories. Other news publishers are perceived as partisan and biased, in ways that damages their reporting credibility. Whether political bias affects journalism standards appears to be a debated topic with no clear consensus. Meanwhile, labels such as “far-left” or “alt-right” are highly contested and may become cause for prolonged edit wars on the Wikipedia pages of some news sources. In this paper, we try to shine a light into this phenomenon and its extent, in order to start a conversation within the Wikipedia community about transparent processes for assigning political orientation and journalistic reliability labels to news sources, especially to unfamiliar ones, which users would be more likely to verify by looking them up. As more of Wikipedia’s content is used outside Wikipedia’s “container” (e.g., in search results or by voice personal assistants), the issue of where certain statements appear in the Wikipedia page and their verifiability becomes an urgent one to consider not only by Wikipedia editors, but by third-party information providers too.
