In this lighting talk paper, we present a dataset of jokes in Russian and deep learning model for solving humor recognition task. The new large dataset was collected from various online resources and complemented carefully with unfunny texts with similar lexical properties. In total, there are more than 300,000 short texts, which is significantly larger than any previous humor-related corpus. Manual annotation of 2,000 items proved the reliability of corpus construction approach. Further, we applied language model fine-tuning for text classification and obtained an F1 score of 0.91, which constitutes a considerable gain over baseline methods.
