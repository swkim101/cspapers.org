Decentralised data solutions bring their own sets of capabilities, requirements and issues not necessarily present in centralised solutions. In order to compare the properties of different approaches or tools for management of decentralised data, it is important to have a common evaluation framework. We present a set of dimensions relevant to data management in decentralised contexts and use them to define principles extending the FAIR framework, initially developed for open research data. By characterising a range of different data solutions or approaches by how TRusted, Autonomous, Distributed and dEcentralised, in addition to how Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable, they are, we show that our FAIR TRADE framework is useful for describing and evaluating the management of decentralised data solutions, and aim to contribute to the development of best practice in a developing field.
