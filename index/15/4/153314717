How do learners schedule their online learning? This issue is concerned by both course instructors and researchers, especially in the context of self-paced online learning environment. Many indicators and methods have been proposed to understand and improve the time management of learning activities, however, there are few tools of visualizing, comparing and exploring the time management to gain intuitive understanding. In this demo, we introduce the LearnExp, an interactive visual analytic system designed to explore the temporal patterns of learning activities and explain the relationships between academic performance and these patterns. This system will help instructors to comparatively explore the distribution of learner activities from multiple aspects, and to visually explain the time management of different learner groups with the prediction of learning performance.
