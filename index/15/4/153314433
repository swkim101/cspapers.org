In this keynote, I will present some results we have obtained using location data from mobile phones interacting with information (news) websites, mobile apps like Pokemon GO and Twitter, and large physical spaces like shopping malls. I will draw some conclusions and generally discuss about the properties of mobile phone data for location-based research to finally close with some remarks about privacy and data security.
