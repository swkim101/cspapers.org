We present QAnswer, a Question Answering system which queries at the same time 3 core datasets of the Semantic Web, that are relevant for end-users. These datasets are Wikidata with Lexemes, LinkedGeodata and Musicbrainz. Additionally, it is possible to query these datasets in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Pourtuguese, Arabic and Chinese. Moreover, QAnswer includes a fallback option to the search engine Qwant when the answer to a question cannot be found in the datasets mentioned above. These features make QAnswer as the first prototype of a Question Answering System over a considerable part of the LOD cloud.
