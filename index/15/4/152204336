1. SUMMARY We propose a special session focusing on kinesthetic learning activities, i.e., physically engaging classroom exercises. These might, for example, involve throwing a frisbee around the classroom to represent transfer of control in a procedure call, or simulating polygon scan conversion with rope for edges and students for pixels. The session will begin with a brief kinesthetic learning activity to motivate the value of these activities. We will follow with a variety of examples, and discuss how to deploy these in a classroom. In the middle of the session, the audience will divide into facilitated groups to design their own activities. Finally, we will all mingle to share and discuss the results. We will set up a public web forum for continued discussion and generation of new ideas.
