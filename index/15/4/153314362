This report describes a way to represent and operate on an RDF dataset such the it behaves as an instance of a conflict free replicable datatype. In this industry presentation, we describe how we accomplish this for the Dydra RDF graph storage service in a manner compatible with the SPARQL Graph Store HTTP Protocol (GSP). The standard GSP concerns the current store state only. Dydra retains previous store states as active addressable aspects analogous to named graphs in a quad store. It incorporates and addresses arbitrary revisions of target datasets according to ETag and Content-Disposition specifications in HTTP headers. Appropriate interpretation of these arguments permits to replicate datasets among cooperating participants.
