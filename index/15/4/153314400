To understand why and how subjectivity and disagreement in label collection matters or doesn't matter I examine the history of systems evaluations and measurement performed by humans and trace the roots of human computation/crowdsourcing and the context in which it arose. Before we can begin fruitful discussions about subjectivity and disagreement we need to ask ourselves what/who it is that human raters are supposed to represent. I offer multiple different perspectives and scenarios that showcase just how varied and ill-defined the role of a human rater can be. I will conclude with some practical recommendations with respect to the questions researchers and practitioners ought to ask themselves before employing human raters, and some challenges with both methodology of such data collection and subsequent analysis of such data.
