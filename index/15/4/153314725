This paper demonstrates a novel analytics service, CrowdPT, for capturing the key information, price target (PT), of individual investors on social media. PT, which is mentioned as a conclusion in most of analysts' reports, indicates not only the market sentiment (bullish/bearish) of investors, but also the analysis results. In order to provide the latest opinions of individual investors, we monitor Twitter in real time and update the information in price chart daily. For all component stocks in Dow Jones Industrial Average, textual information from numerous tweets is summarized into a single number, PT, in CrowdPT. Case studies confirm the effectiveness of our analytics service in the financial domain, and show that capturing the PT of individual investors is promising for stock price prediction. The Web API of CrowdPT is also provided for academic purpose.
