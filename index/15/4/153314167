Welcome to the TheWebConf 2019 International Workshop on Modeling Social Media (MSM'2019) Mining, Modeling and Learning from Social Media. We are celebrating our 10 edition (one decade) of our workshop. Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn generate huge amounts of data that require the application of big data analytics to produce meaningful information to both information consumers and data generators. Machine learning and AI techniques are particularly effective in situations where deep and predictive insights need to be uncovered from such social media data sets that are large, diverse and fast changing.
