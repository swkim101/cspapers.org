LA-WEB was born in 2003 as an international scientific venue that aims towards gathering the community of Web researchers and practitioners worldwide, working on topics of importance to the Latin American region. In addition, this year we have extended LA-WEB's scope to also include Web-centered research from Latin American institutions and from Latin American authors around the world. We expect that the combination of LA-WEB and The Web Conference will create a synergetic atmosphere between the Latin American Web community and the global community of leading Web researchers.
