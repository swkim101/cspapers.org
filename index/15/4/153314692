In this paper we present a proof-of-concept of a visual navigation tool for a personalized “sandbox” of Wiki pages. The navigation tool considers multiple groups of algorithmic parameters and adapts to user activity via graphical user interfaces. The output is a 2D map of a subset of Wikipedia pages network which provides a different and broader visual representation – a map – in the neighborhood (according to some metric) of the pages around the page currently displayed in a browser. The representation schema includes the incorporation of a kind of transparency in the algorithmic parameters affecting the presentation of the landscape visualization, which in turn enables the delivery of a personalized canvas, designed by the user. A case study shows the combination of four different sourcing (i.e., identification and extraction of the neighboring pages) rules and three layouts over the same Wikipedia subnetwork. The basic schema is readily adapted to other search experiences and contexts.
