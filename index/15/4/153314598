Smart technologies advancements, emerging markets competition and sustainability needs have radically changed tourism and transport sectors. The key features of this change are the exploitation of evolving Big Data in the business intelligence context, the development of customized services tailored to the needs of consumers with the purpose of improving their experience, and the development of new business models based on the interaction between business and consumers. This is due to the capacity of smart transport technologies to integrate customers sensing and in this way a novel framework aimed at: i) developing personalized transport services in the tourism sector and ii) creating and delivering patterns of tourist consumer behavior according to specific target groups and market segments at tourist destination or country level is designed and outlined. The proposed “TΟMI” framework, exploits tour data analytics, in order to enable the deployment of personalized tour services that will be beneficial for tour operators, travellers and any other interested parties (local stakeholders, tourism entrepreneurs, etc.). The exploitation of the “TOMI” framework for the purpose of organizing tours in a city is also addressed through a case study on the city of Thessaloniki.
