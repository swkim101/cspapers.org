It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the First International Workshop on Misinformation, Computational Fact-Checking and Credible Web at TheWebConf 2019. It is a recognized problem that our society is struggling with an unprecedented amount of falsehood that harms wealth, democracy, and health. Debunking misinformation and disinformation calls for interdisciplinary collaboration of and advancements in multiple areas, including journalism, communication studies, law and public policy, psychology, and political science. Computing technology plays a crucial role in it. The last few years have witnessed a substantial growth in efforts at computational fact-checking, of which many are data-driven, AI-powered, and include human in the loop. These efforts tackle various fronts, such as the detection of fabricated news, rumors, and spam on social media, automation in fact-checking, flagging clickbait articles, and discovering fake accounts and malicious social media bots, but are far from the maturity that is required to reach commercial application.
