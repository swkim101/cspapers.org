We are excited to oer CyberSafety 2019, the FourthWorkshop on Computational Methods in Online Misbehavior, aliated witheWeb Conference 2019. is workshop oers a forum for researchers in academia, industry and government to share novel research on topics broadly related to the urgent theme of cybersafety, devoted to making the Web safer for its users. is is an area of exploding interest as abuse vectors such as social bots, online misinformation and propaganda, user deception and scams, harassment, hate speech, cyberthreats, cyberbullying and more have proliferated in recent years. A particular aim of the workshop is to encourage interdisciplinary research that brings together computer scientists and researchers from other disciplines, and provides a forum for these researchers to share their ideas. is year, we received 23 paper submissions, all of which were reviewed by the Technical Program Commiee (TPC). Based on reviews, the TPC Co-Chairs selected 8 papers for full presentation, and 6 additional papers for short presentation at the workshop, spanning topics that include spam and bot detection, misinformation, harassment, cyberbullying and more. In addition, the workshop will include several keynote talks from industrial and academic speakers on modern challenges and solutions in computational misbehavior. A detailed program is available at hps://cybersafety2019.github.io/ for more details. is iteration of the workshop succeeds three prior ones, co-located with • WWW 2018 hps://cybersafety2018.github.io/ • WWW 2017 hps://cybersafety2017.github.io/ • CIKM 2016 hps://cybersafety2016.github.io/
