Many current applications use recommender systems to predict user preferences, aiming at improving user experience and increasing the amount of sales and the usage time that users spent on the application. However, it is not an easy task to recommend items to new users accurately because of the user cold-start problem, which means that recommendation performance will degrade on users with little interaction, particularly for latent users who have never used the service before. In this work, we combine an online shopping domain with information from an ad platform, and then apply deep learning to build a cross-domain recommender system based on shared users of these two domains, to alleviate the user cold-start problem. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our deep cross-domain recommender system on handling user cold-start problem. By our framework, it is possible to recommend products to users of other domain through ad distribution in a more accurate level, and to increase sales amount of online shopping.
