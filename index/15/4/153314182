Emotion Classification (EC) aims at assigning an emotion label to a textual document with two inputs â€“ a set of emotion labels (e.g. anger, joy, sadness) and a document collection. The best performing approaches for EC are dictionary-based and suffer from two main limitations: (i) the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) keywords problem and (ii) they cannot be used across heterogeneous domains. In this work, we propose a way to overcome these limitations with a supervised approach based on TF-IDF indexing and Multinomial Linear Regression with Elastic-Net regularization to extract an emotion lexicon and classify short documents from diversified domains. We compare the proposed approach to state-of-the-art methods for document representation and classification by running an extensive experimental study on two shared and heterogeneous data sets.
