The explosive growth of fake news and its erosion to democracy, journalism and economy has increased the demand for fake news detection. To achieve efficient and explainable fake news detection, an interdisciplinary approach is required, relying on scientific contributions from various disciplines, e.g., social sciences, engineering, among others. Here, we illustrate how such multidisciplinary contributions can help detect fake news by improving feature engineering, or by providing well-justified machine learning models. We demonstrate how news content, news propagation patterns, and usersâ€™ engagements with news can help detect fake news.
