Recent years have witnessed explosive growth of online social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, discussion forums and message boards, chat-rooms, and interlinked blogs. While social networks greatly facilitate information exchange and dissemination, they can also be vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation. Most online activity is organic information dissemination, i.e., people innocently or unwittingly sharing information they find interesting with their followers, friends and social contacts. However, a significant portion of online activity is composed of deliberate attempts to manipulate how many people will see the information and how it will spread. Such campaigns seek to manipulate public opinion, disseminate rumors and misinformation. Insidious special interest campaigns try to mimic the appearance of genuine grassroots campaigns with broad support in a process sometimes called “astroturfing” (Ratkiewicz et al. 2011).
