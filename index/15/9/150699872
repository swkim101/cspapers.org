It is our pleasure to welcome you to the second edition of the Politics, Elections and Data workshop (PLEAD at CIKM 2013). The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers working at the intersection of social network analysis, computational social science and political science, to share and discuss their ideas in a common forum; and to inspire further developments in this growing, fascinating field of computational political science. 
 
The call for papers attracted submissions from researchers in different areas and from different countries, which underscores the wide appeal of computational political science. The program committee accepted 3 papers addressing the relationship between tweets and votes in 2009 Federal Election in Germany, political polarization online in the context of the French and US presidential elections and finally, early efforts for multi-cycle forecasting of congressional elections with social media. 
 
In addition, the program includes three keynotes from speakers with experience in modern campaigning, academic political science and media issues: Rayid Ghani (former Chief Scientist at Obama for America 2012), Justin Grimmer (Assistant Professor, Political Science, Stanford University) and Tarun Wadhwa (writer, researcher, entrepreneur, Forbes contributor).
