This position paper argues that IoT tool-kit resources can enable children to be experts of their own experience and create new kinds of outdoor play. We advocate for physical-digital designs and present various ways that children may be enabled to create digital interactions in play. In turn, we suggest that in-the-moment adaptions and direct-control can support social negotiation and emerging opportunities in open-ended play. Finally, we suggest that future studies should investigate the role of shared ownership and community resources in enabling sustained engagement with such tool-kit resources.
