Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) captureindividuals whereabouts for a large portion of the population. To utilize this data for user (location)-similarity based tasks, one must map the raw data into a low-dimensional uniformfeature space. However, due to the nature of LBSNs, manyusers have sparse and incomplete check-ins. In this work, we propose to overcome this issue by leveraging the networkof friends, when learning the new feature space. We firstanalyze the impact of friends on individuals's mobility, andshow that individuals trajectories are correlated with thoseof their friends and friends of friends (2-hop friends) inan online setting. Based on our observation, we propose amixed-membership model that infers global mobility patternsfrom users' check-ins and their network of friends, withoutimpairing the model's complexity. Our proposed model infersglobal patterns and learns new representations for both usersand locations simultaneously. We evaluate the inferred patternsand compare the quality of the new user representation againstbaseline methods on a social link prediction problem.
