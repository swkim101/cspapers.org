We introduce the first visual privacy dataset originating from people who are blind in order to better understand their privacy disclosures and to encourage the development of algorithms that can assist in preventing their unintended disclosures. It includes 8,862 regions showing private content across 5,537 images taken by blind people. Of these, 1,403 are paired with questions and 62\% of those directly ask about the private content. Experiments demonstrate the utility of this data for predicting whether an image shows private information and whether a question asks about the private content in an image. The dataset is publicly-shared at http://vizwiz.org/data/.
