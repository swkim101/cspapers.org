This paper presents a normalization mechanism called Instance-Level Meta Normalization (ILM~Norm) to address a learning-to-normalize problem. ILM~Norm learns to predict the normalization parameters via both the feature feed-forward and the gradient back-propagation paths. ILM~Norm provides a meta normalization mechanism and has several good properties. It can be easily plugged into existing instance-level normalization schemes such as Instance Normalization, Layer Normalization, or Group Normalization. ILM~Norm normalizes each instance individually and therefore maintains high performance even when small mini-batch is used. The experimental results show that ILM~Norm well adapts to different network architectures and tasks, and it consistently improves the performance of the original models.
