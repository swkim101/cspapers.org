Demand response has great significance to the optimal adjustment of the electricity load curve, and also reduces difference between grid peak and valley load. But the promotion and implementation of demand response in China faces many aspects of problems such as electricity price control, power grid electricity sales profit mechanism and so on. Based on interpreting the classic electricity demand response theory, we consider the actual situation of China's electric power system and take a balance consideration of the interests of the government, power generation, power grid companies and electricity users, to give a new interpretation of the concept of demand response, which enriches technology means and economic means of demand response. Besides the leading role and main roles of implementation, we introduce the role of the initiator, and put forward the implementation of demand response project design and automated implementation system.
