Suspension spring is used in the suspension system of light vehicle and medium buses widely, and its design quality related to stability and security of the vehicle. This paper take the suspension coil spring of a light vehicle as the research object, its multi-objective optimization model is established. The volume of spring and one frequency free vibration frequency are taken as optimization objective, the strength, stiffness, stability, fatigue strength and the winding ratio of the spring are taken as constraints, and use NSGA-II algorithm, obtained Pareto optimal solution set of the optimization problem. The coil spring model and optimization method used in this paper is also suitable for optimization design of other spring.
