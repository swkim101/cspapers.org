Limited by the matrix operation ability of normal control CPU (e.g. MCU, PLC and so on), the realization of fuzzy control always via the way of “calculate offline and inquire online”. Applications and practices have proved that such a realization method brings system steady-sate error, and limited the application range of fuzzy control. Based on the study of FC theory and the analysis of Mamdani fuzzy reasoning from geometrical meaning, a real-time fuzzy controller is designed and used in a Linear Motor XY Plaform control system based on Motion control card. The results show that the Real-time FC can avoid the steady-state error effectively and improve the controllability further.
