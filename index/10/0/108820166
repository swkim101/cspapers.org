With the aim at resolving the failure problems of Web-Services-Based electronic information systems, which are caused by web services' failure, we propose a QoS model and evaluation methods of web services collaborated with LAN. On that basis, we design a composite adaptive strategy. This strategy uses the reliability of the web services to assist the selection, and uses the web services backup set to achieve a quick fix. The analysis of feasibility shows that this strategy can obviously reduce the failure ratio and the average recovery time of the composite services.
