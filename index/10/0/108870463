The purpose of this paper is to determine the dynamic equations for a hybrid robot structure which consists of a mobile robot named PatrolBot and a 2TR robot serial structure. The motion equations will be determined on the basis of the new concepts in advanced mechanics, such as Matrix Exponentials Algorithm and Variation Principles in Analytical Mechanics, concerning the kinetic and acceleration energy part of important scientific researches deployed by the main author.
