Based on Bandelet transform and Multi-fractal, the metal fracture surface image denoising is described in the paper. Using multi-fractal analysis, eight multi-fractal spectrum values which are used as shape characteristic parameter of metal fracture surface are extracted. Experimental results showed that different metal fracture surfaces have different shape characteristics and the same kind of metal fracture surfaces have similar shape characteristics. So the shape characteristic parameter of metal fracture surface can be used to study the fracture surface recognition and as the sample of failure analysis.
