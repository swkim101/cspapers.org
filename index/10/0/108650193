The grip operation requires grippers as end effectors, behaving analogous to the human grasping organ, irrespectively if it is performed in robotic systems or in arm prostheses. Improving grippers design involves a biomechanical analysis of the human prehensile organ. The authors evaluated the complexity of both industrial and medical grippers and proposed a common design method, based on the mechatronic philosophy. The aimed upshot might be a better device, with improved functionality, a cost cutback and a more efficient design endeavour.
