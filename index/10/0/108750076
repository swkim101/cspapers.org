Study on the temperature controlling optimization problem of a novel microchip level PCR instrument, a compound control scheme based on Smith predictive and adaptive Fuzzy-PID is presented. Because the temperature control system of microchip level PCR instrument is a time-varying, non-linear and pure time delay complex system, to achieve the different temperature zones rapid switching and the temperature precision controlling is easy to be affected by time delay factor, it may encounter problems such as large overshoot, and even poor stability in the control of system with time delay. In this system, Smith predictable compensation control temperature algorithm should be adopted to decrease the overshooting and oscillating, adaptive Fuzzy-PID control temperature algorithm should be adopted to solve the problem of low precision and poor capability because of the fuzzy rules roughness. The simulation results show that the Smith predictive adaptive Fuzzy-PID temperature control algorithm has the fast response, high precision temperature controlling and strong robust properties, and it can provide a reference for the intelligent temperature control system design of microchip level PCR instrument.
