Abstract: This chapter begins by introducing wireless sensor network (WSN) technology and its current development. It then extensively reviews the applications of WSNs in the areas of environment monitoring, precision agriculture, precision livestock farming, greenhouse management, and food traceability systems. The chapter also discusses the obstacles and challenges faced in the development and deployment of WSNs in agriculture and food production. Finally, the future trends in application of WSN technology in agriculture and food production are presented.
