The kinematic and dynamic analysis of an spatial multi-loop mechanism especially parallel mechanism is significant but always complex. Based on the topological structure of mechanisms, this paper proposes the concept of coupling degree of mechanism systematically, and applies it to the criterion of basic kinematic chains(BKCs) and other problems. The relation between topology, kinematics and dynamics of parallel mechanisms is established, and then it is achieved to quantitatively describe the analysis complexity of a parallel mechanism and to obtain its simplest solving path, according to its topological structure. The preliminary method for unified modeling of the topology, kinematics and dynamics of parallel mechanisms is proposed, using BKC as the basic analysis unit. Some suggestions for optimization and selective preference of parallel mechanisms are also presented.Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME
