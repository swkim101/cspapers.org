Dynamic precision measurement of transmission error involves many subjects such as optical, mechanical and electrical and computer at the forefront of technology has very important significance in the production. In order to achieve the accurate testing of motion error automobile gear, convenient and quick to obtain the gear tooth form error parameters, this paper research and design of the automobile gear error motion detection based on virtual instrument technology system, can accurately test automation, including visual inspection process, real-time detection information, read the data measured parameters, the analysis of characteristic curve, and other functions.
