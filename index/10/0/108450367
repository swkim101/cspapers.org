The novel second-generation embedded planetary-screw extruder prototype was successfully developed in the paper which had eight small planetary-screws and had the excellent degassing function. The numerical simulation of the three-dimensional flow and mixing in the metering zone was carried out for different screw configurations to determine the effect of the number of the small planetary-screws using CFD finite volume method technology. We improved the screw combination of the second-generation prototype according to the simulation results as well as the experimental investigations on first-generation embedded planetary-screw extruder we developed some years ago. The second-generation prototype can effectively improve the axial transport capacity and increase output of the extruder when compared with the first-generation prototype. The novel second-generation prototype can expand the scope of application and can improve the quality of processing material. The novel embedded planetary-screw extruders have a better application prospect.
