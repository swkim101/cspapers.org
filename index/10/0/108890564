With advances in science and technology, the interest to study the animals walking has developed the demand for building the legged robots. Physics-based simulation and control of quadruped locomotion is difficult because quadrupeds are unstable, under actuated, high-dimensional dynamical systems. We develop a simple control strategy that can be used to generate a large variety of gaits and styles in real-time, including walking in all directions (forwards, backwards, sideways, turning). The application named JQuadRobot is developed in Java and Java3D API. A Graphical User Interface and a simulator for a custom quadruped leg's robot and the main features of the interface are presented in this paper. This application is developed in Java and is essential in a development motion for legged robot. The friendly interface, allows any user to define and test movements for this robot. The cross-platform capability was the first reason to choose Java language for developing this application.
