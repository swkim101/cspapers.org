One of the major challenges in achieving long term robot autonomy is the need for a SLAM algorithm that can perform SLAM over the operational lifetime of the robot, preferably without human intervention or supervision. In this paper we present insights gained from a two week long persistent SLAM experiment, in which a Pioneer robot performed mock deliveries in a busy office environment. We used the biologically inspired visual SLAM system, RatSLAM, combined with a hybrid control architecture that selected between exploring the environment, performing deliveries, and recharging. The robot performed more than a thousand successful deliveries with only one failure (from which it recovered), travelled more than 40 km over 37 hours of active operation, and recharged autonomously 23 times. We discuss several issues arising from the success (and limitations) of this experiment and two subsequent avenues of work.
