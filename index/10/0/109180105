One of the main issues of a mobile robot is to move in tight areas, to avoid obstacles, finding its way to the next location. These capabilities mainly depend on the wheels design. An omni-directional drive mechanism is very attractive because it guarantees a very good mobility in such cases. This paper provides some information about the mechanical design of an omni-directional robot, as well as about its control. This report is the result of the cooperation between researchers from Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering Faculties, at “Gh. Asachi” Technical University of Iasi, Romania.
