Geographical Information System (GIS) always play an integral role in LBS systems. But it comes with high entry cost. The aim of this paper is to reveal the potential of Free and Open Source Software for GIS in LBS design and practice, with the acceptance and usage of open standards for LBS applications, which provides a possible solution to overcome the high GIS's cost issue. In this paper, the short review of FOSS and OSGIS are given first and then the possibility of LBS design with FOSS are analyzed. By contrasting FOSS with the proprietary software development cycle, and designing a LBS platform based on FOSS middle ware in a new way, this paper proves the possibility of OSGIS could reduce the cost and complexity of LBS design.
