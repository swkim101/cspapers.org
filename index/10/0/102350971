Learning with complete or partial supervision is power- ful but relies on ever-growing human annotation efforts. As a way to mitigate this serious problem, as well as to serve specific applications, unsupervised learning has emerged as an important field of research. In computer vision, unsu- pervised learning comes in various guises. We focus here on the unsupervised discovery and matching of object cate- gories among images in a collection, following the work of Cho et al. [12]. We show that the original approach can be reformulated and solved as a proper optimization problem. Experiments on several benchmarks establish the merit of our approach.
