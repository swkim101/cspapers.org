A new method for bearing fault diagnosis is proposed based on Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) and Cyclic Bispectrum (CB). The first procedure is signal de-noised using PPCA and the second procedure is the CB analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulation and experimental investigation of a rolling bearing with outer race fault.
