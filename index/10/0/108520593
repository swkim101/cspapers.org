In view of more and more complicate driving and parking problems in urban traffic, the parking guidance system are proposed based on a double signal double display intersection vehicle terminal. The system is based on the information interaction between intelligent terminal, vehicle terminal and vehicle of internet, and to introduce the space maze module and automobile internal information, by simulation maze module planning the different target route and its navigation through the intelligent terminal screen, at the same time instant maze module choice and determine the real-time path navigation through the on-board navigator screen, and to improve the accuracy of target navigation. The system will be the target route and real-time route through their channel respectively on the intelligent terminal and vehicle navigation cross presentation, realize the whole process of target parking navigation, or real-time navigation guidance section step by step according to the real-time parking lots, and in order to improve the parking navigation accuracy to provide an effective means of technology.
