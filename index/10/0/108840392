Energy consumption is an open issue in research field of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol is the most additional routing protocol in WSNs. In LEACH, Cluster Head (CH) is selected randomly, not considering any parameter such as node energy, distance, which causes shortening its lifetime while energy consumption is unbalanced in WSNs. In this paper, it proposes a new LEACH-based protocol, energy consumption balance LEACH protocol. Firstly, all nodes are grouped based on their locations, and a CH is elected in every group, which ensures CHs even distribution in the network area. And an important factor selecting CHs, node energy is considered, which further energy consumption in WSNs. The results of simulation show that ECB-LEACH can increase energy efficiency and prolong the network lifetime.
