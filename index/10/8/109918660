For application in large machine tools, the machined part quality, accuracy as well as machining speed depende greatly on the dynamics of the structure. In this paper, an active-excitation modal analysis (AEMA), using inertial force of the moving slider to excite the structural modes, is proposed. Modal parameters of the machine tool structure estimated by AEMA are experimentally validated. Since the artificial excitation produced by elaborate excitation equipment is replaced by the inertial force of the slider, the proposed method is much more practical and economical than traditional methods.
