Based on the shape of the image retrieval occupy an important position in the content-based image retrieval, and studied architecture, content-based image retrieval system, ie research-based image retrieval key technologies shape features for image noise in addition to the morphological processing; image segmentation; shape-based feature extraction and regional boundaries and description techniques and similarity measure techniques. The results show that the algorithm can effectively identify the characteristics of the image.
