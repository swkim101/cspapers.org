The degree of compaction is a measure of the main evaluation index of road machinery compaction quality, but also affects the working characteristics of vibratory roller. In order to make the vibratory compaction always be in the best working state, we must adjust the operating parameters of the roller based on the real-time compaction pressure degree of the compacted material,for the best compaction effect. The paper analyzes the vibration frequency, amplitude, speed and other main working parameters and the relationship between degree of compaction,discusses how to select the main parameters, and carries out the research of Road Machinery Intelligent compaction system.
