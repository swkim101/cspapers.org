Ports play a very important role in the economy of a nation, as well as other crucial infrastructures like railways, motorways and airports, because, if managed properly, can significantly increase the competitiveness of a particular area. For this reason it is important for Port Authorities, Education Centers and maritime and transportation private companies to invest in training and education for logistic operators in ports, because operators properly trained can improve in a significant way the performance of ports in terms of materials handling. Since the 1990s simulation plays a great role in training logistic operators like crane operators, truck drivers and so on, and nowadays this importance has been increased for different reasons like safety and opportunity ones. CBT (Computer Based Training), especially in the preliminary training phases, can be very useful because the real means can be preserved from having serious accidents involving people's health, infrastructures integrity and implying very huge costs (it is worth to highlight that a transtainer crane, for instance, costs about â‚  4 Million), but can also be used for more value added operations like cargo handlings instead of training operators at the very first levels of skills. In this paper will be presented some Virtual Reality (VR) simulation models devoted to train Straddle Carrier (SC), Quay Crane (QC) and Mobile Harbor Crane (MHC) operators in handling Containers, General Cargoes and Bulk Materials, moreover, at the end, a short overview on further developments regarding new frontiers of VR simulation will be discussed.
