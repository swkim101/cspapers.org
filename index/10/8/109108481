Starting in 1998 from developing and designing their own office Kropman, a major Dutch Building Services contractor, developed a new methodology for structuring and documenting integral design processes. Integral design is meant to integrate the different disciplines involved in the building design design, this in contrast to integrated design which focus merely on the borderlines between disciplines. To help the design team with the complexity of the design process a design methodology was introduced. This design methodology enables clarification, verification and reproduction of decisions made during designing. The project was called Duflexpronoivatie, Duurzame(Sustainable) flexibele(fexibel) proces(process) innovatie(innovation). A enabled verification and reproduction of decisions made during designing. Its conscious use by professionals results in iteration cycles within and between their own domains. The gradual emergence of a design language that helps structuring design tasks and solutions further stimulates the multidisciplinary exchange of ideas and concepts. This gradual emerged to a kind of design language that helped structuring design tasks and solutions further stimulates the multidisciplinary exchange of ideas and concepts. Morphological charts were used to write down the ideas and concepts. The design process improved by this approach, which was tested within the professional context. The project was awarded the status of IFD (Industrial Flexible Demontable)- demonstration project by the Dutch government. The design methodology was used within the professional context of the real project. Besides its value for the building design process itself, this methodology directly stimulated application of sustainable energy in the built environment by the use of the morphological overviews which generated all the thinkable possibilities.
