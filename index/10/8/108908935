Dieless drawing, as a flexible metal forming method, could form pipes with arbitrary variable section. In order to control the shape and dimensions accurately, based on the analysis of deformation mechanism of arbitrary variable section pipes via dieless drawing process, the calculation method of dieless drawing speed during pipe forming is proposed theoretically,Furthermore, mathematical model of dieless drawing speed control is established by using piecewise polynomial to approach continuous speed curve. The study provide the basis for the dieless drawing speed microcomputer control system. The results of experimental investigation showed that the mathematical model indicates variation of dieless drawing speed quite well, and it is available to schedule the speeds for arbitrary variable section pipes dieless drawing.
