Based on the model and feature of combination testing, a novel technique of fault analysis based on combination testing is proposed. The faults of software can be triggered by system parameters and their interaction. The result of combination testing is analyzed, and discovered the possible reasons, and then generates an additional test cased which involved from the test case causing the fault, and analysis and verify the result. This method can locate the faults in a relative small area, and can simplify the process of software debugging and testing.
