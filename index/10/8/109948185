The extraction methods of both the shape feature based on Fourier descriptors and the motion feature in time domain were introduced. These features were fused to get a hybrid feature which had higher distinguish ability. This combined representation was used for human action recognition. The experimental results show the proposed hybrid feature has efficient recognition performance in the Weizmann action database .
