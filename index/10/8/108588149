The detection of hydrophobicity is an important way to evaluate the performance of composite insulator, which is helpful to the safe operation of composite insulator. In this paper, the image processing technology and Back Propagation neural network is introduced to recognize the composite insulator hydrophobicity grade. First, hydrophobic image is preprocessed by histogram equalization and adaptive median filter, then the image was segmented by Ostu threshold method, and four features associated with hydrophobicity are extracted. Finally, the improved Back Propagation neural network is adopted to recognize composite insulator hydrophobicity grade. The experimental results show that the improved Back Propagation neural network can accurately recognize the composite insulator hydrophobicity
