Aiming at the bumps in distributed instrumentation which is applied to performance test and evaluation of fixed facilities in coal mine, this paper proposed a new idea of establishing a virtual instrument with intelligence and integration. Complex and numerous testing parameters were classified according to their common features, the hardware and software resources were shared fully. The hardware platform was developed based on USB interface, met the requirements of convenient movement in coal mine site. The design idea of modularization and design manner of LCOD component-oriented were adopted to develop the software, which made the instrument more universal, extensible and integrated. The performance evaluation and practical application shown that, this instrument can meet all the requirements of performance test and evaluation for fixed equipments in coal mine in terms of function, measurement accuracy, dynamic characteristics, etc.
