This paper introduce the working principle of accumulator charging valve. According to the static analysis of principle and structure of the valve, the model of accumulator charging valve was established by AMESim. which simulated the charging pressure and other charging characteristics. According to the result of the simulation, some technical advices for improving the performance of the full hydraulic system are provided. Thecomparison between simulation and experiment proved that the model of the valve was accurate and reliable. The performance of the charging valve meets the request of the full hydraulic braking system exactly.
