Postural synergies have in recent years been successfully used as a low-dimensional representation for the control of robotic hands and in particular for the synthesis of force-closed grasps. This work proposes to study caging grasps using synergies and reports on an initial analysis of postural synergies for such grasps. Caging grasps, which have originally only been analyzed for simple planar objects, have recently been shown to be useful for certain manipulation tasks and are now starting to be investigated also for complicated object geometries. In this workshop contribution, we investigate a synthetic data-set ofcaging grasps of four robotic hands on several every-day objects and report on an analysis of synergies for this data-set.
