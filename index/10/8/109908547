A typical Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) only performs the action of sensing the environment, the needs of smart interaction with the environment have led to the emergence of Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN). With the presence of actuators, WSAN is heterogeneous, which brings about new challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, the task assignment of actuators in overlapping area is studied. Firstly, a new utility function is defined, which is the standard to choose the proper action actuators in overlapping area. Then, based on the new utility function, a distributed solution called localized auction method to solve task assignment problem in overlapping area is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed auction method can assign tasks to the unique actuator and meet the action completion bound.
