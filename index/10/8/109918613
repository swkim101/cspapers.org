This paper presents a novel exoskeleton training system for hand rehabilitation with the surface electromyography signals (sEMG) feedback to meet the kinematics characteristics of finger joints. In this system, the sEMG is obtained by means of the surface electrodes loaded the forearm antagonistic muscle. The sEMG is amplified about 100 times again after it was preliminarily amplified about 200 times and filter,. Through threshold and the equivalent calculation, the control signal was input into the driving circuit of DC micro motor to control the hand Exoskeleton. The experimental results show that the processed sEMG can drive the hand exoskeleton for rehabilitation training, and the bending angular of joints agree well with bionics laws. The results possess guideline value for bionics motion control of hand rehabilitation with function damage.
