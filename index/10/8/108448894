In UHF band, the effects of carbon black component on the dielectric properties of rubber composites are studied through experiments. The results show that the content of the carbon black have great effects on the dielectric properties of the composite rubber. The higher content of the carbon black in the rubber composite, the larger the permittivity and dielectric loss tangent. At the same time, the operating frequencies also have great influence on the dielectric properties of the rubber composite. In the UHF band, the permittivity and the dielectric loss tangent of the rubber composites decrease with frequency increasing.
