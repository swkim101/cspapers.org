Coordinate axes have been used extensively in three-dimensional (3D) GIS processing to help visualize the location of points directly. Meanwhile, AxSceneControl is a visual control provided by ESRI® ArcGIS® Engine, which is suited to generating perspective scenes that allow user to navigate and interact with 3D feature and raster data. However, there is no direct solution given by ArcGIS Engine to set Coordinate axes in 3D scenes. In this paper, we proposed and implemented an approach to generate and customize coordinate axis in AxSceneControl. By this method, up to five coordinate axes, named as x axis, y axis, z axis, top axis and right axis, can be drawn based on the layer that is loaded to the AxSceneControl. Furthermore, users can modify the properties of coordinate axes such as changing the style of degree scale, determining which axis will be shown and resizing the degree density to achieve simple coordinate axis.
