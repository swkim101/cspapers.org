An improved genetic algorithm for route optimization in DGT is proposed in this paper. In which, method of initial population, cross and mutation are improved to make it more suitable for DGT. It uses a dynamic operator to realize the adaptive adjustment of the parameters. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm overcomes the shortcomings of local optimum and "premature convergence" and improves the search efficiency and adaptability. The proposed algorithm can effectively solve the path optimization problem in DGT in time.
