The paper presents some authorâ€™s experiments carried out within the frame of a research project and destined to endow mobile robot modules with small and simple sensors to support navigation. Range sensors, proximity sensors and acceleration sensors in MEMS technology were used and Fuzzy logic has proved to be an adequate tool for sensor data integration. A Fuzzy controller has been developed and tested on a mobile robot moving on rough terrain.
