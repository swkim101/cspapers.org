In this study, an adjustable damping shock absorber (ADSA) for semi-active suspension was developed. Based on the theory of hydraulics and elasticity, the ways of calculating the embranchment flow rate on the series-parallel complex pipe line (SPCPL) were deduced and employed, and the detailed mathematical model of the ADSA was established by using the equation for annular laminar deformation under a uniform load. The MATLAB software was used to simulate the detailed model, and the calculated results agree well with the test results, and the results obtained provide technical support to the design and performance prediction of the ADSA to a certain degree.
