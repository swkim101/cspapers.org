The Chinese government departments and enterprises increased emphasis on service outsourcing, especially on knowledge process outsourcing which has knowledge-intensive characteristics. Because the increasing demands for the knowledge services in the current market competition, the Scientific and Technical Information Institutes (as the knowledge service organizations), faced the huge market opportunities, but also faced the huge market challenges. In this paper, based on the service status of the institutes, we select some typical knowledge services modes such as media monitoring, industrial monitoring, and patent information service for SWOT model analysis. And we make the SO, WO, ST, WT strategy research. The SWOT model analysis can help the institutes establish proper understandings and assessments of their competitive strengths. Therefore they can make full use of their advantages, overcome the disadvantages, and develop varieties of knowledge service products suitable for the market demands. Through the efforts, the KPO services will become one of the main business directions for the institutes.
