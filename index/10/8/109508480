In this paper, To the energy efficiency of power adapter as the research target, we analyzed the demand for automated testing, establish safety regulations automated test system based on LabVIEW. We will use open, modular design and flexible hardware framework, increase the hardware configuration according to customer product testing requirements, and has a good price and versatility. The test process will be automated, the test results will be displayed in real time, and realize the test data storage, analysis and print. By establishing automates of the entire testing process, greatly saving time and reducing test engineers labor costs, and improve the testing laboratory automation and testing reliability.
