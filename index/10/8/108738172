Equipped with type AEM-RS electromagnetic current meter, the buoy provided effective technical platform for on-site rapid monitoring of the ocean current. Performance index and usage in the ocean current buoy of AEM-RS was introduced. Ultrasonic cleaning method in seawater was developed for preventing AEM-RS from biofouling. Ocean current data can serve for oceanographic research and marine resource exploitation.
