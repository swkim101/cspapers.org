We present an approach for the integrated design of materials, products, and design processes. The approach is based on the use of reusable interaction patterns to model design processes, and the consideration of design process decisions using the value of information metrics. The approach is presented using a multifunctional energetic structural materials (MESM) design example. The design objectives in the example include sufficient strength and energy release capabilities. The design is carried out by using simulation models at different scales that model different aspects of the system. Preliminary results from the application of the approach to the MESM design problem are discussed. In this paper, we show that the integrated design of materials and products can be carried out more efficiently by considering the design of design processes.Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME
