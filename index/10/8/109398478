This paper presents the implementation in the Matlab/Simulink environment of an application for measuring distances using a video camera. Some of the advantages of using image processing as a method of measurement and of the Matlab for designing de application. The principles that where use to obtain de distance calculated where presented. Also the steps of the application implementation in Simulink where described.
