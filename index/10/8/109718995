By analyzing the relations of the excess air ratio to heat loss due to exhaust gas, chemical incomplete combustion and combustibles in refuse, the traditional method for solving the optimal excess air ratio is improved. A correction factor is proposed for heat loss due to combustibles in refuse, making the solving method more accurate, which is of great importance for improving the combustion efficiency of the boiler.
