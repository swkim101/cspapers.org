This paper describes the generation of low frequency oscillations and suppression methods briefly. Observing a phenomenon of low frequency oscillation of Gansu Grid Power and analysis its actual situation. Therefore, we need establish simplified simulation model in MATLAB environment, then do the simulation with the dual power system simulation model which add to power system stabilizer. Simulation results show that: PSS can solve the problem of low frequency oscillations in a region of Gansu steel caused rapid and effective.
