Based on the importance of the robot for the elderly and the disabled, a quadruped walking robot using 3-RPS parallel mechanism as the basic leg mechanism is proposed. The structure of the basic leg is described, and the whole structure of the quadruped walking robot is formed. Then taking the workspace of the basic leg as the standard, the optimum size parameters of the upper platform and the lower platform of the based leg are achieved. Meanwhile the workspace of the basic leg is obtained by the anti-solution search method. Taking the basic leg as analysis object and applying the virtual organization method, the kinematic expression is got. All of these analyses lay a theoretical foundation for the further study on the quadruped walking robot with parallel leg mechanism.
