A lateral flight reduced-order controller for a flexible aircraft is presented. It is based on the reduced-order model of the flexible aircraft and the μ-analysis and synthesis toolbox. The first step deals with the order reduction of the full-model by using the balanced-truncation model reduction method. Then the reduced-order H controller is achieved by using the μ-analysis and synthesis theory and applied to the reduced-order model and full-order model of the flexible aircraft. Finally, numerical results are presented and discussed. The simulation results show the efficiency of the reduced-order controller based on the reduced-order model since the close-loop system of the full-order model meets a set of realistic specifications in the frequency and time domains.
