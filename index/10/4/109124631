In various kinds of natural disasters, earthquake is one of the most serious threats to the lifeline engineering systems. In the earthquake, except of the structure was destroyed, the function of the lifeline engineering systems was often subject to serious damages or totally loss, even caused fire or blood, or gave away poisonous gas and other series of major secondary disasters. To strengthen the function of the lifeline engineering and avoid or reduce the occurrence of secondary disasters, a demonstrated system of earthquake emergency auto-handling applied in water supply was built. The system was composed by the ED-1 type ground motion sensor module unit, the Panasonic FP-X C30R type PLC unit, The Kunlun Tongtai TPC7062K type unified touch screen unit and the multifunction water tower testing unit. The STA/LTA method and spectral intensity method were applied to deal with the distant earthquake and the near earthquake separately. Through theory and experiment analysis, the earthquake emergency auto-handling system could accurately measures the seismic records and performs the earthquake emergency auto-handling rapidly.
