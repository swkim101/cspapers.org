Speech synthesis is a hot research of artificial intelligence today, and urgent difficulty to overcome is how to make the machine more "emotional intelligence" for the human-computer interaction. With the STRAIGHT algorithm, this paper extracted the acoustic feature parameters of the speech signals and did statistical analysis, modified the characteristic parameters of the neutral sounds to synthesize emotional speeches, including happy, angry, frustration, then analyzed a frame of spectrum of synthetic emotional speeches through standard voices, voices added noise and voices de-nosing. The experimental results show that the method is feasible and the synthetic emotional speeches through voices de-nosing are better than voices added noise.
