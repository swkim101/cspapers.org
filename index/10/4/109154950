In order to improve the resolution and accuracy of the inversion, this paper proposed a new inversion method. By introducing constraint sparse spike inversion, the new method can fully take the advantages of high vertical resolution of logging data and the preferable transverse continuity of the seismic data to improve the resolution of the profiles and the quality of imaging and inversion in specific areas. Experimental results showed that this solution can deduce more precise and reasonable inversion result than other inversion solution. Constraint sparse spike inversion can generate reflection coefficients with broad frequency band and solve the marking problems preferably, thereby makes the impedance model obtained from the inversion even close to the actual situation underground.
