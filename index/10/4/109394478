In wayside fault diagnosis of train bearings, the phenomenon of Doppler distortion in the acoustic signal of moving acoustic source acquired with a microphone leads to the difficulty for signal analysis. In this paper, a new method based on Dopplerlet transform and re-sampling is proposed to eliminate the Doppler distortion of multiple acoustic sources which provide a reference for wayside fault diagnosis of train bearings. Firstly, search the parameters space to find the primary functionsDopplerlet atoms. According to the Morse acoustic theory, the instantaneous frequency of the Dopplerlet atom which we choose to remove Doppler distortion of the corresponding acoustic source can be acquired. Then, the re-sampling sequence can be established in time domain. Through the resample, the Doppler distortion can be removed. In the end of this paper, an experiment with practical acoustic signals is carried out, and the results verified the effectiveness of this method.
