A new design for settlement of take-off angle and steer mechanism for combustion piston type hopping robot is presented. The new hopping robot body is fabricated that can easily be loaded with new eras technology instruments to sense the environment and provide environmental information. The mechanisms are very simple which increase the mobility of hopping robot to overcome the challenges during traveling rough terrains. Hopping robot has an algorithm to get distance & obstacle height with help of sensors and settles the take-off angle to overcome desired distance and hop over obstacle efficiently and accurately. The designed structure provides protection to whole system, sensitive sensors and has the ability to absorb jerks & shocks which occurred during hopping and landing.
