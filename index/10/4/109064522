In this paper the dynamics equations for a mobile robot, named PatrolBot, will be developed, using new concepts in advanced mechanics, based on important scientific researches of the main author, concerning the kinetic energy. In keeping the fact that the mathematical models of the mobile platforms are different besides the other robots types, due to nonholonomic constraints, these dynamic control functions, will be computed, according to these restrictions for robot motion.
