The video images of human face tracking and recognition is a hot research field of biometric recognition and artificial intelligence in recent years. This paper presents an automatic face tracking and recognition system, which can track multiple faces real-timely and recognize the identity. Aiming at Adaboost face detection algorithm is easy to false detection, presents a fusion algorithm based on Adaboost face detection algorithm and Active Shape Model. The algorithm is not only detect face real-timely but also remove the non-face areas; A multi thread CamShift tracking algorithm is proposed for many faces interlaced and face number of changes in the scene . Meanwhile, the algorithm also can identify the faces which have been tracked in the video. The experiment results show that the system is capable of improving the accurate rate of faces detection and recognition in complex backgrounds, and furthermore it also can track the real-time faces effectively.
