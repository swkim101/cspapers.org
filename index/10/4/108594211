Embedded targets normally do not have much resources to aid developing and debugging the software. So model-driven development (MDD) is used for designing embedded software with a `first time right' approach. For such an approach, a good way of working (WoW) is required for embedded software development using MDD techniques. This paper discusses the preferred way of working for the development of embedded control software. Control software requires hard real-time support for the loop controllers. These controllers directly control the motor output. Soft and non real-time levels can be used for non loop control related software tasks. The paper also discusses model structure optimisation techniques, which prevent the complexity of resource scheduling for large robotic setups, These techniques allow the designer to keep his own preferred point of view, as the techniques try to optimise the model into efficient software from a execution point of view. This saves a huge amount of design effort, especially for distributed targets.
