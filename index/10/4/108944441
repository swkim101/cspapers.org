In this paper, we propose an open network recharge system for public transportation smart card user to complete recharge. The network recharge system is mainly to cater the urgent need of providing convenient smart card recharge services. The proposed system is consisted of smart card secure reader, network platform and operator system. In order to take advantages of these three components, this paper will pay attention to security scheme and data transmission protocols of the proposed system. The security scheme promises the safety of transactions and data transmission. And the data transmissions protocols help complete the interactions among these three components.
