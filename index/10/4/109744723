As design complexity continues to grow, engineering teams have become increasingly reliant on sophisticated electronic design automation (EDA) tools and technology. Unlike the past, much of this technology comes from commercial suppliers. Indeed, many electronics manufacturers are wholly dependent on commercial vendors. Are these suppliers capable of keeping pace with the market demands, especially as electronics manufacturers push deeper and deeper into the realm of submicron design? During the past 12 months, there has been much discussion on the long term health, and even the viability, of the EDA industry. Many electronics manufacturers believe that the EDA industry, in its current state, will be incapable of delivering all of the technologies and solutions needed during the next ten years. Is the industry in a position to meet the needs of the electronics industry? What is the proper model that will enable the EDA industry to return to profitability and health and, therefore, be capable of delivering what the market demands? How do EDA suppliers intend to address this perceived problem? What is their vision for the future of EDA technology? What is their view on the role that their consulting service organizations will play in the future? This panel, which consists of executives from across the industry, will address these and other issues. Specifically, panelists will discuss their vision of how the EDA industry must evolve during the next five years, as well as their views on the future direction of design technology. The format of the panel will consist of a full 1.5 hours of open discussion and debate.
