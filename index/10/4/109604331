Automated control can improve the canal system to scheduler run levels, improve water efficiency and reduce operating costs schedule. In order to improve the accuracy and reliability of the control, the paper combines fuzzy control theory and PID control technology, Can give full play to the intelligence technology characteristics of the fuzzy control and can effectively improve the limitations of the traditional PID control, realize real-time self-tuning of PID control parameters, This ensures stable operation of drainage systems, can greatly improve the overall control performance of the canal, canal system automatic control development provides new ideas and approaches. Finally respectively for three kinds of operation mode of the single systems simulation, analysis of the superiority of the fuzzy theory combined with PID control.
