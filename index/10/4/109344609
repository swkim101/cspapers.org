Large cooking fires, occurring in industrial oil cookers, present a severe hazard to food processing plants. There lots of reasons and usually the fire extinguishing system invalid turned to be getting more and more attention. The fire extinguishing system has many complex components, and very difficult to evaluate. In view of the existing fuzziness and randomness in reliability comprehensive evaluation for the suppression system, a two-stayed fuzzy assessment model for the evaluation of the petrochemical production unit is established by using the theory of fuzzy mathematics. Average fault ratios, mean time between failures, effectiveness, mean-time-to-repair, and maintenance cost rate, spatial variability and fault density are used as evaluation index system. It is found from the result of evaluation that the variability of the water mist suppression system is reliability step.
