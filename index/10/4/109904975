On the basis of analysis the plate quality detection method in accordance with machine vision, Innovative dot area coverage percentage measurement method for plate microscopic image based on color segmentation was proposed in this paper. Plate microscopic image was transformed from RGB to HSI model. Then the plate microscopic image was segmented according to the saturation and the hue information. It was proved by experiments that the dot area coverage percentage measurement method based on color segmentation was provided with high measurement precision and good plate applicability.
