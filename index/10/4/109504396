In the last period, the quality and productivity of arc welding operations increased more than ever, especially in the areas that require high technology, represented mainly by the aerospace and nuclear industry, which led naturally to automation and robotics welding operations. The paper proposes a fuzzy system for the establishing of the main control parameters (welding current and welding speed) function of two important input parameters (plate thickness and diameter of the non consumable tungsten electrode). In this way, one of the actual modeling techniques (fuzzy logic) can be extended in welding technologies as an alternative tool, being particularly attractive for automated and robotized welding processes.
