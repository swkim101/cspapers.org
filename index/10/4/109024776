In a monocular video scene, in order to improve the efficiency of object tracking and counting under occlusion conditions. The article presents a scheme to automatically track and count people in a surveillance system. First, a modified Gaussian mixture model was employed to determine pedestrian objects from a static scene. To identify foreground objects by positions and sizes of foreground regions which were obtained. Moreover, the performance to track objects was improved by using the modified overlap tracker, the modified overlap tracker was used to analyze the centroid distance between neighboring objects and help object tracking and people counting in occlusion states of merging and splitting. On the experiments of tracking and counting people in three video sequences, the results show that the proposed method can improve the averaged detection ratio about 10% as compared to the conventional work.
