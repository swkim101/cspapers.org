Based on agricultural machinery body posture detection parameters and wheels gesture detection parameters collected by gyro inertial measurement unit, an agricultural machinery operation posture rapid detection method is proposed in this paper. The test results calibrated by RBF neural network show that, the test results of the method are accurate and available, and the method is effective and available for real-time body and wheel status data to further understand the agricultural machinery.
