This paper deals with modeling and adaptive fuzzy control of winding hybrid-driven cable parallel manipulator (WHDCPM). The WHDCPM has the advantages of both the traditional cable-parallel manipulator (CPM) and hybrid-driven based cable-parallel manipulator (HDCPM) since the hybrid-driven planar five-bar mechanism in HDCPM is replaced by winding hybrid-driven five-bar manipulator in WHDCPM. The physical architecture of WHDCPM is determined, and kinematics and dynamics of the cable parallel manipulators have been studied based on Lagrange method. The numerical simulation is demonstrated as an example with adaptive fuzzy control theory, and the diagrams of trajectory tracking, cable tension, friction compensation and motor torque are shown, respectively. The results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the WHDCPM.
