The cluster technology is used more and more widely in fields of oil exploration, aerospace engineering, biological engineering, etc, the application requirements of different type nodes make cluster system harder and harder to manage in the cluster environment. In the paper, with the conception of cluster technology, applying xCAT+shell and Qt platform in Linux, the cluster deployment system has been designed and implemented to configure and distribute centrally different types of nodes in the cluster.
