This paper presents a practical framework to synthesize multi-sensor navigation information for localization of a rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (RUAV) and estimation of unknown ship positions when the RUAV approaches the landing deck. The estimation performance of the visual tracking sensor can also be improved through integrated navigation. Three different sensors (inertial navigation, Global Positioning System, and visual tracking sensor) are utilized complementarily to perform the navigation tasks for the purpose of an automatic landing. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is developed to fuse data from various navigation sensors to provide the reliable navigation information. The performance of the fusion algorithm has been evaluated using real ship motion data. Simulation results suggest that the proposed method can be used to construct a practical navigation system for a UAV-ship landing system.
