Recently, China has become the country who has the largest and fastest-growing wind power across the world. The large-scale of wind power ask for higher requirements in the fields of Wind Power Plant (WPP) Monitoring and Control. In order to achieve that, the integrated and remote control information system for multi-WPPs is proposed in this paper. To meet the need of technical regulation for connecting WPP to power grid and improve the efficiency of WPPâ€™s management, a framework for this integrated and remote control information system is designed, and some tentative ideas for implementing the integrated control are put forward.
