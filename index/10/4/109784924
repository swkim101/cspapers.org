In order to set up well-structured multitasking robot application programs careful planning is required. Robot programming languages (e.g. Karel, RAPID, Melfa, SimPro, etc.) vary from robot to robot constructor. General planning tools used in software development (e.g. UML, IDEF, etc.) require adequate professional skills and a special way of thinking such that robot programmers to apply and adapt them to the specificity of each robot programming language. Customized and intuitive planning tools of robot applications with regard to each particular programming language seem to be preferred by ordinary robot programmers and operators when facing with the development of complex robot tasks. This paper introduces such a tool in relation to the RAPIDTM programming language, specific to ABB robot models. Its effectiveness is revealed in a case study.
