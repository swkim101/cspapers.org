This paper studies the general model of Internet of Things reliability, investigated factors affecting the reliability Internet of Things, the reliability evaluation method proposed Internet of Things from network connectivity and networking information transfer material aspects, and for the general model make reliability simulation. Research results can be used to guide the planning Internet of Things, layout and construction stages of the reliability of the forecast; reference can be used to improve the overall reliability of the study; also provides guidance on the management of network reliability.
