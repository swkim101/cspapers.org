A thermogravimetric system was designed, in which a large amount of sample (about 10 g) can be examined. Test of the combustion characteristics of cooking oil tar in pipe was conducted. Wavelet transform was introduced to the thermogravimetric data smoothing and differentiation analysis according to the experiment results, and the orthogonal test method was used to find the optimize wavelet parameter. Wavelet transform results were compared to the traditional Moving average,Gaussian Smoothing and Vondrak smoothing methods and it was proved that the signal-to-noise ratio () of the measurement is increased significantly. The kinetic parameters calculated from the original TG curves and smoothed DTG curves have excellent agreement,and thus the wavelet transform smoothing algorithms can be used directly and accurately in kinetic analysis.
