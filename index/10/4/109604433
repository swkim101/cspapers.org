The network coverage condition of China Mobile Multimedia Broadcasting (CMMB) affects the signal quality of the CMMB terminal directly. The requirements of signal coverage are different in different regions, the co-channel interference and the interference caused by signal in adjacent areas must be considered in the planning of transmitting station. In the process of transmitting station construction, reasonable planning for network coverage is helpful to save costs and improves the quality of the network. In this paper, the planning principle of CMMB coverage network was analyzed firstly, and then an effective solution for network planning was presented according to the specific needs and the condition of network construction in Fuzhou province. On the basis of controlling construction cost, the solution achieves the required network coverage ratio.
