The paper describes the definition of a set of generalized coordinates and forces (kinematic control parameters) necessary to satisfy a specific job. Specifically, the generation of a three dimensional curve with torsion described by a Frenet reference system. The method employed to accomplish this task is using the Original ADAMS program alias MCADA. The analysis results indicate that the method can be successfully applied when designing motion simulators; however, there are accuracy restrictions for high precision six axis machining.
