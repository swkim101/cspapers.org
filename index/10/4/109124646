Abstract: In order to ensure food security in food-manufacturing operations, automatic process control is desired. With the operation of automatic process-control systems the deviation of the controlled variables from standards can be consistently monitored, adjusted, and minimized to improve the process operations on a regular basis. Proportionalintegral-derivative (PID) control has been widely used in the food industry. Model-based control has been developed to improve the performance of control systems in the food industry. This chapter overviews the concepts, methods, and systems of automatic process control for the food industry, and projects the future of automatic process control.
