Transient faults are the dominated kind of threats to operation safety in networked control systems (NCSs), and the runtime detection of them is difficult but a key point in fault tolerance design. In this paper, a novel transient fault detection approach is proposed based on multiple system models. System models are established to show how system works in teleological, functional, behavioral, and structural viewpoints, and operational constraints of the models are set up to capture the runtime violation in which the faults are indicated. A case is presented to investigate the using processes of the proposal and the results show that the transient faults are detected efficiently online.
