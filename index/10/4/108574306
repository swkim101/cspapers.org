In a country like France, electricity consumption d evoted to domestic lighting represents nearly a fifth of the total energy consumption of a building. The use of electric ligh ting is influenced by several factors such as the building’ s structural characteristics, the activities of its occupants, tlighting equipments, and the level of natural light. Designe rs do take into account, in their energy models, the influence of occupants on the building’s overall energy consumption. Howev er, these models still have some drawbacks regarding the comp rehension of real “occupants’ energy behaviors” which play an important role in the discrepancies between predicted and rea l energy consumptions. The behavioral factors behind occupan ts’ usage trends of energy are still not thoroughly explored. Therefore, it is assumed that a better comprehension of these beh aviors and consumption mechanisms could lead to the identifica tion of technical solutions and energy saving potentials, tresulting in a more robust building design. The present paper aims to provide an insight into domestic lighting usages. The main objective is to explore t he key factors (socio-demographic, economic, technical and behavio ral) responsible for the disparities in lighting consump tion between one household and another. For this purpose, an exp eriment is performed concurrently to the proposal of a lightin g usage model. A micro level investigation protocol is elab orated and used to conduct in-depth studies on the usage patte rns of electric lighting. The survey is conducted on a sam ple of 8 French households. The methodology for constructing the experimental protocol, its deployment, as well as t he results obtained and their analysis are presented in this p aper. The need for further qualitative and quantitative studi es to better understand the usage trends of electric lighting is discussed.
