ESEC/FSE 2003 is the joint meeting of the 9th European Software Engineering Conference (ESEC) and of the 11th ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE). This joint event takes place every two years in Europe, bringing together researchers and practitioners of software engineering to report on innovative research results and to exchange experiences related to both traditional and emerging areas in software development.This year in response to the call for papers, 168 papers, from 29 different countries, were submitted. The papers underwent a rigorous peer review process, with at least three members of the Program Committee reviewing each paper. During a two-day meeting held in Portland, Oregon, the Program Committee selected thirty-three full papers, as well as nine shorter papers to be presented as posters.The technical program is enriched by three invited talks that will provide deep insights along three research perspectives: inter-disciplinary research challenges, intra-disciplinary (i.e., software engineering) research problems and directions, and industrial exploitation of software engineering research results. Giuseppe Longo, from CNRS and the Departement d'Informatique Ecole Normale Suprieure in Paris, will talk about Information and Complexity in some natural phenomena, leading us through the intriguing and ambitious challenges of how to approach, as mathematicians and computer scientists, the inherently mutable and non-stationary nature of physical phenomena. Leon Osterweil, from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, recipient of this year ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award, starting from his own research experience in the area of process, will suggest the importance of using the challenge of grappling with hard technical problems as a basis for searching for deeper questions. Ari Jaaksi, from Nokia Mobile Phones, Helsinki, will present their experience in using a set of tools for executives to monitor the status of ongoing software projects.
