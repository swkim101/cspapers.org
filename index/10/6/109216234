Based on the molecular dynamics (MD) theory, in this article, we made a simulation study on titanium nanometric cutting process at different cutting depths, and analyzed the changes of the cutting depth to the effects on the work piece morphology, system potential energy, cutting force and work piece temperature in this titanium nanometric cutting process. The results show that with the increase of the cutting depth, system potential energy, cutting force and work piece temperature will increase correspondingly while the surface quality of machined work piece will decrease.
