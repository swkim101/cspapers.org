The relation between temperature rise of bit and drilling parameters in drilling lunar soil simulant is studied in this paper through experimentation. Since it is difficult to measure the temperature of bit in the drilling process, fiber Bragg grating temperature measuring system is developed. Then, drilling experiments were carried out in normal and-30Â°C low temperature lunar soil simulant. This research showed a clear correlation between temperature rise of bit, rotational speed and torque in drilling process under specific lunar soil conditions. And the relations in drilling the two lunar soil simulants have similar patterns.
