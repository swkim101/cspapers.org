To encourage teachers of secondary two science to link assessment and teaching strategies to promote learning through use of a web-based environment, two online assessment and diagnostic tools were trialed in five Hong Kong schools. The Diagnostic Tutorial Assessment System (DTAS) and the Intelligent Content Assessment Marking (ICAM) System were used in a collaborative project which was initiated by faculty of the Hong Kong Institute of Education. The project involved teachers, students, course designers, curriculum officers and a technology company. Two tools, integrated within an e-learning environment allowed teachers to diagnose student's learning difficulties and to focus on students' preparedness for learning. By identifying more explicitly the type of questions or topics that a student can or cannot solve, teachers could further determine whether a student was ready to learn and what format of instruction was most appropriate. The outcome of the project was a set of customised teaching and learning content materials based on the Hong Kong secondary two science curriculum. Both teachers and students could also access an elaborate online tool that provided accurate profiles of individual students learning progress. These profiles served as a basis for teachers to design remedial or enhancement work for students. The findings to date indicate that both teachers and students recognised the potential of such tools and were happy to explore further.
