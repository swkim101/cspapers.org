Base on improved particle swarm algorithm, this paper proposes a linear decreasing inertia weight particle swarm algorithm and error back propagation algorithm based on hybrid algorithm combining. The linear decreasing inertia weight particle swarm algorithm and momentum-adaptive learning rate BP algorithm interchangeably adjust the network weights, so that the two algorithms are complementary. It gives full play to the PSO's global optimization ability and the BP algorithm local search advantage, to overcome the slow convergence speed and easily falling into local weight problems. Simulation results show that this diagnostic method can be used for tolerance analog circuit fault diagnosis, with a high convergence rate and diagnostic accuracy.
