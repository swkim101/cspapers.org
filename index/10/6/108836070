This paper presents a theoretical analysis on a performance of an oscillating tail for water-running robots. Generally, tails are used to enhance the mobility and stability of a living creature. In this research, theoretical model is derived for an oscillating tail, and numerically solve the equations to determine the effect of the tail to the stability and lifting force. We expect the enhancement of the stability and lifting force by using the oscillating tail and results of the simulation is well-coincident with our hypothesis. The concept of oscillating tail can be extended to enhance pitching and yawing stabilities.
