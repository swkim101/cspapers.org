This paper is concerned with the analysis of human behavior in teleoperation system. A teleoperation experimental system is developed in this paper. The stability of the inverted pendulum is controled by joystick. The Laminar Phase and power spectrum is adopted to analyse human behavior characteristics. The experiment results show that human is adaptive to the disturbance in the teleoperation system.
