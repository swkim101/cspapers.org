Software projects are an important course in software engineering curricula. They provide students with an opportunity to gain valuable experiences in applying the theoretical materials learned at software engineering courses. However, many drawbacks in our current projects course work make these benefits difficult to realize. In this paper, we discuss these drawbacks and how they affect the effectiveness of this course. To address these difficulties, we advocate a model of enhancing the management approach to provide an effective administration for each project. Our experiments from the model have shown significant improvements in the quality of projects and the experiencing effects of students.
