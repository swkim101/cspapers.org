The aerodynamic characteristics of ordinary vehicle have been studied by lots of scholars, while few people pay enough attention to the aerodynamic characteristics in the bottom of the car. As the requirements of regulations for the performance of the car continues to increase, Analysis of Aerodynamic Characteristics of the car is much more necessary now. In this paper , by using CFD method and getting benefit from the established CFD software, we gave external velocity field and pressure field of the car. The data was analyzed and summarized and the computational results are obtained. In the final analysis for the flatness in the bottom of the car influence on aerodynamic characteristics.This paper has done some useful attempts, and it will provide specific reference significance to the numerical simulation on design of the car in the future.
