Welcome to the 2006 International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, the world's premier conference in electronic design technology! 
 
Our technical program this year is more exciting than ever, addressing several challenges posed by current and future design technologies including power, variability, reliability, yield, system design, and the impact of new devices and materials. 
 
We also offer several social events where you can meet colleagues and friends. Both professionals and researchers active in EDA, as well as practicing designers, will benefit from the knowledge provided in both regular paper sessions and embedded tutorials.
