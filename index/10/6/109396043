In this paper, a new robust trajectory tracking control scheme for wheeled mobile robots without velocity measurement is proposed. In the proposed controller, the velocity observer is used to estimate the velocity of wheeled mobile robot. The dynamics of wheeled mobile robot is considered to develop the controller. The proposed controller has the following features: i) The proposed controller has good robustness performance; ii) It is easy to improve tracking performance by setting only one design parameters.
