Storm surges have a hazardous influence on coastal regions, threatening infrastructures, ecosystems and human lives. A statistical study of storm surge magnitude makes it possible to determine the severity, and therefore better forecast and prevent losses. However, the assessment and grading remain controversial in academia. A storm surge grading system was designed based on data in Chinas coastal provinces of Zhejing, Fujian, Guangdong over the period 2003-2010 in this paper. Related variables include social factors, such as affected farmland, direct economic losses; and natural factors, like wind speed, maximum rainfall. Cluster analysis, Entropy method and factor analysis are applied to determine the detail and specific grading. This grading gave a better insight into the disaster and better forecast and control.
