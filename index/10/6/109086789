In this paper, an equivalent mechanism is obtained by means of optimal design to overcome the drawbacks of an existing brake pedal operating mechanism in a harvester. After establishing the mathematical model, we obtain the optimal design model, including the objective and constraint functions. Consequently the local optimal solutions are worked out, resulting in a solution for the applied engineering problem.
