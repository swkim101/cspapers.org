This paper presents the design of control system of direct metal deposition forming software. The system which is designed by VC++ software employs the ideas of object-oriented and data stream. The metal parts are abstracted into objects and classes to realize the reusability and scalability. The software control system has realized from the machine initialization, digital control code generation, forming process control, process parameter management module. The control system can improve the forming quality and achieve the best forming process control, saving the metal parts of the development time and cost of development.
