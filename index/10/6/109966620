Recently, the SUAV has become the research focus at home and abroad. There is a new aircraft type: double ducted tilting Subminiature UAV system, this paper put forward a new attitude navigation system:AHRS-based low-cost GPS carrier phase orientation Navigation System. AHRS aids GPS fastly fix the attitude.This article proposed application the constraint solving the ambiguity basic model, which is based on the double differential equations of the carrier phase measurement. Then we use baseline length and the inaccurate attitude angle constraint to solver integer ambiguity. By the static experimental results show that this method is fast, effective, the AHRS-GPS system can provide high accuracy navigation for SUAV.
