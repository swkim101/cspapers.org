Subway has already become an important tool of public transportation. Subway security operation is to achieve a serious guarantee of safety and convenience. In this article, subway safety operation evaluation index system is constructed. Based on hierarchy process, triangular fuzzy number was used to describe the evaluation value obtained by experts. In order to be more objective and more precise, the correlation coefficient and standard deviation integrated approach will be used to calculate the weights of criteria in the fuzzy hierarchy process.
