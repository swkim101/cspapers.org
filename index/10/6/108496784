The loader's steer-by-wire system combines the automatic control system and hydraulic system. The system cancels the mechanical or hydraulic connection between the steering wheel and the front wheels, which existed in the original steering system, optimizing the adaptation of the loaders steering systems road feeling to its working conditions, convenient for the integration with other systems, and harmonization of control. This paper puts forward a new measurement of a steer-by-wire system steering angel. It aims at more accurate corner detection, will design to optimize loader's steer-by-wire hydraulic system signal detection, and better meet the actual needs.
