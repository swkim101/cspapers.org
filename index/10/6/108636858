Blade is one of the important components in aero-engine, turbine, and wind generators. The quality of the blades has big influence on the performance of the machine. So high profile accuracy and low surface roughness were put forward. Ruled blade is just one of the blades of aero-engine, which has simple profile and little distort. This blade was grinded by two sides together in the paper. Therefore, in this thesis, the main objects are as fallow: firstly, according to the characteristics of the abrasive belt grinding, analysis the selection of grinding distance for the blade. Secondly, established the model of contact wheel compare grinding system, derived the range of wrap angle of contact wheel, and then two region were make out, one is the region can be directly grinding, and another region which may lead to wheel interference. At last the grinding path of the center of the contact wheel was obtained by calculated the blade model.
