The paper took dish-style separators spindle system as research object, established a finite element dynamic model for spindle system based on rotor dynamic theory, and then obtained vibration characteristic of spindle system considering gyroscopic effect influenced on critical velocity. The result shows that gyroscopic effect decreases the first and second order eddy frequency of spindle system by 36.2%; spindle rotating velocity meets the design requirements for a flexible shaft. The research result indicates that the method in this paper is available, and has a guide for deeper research on vibration characteristic of high speed rotation system, will reduce research expenditure and test time.
