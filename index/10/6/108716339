Design capability of process chamber in IC equipment is of great significance for enhancing the core competitiveness of IC industry. The traditional design methodologies adopted by most enterprises are based on experience and the efficiency is not high. As a new intelligent design methodology, Knowledge-based Engineering (KBE) can realize automation of repeat design and complete the product design quickly to meet market demands. In this paper, the background of KBE is discussed systematically and the evolution of different phases of the technology is described. The definitions of KBE given by the relevant institutions from different perspectives are enumerated and the structure framework is shown. KBE is also compared with other design methodologies commonly used. The main technologies of KBE are introduced in detail, and the domestic and overseas application status of KBE is analyzed. In addition, the roles of this methodology in product design are summed up and the future trends are predicted. At the same time, the design demands and tasks of process chamber are confirmed according to the practice of IC equipment. Moreover, current prevalent problems in the field are pointed out, and the basic ideas and the key steps applying KBE to the rapid design of process chamber are put forward.
