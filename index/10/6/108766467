This paper describes that at high frequencies the reflection signal from an underwater target can be seen as the sum of an individual echo from certain equivalent scattering centers as such an underwater target can be characterized by highlights distributed within a spatial target structure. By analyzing the highlight structure of an underwater target echo, the synthesized echo signal can be simulated. In this paper, a submarine model is selected to analyze the echo characteristic of submarine based on highlight model. The simulation experiment results show that the model is a very reasonable two-dimensional acoustic representation of a submarine. The results also indicate that the highlight model can be applied to acoustic countermeasure system, which has an important application value.
