Automobile exhaust governance is increasingly urgent with the increasingly development of economy and people's emphasis on environmental quality. This paper adopts the working principle of the low temperature plasma purification of automotive exhaust analysis to illustrate the method to remove the contaminants, and study the phenomenon of measured air going to a plasma generator located in the downstream of the combustor in plasma fuel converter. The high voltage is applied to airflow, forming high temperature plasma. High temperature plasma spray the air flow into the burner and high light-off combustible components of fuel air mixture to illustrate the method of purifying automobile exhaust. Last but not least, this paper studies the new technology how the high-tech road surface material effective purify automobile exhaust, and popularization and application. This paper can solve the negative impact of automobile exhaust on atmospheric in a large extent.
