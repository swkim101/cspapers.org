if the power system is disturbed by a large disturbance, its damping characteristics would change due to the nonlinear factor during the dynamic process and the redistribution of power flow after the accident operation mode. In this paper, the impact of operation mode after an accident and the nonlinear factor for large disturbance dynamic stability of grid are studied respectively. And then, by simulation comparison, it concludes that if nonlinear parts of automatic regulating devices have little impact on the grid damping characteristics after the grid suffers large disturbance, large disturbance dynamic stability of grid is mainly determined by the grid damping characteristics under operation mode after an accident. Finally, conclusions are verified through a practical operation mode of North China Power Grid according to simulation.
