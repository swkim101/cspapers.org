In this paper, we summarize our recent work in analyz- 
ing and predicting behaviors in sports using spatiotemporal 
data. We specifically focus on two recent works: 
 
1) Predicting the location of shot in tennis using Hawk-Eye tennis data, and 
 
2) Clustering spatiotemporal plays in soccer to discover the methods in which they get a shot on goal from a professional league.
