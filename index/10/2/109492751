The power plant boiler is one of the most important facilities in thermal power plants. The thermal efficiency of power plant boilers is the index. This paper discusses the relationship between the boiler thermal efficiency and the coefficient of excess air via two methods, one is called the simplified calculating formula and the other is the calculating formula according to the The People's Republic of China national standard power plant boiler performance test procedures. According to the proposed methods, by solving the same optimal problem, optimum excess air coefficients are obtained. Then a comparative analysis is given. Moreover, an improved way for saving calculation time to get the coefficients of the mixed coal in the so called simplified calculating formula is developed.
