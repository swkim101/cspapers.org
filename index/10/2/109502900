This paper, presents first, using Polyaâ€™s theorem of enumeration of distinct structures, the number of closed plane five-link kinematics chains. These chains differ among them by the number and the position of revolute and prismatic joints. From these chains, by interchanging the link connected to the frame, may be obtained different mechanisms with 2 degrees of freedom. Forward, it is presented the design with CATIA software of some mechanisms with five elements, with applicability in robotics. These may represent the mechanical structure of some manipulators for graving, inscription and other work. Also, they may be used in the design of a robot arm, with more degrees of freedom such as SCARA robots.
