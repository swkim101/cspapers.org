Our work aims at understanding the design rationale for product line architecture by focusing on the design of common data access modules for complex simulation software products. This paper presents empirical evidence of organisational and business domain aspects that influence the development of product line architecture. We suggest that the assessment of use-situation and history of organisational structure should be considered when creating product line architectures, especially for products that are tailored and used interactively.
