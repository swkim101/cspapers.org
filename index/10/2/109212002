Although piezoelectric acceleration sensors enclosure can shield electromagnetic pulse commendably, the electromagnetic pulse can be coupled into the sensor and interfere signal processing circuit in the high-frequency electromagnetic environment, which can lead to the failure of acceleration sensor. So, the reasonable design and optimization are necessary for the improvement of signal processing circuit anti-electromagnetic interference ability under the principle of EMC. Some methods were proposed in this paper, such as adding a filter circuit, increasing the spacing between the wires and increasing the number of ground wires, etc. Finite integration technique (FIT) is used in this paper for these simulations in CST software. Simulating results show that the transfer impedances of signal processing circuit under the high-frequency electromagnetic interference were greatly reduced after optimization and power integrity was greatly improved. It achieves the goal of enhancing electromagnetic interference resistance of the signal processing circuit, thereby reduces the influence of the electromagnetic pulse on the piezoelectric acceleration sensor greatly.
