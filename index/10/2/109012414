Enormous river basin information has been collected by for high resolution of the physically-based distributed hydrological model, while the scales of computational domain are often restricted by the intensive calculation. The parallel algorithms of physically-based regional hydrologic soil model (P-RHSM) in OpenGeoSys are brought forward in this paper. The object-oriented C++ programming in the model approaches the two objectives: one is data structure organizations including the spatial discretization of the computation domain with nodes density arrangement and solutions communication of temporal variables, the other is computational efficiency by parallel computing. The Message passing interface (MPI) communication is implemented in P-RHSM which is carried out on Linux supported symmetric multiprocessing computers. P-RHSM is applied to Heihe basin in the northwest China. The high-resolution results of temporal soil moisture content distribution, front movement and parallel performance is presented.
