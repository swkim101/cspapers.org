The monitor system of liquid interface is analyzed as a time-variant, non-linear and multi-disturbance complex system to keep track of RFID tags pose in the environment. In this work, with the input signal of dispersed pressure information, which is obtained by RFID tags from different density liquid, a decision method for the pressure of liquid interface is proposed base on fuzzy control. The simulation results are be tested by using MATLAB software. The simulation results can be shown from figure that output quantity depends on the input quantity of liquid pressure differential. It can be concluded that the fuzzy control theory is used to determine the liquid level pressure changes.
