In software development practice, testing often accounts for as much as 50% of the total development effort. It is therefore imperative to reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness of software testing by automating the testing process. In the past decades, a substantial amount of research effort has been invested into the development and study of automatic test case generation, automatic test oracles, and other (semi-)automated testing techniques. As the theory and practice of software testing becomes more mature, a deeper and more meaningful automation of the testing process is possible. Therefore, the automation of various testing activities is now becoming an integral part of industrial practice. 
 
The 5th Workshop on Automation of Software Test (AST 2010) is a two-day meeting and is the successor of the first four AST workshops held at the International Conference on Software Engineering from 2006 to 2009. It gives researchers and practitioners a forum for exchanging ideas and experiences, developing an understanding of the fundamental challenges, articulating a vision for the future, and finding promising solutions to pressing problems. The workshop also provides a platform for researchers and developers of testing tools to work together in an attempt to identify the problems in the theory and practice of software test automation and to lay the foundation for future development.
