Inverse kinematics of manipulator comprises the computation required to find the joint angles for a given Cartesian position and orientation of the end effector. There is no unique solution for the inverse kinematics thus necessitating application of appropriate predictive models from the soft computing domain. Artificial neural network and adaptive neural fuzzy inference system techniques can be gainfully used to yield the desired results. This paper proposes structured artificial neural network (ANN) model and adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to find the inverse kinematics solution of robot manipulator. The ANN model used is a multi-layered perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN). Wherein, gradient descent type of learning rules is applied. An attempt has been made to find the best ANN configuration for the problem. It is found that ANFIS gives better result and minimum error as compared to ANN.
