To damp the vertical oscillations of the descent submersible caused by dusting the control system utilizing a shock-absorbing hoist located on the submersible was developed. The robust proportional-plus-integral action controller was included in the control loop to ensure the acceptable dynamic properties of the system by the interval variations of the module mass and the rope length. The parametric synthesis of the controller was carried out on the basis of the robust expansion of the coefficient method of the quality rating estimation. The system operability was confirmed by the results of the digital simulation.
