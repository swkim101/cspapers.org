The slip-judgment method of threshold value was made for all-wheel independent electric drive vehicle through the analysis of the relationship of steering kinematics, which based on detecting speed and current of wheel-motor. The speed coordinated control of motor was used as synchronous control method. Models of vehicle dynamics and synchronous control were respectively constructed in Adams and Matlab/Simulink, which composed the model of mechanical-electric collaborative simulation. The synchronous control process of vehicle that running on bisectional road was analyzed, the result shows that synchronous control based on power control strategy reduces slip-wheel motors power consumption and increases other motors output power and torque through reducing the motor speed to average speed of normal wheel-motor. Improves the traction performance and stability of vehicle, also reduces the wheel wear and drivers control difficulty. The method has advantages of low cost, wide applicability, good controllability, high reliability etc., provide the reference of synchronization technology for independent electric drive military vehicle.
