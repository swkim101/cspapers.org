In this paper, an observer-based friction compensation (OBFC) suited for teleoperation is analyzed. Because the observer is based on a model of the dynamics of the system rather than a model of the friction, it is well suited when friction presents time varying properties. This is precisely the case in teleoperated minimally invasive surgery. In this paper, a stability analysis of this observer w.r.t. errors in the model parameters is performed. The impact of indirect speed measurement is also investigated and finally, simulations are performed to illustrate the above mentioned issues.
