In order to analyze and cluster the scale and categories among the Bohai ports group accurately and objectively, ports are expected to be divided among categories of regional port cluster. Considering ports scale can be affected by many different factors, and those factors have different organizations and units, so principal component analysis(PCA) was used to standardize those factorsâ€™ data and then calculated the standardize matrix. Afterwards, k-means clustering method was used to analyze the standardize matrix, achieving the goal of clustering ports and planing hierarchical ports layout.Finally,the cluster results can make significant guidance for the development of inter-port cooperation.
