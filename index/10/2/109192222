Abstract: Tasks in the meat processing sector are physically challenging, repetitive and prone to worker scarcity. Despite the potential for automation, the inherent biological variation of meat and the commercial characteristics of the supply chain have limited the widespread implementation of automated systems. This chapter describes potential benefits and challenges, and gives an overview of some of the robotic and automation equipment available and in development for beef, pork and lamb processing.
