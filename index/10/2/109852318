Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) is a major equipment used in underground engineering and Cutter disk system is its major parts, which affect sharply its capability. The force and vibration characteristics of the cutter system are simulated in this paper, and the effects of its force and vibration on the cutter system reliability are analyzed. These results show that there are the most stress and the worst reliability in these joints between the cutterhead and main driver, the cutterhead and the hob, and cutter ring. These research results are very helpful for increasing the reliability and application of the rock boring machine.
