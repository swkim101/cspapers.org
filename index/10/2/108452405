In this paper, the working frequency band gap of ultrasonic motor (USM) was investigated under finite element model and experimental prototype. The findings indicate that the discrepancy between theoretical analysis and experimental test is mainly related to the fixation conditions of stator. This work proposes a new geometrical symmetrical stator for standing-wave-type linear USM to reduce the discrepancy. The first longitudinal and the second bending modes of stator are combined to drive the USM. Parameterized finite element model with actual boundary is developed to analyze and optimize the stator performance. The results show that the gap between working frequencies can be substantial reduced compared to the initial design.
