In this paper, a targeting system in lifesaving equipment is introduced. The targeting system is made up of seven modules, that is laser ranging module, wind direction and speed sensors, electronic compass, tilt sensor, control operation module, LCD display module and power module. With the help of the operational control module, the data of every module is processed, and the optimal angle is calculated. The optimal angle and pressure ensure the accuracy of lifesaving equipment. Several actual experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed targeting system in the lifesaving equipment.
