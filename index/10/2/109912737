It is unavoidable that the geomagnetic field measurement is interfered by the vehicle magnetic field in geomagnetic navigation. In order to improve the measurement accuracy, the magnetic interference of vehicle must be correctly compensated. Based on the ellipse fitting compensation method, a new 3D magnetic interference compensation method is proposed. The proposed method improves the vehicle magnetic interference compensation method from 2D ellipse fitting to 3D ellipsoid fitting by the least square algorithm of ellipsoid restriction, which relaxes the restriction on 2D motion of vehicles. And a computing method of the compensation parameters is proposed to decrease the load of calculation. Finally, the experiment shows that the compensation method can compensate the vehicle 3D magnetic interference efficiently.
