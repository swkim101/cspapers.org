A high-performance space-time two dimensional RAKE receiving algorithm was proposed in asynchronous cooperative communication system. the transmitting signals were estimated coarsely by traditional space-time rake receiver, then on the basis of that we introduce feedback technology, each multipath signal of transmitted signals was composed by the decision results, and then every multipath component in the received signal can be obtained by eliminating the composed multipath signals from the received signal. Finally, the multipath components were combined by space-time combination and multipath combination rules accordingly, so spatial as well as multipath diversities were achieved. Simulation results show that the new scheme can reduce the bit error rate dramatically compare with traditional space-time RAKE in asynchronous cooperative communication system.
