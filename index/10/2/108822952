Flywheels serve as kinetic energy storage and retrieval devices with the ability to deliver high output power at high rotational speeds as being one of the emerging energy storage technologies available today in various stages of development. This article analyzes the three-dimensional stress distribution of flywheel in Finite-element analysis. It is compared flywheel made of different material to meet the design of reasonable safety composite flywheel.
