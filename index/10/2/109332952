Curvelet transform is the combination of the multi-scale analysis and multi-directional analysis transforms, which is more suitable for objects with curves. Applications of the curvelet transform have increased rapidly in the field of image fusion. Firstly, using the curvelet transform, several polarization images can be decomposed into low-frequency coefficients and high-frequency coefficients with multi-scales and multi-directions. For the low-frequency coefficients, the average fusion method is used. For the each directional high frequency sub-band coefficients, the larger value of region variance information measurement is used to select the better coefficients for fusion. At last the fused image can be obtained by utilizing inverse transform for fused curvelet coefficients. In the present work an algorithm for image fusion based on the curvelet transform was implemented, analyzed, and compared with a wavelet-based fusion algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm works better in preserving the edges and texture information compared with the wavelet-based image fusion algorithms.
