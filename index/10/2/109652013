This paper studied the suspension characteristics of ginkgo, and designed a cleaning machine of ginkgo as well. At the same time, the effects of feeding speed, the wind speed and the angle of wind outlet on the performance of the equipment were analyzed, and a mathematical model was established. By taking multi-objective optimization method and response surface method, this paper obtained the conclusion that the best combination conditions of cleaning equipment of ginkgo: the feeding speed was 270.86kg/h, the wind speed was 9.25m/s, and the angle of wind outlet was 17Â°. Then the cleaning equipment reached the best performance: the loss rate was 1.20%, while the cleaning rate was 95.21%.
