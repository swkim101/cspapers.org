This paper presents a practical approach for a distributed data acquisition system organized on several levels, with functions distributed in functional nodes. A field bus allows the communication between all programmable electronic modules for data acquisition (first level) and the process server (second level); the last one is a data processing and monitoring equipment which also represents the process server in a computer network with many clients. The electronic equipment for monitoring and recording analog and digital inputs (i.e. a functional node from the first level of the distributed data acquisition system) is described in detail. This equipment is organized around the PC/104 central unit and performs four main functions: acquisition, configuration, local monitoring and communication. The experimental results, corresponding to the Server application, are also presented and discussed in this paper.
