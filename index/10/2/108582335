In this paper, quaternionbased mathematical model of Quadrotor without singularity is established to avoid Gimbal Lock problem in Euler angles. Flight control algorithm based on sliding mode variable structure control (SMVSC) is introduced to control the attitude and position to approach the challenge of underactuation, nonlinearity and strong coupling. Numerical simulation is conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.
