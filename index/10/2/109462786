Educational robot is a platform of new educational technology. Student could study new knowledge in execution, and discover new things in exploration. It can enhance the ability of analyzing and solving problems. Orchestic robotic vehicle is designed to give the arrangement and innovation in educational robot platform. With the sensor, dance movements of each vehicle can run according to the route and coordinated motion. There is a major hardware platform which is Arduino, with ATmega328 chip of AVR microcontroller. A QTI line sensor and SHARP-GP2D12 infrared distance sensor are used in the design. Xbee wireless communication module is based on ZigBee technology which is low power network protocol of EEE802.15.4 standard. By researching and comparing several methods of control, this paper analyzes characteristics of them and the advantage and potential of development of synthetic control are testified. Choreography and coordinated control is realized for the dancing wheeled mobile robot scheme.
