The selection and the evaluation of demonstration engineering project of housing are a complex analysis process, many projects are involved, evaluation index system are complicated, the requirements of scientific, advanced, efficiency and fairness are failed to meet with the traditional decision method. Multi-dimensional network decision support system are constructed in this paper, the construction scheme of knowledge base, model base and data warehouse are made a detailed description, the technical method of system construction are made clearly. The new decision services support is provided to select and evaluate to the demonstration project.
