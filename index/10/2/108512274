The importance of design robustness and reliability is a well-established notion and practice in today’s industry. Manufacturing companies strive to achieve Six-Sigma quality measures. While Virtual Prototyping is a key-factor in accelerating the product development process while reducing development costs, it has not contributed in the quest for improved product reliability and robustness performance since it is based on deterministic approaches. This paper provides a systematic approach to design for six-sigma simultaneously addressing variability and uncertainty present in real life on most design parameters. An example from the automotive industry illustrates the methodologies.Copyright © 2004 by ASME
