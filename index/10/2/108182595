ICCAD continues to be the premier and most selective conference devoted to technical innovations in design automation. ICCAD's program of technical papers, tutorials, keynotes and Monday night panel highlights the most important current and future research challenges. A day of colocated workshops on hot topics promises non-stop technical excitement. And as always, a large number of side meetings and social events provide plenty of opportunities for networking and meeting colleagues and friends. 
 
This year's ICCAD starts on Monday, November 2 and continues through Wednesday, November 4; you will find up-to-date details on the conference website http://www.iccad.com. This year's CANDE workshop will be held immediately before ICCAD on Oct 29, only a short hop away in Monterey. ICCAD's colocated workshops will be on Thursday, November 5. Continuing a practice started last year, ICCAD will integrate its tutorials within the technical program Monday through Wednesday. These tutorials, given by world experts, are an excellent opportunity for updating your knowledge in state-of-the-art and emerging areas. 
 
This year we received 438 worldwide submissions and the technical program committee, after careful deliberation, selected 115 excellent papers for presentation. These papers are split into 31 sessions over the three days of the technical program. In addition, the ICCAD program this year includes three special sessions, as well as two designer sessions, all focused on providing additional broad perspectives for our CAD audience.
