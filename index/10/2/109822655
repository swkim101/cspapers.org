Welcome to the 2nd International Workshop on Systems Development in SOA Environments -- SDSOA 2008. The overall goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for a concerted effort to develop a long-term community-wide research agenda for the successful development of service-oriented systems. We hope to bring together researchers and practitioners in this area that represent various strands of research activity and practical methodologies, so that we can collaboratively identify open research issues and continue addressing SOA research issues of interest to the community. 
 
During 2007, the Software Engineering Institute, in collaboration with a team of researchers, developed a taxonomy of SOA research topics that would improve SOA adoption and the development of service-oriented systems. The taxonomy is divided into research issues pertaining to the business, engineering and operation aspects of service-oriented systems, plus a set of cross-cutting aspects. A specific objective of this workshop is to identify new challenges that can be used to evolve the research agenda. 
 
We received 20 papers from Africa, Australia, Canada, Europe and the United States. These papers covered important SOA research topics such as dynamic service composition; designing SOA-based systems for qualities such as usability, reusability and performance; runtime monitoring and adaptation of SOA-based systems; application of known software engineering methodologies in an SOA context; and examples of how SOA can support business process management (BPM). The program committee accepted 14 of these papers, representative of the challenges related to service-oriented systems development. Many thanks to all the authors that submitted position papers for the workshop, as well as the program committee for their thorough reviews. 
 
We hope that you will find the selected papers interesting and that they trigger ideas for future work and research in service-oriented systems development.
