Based on 3D digital model of motorcycle constructed in UGNX, motorcycle multi-body model was established for dynamic behavior analysis under inbuilt assembling of coefficient matrix of dynamical equation in computation code of ADAMS. Through the comparison of simulation analysis for dynamics of different models in accelerations in time and frequency domains, it is concluded that realistic multi-body model better represents the dynamic behavior of motorcycle while simplified one with less physical parameters only provides qualitative analysis for the dynamic behavior. The simulation results shows that model IV with accurate parameters of components influences the dynamic response of frame, simplified models could not represent the influence of mass and inertia moment of subsystems on dynamic behavior, which means advanced motorcycle multi-body improves simulation effectiveness and approximates the dynamic behavior of motorcycle well so that the simulation developed to replace experiments in bad working conditions will promote the advancement of engineering.
