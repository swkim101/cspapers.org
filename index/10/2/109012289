Abstract: Over the past decade, machine vision has been applied much more widely, uniformly and systematically in the food industry. This has been ensured by continual developments in the constituent methodologies, namely image processing and pattern recognition. At the same time, advances in computer technology have permitted viable implementations to be achieved at lower cost. To some extent, progress is now being held up by the need for tailored development in each application: hence future algorithms will have to be made trainable to a much greater extent than is currently possible. In addition, recent developments such as hyperspectral imaging should become accepted in a number of niche areas.
