The sustainable forestry economic development is a typical non-linear complex system, so traditional statistical methods are hard to be used for the pre-warning. This paper constructs the pre-warning index system for the sustainable forestry economic development, and then builds a pre-warning model for it by applying the BP artificial neural network technology. This model provides a technical means for the pre-warning analysis of the sustainable forestry economic development as well as the decision-making basis for the forestry economic management and planning.
