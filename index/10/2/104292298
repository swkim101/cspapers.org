Sketching is an effective communication medium that augments and enhances what can be communicated in text. We introduce Sketchforme, the first neural-network-based system that can generate complex sketches based on text descriptions specified by users. Sketchforme's key contribution is to factor complex sketch rendering into layout and rendering subtasks using neural networks. The sketches composed by Sketchforme are expressive and realistic: we show in our user study that these sketches convey descriptions better than human-generated sketches in several cases, and 36.5% of those sketches were identified as human-generated. We develop some interactive applications using these generated sketches, and show that Sketchforme can significantly improve language learning applications and support intelligent language-based sketching assistants.
