Abstract: This chapter discusses the current and future state of robotics and automation to enable a more efficient poultry processing facility. The chapter begins with a discussion of the unique challenges to automating poultry processing as compared to automobile or electronics manufacturing. The chapter then discusses the current production process with a focus on available solutions as well as prototype systems developed in academic labs. Finally, the chapter ends with a look into the future to see how robotics and automation can help maximize yield and improve food safety while minimizing labor costs and the use of natural resources such as water and energy.
