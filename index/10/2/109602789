Service design has been generally discussed in the engineering field in recent years. Many manufacturers have been focusing more on services than on products themselves. To ensure the feasibility of designed services, a service designer should consider not only customer values but also the requirements of a service provider. However, there are few standard methods to deal with the service provider’s requirements and to reflect them in the service design. In this research, the authors suggest a method to describe service provider’s requirements for the service design based on the Service Engineering methodology. In addition, the authors propose a design process to analyze service providers’ requirements and adjust the specifications of a designed service in order to fulfill the requirements of both service providers and service receivers simultaneously.Copyright © 2009 by ASME
