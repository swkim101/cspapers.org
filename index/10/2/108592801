Abstract: Due to increasing consumer demand for healthy, high quality, and safe food, food processing industries are exploring/adopting new non-destructive, fast, and accurate techniques for quality and safety inspection of their products. Optical sensing and spectroscopic techniques have high potential for automated real-time quality and safety inspection of agricultural and food products. These techniques have already been adopted successfully in several food processing units for automated quality monitoring of their products. This chapter discusses various optical sensing techniques under three broad categories namely: spectroscopic, fiber optic and image sensing. Working principles, instrumentation, advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of these techniques have been described and various applications for quality monitoring in the agriculture and food processing industries have been reviewed.
