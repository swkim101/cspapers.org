The paper presents a comparative dynamic modeling and VR (virtual reality) simulation for two 3 DOF medical parallel robots: a three coupled motions structure (Orthoglide robot) versus two coupled motion parallel structure (robot of type 1PRRR+2PRPaR). Kinematical and dynamical models, followed by a VR application with control aspects are presented for these two parallel robots. The innovative user interface for high-level control of the two parallel robots, presented in the paper, was developed in MATLAB - Simulink and SimMechanics environment, while the closed form dynamic models were obtained in MAPLE program. This kind of parallel robots can be successfully applied for medical applications where accuracy and high dynamic behavior are required. This research will lay a good foundation for the development of medical parallel robots.
