It is a great pleasure to welcome you to the 48th edition of the Design Automation Conference in San Diego. In the age of web-conferencing DAC is changing its format to provide the maximum opportunity for multi-way interaction at the conference. In addition to the kickoff reception on Sunday, DAC will feature a reception at the end of each day to stimulate intermingling of all DAC participants from the exhibit floor to the technical sessions. In the technical program, all paper presentations are shortened and immediately followed by a poster session where a dialogue can take place between the author and the audience. At the Wednesday reception the Work In Progress (WIP) session will take place. This new initiative will provide a forum for new ideas, not yet fully ready for a publication, to be exchanged with other experts in the field.
