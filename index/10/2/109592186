The principle conceptual design of the automatic tray filling machine of Li/MnO2 button cell battery and its control system are analyzed in the work. According to the the needs of production process putting the cell battery into the plate, it makes structure design and modeling simulation, completes electrical system design and program control design, relys on the Single chip microcomputer (MCU) system to achieve the human-computer interaction. In addition, this work verifies the feasibility and safety through the ANSYS modal analysis. After running the test more than a year, the product can well meet the production requirements.
