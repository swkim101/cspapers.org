A learning model based on the operant conditioning mechanism (OCLM) is presented in this paper to deal with the autonomous learning problem in cognitive robotics. The model is described by 9 elements, including the space set, the action set, the bionic learning function and the system entropy etc. To describe the learning mechanism which is the core of the model, a new notion negative ideal degree(NID) is defined. We also prove the convergence of OCLM to indicate that the model is a self-organization system. OCLM has been applied to simulating the Skinner rat experiment. The results show that this model can well simulate the animals operant conditioning behavior, acquire the cognitive skills through the interaction with the environment and achieve self-learning and self-adaptability.
