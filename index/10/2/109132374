With the rapid increase in car ownership in China, increasing pressure of road traffic and part of the large and medium-sized city's traffic congestion had become a serious social problem. This led directly to greatly reduction of the speed of vehicles, increased fuel consumption and increased environment pollution. The promotion and application of the car navigation device can help the driver rational plan and select a route to avoid the crowded roads. This is the major significance of energy saving and environmental protection. Vehicle navigation control system based on green path planning regards saving vehicle fuel consumption as a starting point, the least fuel consumption as a goal, researches and selects the vehicles path. In-car terminal as an important part of the system is of great significance. In this paper, we inquiry and analysis via the green path planning model, based on the car terminal of the green path planning for car navigation monitoring systems database construction and in-car terminals realization. This is significant for China's low-carbon economy construction.
