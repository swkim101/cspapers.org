In this paper, compression behavior and energy absorption of aluminum alloy AA7005 tubes in T6 are investigated both experimentally and numerically. True stress-plastic strain curves from the tensile test are used in the static simulation of AA7005 tubes. The results from the experimental compression of AA7005 tubes are compared with the static simulation using LS-Dyna. The peak loads and energy absorption values between experimental compression results and numeral simulation are found to be in good agreement.
