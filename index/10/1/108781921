Firmware is an important part of the computer architecture, the Firmware in the process of self-test can be set through selecting specific options to adjust the boot sequence menu list, allowing the computer to select the media type to start the operating system. In this paper,through the analysis of Firmwareâ€™s boot sequence principle, pointed out the process of implementation of the Firmware boot sequence, including the position of reading boot sequence data, get the signatures of boot sequence and other key technologies. The correctness of results of the boot sequence modification experimental has been proved.
