This paper presents a diagnosis method based on EMD, in order to improve the precision of fault diagnosis in induction motors. After the Park vector analogue signal of stator current is decomposed by EMD, 2sf fault characteristic value is abstracted accurately. Simulation results show that this proposed method is of high sensitivity, efficiently solves the problem that frequencies of fault and fundamental wave are close and difficult to be decomposed.
