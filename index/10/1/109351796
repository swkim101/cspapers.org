A new iteration method based on geometry to solve the inverse kinematics for the boom system of truck mounted concrete pump, which is difficult to real-time control since its degrees of freedom are multiple-redundant, is presented. This method uses a variable-step size technique to approach the solution of the inverse kinematics, and uses geometry to determine how much angles of joint to change and its direction. Comparing with the traditional methods, this method is more suitable for real-time control of truck mounted concrete pump boom system without calculating the inverse matrix of jacobian. By the method the movement of boom will be safer and more stable when pumping concrete. Simulation results show that the new method has a fast convergence speed and good stability.
