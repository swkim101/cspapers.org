The figure of road toll at intersections around the world has not decreased in spite of the innovation and improvement of road and vehicle safety technologies. One of the most advancing technologies being developed for road safety is sensor technology. The development and installment of sensors in vehicles and on the road have caused a flood of data to be understood. Extracting patterns and trends from such data is important for better situation awareness and threat detection in an intersection. Ubiquitous computing techniques, such as ubiquitous data mining and multiagent system, have the potential to improve intersection safety. We propose a framework that utilizes both mathematical model and data mining to detect dangerous behavioral patterns and potential collision between vehicles in an intersection.
