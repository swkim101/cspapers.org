Objective To propose a PET/CT multi-planar fusion system based on PACS. Methods Firstly, the system got PET and CT slices and relevant DICOM header information from PACS workstation, preprocessed them and formed CT volume and PET volume, and then displayed the axial, coronal and sagittal planes of the two volumes by MPR. Afterwards, the results of MPR were enhanced by pseudo color processing, then were fused with the MRP results of CT correspondingly. Finally, the SUVs of PET images and the CT value of CT images were calculated according to the parameters obtained from the DICOM header, and were displayed in the lower right corner of the current sub window. Results This system can be integrated into PACS workstation expediently, can reconstruct each volume, either MPR or MIP, stably and effectively, and can fuse PET images with CT images in different planes. The resource consumption of the system is reasonable and the SUVs calculated were accurate and reliable. Conclusion The system is easy to use and has stable performance, which is helpful in the clinical diagnosis of malignant lesions as an auxiliary tool.
