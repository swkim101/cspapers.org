The estimation of the mineral resources area (target area) number is an important part of mathematical geology. Total resource depends not only on the scale of the single target mineralization but is also proportional to the number of target area. In this paper, the target area quantitative algorithm was studied based on the domestic and abroad opinions. The Petersen capture model and Poisson model were introduced into the estimation of resource maternal capacity. In order to meet the requirements of the two models, sampling plan were re-designed and improved. Take 1/200,000 gold mines and metal (Cu, Ag, Pb, Zn) mineral resources prediction in Hebei Province as an example, two practical estimation models of the resource maternal capacity were established. Calculation shows that the results of Petersen capture model and Poisson model were similar and can be as an effective predictor of district resource capacity. Therefore, the bottleneck of regional resource total forecasting calculation method is solved.
