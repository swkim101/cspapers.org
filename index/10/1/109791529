This study used finite element models to assess potential benefits of selected unconventional features implemented in this study for occupant protection in side impact. These features include door lockdown, gullwing door with a corrugated aluminum panel and cross-car beams. The intrusion and intrusion velocity of the B-pillar were used as the parameters for measuring side impact protection performance. No attempt was made here to assess manufacturablity, design feasibility, mass implications or market interest.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
