Segmentation of brain MRI in an image sequence is one of the most challenging problems in image processing, while at the same time one that finds numerous applications. In this paper, we propose a robust multi-layer background subtraction technique and seed region growing approach which takes advantages of local texture features represented by local binary patterns (LBP) and photometric invariant color measurements in RGB color space. Due to the use of hybridization of layer-based strategy and seed region growing approach, the approach can model moving background pixels with quasiperiodic flickering as well as background scenes which may vary over time due to the addition and removal of long-time stationary objects. The experiment results prove that in the view of the brain MRI segmentation, this algorithm provides fast segmentation with high perceptual segmentation quality.
