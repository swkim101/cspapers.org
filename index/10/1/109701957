The advantages of reuse are particularly relevant to engineering and maintenance of the large volumes of extremely complex software that will be required for Integrated Broadband Communications (IBC). This fact has been recognized in the RACE programme which includes two projects, ARISE and SPECS, that explicitly deal with various aspects of software reuse. ARISE (A Reusability Infrastructure for Software Engineering) (RACE Project 1021) is a five year project whose main concern is to specify the elements of an integrated support environment for the engineering of IBC software. The paper presents the methodological approach adopted by ARISE for achieving results in the area of reuse of relevance to software engineering in the telecommunications domain. It does not say how reuse should be done in the telecommunications domain, but rather describes an approach to applied industrial research on reuse which will yield the results we need. >
