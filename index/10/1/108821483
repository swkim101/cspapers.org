This paper presents a leg reconfigurable technique to optimize the hexapod robot reconfiguration flexiblity. A hexapod-to-quadruped (Hexa-Quad) transformation technique is proposed to optimize hexapod legs on certain situation that need some legs to be disabled as a leg to do other tasks and operations. This proposed method used the factor of center of body (CoB) stability in the support polygon and its body shape. The reinitialized legâ€™s shoulder method is proposed to ensure the support polygon is balanced and confirmed the CoM nearly or at the center. This method is modeled and simulated in a real-time based model of hexapod robot with 4-DOF/leg control architecture. The model is verified in numerical model and presented using separated 3D simulators.
