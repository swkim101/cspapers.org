Used the finite element method, the rolling process analysis mod Analysis el of 3500mm rolling mill is established in this paper based on the thermal mechanical analysis theory, according to the rolling technology parameters in actual production, the rolling process of plate rolling is systematic analyzed, which thinks about the thermal stress caused by uneven temperature distribution. The law of technology parameters influencing rolling process is gained, which uses in the optimization of rolling process, improves production efficiency. it has important significance to reduce the energy consumption.
