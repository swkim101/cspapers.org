This study analyzes the loads of a needle by using singularity functions and determines the Von-Mises stresses to predict the failure modes of needles by using a personal computer. After principal stresses are calculated from the bending stress, compressive stress and shear stress, predicted failure modes of needles based on the Von-Mises stress coincide with practical existing failure modes reported by a manufacturer. These calculated stresses are also compared with the results obtained by using the software ABAQUS in the mainframe, and the deviation between the results calculated by these two methods is also investigated. Using this methodology can obtain loads, stresses and failure modes of a needle with acceptable accuracy while reducing the cost of using the commercial software in the mainframe.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
