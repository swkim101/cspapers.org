Based on the characteristics of the acoustic emission (AE) signals from low carbon steel pitting corrosion, a new extraction method was proposed with wavelet transformation and independent component analysis. The experiment result shows that the new method can overcome the influence induced by the uncertainty of the independent source of low carbon steel pitting corrosion and good extraction result can be achieved.
