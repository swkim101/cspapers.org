This paper describes the image based on dark channel prior to fog. Dark colors from the statistical laws of outdoor priori no fog image database, it was such a key observation was based on the fact that - the vast majority of each local area outdoor image without fog are present strength of certain of at least one color channel low value pixels. Using this model building, directly estimate the concentration of fog and mist removal recover high quality interference image. Experiments show that the dark channel prior to remove the image haze becomes simple and effective.
