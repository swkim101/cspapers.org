Damage alarm is an important step among structure damage identification. Its objective is to evaluate the structure health. the existing damage alarm methods are mostly based on BPNN without thinking over testing noise. Therefore, a new method based on hybrid algorithm RBFNN is proposed for structure damage alarm system in this paper. The experiment results of steel truss girder bridge show that the new method is better than BPNN for structural damage alarm.
