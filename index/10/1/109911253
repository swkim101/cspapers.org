Active magnetic bearing (AMB) is a prime component of the more electric aircraft technology that aims at reducing weight and emissions, and augmenting reliability and efficiency for future aircraft. The effect of maneuvering flight on performance of AMB system is investigated. A mathematical model considering maneuver equivalent force is presented and based on the model stability analysis is presented in terms of asymptotical and regional stability. The research result indicts that maneuvering flight has a great influence on system dynamics and stability.
