When a submarine uses an anti-torpedo tactic, it is a matter of life or death. There are two types of countermeasures:decoys and jammers. A successful anti-torpedo tactic should consist of the deployment of mixed decoys and jammers and the coordination with the submarines maneuver. This paper would like to discuss the anti-torpedo tactics and study the interaction among the submarine and torpedo. After applying the evolutionary algorithm, it is interesting to discover the survivability of submarine in the torpedoes engagement scenario.
