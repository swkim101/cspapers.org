Road Safety System development is complex task, which requires the collaboration between designers and accidentologists. However, designers and accidentologists do not share the same viewpoints, neither the same models to analyze an accident, nor the same technical language. This makes their communication a complex task in a design process. Accident Scenario is recognized as a powerful communication tool between designers and accidentologists. Nevertheless, an accident scenario has to be presented in a way that both designers and accidentologists can understand and use. To address this issue, we use the systemic approach (a complex system modeling approach) to develop a new methodology allowing constructing multi-view accident scenarios.Copyright Â© 2005 by ASME
