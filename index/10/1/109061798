In recent years, the development of e-government construction in China has made great strides. The development of e-government from1.0 to 2.0 had played an important role in integrating and promoting the public service and management capacity of government. Grassroots government is one of the main supplies of public services. It is an important mean for grassroots government to improve service quality and efficiency by providing and promoting the public service. But in practice, e-government 2.0 in grassroots government still has many obstacles in ideas, institutions and resources. Eliminating these barriers and promoting the role of e-government 2.0 will further improve the efficiency of public services and the level of grass-roots government.
