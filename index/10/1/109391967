Based on the application drawback of the conventional motor reciprocating within certain angle, a novel permanent magnet arc guideway motor (PMAGM) is put forward which directly converts electrical current into limited angular moment, producing torque through a limited rotation angle of normally much less than ±180°. According to the permanent magnet (PM) magnetization and solenoid coil electrifying modes, five different magnetization orientations and three different electrifying modes are analysed. Results show that electromagnetic force of Y direction magnetized alone the external field force lines is larger than any other magnetization orientations, 40% higher than that of vertical magnetization. X direction electromagnetic force magnetized alone the external field force lines in proposal 3 is 2.5 times that of the vertical magnetization in proposal 2. The electromagnetic force and dynamic response performance of designed PMAGM could be improved effectively and provided with certain practical significance.
