Pulsed current source is used to drive high-power LED in thermal analysis and testing. A new scheme to design the high-power LED pulsed current source, which integrates FPGA device, with highly quality single-chip microcomputer C8051F as the control center, is introduced. In order to obtain the LED automatic current control, the negative feedback is used in the LED pulsed driver. The pulsed current source consists of constant-current source and couple output interface controlled by square pulse signal, which ensures the stability of pulsed current, rise time and fall time. It is convenient to adjust the pulse current amplitude, pulse width, pulse cycle and sampling gate independently. Results show that the current stability of the driver control system can obtain 0.01%.
