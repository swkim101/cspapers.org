An optimal scheduling method of urban pumping stations was proposed to cut down the energy cost.Using this method, pumping stations in the drainage area were divided into groups,and the scheduling period was divided into several computation periods,and several operation schemes were fixed in each group. In each computation period, groups were regarded as test objects,and operation schemes as test levels, and scientific tests were carried out with the help of orthogonal test table. Choosing the ratio of drainage volume and power consumption as the objective function, the best theoretical operation scheme should be found out through the orthogonal analysis.Using the unsteady flow model to calculate each river water level, and if each river water level was within the allowable variation amplitude, then the scheme was optimal and feasible; otherwise, adjust the test level according to the main-to-secondary sequence to obtain the optimal operation scheme. Taking 20-year frequency storm in one region of Shanghai city as a study case, total electric power consumption could be reduced more than 1/4 with the optimal scheduling method compared with the traditional one.
