Determining how to select path efficiently in complex transportation networks was one of the main problems in-car navigation systems. For the drawbacks of slow convergence and easy to fall into local optimal solution of basic ant colony algorithm in solving the optimal path problem, a method of improving the expect-heuristic function is proposed in this paper, which enhances search direction and improves the convergence rate. Meanwhile, with the introduction of a new strategy to update the pheromone on ant colony system, the contradiction that convergence speed brings stagnation is balanced. The results show that the improved ant colony algorithm is easier to get the optimal solution compared with basic ant colony algorithm, and the convergence speed is faster, having a good navigation effect.
