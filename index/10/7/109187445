This tutorial explores the implications of two classes of component-based development efforts. First, those efforts where components are custom-developed and deployed onto a pre-fabricated component infrastructure such as Enterprise JavaBeansTM, and second, efforts where commercial off-the-shelf components are integrated into an enterprise infrastructure upon which business logic can be deployed.
