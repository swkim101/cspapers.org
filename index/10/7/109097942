Trust model is the foundation of the whole secure architecture because it determines the trust form adopted and the risk to adopt it in network. So the research of trust model in PKI has been the hot spot of PKI technology. Firstly, some backgrounds of PKI and trust model as well as the problems to be solved by the model are discussed. Through analyzing and comparing several extant CA-based trust model, their advantages and disadvantages are described. Finally, PKI trust models are summarized, and the future research directions were discussed.
