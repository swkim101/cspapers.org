Welcome to the 6th International Workshop on Traceability in Emerging Forms of Software Engineering (TEFSE 2011), which is collocated with the 33rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE'11) in Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii. We hope you will all enjoy the location as much as the workshop and the main conference. 
 
TEFSE 2011 is the result of efforts undertaken by many people. The organizing committee included five members who managed organizational issues, the program, web presence and publicity efforts. The program committee included 23 members who contributed to the review process. We want to thank all of them for their impressive work and commendable commitment. TEFSE program would not exist without the effort of these excellent reviewers. We would thank the steering committee members for their precious guidance. Last, but not least, the ICSE organization, and in particular the ICSE workshop chairs, who actively supported in the workshop organization. 
 
This year TEFSE received 17 paper submissions, out of which we accepted four full and eight short papers. The TEFSE program includes two technical sessions, one on "links and relations" and the other on "humans, effort, and tools". Also, the program includes one challenge session in which different participants will compare the capability of their approaches on some common datasets, and a panel on "Grand Challenges, Benchmarks, and TraceLab: Developing Infrastructure for the Software Traceability Research Community". 
 
It is our distinct honor to have Dr. Jane Cleland-Huang from DePaul University, USA as our keynote speaker. Dr. Cleland-Huang will inaugurate the TEFSE workshop this year with her vision on "Traceability Research: Taking the Next Steps".
