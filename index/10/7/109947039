This paper discusses the problem of synchronizing multiple robots in cooperative tasks. The problem is divided in two parts: first the problem of synchronizing robots which are handling large objects that cannot be manipulated only by one robot (hard connected robots) is discussed; the problem is approached from the point of view of path planning, kinematics, and movement synchronization. An alternative of control using the force control and dynamics which solved by using a decentralized control structure is also presented. The second problem concerns robot synchronization in a shared workspace; here is presented a method of control for collision avoidance and time optimization for the robot tasks (assembly / disassembly). In the conclusion section the results from the experiments conducted on two SCARA type robots (Adept Cobra s600) are presented.
