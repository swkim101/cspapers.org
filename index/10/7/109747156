The objective of the ROSA project is to develop a model for the RACE Open Services Architecture, and to show its practical relevance to the evolution of software for Integrated Broadband Communications (IBC) during its potential life-span of 25 years or more. Its principal deliverable is the ROSA embryonic standard which will be in the public domain and non-confidential and suitable for input to international standardisation processes. The ROSA project aims to fill a crucial gap in software strategy for the RACE programme by forming a bridge between the Functional Reference Model and the Programming Infrastructure projects. Its definition of a common architectural approach to system engineering design at all levels, which facilitates the evolution of open systems, provides a focus for current Programming Infrastructure projects and an instrument for applying their results coherently and consistently across IBC.
