The collision that between a car and a train is the main type of accidents in the case railway level-crossing, which is proved by the arrangement diagram analysing. The fault tree analysis and the event tree analysis are used to assess the level of the risk of the level-crossing quantificationally. Some conclusions can be drawn: the collision of the railway level-crossing that between a car and a train will happen 2.552 in a year, which can bring 0.061 equivalent fatalities. This paper puts forward some precautionary measures that based on the minimal cut set of the collision of the accident and the most probable or the highest risk event.
