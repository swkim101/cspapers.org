A phenomenon that the damping ratio will decrease when the power flows from both sides to the primary power grid is summarized and analyzed in the paper. Based on analysis of the damping ratio change of West Inner Mongolia-Shandong oscillation under the sequential operation mode and the hedge operation mode, a three-machine equivalent system is established to study edge to edge (ETE) oscillation mode under hedge operating mode of the power system. The influence of magnitudes and trends of power flow on damping ratio is analyzed, and the reason that why damping ratios decreases when both sides send power to the mid-side power grid is explained.
