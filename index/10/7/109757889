The aim of the paper is to describe an approach for modeling the dynamic behavior of a positioning system actuated by two shape memory alloy springs, placed in opposition. The mathematical analysis of the system in order to develop the dynamic model is difficult in this case because of the unknown parameters within the dynamic equations (thermodynamics, change in austenite fraction) and therefore a new approach is presented. Thus, a positioning system is considered, and its behavior is determined using Matlab Software, D-space platform and an optical sensor, which analyses the position/velocity of the moving cart. The dynamic model of the system is determined in order to develop a further model based control technique. The model is generated using system identification toolbox within Matlab and input and output (response) of the considered system.
