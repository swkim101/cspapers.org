Deep Learning (DL) models have created a paradigm shift in our ability to comprehend raw data in various important fields, ranging from intelligence warfare and healthcare to autonomous transportation and automated manufacturing. A practical concern, in the rush to adopt DL models as a service, is protecting the models against Intellectual Property (IP) infringement. DL models are commonly built by allocating substantial computational resources that process vast amounts of proprietary training data. The resulting models are therefore considered to be an IP of the model builder and need to be protected to preserve the owner's competitive advantage. We propose DeepSigns, the first end-to-end IP protection framework that enables developers to systematically insert digital watermarks in the target DL model before distributing the model. DeepSigns is encapsulated as a high-level wrapper that can be leveraged within common deep learning frameworks including TensorFlow and PyTorch. The libraries in DeepSigns work by dynamically learning the Probability Density Function (pdf) of activation maps obtained in different layers of a DL model. DeepSigns uses the low probabilistic regions within the model to gradually embed the owner's signature (watermark) during DL training while minimally affecting the overall accuracy and training overhead. DeepSigns can demonstrably withstand various removal and transformation attacks, including model pruning, model fine-tuning, and watermark overwriting. We evaluate DeepSigns performance on a wide variety of DL architectures including wide residual convolution neural networks, multi-layer perceptrons, and long short-term memory models. Our extensive evaluations corroborate DeepSigns' effectiveness and applicability. We further provide a highly-optimized accompanying API to facilitate training watermarked neural networks with a training overhead as low as 2.2%.
