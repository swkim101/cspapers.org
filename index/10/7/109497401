Wind turbine transmission system with abundant fault feature and variable types, the vibration signal was a carrier of fault features and it can reflect most of the fault information in the wind turbine transmission system. As there were a large number of transient and non-stationary signals accompany with the vibration signals, so wavelet packet transform was adopted for feature extraction. As RBF Neural network has a strong nonlinear mapping ability and self-adaptability, so it was introduced to the diagnosis system for network training, the neural networks structure and learning algorithm was presented, which could enhance the accuracy of diagnosis. The two-level neural networks recognition method was proposed, first level for fault classification and second level for fault diagnosis. The example shows that this method can be effectively applied to transmission system of wind turbine fault diagnosis with wavelet packet algorithm for fault feature extraction and RBF neural network for pattern recognition.
