Based on the tapping machines special structural features and practices, from both directions of rotation and impact established the tapping machine mechanism rotating borer and impact dynamic mathematical model, analysed the effect of different tapping machines parameters on the model itself, simulated the model with inputting wide pulse signal, the simulation results show that: firstly, the tapping machine model established in this paper is reasonable; secondly, increase the damping coefficient of the blast furnace, the tapping machines rotating borer rotation speed and impact attenuation speed decrease.
