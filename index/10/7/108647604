This paper firstly describes the concept of eye ellipsoid and the calculation about the coordinate of eye point in the SAE J941. And based on it, uses the vector method and the role of reflection to get the equation of view angle about rearview mirrors, and then measures parameters of one real car, finally makes graphics to present the change of the view angle along with the corner of mirror and the position of driver by using the Matlab software.
