Transformers are a class of products with great potential in a number of markets and applications. These are systems that exhibit a change in state to facilitate new or enhanced product functionality. The historical children’s toys known as “transformers” provide a mental picture of this definition. Working examples are vertical lift aircraft that function as helicopters for take-offs but transform to propeller-driven airplanes for point-to-point travel. This paper builds on research into developing principles and design methodologies for the creation of transforming products. We summarize this research and demonstrate an approach for implementing Transformer Design Principles as part of an ideation and computational design process. An application to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV-TACMAV) illustrates the utility of the approach.Copyright © 2006 by ASME
