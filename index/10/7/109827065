Hybrid Control Unit (HCU) is the core control component of hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). According to the input signals such as driver attempts, accelerate pedal position, gear and brake pedal position etc, the HCU can calculate the output parameters such as engine output power, motor and generator torque etc, Therefore, the design of HCU will directly influence the power performance, fuel economy, reliability and other performances of hybrid electric vehicle. This HCU is designed based on MC9S12DP512 microprocessor. In this paper, first, the function requirement and design philosophy of the HCU is explained. Then, according to the function, the HCU is divided into power supply module, CAN communication module, MCU module, digital input module, AD converter module etc. And the function and circuit principle of each function module are explained respectively. Finally, the design method related to improve HCU EMC performance is illustrated.
