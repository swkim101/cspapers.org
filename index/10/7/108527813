Precision irrigation is an important subsystem of precision agriculture, which is helpful to improve the water utilization of agricultural irrigation, so as to achieve the purpose of water conservation. For the issues of crop water shortage information timely and accurately, it designed and implemented a water shortage information detection system in the growth of crop based on canopy temperature and environmental factors. The system used the STM32 processor as the core, configured a variety of sensors, acquired and processed crop canopy temperature and various kinds of crops micro-environment information, obtained crop water shortage information through crop water stress index (CWSI), so as to guide the agricultural irrigation. The test proves that the system is working in good condition, can be effective for data acquisition and processing, so as to achieve the design requirements.
