Abstract: Automation and the use of robots are enabling technologies in the seafood industry when the goal is reduced production costs and increased product quality. The seafood processing industry has a relatively small robotic involvement compared to some other industry sectors, and needs to increase this involvement in spite of the challenges regarding robotic handling of fresh food products and hygienic requirements. Some technological possibilities are briefly described in this chapter; among other technologies, some new gripper solutions are mentioned. The application and adoption of automation and robotics in different unit operations in fish processing are described and some future trends are briefly discussed.
