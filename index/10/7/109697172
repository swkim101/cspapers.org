Abstract: Novel approaches to guarantee complete and intelligent control of entire food processing plants are required in order to ensure product quality, flexible and efficient operation, and to reduce the impact of processes on the environment. The objective of this chapter is to present several issues associated with, and advanced methods for, modelling, monitoring and control that may be appropriate for the handling of on-line process optimization in the context of food processes. The chapter mainly concentrates on a bioconversion process in a fed-batch reactor.
