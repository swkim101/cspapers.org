Abstract: It is estimated that 40% of all foods require refrigeration and rely on a well controlled cold-chain to maintain product quality and safety in order to be supplied to the consumer. This chapter looks at the key drivers and challenges for automatic controls for food chilling and freezing operations. The key operations that make up the modern food cold-chain are discussed individually in detail, and in each case the current or future applications for automation of these operations is highlighted and discussed.
