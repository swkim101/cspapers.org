With the continuous advance of mobile Internet applications and deepening of the mobile node based multicast applications are rapidly expanding, which prompted about IP multicast technology moves towards greater efficiency requires rapid expansion. This detailed analysis of the current source mobile support the technical characteristics of the pros and cons of various options, from mobile multicast nature of the fundamental dilemma facing the Institute and gives a general conclusion. Meanwhile, according to the technical characteristics of the mobile anchor point MAP, as a starting point, the initial build a more comprehensive source mobile multicast algorithm, given the basic principles and operation points, so show a good efficacy with, the extension movement of multicast frame shape.
