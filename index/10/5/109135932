Sand milling collection machinery is a kind of large machinery to collect the surface soil containing ores. The suspension system of milling machines directly affects the ride comfort and driving safety for the operator; for this end, the design of suspension system has been optimized so as to satisfy the requirements of reliability and comfort by making the console and operator set at the maximum station and minimum absolute acceleration and the amplitude within the range. This paper first established a suspension system model of milling collection machines and set up the state equation of suspension system by applying Lagrange equation. On this basis, this paper conducted the optimized calculation encouraged bt the pavement with sine rule change and obtained an optimal suspension system parameters ki and ci.
