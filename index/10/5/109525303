The corrosion is an important problem for the service safety of oil and gas pipeline. This research focuses. This paper proposed a new prediction algorithm on corrosion prediction of gathering gas pipeline, which combined modified Support Vector Machine (SVM) with unequal interval model. Firstly, grey prediction method with unequal interval model was used to pretreatment original data because there is unequal interval problem in actual collected data of pipeline. Secondly, improved Support Vector Regression (SVR) based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been proposed to resolve parameters selection problem for SVR. Finally, the corrosion prediction model of gas pipeline has been proposed which combined improved SVR and unequal interval grey prediction method. The experiment results show this algorithm could increase precision of the pipeline corrosion prediction compared with the traditional SVM. This research provides reliable basis for in-service pipeline life prediction and confirming inspecting cycle.
