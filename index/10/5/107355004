Pakistan's IT industry is currently one of the top performers as compared to other industrial sectors within Pakistan. As per the findings of Ahsan (2008), despite the fact that Pakistan's IT industry is competitive, its true potential is yet to be unfolded. Ahsan (2008); states that Pakistan's so called competitive IT industry has to be in lined with the international performers. A simple proof of this statement can be obtained from the fact that Pakistan's general economy is 1/5th of Indian economy. This must be true for IT sector of both the economies as well, which, unfortunately is not the case as because Pakistan's IT sector is currently 1/27th of the Indian IT Sector. Ahsan (2008) believes that partial reason of this unwanted difference may be revenue models, business practices and political situations of the two countries. Other than these Ahsan (2008) believes that several soft issues are also responsible for this industrial difference. Out of the soft issues 'motivation' is one such important factor.
