In this paper, By using a large common ABAQUS finite element software to simulate a hospital,s deep foundation pit excavation process in Changchun, Contrasting respectively pile-anchor retaining structure which had been adopted in the project with pile-strut bracing structure. Obtaining stress and deformation of soil and the stress and deformation of pile under the two supporting types, Analysis of the two supporting types feature only from the perspective of the force and deformation in foundation soil and piles, To provide a reference for future support in deep foundation excavation work.
