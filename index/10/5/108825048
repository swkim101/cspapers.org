The paper presents a scaled experimental stand for applying different algorithms onto a braking system with anti-lock capability, in order to determine the best way to control the braking process. The stand consists of a test wheel with an electro-mechanic brake caliper rolling against a powered tambour track. The angular velocities of both rolling wheel and track are monitored by a PC using custom hardware and software. The functional parameters of the test stand can be modified, thus employing different approaches for the anti-lock function of the braking process.
