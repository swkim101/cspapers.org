This paper introduces the current development of dynamic compaction machine at home and abroad and the basic structure of no decoupling dynamic compaction machine. Besides, The design scheme of no decoupling dynamic compaction machines brake control system is focused on putting forward in order to achieve automatic ramming without decoupling and without artificial hook. This kind of dynamic compaction machine with the advantage of simple structure, convenient operation and high efficiency effectively reduces the construction cost.
