Abstract: The confectionery industry is characterised by short runs and small batch production, thus confectionery packaging is frequently accomplished manually, resulting in wastage, injuries and hygiene issues. Automation of packaging in the confectionery industry would reduce these problems; and the frequent change-overs due to the large variety of products under manufacture necessitate an extremely versatile automated packaging system. This chapter describes market trends in the confectionery industry and the industryâ€™s packaging needs and reviews reconfigurable mechanisms and the potential for flexible packaging automation in the confectionery industry. A case study of a reconfigurable demonstration system is outlined.
