Gait planning affects stability, motion speed, and joint torque of quadruped robot etc. Also, it is necessary to consider movement parameters of slope walking environment such as the inclination angle, the movement area of feet and so on. The stability criterion on the basis of center of pressure is chosen to analyze the stability during the movement. Based on static balance, the omni-directional walking of quadruped robot on a slope is planned. CFP is set in order to reduce the transition steps. Then the start and end positions of swinging leg and supporting leg is calculated. The process of gait transition is planned to make sure stable and continuous movement. The experiment verifies the validity of the proposed method.
