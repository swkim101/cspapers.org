This paper describes design of wheel which can both climb stairs and travel flat ground smoothly. Firstly the corresponding Archimedes helix for climbing a certain size stairs is calculated out. Then arc curve is used to approximate Archimedes helix and the round wheel consisted of circular arc can be converted into similar Archimedes helix vane wheel, enabling the wheel both to climb stairs and to travel flat smoothly. Inventor software is used for mechanism design and modeling.
