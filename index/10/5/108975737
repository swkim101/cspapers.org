Tolerance analysis plays an important role at the stage of product design and has great influences on the assembly quality and manufacturing costs. For each ending point on the functional feature, the displacement transfer relationship is influenced by the clearance between the two parts and the tolerances of each part. With regard to functional tolerance accumulation for the simple assembly, the tolerance analysis of a complex mechanism with three parts is conducted based on the analysis line method. The rules for the functional tolerance analysis process will be summarized in this paper.
