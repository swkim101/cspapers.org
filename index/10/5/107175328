Formal education and professional training, even re-training, are becoming the central issue of software engineering, as computers become employed in almost every organized human activity. Professional know-how of any kind today must be combined with some computer skill. Equally importantly, new ideas, tools and techniques developed in laboratories must be applied to improve quality of software and reduce cost of programming. This demands a smooth flow of technology which in turn requires informed and educated minds to absorb novelty. Without them applied technology remains stagnant and accumulated research ideas unused.
