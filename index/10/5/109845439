In this paper, modeling and stability of MIMO networked control system is considered in view of network-induced delay and data packet dropout simultaneously. Based on the assumption that the data packet dropout rate is fixed and the time delay is less than one sampling period, the MIMO networked control system can be considered as linear discrete time-delay system with rate constraints on events. Then, the uniform model of MIMO NCS is established and stability criterion is derived.
