This paper presents a new MW wind turbine yaw hydraulic system,and describes the working principle of the hydraulic system,derives kinetic equations of the electromagnetic proportional valve and the motor in the hydraulic circuit,uses AMEsim to establish a simulation model of the electromagnetic proportional valve control motor hydraulic system,sets parameters of main elements of the model,and simulates.given under the input current signal action,derives yaw motor shaft speed and time graphics,and analysis.
