While there is currently a proliferation of software development tools and development support systems, they do not appear to be having an impact consonant with the expectations which led to their preparation. A recent workshop-style conference had the intent of assessing the current state-of-the-art in the area of software development tools, identifying the reasons underlying their diminished impact, and establishing directions for further advancement within the area of software development tools. The intent of this panel is to initiate discussion of these issues within the software engineering community at large by using a report upon the workshop-style conference as a focus of an open discussion.
