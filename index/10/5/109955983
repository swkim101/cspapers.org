The effect of machined workpiece surface topography and surface integrity were studied. Modifications of surface layers after mechanical surface treatments were also reviewed. Conflict ideas exist in publications about which parameters can better define fatigue endurance. The traditional one was Arithmetic Average Roughness, although deepest surface feature and the square root of the defect area were proposed. The combinations of these factors including high temperature, metallurgical alternations and plastic deformations, rather than the residual stress alone affect surface topography and surface integrity. They should be examined carefully in order to gain a better understanding of fatigue.
