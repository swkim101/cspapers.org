In this article it compares the different EEDI formulas proposed by IMO and CCS formula. On the basis of it, the river-sea-going ships EEDI calculation formula can be put forward. After comprising the EEDI reference lines of every kind of sea-going and Inland ships and compute the practice example of the developed river-sea-going ship, the conclusion can be drawn that the reference line of Inland ship is generally lower and should be the reference in verification of river-sea-going ship in the absence of river-sea-going ship EEDI reference line nowadays.
