Blades are the one of significant component in aero-engine, 70% mechanical faults are caused by blades failure. In this paper, a spectrum analysis on straining signals of rotating blades has been done through fiber Bragg grating sensors (FBGs) and Hilbert transform (HT). In order to obtain the dynamic characteristics of rotating blades, dynamic strain was monitored by four FBGs located on one blade in aero-engine with rotating speed up to 840 rpm. According to the measured and analyzed results, the FGBs are effective to measure the dynamic strain of blade in operating aero-engine. Moreover, it is capable of providing the state of rotating blades based on the envelope analysis in HT.
