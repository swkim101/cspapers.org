The interaction characteristic between lunar soil and coring drill is studied in this paper. According to the failure forms of lunar soil, the stress area is divided into two parts, central failure area and lateral failure area. The impacts of different drill parameters on cutting force are obtained by a rotary cutting model. And the process of lunar soil coring is simulated basing on a special built DEM (discrete element method) model, which accord to the special mechanical properties of lunar soil. By analyzing the simulation results, the correctness of the cutting model is proved.
