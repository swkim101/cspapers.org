Due to the features of being fluctuant, intermittent, and stochastic of wind power, interconnection of large capacity wind farms with the power grid will bring about impact on the safety and stability of power systems. Based on the real-time wind power data, wind power prediction model using Elman neural network is proposed. At the same time in order to overcome the disadvantages of the Elman neural network for easily fall into local minimum and slow convergence speed, this paper put forward using the GA algorithm to optimize the weight and threshold of Elman neural network. Through the analysis of the measured data of one wind farm, shows that the forecasting method can improve the accuracy of the wind power prediction, so it has great practical value.
