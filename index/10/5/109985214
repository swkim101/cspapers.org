Electromagnetic control valve (ECV) controls an automobile vehicle air conditioning compressor based on a pulse width modulation (PWM) input signal that supplied from an external controller. For maintaining a suitable range of temperatures inside the vehicle, suction and crankcase port pressure controls the swash (wobble) plate at certain angle. Suction and crankcase port pressure controlled in ECV can be analyzed by experimental test by considering different technical assumptions. This research paper highlights the flow of air from crankcase port with correspondence with amount of variable supply of current to obtain the experimental test data which is important to maintain the vehicle temperature inside the compartment for passengers comfort.
