Secure software development is one of the most information system issues that raised through the use of the internet and networked systems. The importance of developing secure software increases. In this work we present a process for the development of security critical software projects and an overview of some of the existing processes, standards, life cycle models that support the secure software development. It is a guide to the common body of knowledge for producing, acquiring, and sustaining secure software.
