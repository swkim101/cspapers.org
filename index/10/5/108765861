Road design aims at the selection of geometric design parameters resulting in a road environment which can be used in driving simulators, in accordance with real situations. The following chapters present the road alignment parameters with respect to their geometric representation in virtual reality, focused on two road profiles, horizontal and vertical alignment. This paper discusses and presents the graphical representation of roads in Matlab m-code as virtual reality models with respect to safety regulations.
