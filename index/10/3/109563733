Abstract: In the food industry, end-products must achieve a compromise between several properties, including sensory (texture or color for example), sanitary, and technological properties (dimensions of a biscuit or mass loss of a cheese for example). Managing these properties right from the fabrication stage with the aim of controlling them is no easy task. At present, many production processes are largely reliant on the skill and experience of the operator, something that no system will be capable of replacing in the foreseeable future. The upshot is that the quality of a food product cannot be described exclusively through strict transitions between the crisp qualifiers ‘good’ or ‘bad’, but instead requires an infinite series of potentially vague grades to be properly defined and, ultimately, controlled. This chapter outlines the key functions of fuzzy sets and proposes possibility theories to integrate skill and experience for control purposes within the food industry.
