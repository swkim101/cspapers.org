Thermal design and analysis of a satellite instrument is introduced in this paper. Some methods were adopted to help heat conduct and a finite element model was built. The analysis results showed that the temperature scopes of the main structures are from 45°C to 65.8°C and all of junction temperatures of the components are lower than the derated maximum junction temperatures themselves and leave enough design margins, which match the requirements of thermal analysis.
