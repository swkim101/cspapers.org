In this article, vibratory parts feeder widely used in industrial automation with the structure of a symmetric four-bar linkage mechanism driven by piezoelectric actuator is investigated. The dynamic modeling and simulation of the system as well as the driving controller are developed. Experiment is carried out to measure the practical acceleration and force of the vibratory platform. In comparison the experimental result with the analytical result, both outcomes are quite matched, which indicates their good accuracy. Driving control circuitry with feedback design is instrumental to provide steady output performance. Finally, optimum design to improve the transport speed and keep the parts in order is discussed.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
