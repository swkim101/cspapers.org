In the first part of this paper, there are presented the computing relations for kinematic (getting the velocity and the accelerations) and kinetostatic (getting the reactions â€“ force and moment from the links) of a plan mechanism which has five elements. In the second part of the paper, there is a three-dimensional model of the mechanism created of SolidWorks and the analysis of this mechanism motion using COSMOSMotion under SolidWorks, the goal is a comparison between the results that we obtained on analytical way and the ones from this program.
