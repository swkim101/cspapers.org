Teleoperation tasks are performed at cartesian evel when the robot and the haptic device ave dissimilar inematics. If the size of the workspaces is also dissimilar, as 
it is usually the case, the mapping between workspaces must e handled with care in order to let the user teleoperate the obot in a natural and precise way. This paper formulates the apping of workspaces based on the re-synchronization method nd proposes an assisted system that lightens the user from the edious part of the method, by guiding him/her towards the est re-synchronization position, thus minimizing the number of jumps. The proposal is part of a teleoperated guiding system being developed by the authors.
