Unmanned Aerial Vehicles have gained well known attention in recent years for a numerous applications such as military, civilian surveillance operations as well as search and rescue missions. The UAVs are not controlled by professional pilots and users have less aviation experience. Therefore it seems to be purposeful to simplify the process of aircraft controlling. The objective is to design, fabricate and implement an unmanned aerial vehicle which is controlled by means of voice recognition. In the proposed system, voice commands are given to the quadcopter to control it autonomously. This system is navigated by the voice input. The control system responds to the voice input by voice recognition process and corresponding algorithms make the motors to run at specified speeds which controls the direction of the quadcopter.
