The Ministry of Transport started a project for multipurpose electronic ticket using contactless smart card. "Contactless" and "common use" are the key concepts of this ticket. After the discussion on its concept, its specification was drawn up and a prototype system is now under development. We are going to put it in a trial operation on a subway line and some bus lines in business. In the final stage of this project, the standard of multipurpose electronic ticket for Japanese railways will be established.
