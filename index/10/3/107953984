Bolted flanged connections for fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) pipes and pressure vessels are of great importance for any user of FRP material in fluid containment applications. At present, no dimensional standards or general design rules exist for FRP flanges. Most often, flanges are fabricated to dimensional standards for metallic flanges without questioning their applicability to FRP materials. Flanges in FRP piping systems are often subjected to external, longitudinal bending moments of considerable magnitude. In piping systems, such bending moments are usually caused by thermal expansion of the piping components themselves, or by thermal expansion of pressure vessels and other equipment to which the piping system is connected. Such bending moments are of utmost importance on FRP piping systems due to the relative stiffness of most FRP materials. None of the pertinent design codes, neither the ASME Code, Section X, Fiber-Reinforced Plastic Pressure Vessels, nor the ASME/ANSI B31.3 Code for Chemical Plant and Petroleum Refinery Piping, contain design rules for external bending moments on FRP flanges. In previous papers by the same author, the effect of such external bending moments on metallic flanges were investigated and compared with a design criterion listed in the ASME Code, Section III, Nuclear Power Plant Equipment, based on an equivalent internal pressure. An analysis of the stresses in the flange-bolt assembly due to external bending moments was proposed and results were compared with flange thicknesses using the equivalent internal pressure. Calculated stresses were als6 compared with results from strain gage measurements on a test pressure vessel. To verity stress values in FRP flanges under external bending, a test rig is being used to perform strain gage measurements on a test pipe with a bolted flanged connection, subjected to internal pressure and longitudinal bending.
