This paper aims at proposing a structured approach in reliability design and analysis for mechatronic devices. Mechatronic systems are a complex integration of extremely advanced technological components able to perform tasks with high accuracy and flexibility. This complexity at all levels increases the risks of malfunction, failures and issues. The definition of an effective roadmap is necessary to provide prompt solutions in terms of product performances and duration. This study presents a set of reliability activities to be integrated in the product process development and during its cycle life. This approach may contribute to improve the mechatronic product functionalities and duration.
