A robust adaptive observer was proposed for single-linked robotic arm systems, where all the parameters in the robotic arm motion equation are treated to be unknown. Under certain assumptions, the proposed observer ensures that the estimation error is uniformly bounded in the presence of unmodeled dynamics, unknown nonlinearities, bounded disturbances and unknown parameters. Furthermore, the estimation error can be made arbitrarily small by choosing appropriately design parameters. Simulation results illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed observer.
