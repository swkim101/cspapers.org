The IC design and EDA ecosystem has witnessed a number of structural and financial upheavals in recent years. Perennial challenges—new technologies and markets, R&D investment levels, business and revenue models, and interoperability—are magnified by the current economic downturn. This year, DAC will open its program with a special Monday afternoon panel that brings together the CEOs of the leading EDA companies. The panelists will give their views on market, business and technology futures, as well as the overall outlook for the EDA industry.
