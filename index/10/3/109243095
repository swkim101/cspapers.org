Abstract: This chapter discusses automation in the form of computer-aided analysis and control engineering methods that facilitate sustainable development in the food industry. The concepts of sustainability and automation are analyzed in the context of food manufacturing processes. A number of automated tools, methods and technologies that facilitate automated design and control in the broader chemical process industry are reviewed and discussed with respect to their ability to incorporate sustainability considerations. A review of the scientific developments associated with automated design and control in food manufacturing is also performed to evaluate the assimilation of the presented tools, methods and technologies. It is concluded that food manufacturing processes provide significant opportunities for further integration of automated tools, methods and technologies that advocate sustainable development.
