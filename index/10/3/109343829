A BP neural network model was employed to forecast the railway freight turnover. First, this paper analyses the data of railway freight turnover in China from 1998 to 2012, build a three layers BP neural network, then by training and learning, a well-trained network can be used for simulating and forecasting. Finally, predict by the Grey GM(1,1) model and well-trained BP neural network respectively, and compares the errors of two prediction model, the results show that predicting the railway freight turnover by BP neural network has higher precision.
