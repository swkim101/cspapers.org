The paper analyzes mechanism of scientific research project reporting and implementation process quality assessment, constructing multi-strategy evaluation architecture model based on the N-level fuzzy idea. The model highlights the characteristics including the effectiveness, specificity, sensitivity and comparability in scientific research project quality evaluation. And the model uses of vector combination method and DEMATEL method to optimize the weights of evaluation factors in evaluation system and designs reasonable scientific evaluation system.
