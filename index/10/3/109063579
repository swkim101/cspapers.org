Based on an underwater robot with three degrees of freedom (DOF), a control system with autonomous motion and monitoring function is designed to detect the security of underwater structures. With LabVIEW as the PC software and ARM as the main controller of the lower computer, communicating through the CAN bus, this robot system has the ability of walking freely on the dam surface according to the joystick’s signal , and acquiring the robot’s position and posture as well. In addition, a two-way video multiplexer is used to transfer two video signals, which are used for navigation and observation respectively. Finally, the experiment indicated the system could realize the desired goals .
