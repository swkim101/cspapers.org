Abstract: The first automated grading facilities for fruit and vegetables became available more than 10Â years ago. Recently, machine vision and near infrared (NIR) technologies as well as mechatronics and computer technologies have been employed to make these facilities more sophisticated and have led to their use for many kinds of agricultural products. Robot technology has proved able to handle agricultural products delicately and with a high degree of precision, and to gather information to create a database of products every season. This information is then utilized as traceability data for consumers and as farming guidance for producers.
