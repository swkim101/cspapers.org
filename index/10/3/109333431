The blue organic electroluminescent device using TPBi as hole blocking layer is reported. The structure of device is ITO/ NPB(30 nm)/ DPVBi (15 nm)/ TPBi (x nm,x=0, 6)/ Alq (30 nm)/ LiF(1 nm)/ Al (200 nm) . With the addition of the TPBi not only make the highly of the blue organic electroluminescent device stable attachment x=0.168,y=0.170, but also the color coordinates change is very small and the chromaticity is relatively stable, which is coming from TPBi blocked hole in the organic emitting layer so as to improve the balance of the carrier, the composite probability of the exciton in organic functional layer and the efficiency of the organic electroluminescence device. The experiment shows the efficiency of the device is 3.32 cd/A, the maximum brightness of the device can reach 2222 cd/m2 when the voltage is 20V, respectively.
