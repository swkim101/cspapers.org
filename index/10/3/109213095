Modal analysis and vibration analysis is the foundation of dynamic characteristics analysis and it is the most important methods to analyze the inherent characteristics and mode shapes of the system. In this paper, the airport tractor frame is taken as the research object and its geometric model is established by Pro / E, 10 order modal and shapes of tractor frame is obtained by ANSYS. The results showed that: the first and second frequency of the frame is avoided the engine idling, the outbreak frequency, and excitation frequency in normal driving road. The entire frame meets the requirement of the dynamic characteristics.
