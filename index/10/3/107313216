This paper describes how the Waste Programs Division of EG and G is using computer aided design (CAD) and Design Automation to support present waste disposal operations and forecast near- and distant-term environmental effects. Specifically, support for disposal operations involves development of a two-dimensional graphic representation of the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC); support for environmental trend forecasting involves development of a three-dimensional graphic representation and environmental data base.
