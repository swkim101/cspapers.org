In this paper, we explore the design of thermoelectric (TE) windows for applications in building structures. Thermoelectric windows are equipped with TE units in the window frame to provide a heat absorption power, given a direct current input. We explore the design performance of the TE window to compensate for its own heat gains. While existing energy efficient windows have made advances towards reducing the heat transfer through them, they still depend on the building’s heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system to compensate for their heat gains. Our research explores the design of a window that can actively compensate for the passive heat flow through the window panes, and to do so with a better coefficient of performance (COP) than conventional HVAC systems. We also optimize the TE window design, and present results of the potential performance for practical applications in the building structure. For the geographic locations considered (Hawaii and Miami), the results are promising. Interestingly, the proposed TE window design actively compensates for the conduction heat gains with a COP greater than three, while that of conventional systems is typically less than three.© 2008 ASME
