For problems of zero sequence current and negative sequence current of traction transformer in Electrified Railway, a novel balance transformer with asymmetrical windings was presented. By a systematic analysis method based on the magnetic force balance equations, winding connection equations, output-port equations and voltage transfer equations, the current relationships of the primary windings and secondary windings, the balance condition and the short circuit impedances (when the neutral current in the primary side is zero) were deduced, and the electric characteristics of the balance transformer was analyzed. Through the experimental model of balance transformer in simulation platform based on Matlab/Simulink, the electric characteristics of balance transformer and change law of zero sequence current and negative sequence current in different mode were researched. Correctness and feasibility of the theoretical analysis are verified through the simulation experiment.
