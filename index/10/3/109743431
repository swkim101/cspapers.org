This slide presentation discusses the use of robust planning for rover vehicles to enable planetary exploration. The objective of this work is to use onboard planning, scheduling and execution techniques to enable a rover to take autonomous action to take advantage of new opportunities, and to respond to unexpected problems, and to improve the overall utilization of rover resources.
