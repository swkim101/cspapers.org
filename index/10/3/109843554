Integrated design about guidance and control of homing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is proposed. Firstly, an integrated guidance and control model with uncertainties can be described. Secondly, a nonlinear observer is designed for the integrated guidance and control model. Finally, the simulation results show that the nonlinear adaptive guidance law using the proposed integrated design model can perform better than the one designed separately.
