It is difficult to give shapes for tapered wire-pole with square cross-section in conventional plastic working process. A new dieless drawing method for making wire-pole has been developed. Through the dieless drawing theoretical study and experimental analysis of the wire-pole, a new wire-pole dieless drawing process is developed. The methods to ascertain key technique parameter are given out and the drawing velocity model is established. The experimental study shows that the dieless drawing technique is reasonable novel, the equipment is simple and one dieless drawing production procedure can replaces complete forming procedure in the general for tapered wire-pole dieless forming, which completes the deformation heat treatment, enhances the productâ€™s overall performance simultaneously and has the practical value.
