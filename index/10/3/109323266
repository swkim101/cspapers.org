This paper will discuss data systems interface standards including the goals and benefits in their application to space flight programs. Recent trends toward increased international cooperation in space research and applications missions have resulted in a greater emphasis on compatible interface standards among the participating agencies. The discussion will highlight the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), a consortium of 19 space agencies formed in 1982 in order to provide a technical forum for developing guidelines for compatible data systems standards among cooperating space agencies worldwide. CCSDS effort is seen as contributing significantly to the objectives of the IAF's Symposium on Space Exploration.
