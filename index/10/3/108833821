Snowfall process is analyzed from the perspective of computer simulation in this paper, the dynamic properties and the static properties of snow particles are abstracted based on particle system theory. The snow particles movement is simulated with wind and no wind. To solve the problems of the blur of snowing environment and firn phenomena, the paper puts forward a method of applying pulverization to snowing virtual environment. The tests show that the simulation methods of snowfall and pulverization are effective and real, which are suit for real-time virtual environment.
