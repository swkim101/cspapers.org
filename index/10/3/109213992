In this paper, we develop a new robust adaptive control scheme for ship steering by introducing alternative smooth function and Nussbaum function into backstepping approaches. And no requirements for the knowledge of control coefficient and the bound of unknown external disturbance, the proposed strategy implements the global stability of the ship course control and guarantees the global uniform boundedness of all signals of the resulting closed-loop system. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that tracking error asymptotically converges within an arbitrary small value pre-described by designer. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the developed adaptive backstepping control law.
