Due to the advantages of strong bearing capacity, compact structure and large working space, cable-driven camera robots are being used increasingly. This paper focuses on the design and implementation method of the control device for a four-cable-driven camera robot. Firstly, a kinematics model is built and the variations of the cable lengths are analyzed along with the camera robot motion; then, the console and actuator of the camera robot are designed; again, PC software transferring command codes from the camera robot console to the actuator and displaying camera robot motion state is developed; finally, the stability and rationality of the control device are verified by the experiment.
