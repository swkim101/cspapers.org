Welcome to the Second International Workshop on Managing Technical Debt, MTD 2011, co-located with the 33rd International Conference on Software Engineering at Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii! 
 
The first workshop on technical debt was held at the Software Engineering Institute in Pittsburgh on June 2 to 4, 2010 with the goal of understanding open research questions related to managing technical debt in software. The goal of this second workshop is to come up with a more in-depth understanding of technical debt, its definition(s), characteristics, its different forms. For this second workshop we accepted 3 research and 7 position papers. The papers were selected after a peer review by at least three members of the program committee. The accepted submissions cover a range of topics such as: monitoring and visualizing code quality, relationship of technical debt and maintainability, an economic model for technical debt and interest, software architecture related technical debt, and definitional foundations of technical debt. 
 
Managing technical debt is a broad concern of software engineering that blends research and practice. This can be seen from the programme and those involved in the workshop programme selection process. To encourage interactive discussion, foster brainstorming, community building the workshop will consist of only short presentations from the accepted papers. These short presentations will provide a basis for the participants to investigate further open research questions and challenges in practice.
