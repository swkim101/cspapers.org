Based on sound intensity and acoustic array methods, noise source identification of an engine is measured at idle condition. The main noise source of intake surface and exhaust surface are determined, also their frequency spectrum analysis. This two kinds of method testing results fundamentally agreed very well, and verify acoustic array method is more simple and easier than sound intensity method.
