The interface is constructed between the mine dump trucks performance simulation software and the genetic algorithm, aiming at the very complex relationship between the mine dump truck engine and its dynamic performance and fuel economy. The optimization of the objective function, optimization variables and constraints are designed. Genetic algorithm is used to design type 3303B mine dump trucks. The optimization of the design results are compared and analyzed on before and after and the results show that the fuel economy of the optimization of genetic algorithm is better than the original car, fuel consumption reduced 0.51 every km.
