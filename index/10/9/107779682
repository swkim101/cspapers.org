The continuing need to enhance the quality of education in all tertiary sectors is ever present. The development and delivery of large undergraduate courses, presents many challenges to those involved in both design and delivery, to ensure that the desired learning outcomes are achieved in the most effective way possible. When these students represent, as they do at Central Queensland University (CQU), a combination of internal and distance students, domestic and international students, the challenge to achieve these outcomes becomes even more complex. As educators in the tertiary environment we are mindful of the need to be innovative in our utilization of web-based resources, to evaluate the benefits or otherwise to our students as learners and enhance the quality of their learning experience. Importantly we need to remember that we are learners too and our adoption of web-based technology is an integral part of the continuous evolution and development of all educators. 
 
This paper reports on the initial findings of a recent survey to measure students’ general expectations and perceptions of web based flexible delivery in three core undergraduate subjects in accounting, management and law. This is part of a broader, on-going research project and this paper contributes to the growing awareness of the web as an additional teaching tool, and students’ perceptions and expectations in relation to these forms of delivery. In particular, the web-based initiatives being utilized in this study relate to online material delivery, online assessment and online interaction and engagement.
