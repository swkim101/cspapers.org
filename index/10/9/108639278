An observation system is developed with three ordinary industrial CCD cameras to capture the images of the weld pool and the keyhole. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the affecting relationship between welding parameters (welding current and welding speed) and the size of weld pool and keyhole. The observation results lay foundation to understand the weld pool and the keyhole behavior in PAW process and to design the future control system.
