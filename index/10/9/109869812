Bipeds are complex hybrid dunamical systems, in the sense that they miz both continuous and discrete-event phenomena (Hurmuzlu et al., 2004). The main characteristic of biped walkers is the abrupt kinematic change between the aerial phase and the support phase accompanied of dynamical impacts. The main problems of these robots is their high power and energy consumption, which limits mainly their autonomy. It could be attributed to, for example, the high number of actuacted joints (about 20), and also because the study of energy consumption is not often considered during the planning of movements.
