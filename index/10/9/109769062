A cotton sliver detection sensor is designed, which is different from the traditional roller detection system. Firstly the lever enlarges the change of thickness of cotton sliver into a large amount of displacement, and then the LVDT detects this displacement, and finally the signal transmission module based on AD698 converts the detected signal of the LVDT into a voltage ranging from 0V to 10V. The experiments show that the sensor has good linearity and resolution. The design is not only with lower mechanical inertia and simpler signal processing circuit, but also solving the problem that in the face of processing technologies change, sliver sensor with embossing roller and ladder roller, need to replace the different detection roller.
