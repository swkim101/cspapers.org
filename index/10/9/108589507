The subject of boom lifting and slewing need to repeat ten hundreds times in truck crane operating reliability, resulting in lasting for dozens of days. It is difficult for the inspection officials to supervise the entire procedures, which influences the objectivity of examination. A monitoring system was developed based on virtual instrument technology. It consisted of the load lifting height detection nodes, boom slewing counter module and data collector, etc. The height was measured by two relative-distance wireless nodes which are based on CSS (Chirp Spread Spectrum, CSS) technology. The boom slewing count was achieved by logic circuit. The signal of it was input by two sensors which were distributed at 180Â°. The height and count were transported to data collector via wireless network. The number of cycles of boom lifting and slewing was automatically judged by client software in data collector based on the height and slewing count. Preliminary experiments were conducted. A total of 800 experiments were tried and 793 times were successfully counted. The accuracy was 99.1%. The results show that the system can meet long-term demand for reliability test effectively. It is helpful to reduce labor intensity and guarantee the authenticity of examination.
