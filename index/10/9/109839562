Train operation regulation is the key technology to ensure the orderly operation of trains, its value has been fully realized under the background of rapid construction and high traffic density in urban rail transit. This paper did a deep analysis on different strategies and methods for urban rail transit train operation regulation and the applications of these strategies and methods in different conditions. Furthermore, an automatic train operation regulation mathematical model was established. Then developed a software system in Visual C++ and used it to analysis and test the model by data of a real metro line, the result showed that both the model and the system were available.
