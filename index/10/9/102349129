Modern online services come with stringent quality requirements in terms of response time tail latency. Because of their decomposition into fine-grained communicating software layers, a single user request fans out into a plethora of short, μs-scale RPCs, aggravating the need for faster inter-server communication. In reaction to that need, we are witnessing a technological transition characterized by the emergence of hardware-terminated user-level protocols (e.g., InfiniBand/RDMA) and new architectures with fully integrated Network Interfaces (NIs). Such architectures offer a unique opportunity for a new NI-driven approach to balancing RPCs among the cores of manycore server CPUs, yielding major tail latency improvements for μs-scale RPCs. We introduce RPCValet, an NI-driven RPC load-balancing design for architectures with hardware-terminated protocols and integrated NIs, that delivers near-optimal tail latency. RPCValet's RPC dispatch decisions emulate the theoretically optimal single-queue system, without incurring synchronization overheads currently associated with single-queue implementations. Our design improves throughput under tight tail latency goals by up to 1.4x, and reduces tail latency before saturation by up to 4x for RPCs with μs-scale service times, as compared to current systems with hardware support for RPC load distribution. RPCValet performs within 15% of the theoretically optimal single-queue system.
