Wheel sensor is the basic facility of railway axle counter. The traditional active magnetic steel axle counter method has a disadvantage of low accuracy. For this reason, a high-precision active wheel sensor which sends axle pulse in a fixed position of wheel signal was presented. In addition, double DSP parallel working mode was used to improve the reliability of the system. Firstly, the detection scheme of the system was presented. Then hardware circuit of the wheel sensor was designed with TMS320F2812, and the reliable output of the pulse was realized by using the gate circuit. Finally, software programming was completed based on the hardware design, which mainly includes the wheel signal detection and position calculation for sending axle pulse. The actual operation shows that the system has the advantages of being stable and reliable and has strong resistance to interference, which makes it a high practical value.
