Integrated Materials and Products Design (IMPD) differs in the way that materials as well as product layout are designed or optimized in a concurrent manner to meet design requirements. IMPD allows the specific performance required in a product to be achieved by tailoring materials and product, since system performance will not be limited by a pre-chosen material employed in conventional, material-selection-based design. In this study, Blast Resistance Panels (BRPs) with square honeycomb core are designed based on this new design approach to further enhance the performance of BRPs. We employ multi-level design methods for the integrated design of blast resistance panels and materials. Along with the traditional multi-level optimization of BRP, another design approach, Analytical Target Cascading (ATC) is introduced for a comparative design study in the BRP design. In this article, we compare the design results and design exploration efficiency of the two multi-level design methods in designing the blast resistance panels as well as those materials. We also discuss the advantage and disadvantage of the methods observed in this study.
