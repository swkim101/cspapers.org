This paper describes design and implementation of process management for ARM based multi-process mono-kernel, including creation of init process, process fork, process exit, process waiting, process switching and process schedule. An example is provided at the final of the paper to show the effect of process management for the mono-kernel. The entire kernel is developed from scratch by the author of this paper on Linux with GNU tool chain, suitable not only for further research but also as embedded OS design demo for related curriculum teaching.
