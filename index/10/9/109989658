On March 26, 2004, a six-year-old boy ran into an automatic revolving door when it was about to close. The door caught the boy’s head and killed him. The accident immediately caught the attention of mass media, police, government, and the people. Amidst all the opinions and talks about how dangerous these automatic revolving doors are and how safety measures should be installed, we organized a group of volunteers to analyze the dynamics of the accident to measure the forces, door velocity, acceleration, and if available, the driving current and voltage of the motors. The group not only studied the same door that caused the fatal accident but it also ran the same series of tests on a smaller size power-assisted revolving door, an automatic sliding door, an elevator door, a building shutter, a commuter train door, a bullet train door, an automatic sliding door on an automobile, and its power window. With the safety mechanisms disabled, we measured an impact force of 548kgf on a dummy head of a 3-year old when it was jammed between the revolving door edge and the door frame. The human scull of a child crushes at only 100kgf and our results show that in addition to this large automatic revolving door, the smaller size power-assisted revolving door, the shutter, and manually closing automobile doors generate forces that exceed this limit. These doors inherit the danger of causing fatal accidents.Copyright © 2005 by ASME
