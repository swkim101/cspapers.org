With the development of modern agricultural science and technology, the phytotron, as a controlled environment laboratory, is applied widely in crop cultivation, breeding and other fields. Data acquisition and automatic control with high precision of microclimate parameters in phytotron becomes more and more important. In order to overcome the defects of conventional phytotron with complex layout and inconvenient maintenance, a new implementation scheme of monitoring system based on wireless sensor network for phytotron is presented in this paper. Different kinds of environmental parameters were collected by wireless node and sent to the monitoring center through wireless communication network, and then processed and controlled by the main controller collaborating with interactive interface equipment. Testing result shows that the monitoring system with friendly interface has advantages of high sensitivity, easy operation and flexible extension.
