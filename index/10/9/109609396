In this paper, an automatic tape vulcanizing tank hoisting manipulator is designed to improve the accuracy and the efficiency in tape vulcanization. The hoisting manipulators control system takes Siemens S7-200 PLC as the core. By controlling two frequency converters and a solenoid valve, the hoisting manipulator not only movs along the Y-axis and Z-axis also clamps the vulcanizing mold. In addition, the hoisting manipulator communicates with the vulcanizing tank through PC / PPI bus and the RS232/485 interface port on PLC, achieving linkage production.
