This paper presented a approach, called LBS, for modeling and implementing the architecture of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) publish/subscribe (Pub/Sub) applications using a local broker subcomponent (LBS) model. Considering the reconfigurability of WSNs applications which was necessary for WSNs middleware, a graph oriented local broker subcomponent (GOLBS) model was defined based on the LBS model by integrated WSNs middleware with Pub/Sub. The analysis indicated that GOLBS provided reconfiguration management and non-predefined dynamic reconfiguration management for WSNs middleware. The results imply that GOLBS can easily be constructed, while ensuring good reconfigurability.
