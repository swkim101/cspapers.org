If all the elements of modelling of industrial product are similar and one is different in form,it will stand out and become specific form. The internal structure, semantic function, use function and aesthetic function are the existing theoretic foundation. The applications of specific form in modeling design of industrial product include the application of specific forms of morphological attribute in modeling designï¼Œthe application of specific forms of modeling techniques in modeling design, the application of specific forms of deformation in modeling design and the application of specific forms of image in modeling design.
