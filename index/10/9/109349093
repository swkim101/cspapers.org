This paper focuses on the visual tracking algorithm in optical imaging surveillance and tracking system. The tracking particle filter framework deemed find sparse representation problem, can effectively overcome the visual tracking algorithm appears in noise, occlusion, background interference and complex situations such as illumination changes. Morphological methods using digital occlusion area is detected to determine whether the date is added to the template tracking results set, thereby updating the control template, to effectively prevent the drift tracking results.
