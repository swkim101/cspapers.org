The network size of China Mobile Multimedia Broadcasting (CMMB) has expanded rapidly, and population coverage ratio has significantly increased. Meanwhile requirements of users to CMMB network coverage have risen higher and higher. How to know the situation of CMMB network coverage accurately and resolve the problems of it timely and effectively has become the primary task for CMMB network coverage workers. In this paper, based on the design requirements of CMMB coverage analysis system and data system, the E-R diagram was adopted to realize the database design of three physical objects: coverage information, map information and user information. Furthermore, a logical structure model of database was created and the design process of database in CMMB coverage analysis system was analyzed in this paper, which can provide a reference for further development and optimization of CMMB coverage analysis system.
