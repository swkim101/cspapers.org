In this paper, the application of Scene Simulation technology to walkthrough is introduced in detail, and two key links of system implement with the scene simulation technology are analyzed, which are the construction of three-dimensional model and the implement of the walkthrough drive engine. MultiGen and OpenGVS are selected to be the walkthrough system development platform. The whole system realization from the construction of three-dimensional model to implement of the walkthrough drive engine is discussed particularly.
