A novel meander-line structure implemented with bimorph piezoelectric actuators driven by alternating current power is developed in this article. Via the generated traveling wave, this mechanism is able to transport parts. Dynamic model of the structure as well as motion trajectory and optimal transport feed rate is studied, and also verified by the practical experiment.Copyright Â© 2004 by ASME
