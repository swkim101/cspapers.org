Gap-type conductor stringing and currently existing conventional tension stringing construction technology are not identical, explore two old wires with a new gap-type conductor, which is two-pulling-one wire stringing construction technology. In this paper two-pulling-one running board is designed and manufactured to meet the stringing construction technology. The experiment results show that the system greatly improves the efficiency of the stringing, at the same time reduces construction costs, saves a lot of manpower and time, ensures the construction period, safely and efficiently completes the construction task.
