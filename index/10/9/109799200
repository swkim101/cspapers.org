Pyrite was used to study the electro-generation both the sterile dual battery system and the microbe fuel cell for pyrite-MnO2 in this paper. The Relationship between potential, work output, and current for pyrite in presence of A. ferrooxidans and sterile, showed that the electro-generation trend enhanced in the presence of A. ferrooxidans for pyrite. The Evans graph for pyrite in presence of A. ferrooxidans and sterile showed that with the increase of current, the output potential decreased. The dissolved metal ion in the presence of A. ferrooxidans is nearly 12% higher than that in the absence of A. ferrooxidans; the electro-generative quantity in the former is about 166% more than that in the latter; the transferred charge due to the bacteria is more than that of sterile dual battery process in the last stage of microbe fuel cell.
