It will cause the drop of the acceleration performance and driving comfort if the continuously variable transmission shift too quickly. So Aiming at the shifting problem of continuously variable transmission system, This thesis put forward the method to control shift speed of the continuously variable transmission based on driving intention. By the dynamics analysis of continuously variable transmission system, it does a research on the influence on the motor automobiles acceleration performance and driving comfort, when the ratio changes too fast. According to working practice, analyzing shift way of continuously variable transmission system. Through the above analysis and findings, the method to control shift speed based on driving intention will be designed to make acceleration and driving comfort unified. And by limiting the maximum CVT ratio change rate, the automobile acceleration performance can be further improved.
