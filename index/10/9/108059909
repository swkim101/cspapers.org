Field robots often rely on laser range finders (LRFs) to detect obstacles and navigate autonomously. Despite recent progress in sensing technology and perception algorithms, adverse environmental conditions, such as the presence of smoke, remain a challenging issue for these robots. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to improve laser-based perception applications by anticipating situations when laser data are affected by smoke, using supervised learning and state-of-the-art visual image quality analysis. We propose to train a k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) classifier to recognise situations where a laser scan is likely to be affected by smoke, based on visual data quality features. This method is evaluated experimentally using a mobile robot equipped with LRFs and a visual camera. The strengths and limitations of the technique are identified and discussed, and we show that the method is beneficial if conservative decisions are the most appropriate.
