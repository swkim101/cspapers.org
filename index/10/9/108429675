Since its inception as a meeting from the US Air Force KBSA project in 1986, the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE) has come a long way to become one of the world's premier Software Engineering conferences. The ASE conference brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss foundations, techniques and tools for automating the analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance of large software systems. ASE is celebrating its 25th anniversary in the city of Antwerp, a place that combines a rich and illustrious historical past and a bustling modern economy (as fittingly witnessed by our conference venue, the Meerminne, a sleek modern university facility across the street from 15th-century Sint Jacobus church). This year again, the program features a rich selection of high-quality contributions. Out of 190 submissions, our Program Committee and Expert Review Panels selected 33 papers for presentation as talks and publication as full papers, and 31 for presentation as posters and publication as short papers. The reviews were performed in two rounds, with every accepted paper being reviewed by at least three reviewers. A separate Tool Demonstration Committee selected 18 tools for demonstration and presentation at the conference, out of 43 submissions. ASE also traditionally includes a one-day Doctoral Symposium, where junior researchers can present their work and receive feedback on their research and guidance on future directions from a broad group of advisors. This forum fosters a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research, and contributes to the conference goals through interaction with other researchers and conference events. The program also proposes no less than eight associated workshops and five tutorials.
