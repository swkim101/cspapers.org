Abstract: This chapter describes theoretical, practical and efficient strategies for on-line correction of thermal process deviations during retort sterilization of canned foods. It presents a review of recent developments over the past 10Â years that have further advanced the state of the art in improving food safety, quality and manufacturing efficiency in the canned food industry worldwide. The focus is on retort control systems, and the various approaches that have been taken to help canned food processors accomplish on-line correction of unexpected process deviations, the major cause of lost productivity. Important features of each approach are discussed, along with suggested industry applications that would be appropriate for each method. The chapter concludes with a discussion of future trends to be expected in the industry.
