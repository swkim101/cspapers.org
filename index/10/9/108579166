Extended state observer (ESO) based output-feedback control strategy is proposed for the attitude control of a quadrotor aerial vehicle in this paper. By using ESO technique, the generalized disturbances are estimated from output signals. According to the sliding mode method, the attitude controller with disturbance compensations is proposed for the attitude tracking control of a quadrotor vehicle. The theoretical analysis reveals that all signals in the closed-loop system are ultimately uniformly bounded. The simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed method.
