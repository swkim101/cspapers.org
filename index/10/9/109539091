It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 7th Joint meeting of the European Software Engineering Conference -- ESEC, and the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering Conference -- FSE. This year's conference continues its tradition of being a premier forum for researchers, practitioners, and educators to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, experiences, and challenges in the field of software engineering. Held bi-annually, ESEC/FSE brings together experts from academia and industry to exchange the latest research results and trends, as well as their practical application in all areas of software engineering. 
 
The call for papers attracted 217 submissions from all continents. The program committee accepted 32 papers that cover a variety of topics, including empirical software engineering, specification & verification, analysis & testing, service-orientation, and mining software repositories. In addition, the program includes keynote speeches by Mary Shaw (Carnegie-Mellon University) on "The Challenge of Pervasive Software to the Conventional Wisdom of Software Engineering," Ralf-Peter Schafer (TomTom) on "IQ Routes and HD Traffic - Technology insights about TomTom's time-dynamic navigation concept," and Richard Taylor (University of California, Irvine), recipient of the 2009 ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award, on "Software Architecture: Many Faces, Many Places, Yet a Central Discipline." The conference also features challenge talks, in which visionary ideas in relevant Software Engineering topics are presented. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for software engineering researchers and practitioners.
