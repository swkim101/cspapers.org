This paper mainly based on the coupling relationship between tribological and dynamic behaviors of cylinder liner-piston system to establish dynamics and tribology coupling model of cylinder linerpiston-piston ring, and to analyze the effect of piston skirt profile based on it, providing theoretical basis for determining the effect of piston skirt profiles to piston dynamics and lubrication performance.
