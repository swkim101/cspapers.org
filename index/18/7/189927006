Over the past few decade, smartphone technology has played a vital role in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we proposed a methodology to allow end users to automatically process the medical text image using a camera or enter text manually. Then the system output allows to extract medical concepts, its semantic type and entity type from medical text apply Natural Processing Language techniques from UMLS medical dictionary. The medical text can be a health report, a clinical case, or other kinds of a text containing medically related information. The aim of this kind of methodology of the mobile application is to contribute in the area of natural language processing (NLP), intelligent system and to increase the medical students and bioinformatics researchers interest to quickly accessing information about medical data.
