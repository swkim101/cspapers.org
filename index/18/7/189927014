Voice-enabled AI assistants rely on developers to build every single skill, although many skills share similar functions. We propose a concept and prototype system, \ksystem, to automatically build a set of similar skills in the ecosystem (eco-skills) with one-time teaching from end users. During teaching, a user only needs to demonstrate on the screen in one (native) mobile app and provides natural language (NL) instructions.
