The fingerprinting-based indoor positioning technique requires a database, i.e., a radio map, containing indoor scenes through the training phase. Since that offline phase is labor intensive, numerous studies are underway to minimize the effort. In this paper, we present a concept that applies to a collaborative crowdsourcing method. We designed a system that relies on people and robots moving in the indoor space to construct a radio map. Experiments at two testbeds provide proof of the concept and are the result of the last step of the proposed system.
