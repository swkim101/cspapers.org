4G LTE networks across the world (e.g., United States, Europe, and South Korea) use the same mechanism to broadcast emergency alerts. These alerts include AMBER, severe weather alerts, and the (unblockable) Presidential Alert in the US. We demonstrate the ability to spoof these alerts by forcing any 4G phone in the area of our malicious cell tower to receive and display a fabricated message. This demonstration uses a commercially-available software-defined radio, an LTE base station, and our modifications to the open-source NextEPC and srsLTE libraries to send the Presidential Alert to phones volunteered from the audience.
