This paper builds on the emerging idea of the Local Magnetic Actuation (LMA) system for robotic abdominal surgery, that allows the rigid linkages for the surgical manipulator in minimally invasive surgery to be replaced by magnetic linkages across the abdominal wall. In this paper, the equation of motion for the internal unit, inserted into the abdominal cavity, is derived in all 6 spatial degrees of freedom. Firstly, the resultant magnetic field at the location of the rotor, generated by a source at an arbitrary displacement from the rotor, is modelled. Secondly, the model of the wrench acting on the internal rotor unit generated by the magnetic flux linkage between the above mentioned field and that of the permanent magnet rotor is derived (by Newton Euler approach). The contributions of multiple sources of magnetic field on the forces and moments acting on the internal rotor unit are taken into account by the principle of superposition. The paper then carries out system identification on an experimental set up. Numerical computational and experimental validations were carried out on the magnetic field model and magnetic-torque model, as well as confirming the validity of the principle of superposition for our problem.
