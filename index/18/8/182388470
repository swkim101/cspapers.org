In this position paper, I present and explain the position that what we should study in HCI depends on the objective of the research and its political, social, cultural, technological, and historical context. I outline four principles for selecting research questions and give a personal account of how I have selected research questions using these four principles. The aim with the paper is to generate discussion and advance the understanding of what to study in HCI.
