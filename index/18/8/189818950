Implementing secure Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) is challenging, mainly due to the necessity to persist security metadata along with data. Unlike conventional secure memories, NVM-equipped systems are expected to recover data after crashes and hence security metadata must be recoverable as well. While prior work explored recovery of encryption counters, fewer efforts have been focused on recovering integrity-protected systems. In particular, how to recover Merkle Tree. We observe two major challenges for this. First, recovering parallelizable integrity trees, e.g., Intel's SGX trees, requires very special handling due to inter-level dependency. Second, the recovery time of practical NVM sizes (terabytes are expected) would take hours. Most data centers, cloud systems, intermittent-power devices and even personal computers, are anticipated to recover almost instantly after power restoration. In fact, this is one of the major promises of NVMs. In this paper, we propose Anubis, a novel hardware-only solution that speeds up recovery time by almost 107 times (from 8 hours to only 0.03 seconds). Moreover, we propose a novel and elegant way to recover inter-level dependent trees, as in Intel's SGX. Most importantly, while ensuring recoverability of one of the most challenging integrity-protection schemes among others, Anubis incurs performance overhead that is only 2% higher than the state-of-the-art scheme, Osiris, which takes hours to recover systems with general Merkle Tree and fails to recover SGX-style trees.
