The use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has steadily increased since 2010. Bluetooth specification 4.2 defined only one data rate, 1 Mb/s. However, Bluetooth specification 5 released in 2016 specifies 2 Mb/s and coded PHY for higher throughput and for more stable transmission, respectively. In addition, this version of specification defines transmission power from -20 dBm to 20 dBm. In this paper, we propose AdaptaBLE, an algorithm that selects the data rate and transmission power of BLE by considering link stability and energy consumption. We implement AdaptaBLE on real devices and measure its performance. As a result, we confirm that AdaptaBLE successfully lowers energy consumption while keeping the link stable.
