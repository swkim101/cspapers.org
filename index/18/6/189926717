Voice-user interface (VUI) has become an integral component in modern personal devices (\textite.g., smartphones, voice assistant) by fundamentally evolving the information sharing between the user and device. Acoustic sensing for VUI is designed to sense all acoustic objects; however, the existing VUI mechanism can only offer low-quality speech sensing. This is due to the audible and inaudible interference from complex ambient noise that limits the performance of VUI by causing denial-of-service (DoS) of user requests. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to enable noise-resistant speech sensing in VUI for executing critical tasks with superior efficiency and precision in robust environments. To this end, we investigate the feasibility of employing radio-frequency signals, such as millimeter wave (mmWave) for sensing the noise-resistant voice of an individual. We first perform an in-depth study behind the rationale of voice generation and resulting vocal vibrations. From the obtained insights, we presentWaveEar, an end-to-end noise-resistant speech sensing system.WaveEar comprises a low-cost mmWave probe to localize the position of the speaker among multiple people and direct the mmWave signals towards the near-throat region of the speaker for sensing his/her vocal vibrations. The received signal, containing the speech information, is fed to our novel deep neural network for recovering the voice through exhaustive extraction. Our experimental evaluation under real-world scenarios with 21 participants shows the effectiveness ofWaveEar to precisely infer the noise-resistant voice and enable a pervasive VUI in modern electronic devices.
