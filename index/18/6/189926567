can enable futuristic applications including many Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and cloud gaming applications on resource constraint mobile devices. While RGR requires a high-level of networking bandwidth for seamless servicing, emerging high-speed communication technologies such as IEEE 802.11ax and millimeter wavebased communications are expected to provide high-bandwidth and low-latency networking performance. Thus, they can potentially resolve the transmission latency constraint, which is one of the most tricky obstacles to resolve prior to applying various RGR applications in the real world.
