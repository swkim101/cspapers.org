In spite of the evolution of Augmented Reality~(AR) technology, it is not wide spread in everyday life. There may be many reasons, but one of the reasons is that it has been developed for very specific users, such as researchers and professionals. To overcome this problem, Grubert et al. proposed the pervasive AR. It is not limited to a specific situation, but is usable in various instances and providing continuous and flexible AR experience. The AR browser is the example of utilizing pervasive AR. The AR browser understands the context of the user and provides corresponding information. However, if the corresponding information to the context of user cannot reach the user in time due to massive data transmission, unexpected network congestion, poor service quality or signal strength, it cannot be guaranteed to be continuous. This leads to a degradation of the user experience, and it cannot support pervasive AR. This paper presents the Progressive Augmented Reality, the way which quickly send incomplete, yet informative, response about the user's current context rather than wait for sending complete information to the user. The concept of Progressive Augmented Reality comes from Progressive Data Science. Our system is aware of network quality by collecting various network health parameters. According to the network status quality, it divides the chunk information to the optimal number and transmits the one that have the highest priority among the divided information. By conducting the above process iteratively, all the divided information is updated. Our client-side system utilizes Android ARCore and has been tested on Google Pixel 2XL.
