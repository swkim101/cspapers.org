In this demo, we showcase how to stream 8K 360Â° video to commod- ity mobile devices without pre-processing or viewpoint prediction using our Freedom system. Users can freely select the viewpoint, zoom in and zoom out to enjoy the full quality of the 8K resolu- tion using any Samsung GearVR compatible smartphone. We also present how our system works internally to dynamically adjust margin size to accommodate to network latency and how our ap- proach can save up to 80% bandwidth compared to streaming full video to mobile devices.
