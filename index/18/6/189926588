The ACM International Conference on Distributed and Eventbased Systems (ACM DEBS) Grand Challenge is aiming to build faster and more accurate distributed and event based systems. In 2018, the goal of the Grand Challenge was to make predictions for vessels' destinations and arrival times. In our previous work [3], as a participant of the Grand Challenge, we adopted a grid-based Bayesian inference model to yield a decent result. However, we found that a number of serious outliers in the real-world data may adversely affect predictions. This paper introduces our attempts to enhance the performance of the previous model for predicting the destination and arrival time of a vessel issued by ACM DEBS GC 2018, by proposing an outlier detection method based on clustering and refning training data.
