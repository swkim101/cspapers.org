Backscatter communication enables wireless transmissions at orders of magnitude lower power consumption when compared to conventional radio transceivers. This introduces novel opportunities for battery-free and ubiquitous sensing. We take advantage of backscatter communication to enable networked utensils. We imagine a scenario where such utensils can provide essential information about the state of the food or the beverage; for instance, the temperature or the quality of food contained in the utensils. We propose flex sensors, to achieve this capability, by augmenting utensils with flexible and inexpensive battery-free sensors that can communicate wirelessly. We demonstrate our efforts by designing a smart cup that tracks the temperature of the beverage.
