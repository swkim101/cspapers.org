Simulation is a method of predicting future events and system states through analysis of the state model of the system over time. It can support to make decisions of mobile terminals (ex. threat assessment in an autonomous vehicle) operating in various situations under uncertain reality. Unlike a single simulation, which is executed in one mobile terminal using data collected from the same terminal, a multiple simulation, which supports to make sophisticated decisions through data collected from multiple terminals, is not only complicated to implement but also requires a large number of computations and has network delay problem in collecting data from plenty of data sources [1]. Consequently, it is impossible to implement in a single mobile terminal.
