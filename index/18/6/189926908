What if the window of our cars is a magic window, which transforms dark views outside of the window at night into bright ones as we can see in the daytime? In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of implementing such a magic window, addressing two important requirements: (1) the quality of transformed images (from the nighttime to the daytime) and (2) the frame rate of transformed image stream. We present our initial ideas to address the problem and report preliminary results towards the experience of daytime driving at night.
