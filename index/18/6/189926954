The VWorld Data Center provides high quality spatial information data with 3D terrains and buildings of major cities in Korea. In this paper, we proposed the visualization method for the city model using VWorld data. Anyone can use through the VWorld 3D map service site. We expect that our platform can be used to visualize 3D spatial information for various applications.
