In this poster, we present our recent work, a wearable system for achieving real-time 3D arm skeleton. We have coped with the major challenge that the skeleton of each arm is determined from the locations of the elbow and wrist, whereas a wearable device only senses a single point from the wrist. Result shows that the potential solution space is huge. This underconstrained nature fundamentally challenges the achievement of accurate and real-time arm skeleton tracking. In this study, we propose Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state reorganization and hierarchical search two methods to improve the heavyweight computation of the state-of-art arm tracking model and achieve real-time tracking even on mobile phone.
