Real-time remote interaction has become easier and richer powered by recent advances in mobile computing and communication. A number of research have been explored on enriching family interaction by augmenting an interaction channel with asynchronous communication [6] or additional sensory stimuli [5]. However, it is still far from achieving a sense of living together for family members involuntarily living apart, especially in context-aware impromptu interaction. For families living together, it is trivial to naturally perceive behavioral and situational contexts of the other and initiate a relevant interaction intuitively. For example, a wife starts a casual chat with asking her husband what he is going to cook when she sees him going to the kitchen or hears a simmering sound.
