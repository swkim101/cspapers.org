Retrofit could be still expensive solution to existing building. However, with IoT(Internet of Things) environment sensors, it is possible to build a powerful intelligent building monitoring system with relatively low costs. The IoT environment sensor can analyze the IAQ(Indoor Air Quality), occupancy, and comfort level of the individual space by integrating temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, sound, illuminance, organic compound, human body detection and IR sensor in the individual space of the building. In addition, because it supports Wifi mesh network, it can be easily installed without performing construction for retrofit in existing building, and real time monitoring can be performed. In this paper, we introduce the result of applied the IoT environment sensors to three buildings and visualization interface based on the result of analysis and real environment sensing
