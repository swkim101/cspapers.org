Because disaster situations can cause damage to people and property, fast recognition and Countermeasure is important. IoT and MR, the technologies that have become popular nowadays, expected to play a key role in this domain. In this paper, we will introduce MR and IoT Convergence Platform with AI Support for Disaster Recognition This platform can recognize a disaster situation with sensors and AI system, and report to the user's MR devices. Also, we build a prototype using OneM2M-based Mobius Platform, Microsoft Hololens, and CNN-based AI Camera for proving feasibility.
