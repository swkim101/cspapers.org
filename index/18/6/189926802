We present Surface++, which leverages our previous work SATURN, a self-powered flexible acoustic sensor, and ZEUSSS, a passive wireless sound communication technique using analog backscatter, to create a scalable and self-sustainable wireless sound sensing surface. Our new prototype allows for large area acoustic sensing using modular fabrication techniques with the promise of being fully printable. A single small Surface++ patch can be used to extend voice and gesture input for everyday surfaces, while our more sensitive Surface++ modular array allows for large-area context sensing and localization.
