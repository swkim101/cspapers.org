Most present day fitness trackers and smart watches measure critical health indicators such as heart rate, SpO2 concentration, sleep cycle etc. but they fail in their ability to track health indicators at the molecular level. This has attracted rapid research in the development of chemical sensors which can non-invasively measure analytes available in raw biofluids such as sweat, tears and urine. Of all the available raw bio-fluids, sweat can be obtained non-intrusively and readily, and thus is the most suitable choice for continuous real-time monitoring of indicators at a molecular level.
