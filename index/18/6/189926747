This paper presents VisIoT, a system that tracks the location of a wireless transmitter in IoT devices and displays it in the screen of an AR device such as smart glasses and tablet. The proposed system benefits existing IoT systems by enabling intuitive interaction between a user and IoT devices and further enhancing visualization of the data collected from IoT sensors. VisIoT achieves them through a combination of wireless sensing and camera motion tracking. By using the azimuth and elevation angles between the wireless transmitter and the camera-equipped mobile device, VisIoT can instantly identify the location of the IoT device from the camera image. This paper introduces novel azimuth and elevation estimation algorithms that leverage the phase difference of the signals from two antennas together with the tracked camera rotation. We prototype VisIoT using a tablet PC and a USRP software radio, and develop a software that tracks and visualizes the location of ZigBee nodes in real time. The evaluation results show that VisIoT can accurately track the nodes with the median position error of 6%.
