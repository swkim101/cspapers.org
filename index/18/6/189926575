In Japan, more than 1,000 earthquakes occur annually, thus causing enormous damage. However, in areas facing the ocean, the risks of secondary disasters due to tsunamis are extremely high. We conducted research the on an emergency disaster prevention system for transmitting tsunami information using ultra-low- frequency sound sensors and tide-level gauges. The system conveyed the information to members in the crisis management staff for the area concerned, and we assumed that the staff in charge made evacuation recommendations to the citizens of the area based on the information. In addition, when a tsunami occurs, there is a high possibility that an existing infrastructure cannot be used because an earthquake has already occurred. In this research, we develop a disaster prevention system using tsunami information using long-distance wireless communication technology, MAD-SS.
