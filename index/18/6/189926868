The connected and autonomous vehicles are expected to rely heavily on connectivity to exchange data and computation services with other vehicles and remote infrastructure including roadside units and other edge infrastructure to increase their immediate view, which leads to greater safety, coordination and more comfortable experience for their human occupants. In order for vehicles to obtain data, compute and other services from other vehicles or road-side infrastructure, it is important to be able to make micropayments for those services and for the services to run seamlessly despite the challenges posed by mobility and ephemeral interactions with a dynamic set of neighboring devices. We present MOTIVE, a trusted and decentralized framework that allows vehicles to make peer-to-peer micropayments for data, compute and other services obtained from other vehicles or road-side infrastructure within radio range. The framework utilizes distributed ledger technologies including smart contracts to enable autonomous operation and trusted interactions between vehicles and nearby entities.
