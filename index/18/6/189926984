As personal interactive devices become more ingrained into our daily lives, it becomes more important to understand how seamless interaction with those devices can be fostered. A typical mechanism to interface with a personal device is via a touch screen, in which users use their fingertip or stylus to scroll, type, select, or otherwise control device usage. Touch-based techniques, however, can become restrictive or inconvenient under a variety of scenarios. For example, personal devices such as phones or tablets are continuously increasing in size, making one-handed interaction difficult because one cannot easily hold the phone and touch the screen (with the thumb) at the same time with one hand. Therefore, in this demo, we present a new technique to interact with personal devices in which the screen and touch screen interactions can adapt to a user's grip or current touch constraints.
