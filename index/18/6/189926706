By the infrastructure of cellular network changing, the conventional methods has became not be adequate. As an alternative, a probabilistic model for dynamic input aiming on signals from multiple cellular station is proposed in this study, and the feasibility was verified. The result from the experiment can be shown a little petty, but if one experiments in a better environment and utilizes LTE and 5G network, about 20~30m of the positioning error can be expected.
