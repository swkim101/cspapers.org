Most of the currently developed indoor localization techniques depend on some kind of sensory input, utilizing, among others, WiFi-signals (e.g. [2]), smartphone sensors (e.g. [4]) or Bluetooth beacons (e.g. [1]). However, each of these systems has its own downsides, such as a lack of infrastructure, power consumption and proneness to noise. These are the reasons no such system is currently able to be truly considered as the "GPS for the indoors", as they cannot provide worldwide coverage.
