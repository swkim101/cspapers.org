We propose a mobile system, called PotholeEye, for automatically monitoring the surface of a roadway and providing real-time analysis of images, with the specific goal of detecting the pavement distress. PotholeEye pre-processes the images, extracts features, and classifies the distress into a variety of types, while the road manager is driving. We have tested PotholeEye on real highway involving real settings, a camera, a mini computer, a GPS receiver, and so on, and have shown how we can effectively maintain the pavement distress.
