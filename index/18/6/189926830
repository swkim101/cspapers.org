We propose TITAN, a tool that enables efficient testing of IoT applications during a development process. TITAN is designed to allow developers to execute and verify IoT applications in a development environment without being constrained by the physical environment and user behaviors required to test the application logic being developed. We present the initial design and prototype of TITAN and the preliminary study to evaluate its usefulness.
