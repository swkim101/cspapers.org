Wearable health monitoring has become a very familiar term in today'sworld. One of the most popular means ofwearable sensing is photoplethysmogram (PPG). Due to its unobtrusive and ubiquitous nature, it is gaining popularity among people everywhere. Due to the ease of use, the utility of such technology is increasing day by day. However, in theworld of researchers, the accurate estimation of heart rate (HR) in presence of motion artefacts remains an unsolved problem due to the susceptibility of PPG signals to corruption by motion artefacts. The way in which a person fastens the device on the wrist plays an important role in the acquisition of signal from the device. While there are various research works going on in this field, there is always a trade-off between accuracy and complexity of algorithm and hardware resources. Also, in such scenarios where the sensor gets misplaced due to movements, there might be no PPG signal component available in the acquired signal data. In such cases the sophisticated denoising algorithms make no sense.
