Voice-controlled smart speakers are popular due to Amazon Echo and Google Home. Though many smart speakers have appeared in the market, we do not know the exact performance of smart speakers. In particular, when we call a smart speaker to issue a voice command, we recognize that the smart speaker is ready when it turns its LED lamps on. The wake-up response time is important for improving user experience. Therefore, we have to measure the wake-up response time, which requires the video analysis of smart speaker LED's status for the voice command. In this work, we present a smart speaker wake-up response time measurement method with a camera. We record video files with camera while testing a smart speaker and analyze image similarity to find a wake-up event. For this purpose, we use the Google Inception-v3 model to improve the accuracy of detecting the image change of a small area.
