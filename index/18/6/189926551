It is difficult for shoppers to estimate the amount of cost spent while shopping offline. Existing mobile platforms can be used to assist offline shoppers, but there still remain questions about the usability and affordability of such platforms. To reduce this gap, we propose SEEjang, a prototype for providing users with a smart, easy, and economical experience with offline shopping. We developed the application through a design thinking process to maximize consumer satisfaction with offline shopping.
