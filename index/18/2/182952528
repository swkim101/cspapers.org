We study the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA) for sampling from a probability distribution $\nu = e^{-f}$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We prove a convergence guarantee in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence assuming $\nu$ satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality and the Hessian of $f$ is bounded. Notably, we do not assume convexity or bounds on higher derivatives. We also prove convergence guarantees in Renyi divergence of order $q > 1$ assuming the limit of ULA satisfies either the log-Sobolev or Poincare inequality.
