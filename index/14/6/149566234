Abstract--In this paper we present a model able to serve in validating either functional or non-functional properties of the hard real time systems. We firstly introduce the timed SystemC waiting state automata (TWSA) that will serve in the modeling of the hardware. TWSA guarantees both critical functional properties about the interactions between concurrent processes and non-functional properties especially the time constraints. Timing properties need to be carefully addressed as they are important in performance and safety verification of real time embedded systems. A method which starts from a SystemC code and ultimately provides a tight execution time upper bound of the code running on the modeled system is also presented.
