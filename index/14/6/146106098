Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) implementations are typically based upon integration of multiple sensors. One of the most common configurations for SLAM is the combination of odometry and range sensors. However, these sensors usually capture measurements at different times and thus introduce additional time synchronisation error when their data are fused together directly. As a robot moves faster, this error becomes more significant. The overall aim is to allow the robot to travel quickly and yet still be capable of obtaining accurate localisation and mapping results. This paper presents techniques for time synchronisation of multiple sensors taking into account clock drifts, inaccuracy of timestamps, and other unexpected communication and operating system delays. This paper also introduces a method of calibrating odometry and range sensors to ensure an accurate data fusion. Experimental results with and without synchronisation are shown to illustrate and validate the improvements.
