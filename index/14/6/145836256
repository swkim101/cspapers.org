Introduction Diabetes mellitus Type II (T2DM) is a common chronic disease of the endocrine system in which the pancreas no longer produces enough insulin to metabolize blood glucose or the body becomes less sensitive to insulin (SDG, 2015). Over one in four of the 65 years and older adults in the U.S. population are estimated to have T2DM resulting in 9.4% of the U.S. population (CDC, 2017). In Switzerland, almost 500,000 people suffer from T2DM, which is approximately 4.9% of the male Swiss population and 4.2% of the female Swiss population (SDG, 2015). To manage blood glucose levels and to reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, vision loss, amputations), patients need to follow medical recommendations for healthy eating, physical activity, and medication adherence in their everyday life (CDC, 2017). Evidence suggests that for married adults, illness management is mainly shared with their spouses (Seidel et al., 2012; Rintala et al., 2013). Social support among spouses is associated with healthier habits among diabetes patients (Miller et al, 2005). Additionally, spousal support has been shown to have beneficial effects on well-being or affect (feelings) (Prati and Pietrantoni, 2010; Iida et al., 2010). Given that there is some relationship between social support and affect, through affect detection, we may have a proxy for received social support from spouses. Considering the health benefits of social support especially for chronic disease management, affect detection could be used to inform just-in-time adaptive interventions through for example a digital coach. Also, this digital coach could adapt its communication style based on the detected affect.
