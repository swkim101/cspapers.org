Abstract Commercially available eye tracking solutions are designedto monitor one person at a time. Increasing interest in theinterpersonal functions of gaze in social neuroscience hasbrought up the question of how to analyse gaze behaviourin ongoing social interactions and how to creategaze-contingent social stimuli [6]. In the current paper wepresent the implementation of a dual eye tracking systemwhich allows to simultaneously measure two participants,engaged in gaze-based interactions while providing fullexperimental real time control over the behavioural data.

Mutual gaze plays a critical role in regulatingsocial interactions by providing information and expressingemotions.
