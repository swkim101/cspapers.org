I n this paper implementation of Model Predictive Controller on mobile robot was explained. The conducted experiments show effectiveness of the proposed method on control of the mobile robot. Furthermore the effects of the model parameters such as control horizon, prediction horizon, weighting factor and signal filter band on the controller performance were studied. Finally, a comparison between the designed MPC controller and PID and adaptive controllers was presented demonstrating superior performance of the Model Predictive Controllers.
