An adaptable grid based navigation and control strategy is adopted to eliminate potential colli-sions among robots. Unexpected obstacles are handled and the speed of individual robot is maintained using the nodeordering technique. The proposed navigation control and synchronization mechanism is scalable and can be easily extended for multi-cell large environment. The obstacles information is gathered through local information by the robots for better planning of the navigation. The system collaborates with the existing surveillance systems in case of additional visual information is necessary. The interaction with the surveillance system is minimized to reduce potential overhead. The proposed methodology is evaluated for a large-scale simulation with multiple robots.
