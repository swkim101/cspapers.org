This paper presents the development of an annotation scheme for the syntax/semantics interface that may feed into the generation of (ISO-)TimeML style annotations. The annotation scheme accounts for compositionality and calculates the semantic contribution of tense and aspect. The annotation builds on output from syntactic parsers and links information from morphosyntactic cues to a representation grounded in formal semantics/pragmatics that may be used to automatize the process of annotating tense/aspect and temporal relations
