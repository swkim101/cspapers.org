We used content analysis of in-app driver survey responses, customer support tickets, and tweets, and face-to-face interviews of DHH Uber drivers to better understand the DHH driver experience. Here we describe challenges DHH drivers experience and how they address those difficulties via Uber's accessibility features and their own workarounds. We also identify and discuss design and product opportunities to improve the DHH driver experience on Uber.
