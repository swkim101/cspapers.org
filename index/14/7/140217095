Students and hobbyists build embedded systems that combine sensing, actuation and microcontrollers on solderless breadboards. To help students debug such circuits, experienced teachers apply visual inspection, targeted measurements, and circuit modifications to diagnose and localize the problem(s). However, experienced helpers may not always be available to review student projects in person. To enable remote debugging of circuit problems, we introduce Heimdall, a remote electronics workbench that allows experts to visually inspect a student's circuit; perform measurements; and to re-wire and inject test signals. These interactions are enabled by an actuated inspection camera; an augmented breadboard that enables flexible configuration of row connectivity and measurement/injection lines; and a web-based UI that teachers can use to perform measurements through interaction with the captured images. We demonstrate that common issues arising in embedded electronics classes can be successfully diagnosed remotely and report on preliminary user feedback from teaching assistants who frequently debug circuits.
