This article reports on work in progress on UK government policy on the creative industries. It argues that the central, animating idea of ‘creativity’ has moved centre stage over the past decade, as Labour Party policy has evolved during its period in power since May 1997. The central contention is that from being a discourse that itself emerged from an earlier discourse on the cultural industries, ‘creativity’ has subsequently been elaborated to become a virtual doctrine, and is now uncritically reproduced across government reports and the wider policy community, including most academics. To illustrate the argument, reports dealing with the reengineering of business, the refocusing of education, and the next stage of firing up the ‘creative economy’ are all analysed. Indications of forthcoming work on this research project are given in conclusion.
