Conformance testing is a critical problem of workflow systems. Indeed, the execution engine must satisfy the specification of the workflows coming from the end users. The problem of testing is un-decidable in the general case. The difficulty is thus to provide a heuristic that minimizes the suite of test sequences. Despite many theoretical works exist in the literature, concrete solutions are really missing. This paper describes a software solution to this problem. It is implemented as a standalone component that can take a workflow specification as input and gives the test sequences as outputs. That approach enforces workflows coming from the Intraqual environment of Qualnet but it can serve as a general solution for testing any other workflow engine.
