This paper revisits the real-time scheduling problem recently introduced by Haque, Aydin and Zhu (2017). In this challenging problem, task redundancy ensures a given level of reliability while incurring a significant energy cost. By carefully setting processing frequencies, allocating tasks to processors and ordering task executions, we improve on the previous state-of-the-art approach with an average gain in energy of 20%. Furthermore, we establish the first complexity results for specific instances of the problem.
