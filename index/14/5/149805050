The design of controllers that operate in dynamical systems to perform specified tasks has traditionally been manual. Machine learning algorithms enable data-driven generation of controllers, also called policies or programs, and differ in how a user may convey what task the controller should perform. In Imitation Learning (IL), the user demonstrates a supervisor control signal in a set of execution traces, and the objective is to train from this data a controller that performs the computation correctly on unseen inputs.
