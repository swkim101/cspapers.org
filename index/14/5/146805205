The problem of finding and grasping a target object in a cluttered, uncertain environment, target object search, is a common and important problem in robotics. One key challenge is the uncertainty of locating and recognizing each object in a cluttered environment due to noisy perception and occlusions. Furthermore, the uncertainty in localization makes manipulation difficult and uncertain. To cope with these challenges, we formulate the target object search task as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), enabling the robot to reason about perceptual and manipulation uncertainty while searching. To further address the manipulation difficulty, we propose Parameterized Action Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning (PA-POMCP), an algorithm that evaluates manipulation actions by taking into account the effect of the robotâ€™s current belief on the success of the action execution. In addition, a novel run-time initial belief generator and a state value estimator are introduced in this paper to facilitate the PA-POMCP algorithm. Our experiments show that our methods solve the target object search task in settings where simpler methods either take more object movements or fail.
