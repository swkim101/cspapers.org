Japanese word processor(JWP) presents a typewriter which can easily handle Japanese documents with newly developped and quite different way from conventional Japanese typewriters. Japanese documents consist of more than two thousand letters (Kanjis: Chinese characters, Kanas: Japanese alphabet, alphanumerics, and so on). The conventional Japanese typewriter is equipped with all these letters. It means that type writing is very difficult and typing speed is low. JWP overcame these difficulties with Kana-to-Kanji translation technology.
