Load balancing systems, comprising a central dispatcher and a scheduling policy at each server, are widely used in practice, and their response time has been extensively studied in the theoretical literature. While much is known about the scenario where the scheduling at the servers is First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), to minimize mean response time we must use Shortest-Remaining-Processing-Time (SRPT) scheduling at the servers. Much less is known about dispatching polices when SRPT scheduling is used. Unfortunately, traditional dispatching policies that are used in practice in systems with FCFS servers often have poor performance in systems with SRPT servers. In this paper, we devise a simple fix that can be applied to any dispatching policy. This fix, called guardrails, ensures that the dispatching policy yields optimal mean response time under heavy traffic when used in a system with SRPT servers. Any dispatching policy, when augmented with guardrails, becomes heavy-traffic optimal. Our results yield the first analytical bounds on mean response time for load balancing systems with SRPT scheduling at the servers.
