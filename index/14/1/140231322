A new form of symbolic layout for integrated circuits is coupled with a mask compaction procedure which removes excess space while guaranteeing that all design rules are met. Tradeoffs between X and Y compaction are made based on critical path information. Two types of compaction are used to minimize mask area and computer run-time. Additional procedures reduce mask area by inserting jogs at strategic locations in the layout. A partitioned data base is used to store mask data in a hierarchical manner. The symbolic layout and mask compaction procedures require only 30 to 50 percent of the time traditionally needed to do equivalent hand layouts.
