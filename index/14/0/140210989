We treat a program as an object of manipulation, determine items of program constancy, and simplify the program based on the constancy. Some motivation for program manipulation is presented, along with two examples of “higher level optimization” written in an Algol-like language. A collection of program transformations and a model of the compilation process in terms of source-to-source transformations are presented. Finally a description of the application of these ideas to an existing programming language is given.
