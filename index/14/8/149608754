Received Jun 2 2017 Revised Aug 4, 2017 Accepted Aug 18, 2017 This work focuses on Model based Predictive Control (MPC) for photovoltaic-wind hybrid energy system connected to electrical grid. Several benefits are offered by this method such as robustness against a parameter variations, minimum output current distortion and excellent reference tracking. In order to minimize the cost function or the error between the predicted values and their references, MPC-based algorithm permit to select and apply the optimal voltage vector. Simulation results under Psim environment show a fast dynamic behavior of hybrid system with minimal errors, accuracy and usefulness of the considered control approach. Keyword:
