In this paper we propose a new model for sequential manipulation tasks that also considers robot dynamics and time-variant environments. From this model we automatically derive constraint-based controllers and use them as steering functions in a kinodynamic manipulation planner. The resulting plan is not a trajectory but a sequence of controllers that react online to disturbances. We validated our approach in simulation and on a real robot. In the experiments our approach plans and executes dual-robot manipulation tasks with online collision avoidance and reactions to estimates of object poses.
