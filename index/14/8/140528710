There has been a significant increase in research focusing on the psychological aspects of ACL injury over the last decade (Bianco, 2001; Carson & Polman, 2008; Perrin & Schulz, 2005). This chapter provides an overview of the main findings of the psychological response to ACL injury and rehabilitation, providing recommendations for those involved with the rehabilitation and subsequent return to competition. The debilitating effects of ACL injury and the restrictive nature of some ACL rehabilitation protocols present a different dimension to the psychological aspects, compared to those suffering alternate injuries. This chapter discusses the coping responses of athletes to reconstructive surgery; development of motivation during the rehabilitation process; and factors to assist a successful return to competition. The main findings highlight social support and instrumental coping aid the psychological response to surgery; increased autonomy and control can be beneficial during rehabilitation; and physical competence and goal setting facilitating successful return to competition. Those involved with the rehabilitation may benefit from providing a comprehensive explanation of the injury and rehabilitation program to the injured athlete, which can increase self-regulation and perceived control, facilitating successful return to sport.
