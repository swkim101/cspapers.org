We received 35 submissions from Australia, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, India, Italy, Qatar, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States covering a broad range of topics. Several demo submissions have been evaluated regarding demonstrability, relevancy, novelty, and quality and we selected 19 demonstrations for being presented during the conference. One major evaluation criterion was the attractiveness of the demo proposal for the audience.
