—Broadly deﬁned as the Internet of Things (IoT), the growth of commodity devices that integrate physical processes with digital connectivity has changed the way we live, play, and work. To date, the traditional approach to securing IoT has treated devices individually. However, in practice, it has been recently shown that the interactions among devices are often the real cause of safety and security violations. In this paper, we present I O TG UARD , a dynamic, policy-based enforcement system for IoT, which protects users from unsafe and insecure device states by monitoring the behavior of IoT and trigger-action platform apps. I O TG UARD operates in three phases: (a) implementation of a code instrumentor that adds extra logic to an app’s source code to collect app’s information at runtime, (b) storing the apps’ information in a dynamic model that represents the runtime execution behavior of apps, and (c) identifying IoT safety and security policies, and enforcing relevant policies on the dynamic model of individual apps or sets of interacting apps. We demonstrate I O TG UARD on 20 ﬂawed apps and ﬁnd that I O TG UARD correctly enforces 12 of the 12 policy violations. In addition, we evaluate I O TG UARD on 35 SmartThings IoT and 30 IFTTT trigger-action platform market apps executed in a simulated smart home. I O TG UARD enforces 11 unique policies and blocks 16 states in six (17.1%) SmartThings and ﬁve (16.6%) IFTTT apps. I O TG UARD imposes only 17.3% runtime overhead on an app and 19.8% for ﬁve interacting apps. Through this effort, we introduce a rigorously grounded system for enforcing correct operation of IoT devices through systematically identiﬁed IoT policies, demonstrating the effectiveness and value of monitoring IoT apps with tools such as I O TG UARD .
