A novel noise suppression scheme for speech signals is proposed which is based on a neurophysiologically-motivated estimation of the local signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in different frequency channels. For SNR-estimation, the input signal is transformed into so-called Amplitude Modulation Spectrograms (AMS), which represent both spectral and temporal characteristics of the respective analysis frame, and which imitate the representation of modulation frequencies in higher stages of the mammalian auditory system. A neural network is used to analyse AMS patterns generated from noisy speech and estimates the local SNR. Noise suppression is achieved by attenuating frequency channels according to their SNR. The noise suppression algorithm is evaluated in speaker-independent digit recognition experiments and compared to noise suppression by Spectral Subtraction.
