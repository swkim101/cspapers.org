Within the limbs of typical animals, there exist bi-articular muscles crossing two joints. It is known that the bi-articular muscles of the felid play an important role in the locomotion. Also the muscle-tendon complex, composed of the gastrocnemius muscle and the Achilles' tendon that cross the knee joint and the ankle joint contributes much to the movements such as running and jumping particularly. Besides, because the muscle-tendon complex has the function for absorbing shocking, it is utilized for soft landing from high places. To achieve high performance for jumping and landing motion like cats, we are developing robot legs inspired by the bi-articular muscle-tendon complex of cats. The leg consists of hip, knee and ankle joints. For the knee and ankle joints, a four-bar linkage mechanism with one elastic linkage, in which the knee joint is driven by an electric rotary motor and the ankle joint is passive, is applied. By this mechanism, basic functions of the bi-articular muscle-tendon complex of felids like cats can be realized and the performance for jumping and landing can be improved. In this paper, the new leg mechanism is described. Moreover, a prototype of a pair of the hind legs of the quadruped robot using the new mechanism has been developed. The results of jumping and landing experiments are shown to validate the effectiveness of the mechanism.
