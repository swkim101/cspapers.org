In this paper I argue that empirical analysis of algorithms is important but also difficult and requires a place in our curricula. I discuss how I planned to include coverage of this topic through lectures, discussions and practical work and the approach that I took in the Honours Analysis of Algorithms topic at the University of the Witwatersrand in 2001. I then discuss the results of a survey conducted on the Honours class and suggest some improvements for 2002.
