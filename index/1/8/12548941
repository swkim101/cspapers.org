Control of the exerted force on objects as well as the position of the actuator during a cell characterization operation has an essential role in achieving an efficient performance. In such operations, any undesired applied force could degrade the efficiency or make damages to the object. A challenging problem associated with application to cell characterization using a piezoelectric actuator is to design a suitable force-position switching control law and also to deal with nonlinear hysteretic behavior of such actuators. The main concern in this operation is to provide a smooth switching transition between position and force control modes. A modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) operator and its inverse are utilized for both identification and real time compensation of the hysteresis nonlinear behavior. By proposing an appropriate force-position switching control approach, the smooth transition between these two modes is guaranteed. The stability of each controller as well as the switching system is demonstrated analytically. Experimental results depict that the proposed approach achieves precise force-position control within each modes and also the switching remains smooth.
