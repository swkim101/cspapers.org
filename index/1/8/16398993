Equivalence checking and functional correction are important steps ensuring design correctness. Direct verification of large industrial designs is challenging and often requires a divide-and-conquer approach. The 2015 CAD Contest at ICCAD poses the challenge of large-scale equivalence checking and functional correction. This paper reports our work in the competition. An algorithm to identify cut-points in both equivalent and inequivalent circuit pairs is proposed for design partitioning. To obtain high quality cuts, we take into consideration their proximity information in cone sizes and circuit depths. Experiments on the contest benchmarks show our method achieves top quality results among all contestants.
