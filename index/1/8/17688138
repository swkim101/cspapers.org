In this paper, we discuss a software tool we have developed for use in undergraduate DBMS courses, that provides: (i) a web-enabled database set up and administration facility for faculty use, and (ii) web-based database projects that may be assigned to students.We discuss the motivation for our work and the objectives underlying the design of the tool. The significance of our work is two-fold. First, it should help the instructor in the set up, management, and monitoring of student database accounts. Second, it provides the students with a feel for the organization and use of contemporary web-enabled database applications.
