The ever-growing number of cores in Chip Multi-Processors (CMP) brings a renewed interest in stream programming to solve the programmability issues raised by massively parallel architectures. Stream programming languages are flourishing (StreaMIT, Brook, âˆ‘C, etc.). Nonetheless, their execution support have not yet received enough attention, in particular regarding the new generation of many-cores.
 In embedded software, a lightweight solution can be implemented as a specialized library, but a dedicated micro-kernel offers a more flexible solution. We propose to explore the latter way with a Logical Vector Time based execution model, for CMP architectures with on-chip shared memory.
