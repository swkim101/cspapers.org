A first course in computer science that loosely follows the Computing Curricula 2001 report is described. This course blends theory and practice, highlights algorithm design, introduces a modest amount of imperative programming, and uses an Internet algorithmics theme to tie the topics together and keep the course both challenging and interesting to those with and without previous computing experience.
