The problem of knowledge representation has been extensively addressed in the information systems field and there has been a wide range of suggestions for capturing semantics. A number of systems and methodologies have been proposed. Most seem to suffer from a variety of problems which make representation difficult, e.g. mixing of type and instances, too many and complex structures. Representation languages which permit a graphical form are becoming more widely accepted under the motivation of being able to see the data structures which exist. However the semantics are somewhat limited with, for example, few integrity constraints being represented. In this paper we show how a conceptual schema language with a graphical form can be extended to permit a wider class of semantics to be represented.
