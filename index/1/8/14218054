We present a locally reactive algorithm to construct arbitrary shapes with amorphous materials. The goal is to provide methods for robust robotic construction in unstructured, cluttered terrain, where deliberative approaches with pre-fabricated construction elements are difficult to apply. Amorphous materials provide a simple way to interface with existing obstacles, as well as irregularly shaped previous depositions. The local reactive nature of these algorithms allows robots to recover from disturbances, operate in dynamic environments, and provides a way to work with scalable robot teams.
