As consumer depth sensors become widely available, estimating scene flow from RGBD sequences has received increasing attention. Although the depth information allows the recovery of 3D motion from a single view, it poses new challenges. In particular, depth boundaries are not well-aligned with RGB image edges and therefore not reliable cues to localize 2D motion boundaries. In addition, methods that extend the 2D optical flow formulation to 3D still produce large errors in occlusion regions. To better use depth for occlusion reasoning, we propose a layered RGBD scene flow method that jointly solves for the scene segmentation and the motion. Our key observation is that the noisy depth is sufficient to decide the depth ordering of layers, thereby avoiding a computational bottleneck for RGB layered methods. Furthermore, the depth enables us to estimate a per-layer 3D rigid motion to constrain the motion of each layer. Experimental results on both the Middlebury and real-world sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the layered approach for RGBD scene flow estimation.
