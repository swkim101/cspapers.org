The authors discuss evaluating the dynamic behavior of robot structures in water. A procedure for predicting the structure's modal parameters in water using its modal parameters in air as a starting point is described and applied. The results, presented for simple structures but fully applicable to more complex ones, show that the problem of the structure-fluid coupling can be solved with limited calculation resources.
