In Britain there is a very successful form of panel session, on a television program called “Question Time.” In this programme, four panelists, all public figures, are chosen to give a spectrum of viewpoints. There is always a figure from the two main political p<a.rties, usually one from the third largest party, and some complementary figure, perhaps a a business leader, union leader, or media person. This gives a wide spread of views. There are no position statements, the program is filled by discussing questions at about 10 minutes each. Each question is asked by an audience member, all four panelists respond, moderated by the panel moderator (a well known BBC ligure). The questioner then makes a brief reply, and there is a brief period of comments from the floor. The questions are submitted in advance by the audience members and the progr‘am organizers pick six questions that will be interesting. This panel on use cases follows roughly the same format. A well known (English!) 00 figure will question four expert panelists with differing views, to expose their views and their reasons for differing. There are no position statements, the 90-minute pane1 is filled by discussing eight questions. The questions are submitted in advance by the public and audience members. The moderator picks eight questions that will be interesting and help tease ap‘art subtle issues and differences between the panelists. For each question, all four panelists respond, moderated by the pane1 moderator. The questioner makes a brief reply, and there is a brief period of comments from the floor.
