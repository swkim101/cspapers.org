Graphical, well focused and intuitive domain specific languages (DSLs) are more and more used to design parts of embedded systems. These languages are highly specialized and often tailored to one domain; one single language therefore cannot describe all relevant aspects of systems and system components. This raises the need for heterogeneous modeling approaches that are capable of combining multiple DSLs into holistic system models. Our CompoSE modeling approach focuses on this problem; it does not only cover system modeling with DSLs, but provides also interfacing of language specific generators and harmonization of generated code. In this paper, we describe the principles of CompoSE, together with the integration of an existing modeling language with industrial strength tool support into CompoSE. Supporting the integration of existing languages is of particular importance in the domain of embedded systems, because modern modeling approaches will only be accepted in industry if they support existing and proven technologies.
