This paper describes a new indexing method for Japanese text databases using the simple keyword string, in which a compound word is treated as a string of simple words, which are the smallest units in Japanese grammar which still maintain their meanings. This method allows retrieved texts to be ranked, according to the similarity of their meaning to the query, without using a control vocabulary or thesaurus. This paper also introduces the keyword feature, which describes the syntactic and semantic characteristics of a word, and results in more precise keyword extraction and text retrieval as well as simple dictionary maintenance.
