Kinematically complex robots such as legged robots provide a large degree of mobility and flexibility, but demand a sophisticated motion control, which has more tunable parameters than a general planning and decision layer should take into consideration. A lot of parameterizations exist which produce locomotion behaviors that fulfill the desired action but with varying performance, e.g., stability or efficiency. In addition, the performance of a locomotion behavior at any given time is highly depending on the current environmental context. Consequently, a complex mapping is required that closes the gap between robot-independent actions and robot-specific control parameters considering the environmental context and a given prioritization of performance indices.
