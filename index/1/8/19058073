In this paper I introduce a contrast between homomorphic and nonhomomorphic ascriptions of informational content to representations. In the former case there is a mapping from the parts of the representation onto the constituents of the content. In the latter case, there is not; some of the constituents of the content are settled by background factors. I contrast this distinction with that between context dependent and context independent ascriptions of content. I note that in cases where the ascriber of content shares the background with the agent, one is inclined to ascribe homomorphic content of a sort that does not have a fixed truth-value to a representation. This leads to the notion of relative information. Some uses for relative information are noted. Finally, the distinctions developed are used to distinguish three types of self-knowledge and account for their relations.
