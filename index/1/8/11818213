The existing MapReduce framework in virtualized environment suffers from poor performance, due to the heavy overhead of I/O virtualization, and management difficulty for storage and computation. To address the problems, we propose Cloudlet, a novel MapReduce framework on virtual machines. The aim of Cloudlet design is to overcome the overhead of VM while benefiting of the other features of VM (i.e. management and reliability issues).
