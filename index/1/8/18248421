This paper presents DiVA, a new acoustic source localization scheme that uses an ad-hoc network of microphone sensor nodes to produce an accurate estimate of the source's location. DiVA uses pairwise comparisons of sound detection timestamps between local Voronoi neighbors to identify the node closest to the acoustic source and then estimates the source's location. The scheme improves on the state of the art by effectively dealing with anchor nodes' position error, time stamp measurement error and time synchronization error in real world conditions. Through simulation and experimental evaluations, DiVA is shown to be more robust than existing solutions under different error conditions.
