During the requirements elicitation phase, analysts have often to take into consideration laws and regulations enacted by different levels of government. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, a systematic process is outlined which, given a problem and a collection of legal prescriptions, generates a set of requirements that address the problem while complying with the prescriptions. Second, the conceptual framework is outlined, which characterises the process by providing both legal concepts proposed in theoretical studies in the legal domain and concepts from goal-oriented requirements engineering. The issues and challenges of the proposed framework are also evaluated, with regard to expected results.
