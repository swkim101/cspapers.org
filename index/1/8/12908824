Teleoperation tasks are performed at cartesian level when the robot and the haptic device have dissimilar kinematics. If the size of the workspaces is also dissimilar, as it is usually the case, the mapping between workspaces must be handled with care in order to let the user teleoperate the robot in a natural and precise way. This paper formulates the mapping of workspaces based on the re-synchronization method and proposes an assisted system that lightens the user from the tedious part of the method, by guiding him/her towards the best re-synchronization position, thus minimizing the number of jumps. The proposal is part of a teleoperated guiding system being developed by the authors.
