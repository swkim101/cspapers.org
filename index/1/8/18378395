This paper introduces a new data structure, called V-trees, designed to store long sequences of points in 2D space and yet allow efficient access to their fragments. They also optimire access to a sequence of points when the query involves changes to a smaller scale. V-trees operate in much the same way as positional B-Trees do in the context of long fields and they can be viewed as a variant of Rtrees. The design of V-trees was motivated by the problem of storing and retrieving geographic objects that are fairly long, such as river margins or political boundaries, and the fact that geographic queries typically access just fragments of such objects, frequently using a smaller scale.
