Limited endurance problem and low cell reliability are main challenges of phase change memory (PCM) as an alternative to DRAM. To further prolong the lifetime of a PCM device, there exist a number of techniques that can be grouped in two categories: 1) reducing the write rate to PCM cells, and 2) handling cell failures when faults occur. Our experiments confirm that during write operations, an extensive non-uniformity in bit flips is exhibited. To reduce this non-uniformity, we present byte-level shifting scheme (BLESS) which reduces write pressure over hot cells of blocks. Additionally, this shifting mechanism can be used for error recovery purpose by using the MLC capability of PCM and manipulating the data block to recover faulty cells. Evaluation results for multi-threaded workloads reveal 14-25% improvement in lifetime over existing state-of-the-art schemes.
