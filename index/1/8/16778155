Current object-oriented drawing programs have an established wayof drawing in which the shape of an object is controlled bymanipulating control points. While the control points are intuitivein their basic use, it is not clear whether they make more complexdrawing tasks manageable for the average user. In this paper wedescribe an alternative way of drawing and editing a drawing usingnew direct manipulation tools. Our approach resembles sculpting intwo dimensions: the user begins with a large block and usesdifferent tools to give it the desired shape. We also present auser evaluation in which the users could try our new tools andcompare them to their previous experience of control points, Theusers claimed to understand the operations better with our toolsthan if they had needed to use curves and control points. However,our tools were better suited for sketching the artwork than formaking very detailed drawings.
