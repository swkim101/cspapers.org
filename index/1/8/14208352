We have developed a humanoid robot HRP-2P with a biped locomotion controller, stereo vision software and aural human interface to realize cooperative works by a human and a humanoid robot. The robot can find a target object by the vision, and carry it cooperatively with a human by biped locomotion according to the voice commands by the human. A cooperative control is applied to the arms of the robot while it carries the object, and the walking direction of the robot is controlled by the interactive force and torque through the force/torque sensor on the wrists. The experimental results are presented in the paper.
