This session will help participants understand the importance of, and challenges in, introducing collaborative learning within introductory Computer Science curricula. At the University of Adelaide, we have designed our first year curriculum, a sequence of three courses, around collaborative learning - in this session we explore our experiences in developing collaborative activities, collaborative assessment and appropriate training for staff, academic and sessional, involved in collaborative sessions. Based on a seven year programme of designing and undertaking collaborative activities, we will discuss our successes, and our failures, in the use of collaborative learning techniques.
