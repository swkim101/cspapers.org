Many research networks, Internet exchanges and even portals are utilizing 10 Gigabit links at the WAN edge to accommodate rapidly increasing traffic as broadband access speeds and penetration rates grow. While the demand for 10 GbE continues to grow, firewall technology is not keeping pace, leaving the network edge open to security breaches.To effectively protect the high speed WAN edge requires a different type of firewall that can provide visibility into traffic as well as filter traffic at 10 Gigabit speeds. This functionality and the growing sophistication of security breaches, require a greater degree of flexibility than previous generations of firewall technology have provided. Specifically, it is essential to move away from the rigid rule ordering logic of existing firewalls to a flexible scheme that lets network operators choose between policy control, ordered rules or summed outcomes.Additionally, a high speed firewall needs to be transparent and provide Layer 7 deep packet inspection to eliminate unwanted traffic, critical features to ensuring reliable security at the 10 GbE WAN edge.This presentation will focus on the requirements for a high speed firewall that can secure the 10 GbE WAN edge and the trends driving the move to higher speed networks.
