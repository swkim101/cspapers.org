In this paper, robotic sensor fusion of acceleration and force measurement is considered. We discuss the problem of using accelerometers close to the end-effectors of robotic manipulators and how it may improve the force control performance. We introduce a new model-based observer approach to sensor fusion of information from various different sensors. During contact transition, accelerometers and force sensors play a very important role and it can overcome many of the difficulties of uncertain models and unknown environments, which limit the domain of application of currents robots used without external sensory feedback. A model of the robot-grinding tool using the new sensors was obtained by system identification. An impedance control scheme was proposed to verify the improvement The experiments were carried out on an ABB industrial robot with open control system architecture.
