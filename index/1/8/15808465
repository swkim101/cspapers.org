The method of human-like handwriting and drawing is addressed with a three-link arm. Three strategies of trajectory planning are considered: the basic stroke method, the Bezier curve method, and the non-gradient numerical optimization method. Planar patterns of handwriting or drawing are converted into the vector form of joint angles in which sequence and speed of the movement can be designed to imitate human handwriting and drawing. A nonlinear three-link three-dimensional arm, similar to a human arm, is developed to track the planned trajectories. The feasibility of these methods is demonstrated by simulation.
