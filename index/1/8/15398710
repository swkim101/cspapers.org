We propose a novel haptic teleoperation control framework for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over the Internet, consisting of the three control layers: 1) UAV control layer, where each UAV is abstracted by, and is controlled to follow the trajectory of, its own kinematic virtual point (VP); 2) VP control layer, which modulates each VP's motion according to the teleoperation commands and local artificial potentials (for inter-VP/VP-obstacle collision avoidance and inter-VP connectivity preservation); and 3) teleoperation layer, through which a remote human user can command all (or some) of the VPs' velocity while haptically perceiving the state of all (or some) of the UAVs over the Internet. Master-passivity/slave-stability and some asymptotic performance measures are proved. Semi-experiment results are presented to validate the theory.
