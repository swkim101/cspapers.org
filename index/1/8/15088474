This paper presents the elasto-geometrical modelling of an industrial robot manipulator whose structure includes a closed-loop mechanism. This modelling is done for sensitivity studies and calibration purposes since the robot is involved in machining operations that require a high level of quasi static positioning accuracy. The kinematics of the machine is described first then the systematic approach that is proposed to calculate the elastic modelling of its architecture is presented. Simulations and experiments are presented next in order to evaluate the limitations and benefits of the proposed modelling approach.
