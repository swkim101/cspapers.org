We present a deterministic (1+o(1))-approximation O(n1/2+o(1)+D1+o(1))-time algorithm for solving the single-source shortest paths problem on distributed weighted networks (the CONGEST model); here n is the number of nodes in the network and D is its (hop) diameter. This is the first non-trivial deterministic algorithm for this problem. It also improves (i) the running time of the randomized (1+o(1))-approximation Õ(n1/2D1/4+D)-time algorithm of Nanongkai [STOC 2014] by a factor of as large as n1/8, and (ii) the O(є−1logє−1)-approximation factor of Lenzen and Patt-Shamir’s Õ(n1/2+є+D)-time algorithm [STOC 2013] within the same running time. Our running time matches the known time lower bound of Ω(n1/2/logn + D) [Das Sarma et al. STOC 2011] modulo some lower-order terms, thus essentially settling the status of this problem which was raised at least a decade ago [Elkin SIGACT News 2004]. It also implies a (2+o(1))-approximation O(n1/2+o(1)+D1+o(1))-time algorithm for approximating a network’s weighted diameter which almost matches the lower bound by Holzer et al. [PODC 2012]. In achieving this result, we develop two techniques which might be of independent interest and useful in other settings: (i) a deterministic process that replaces the “hitting set argument” commonly used for shortest paths computation in various settings, and (ii) a simple, deterministic, construction of an (no(1), o(1))-hop set of size O(n1+o(1)). We combine these techniques with many distributed algorithmic techniques, some of which from problems that are not directly related to shortest paths, e.g. ruling sets [Goldberg et al. STOC 1987], source detection [Lenzen, Peleg PODC 2013], and partial distance estimation [Lenzen, Patt-Shamir PODC 2015]. Our hop set construction also leads to single-source shortest paths algorithms in two other settings: (i) a (1+o(1))-approximation O(no(1))-time algorithm on congested cliques, and (ii) a (1+o(1))-approximation O(no(1)logW)-pass O(n1+o(1)logW)-space streaming algorithm, when edge weights are in {1, 2, …, W}. The first result answers an open problem in [Nanongkai, STOC 2014]. The second result partially answers an open problem raised by McGregor in 2006 [sublinear.info, Problem 14].
