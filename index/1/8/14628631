To apply semantic search to smartphones, we propose an efficient semantic search method based on a lightweight mobile ontology. Through a prototype implementation of a semantic search engine on an android smartphone, experimental results show that the proposed method provides more accurate search results and a better user experience compared to the conventional method.
