Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently emerged as a promising platform for civilian tasks and public interests, such as merchandise delivery, traffic control, news reporting, natural disaster management, mobile social networks, and Internet connectivity in third-world countries. Looking forward, the exciting potential of UAVs is accompanied with significant hurdles that call for broad and concerted interdisciplinary research, with diverse focuses on real-time system design, energy efficiency, safety and security, programmability, robotics and mechanical design, among others. This poster proposes an open-source and extensible software infrastructure for UAVs.
