In a mixed-methods study on adoption of location-sharing social networks (LSSN), we discovered that variations in adoption and usage behavior could be explained by one's predisposition to communicate in a certain style. Specifically, we found that certain individuals prefer a communication style we call FYI (For Your Information). FYI communicators like to infer availability and to keep in touch with others without having to interact with them, which is the predominant style in current LSSN. Using structural equation modeling on a U.S. nationwide survey (N=1021), we show how the FYI communication style predicts the adoption of LSSN while also showing a negative effect on one's desire to call someone on the phone. Moreover, we find that as age increases, FYI preference significantly decreases. In a follow-on survey (N=180), we refine the FYI construct and show that it affects users' level of disclosure and participation in social media. Furthermore, we show that it completely mediates the effect of certain Big-5 personality traits on social media participation and LSSN usage. The results suggest that to cater to a wider segment of the population, LSSN (and arguably any social media) should support an active communication style.
