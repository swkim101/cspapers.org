The rapid development of social media exacerbates the information overload and credibility problems. Trust, providing information about with whom we can trust to share information and from whom we can accept information, plays an important role in helping users collect relevant and reliable information in social media. Trust has become a research topic of increasing importance and of practical significance. In this tutorial, we illustrate properties and representation models of trust, elucidate trust measurements with representative algorithms, and demonstrate real-world applications where trust is explicitly used. As a new dimension of the trust study, we discuss the concept of distrust and its roles in trust measurements and applications.
