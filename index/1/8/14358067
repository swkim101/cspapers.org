A human-inspired hand-over control strategy is proposed for the haptic interaction of two dual-fingered hands for the planar case. It is based on a grasp controller for an unknown object which achieves, via fingertip rolling, a stable grasp and a real object mass estimation. Object load transfer is receiver initiated, follows human evidence and involves awareness of the other hand's state based solely on local proprioceptive measurements. Simulation results illustrate the proposed approach.
