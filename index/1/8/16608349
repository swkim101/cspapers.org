Linear Increase/Multiplicative Decrease (LIMD) has typi^.. . tally been the congestion control paradigm ot choice in the traditional Internet with tail-drop routers. In recent years, routers with fair packet dropping policies (e.g. RED) are increasingly being deployed in the Internet. In the context of a network with fair packet dropping routers, we challenge the popular notion that Linear Increase/Linear Decrease (LILD) is an unsuitable paradigm for congestion control, and present two key results: (a) LILD is both eficient and fair in the target environment. In fact, LILD outperforms LIMD in most respects. (b) By maintaining the history of transmission rates and loss profiles, congestion control algorithms can effectively distinguish between congestion-induced and non-congestioninduced loss. We present the LILD/H algorithm that combines the above features. LILD/H reacts gently to random/channel probe loss, and aggressively to congestion loss, thereby adapting effectively to the dynamics of the network. Consequently, we believe that LILD/H is a viable congestion control algorithm at the end host or the edge router in the future Internet.
