This paper examines the changes in the undergraduate course on Operating Systems both from the perspective of the ACM curriculum recommendations and the perspective of the topical coverage in popular textbooks. It concludes that the course and the expectations of the course have changed over the years. The net effect of these changes has been towards less substance and less preparation for students emerging from the course. The paper begins by discussing the changes in ACM curricular guidelines. That section is followed by two sections that trace the changes recommended by the curricular guidelines to their implementations in both the older and newer generations of textbooks. These are followed by a brief discussion of the literature describing Operating Systems courses and their projects. Finally conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made.
