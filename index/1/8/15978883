This paper proposes an approach to enhance dependency parsing in a language by using a translated treebank from another language. A simple statistical machine translation method, word-by-word decoding, where not a parallel corpus but a bilingual lexicon is necessary, is adopted for the treebank translation. Using an ensemble method, the key information extracted from word pairs with dependency relations in the translated text is effectively integrated into the parser for the target language. The proposed method is evaluated in English and Chinese treebanks. It is shown that a translated English treebank helps a Chinese parser obtain a state-of-the-art result.
