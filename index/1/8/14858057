We have developed an exclusive planetary subsurface explorer robot with propulsion and excavation units. In this paper, we first explain the concept of our underground explorer robot. Next we develop an excavation unit with a tapered earth auger and a propulsion unit with dual pantograph. Several experiments are performed to demonstrate these features. Finally, we develop a subsurface explorer robot with propulsion and excavation units. Excavation experiments are successfully conducted using the excavator alone and at lighter weights. We show that the excavator can begin boring from a launcher, and in case of excavator of 1/6 of its own weight, it successfully excavates at the same depth as in its own weight. This demonstrates that this novel excavator is expected to accomplish future missions on other planets and the moon.
