Many robotic hands or prosthetic hands have been developed in the last several decades, and many use tendon-driven mechanisms for their transmissions. Robotic hands are now built with underactuated mechanisms, which have fewer actuators than degrees of freedom, to reduce mechanical complexity or to realize a biomimetic motion such as flexion of an index finger. The design is heuristic and it is useful to develop design methods for the underactuated mechanisms. This paper classifies mechanisms driven by tendons into three classes, and proposes a design method for them. The two classes are related to underactuated tendon-driven mechanisms, and these have been used without distinction so far. An index finger robot, which has four active tendons and two passive tendons, is developed and controlled with the proposed method.
