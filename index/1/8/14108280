We address two difficulties in establishing an accurate system for image matching. First, image matching relies on the descriptor for feature extraction, but the optimal descriptor often varies from image to image, or even patch to patch. Second, conventional matching approaches carry out geometric checking on a small set of correspondence candidates due to the concern of efficiency. It may result in restricted performance in recall. We aim at tackling the two issues by integrating adaptive descriptor selection and progressive candidate enrichment into image matching. We consider that the two integrated components are complementary: The high-quality matching yielded by adaptively selected descriptors helps in exploring more plausible candidates, while the enriched candidate set serves as a better reference for descriptor selection. It motivates us to formulate image matching as a joint optimization problem, in which adaptive descriptor selection and progressive correspondence enrichment are alternately conducted. Our approach is comprehensively evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art approaches on two benchmarks. The promising results manifest its effectiveness.
