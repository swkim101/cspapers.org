From our experience with customers who deploy customized software products, we have learned that deriving products from shared software assets requires more than complying with quality standards like ISO9126. Additionally, developers must consider what we call the quality profile of the final product. A process that matches the quality profile of final product during product derivation helps provide and validate industrial software application solutions. This paper describes this matching concept and its application in a case study of the development of a product lifecycle reporting tool at a large organization. Also we propose a tool that could enhance quality control.
