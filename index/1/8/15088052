Wireless researchers face the practical challenge of evaluating the performance of new routing protocols for very large-scale heterogeneous mobile systems. While simulation platforms, tools and techniques have matured, doubts remain about the broad validity of simulated results when applied to real world situations. Wireless network emulation provides a middle ground between simulations and real-world testing. However, emulation environments are complex to run and cost-prohibitive for larger-scale tests. In order to maximize fidelity while managing complexity and costs, we developed a common framework that unifies simulation-based analysis and emulation experiment tools, in order to produce calibrated and scalable performance evaluations.
