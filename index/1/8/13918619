Both distributed systems and multicore computers are difficult programming environments. Although the expert programmer may be able to tune distributed and multicore computers to achieve high performance, the non-expert may struggle to achieve a program that even functions correctly.
 We argue that high level abstractions are an effective way of making parallel computing accessible to the non-expert. An abstraction is a regularly structured framework into which a user may plug in simple sequential programs to create very large parallel programs. By virtue of a regular structure and declarative specification, abstractions may be materialized on distributed, multicore, and distributed multicore systems with robust performance across a wide range of problem sizes. In previous work, we presented the All-Pairs abstraction for computing on distributed systems of single CPUs. In this paper, we extend All-Pairs to multicore systems, and introduce Wavefront, which represents a number of problems in economics and bioinformatics. We demonstrate good scaling of both abstractions up to 32-cores on one machine and hundreds of cores in a distributed system.
