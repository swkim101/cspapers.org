We present a data mining process for discovering associations between structures and functions of the human brain. Our approach is through the study of lesioned (abnormal) structures and associated functional deficits (disorders). For this purpose we have developed a BRAinImage Database (BRAID) that integrates image processing and visualization capabilities with statistical analysis of spatial and clinical data, providing access via extended SQL through a web interface. We present visualization and statistical methods for mining lesion-deficit associations. We consider issues of scalability and morphological variability. We demonstrate the use of the proposed mining methods by applying them to epidemiological data finding clinically meaningful associ-
