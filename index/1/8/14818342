This paper describes a rule-based legal decisonmaking system (LDS) that embodies the skills and knowledge of an expert in product liability law. The system is being used to study the effect of changes in legal doctrine on settlement strategies and practices. LDS is implemented in ROSIE, a rule-oriented language designed to facilitate the development of large expert systems. The ROSIE language is briefly described and our approach to modeling legal expertise using a prototype version of LDS is presented.
