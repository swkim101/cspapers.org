This paper describes an algorithm for the simulation of gate-level logic. Multiple logic levels are used to describe the state of each node. Each state corresponds to a different voltage level, and the number of levels to be used for a simulation is user-defined. This feature simplifies considerably the interface between a digital and an analog simulator. A DC solver is incorporated to find the initial operating point of a circuit before a transient analysis begins. This solver has the capability of finding the operating point of gates located in feedback loops. For transient analysis, a gate delay model that takes into account the slope of the input waveforms is used. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated by simulations of a number of benchmark circuits.
