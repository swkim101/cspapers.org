The burden of entry into mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is prohibitively high for human-subject researchers who lack a technical orientation. As a result, the benefits of MCS remain beyond the reach of research communities (e.g., psychologists) whose expertise in the study of human behavior might advance applications and understanding of MCS systems. This paper presents Sensus, a new MCS system for human-subject studies that bridges the gap between human-subject researchers and MCS methods. Sensus alleviates technical burdens with on-device, GUI-based design of sensing plans, simple and efficient distribution of sensing plans to study participants, and uniform participant experience across iOS and Android devices. Sensing plans support many hardware and software sensors, automatic deployment of sensor-triggered surveys, and double-blind assignment of participants within randomized controlled trials. Sensus offers these features to study designers without requiring knowledge of markup and programming languages. We demonstrate the feasibility of using Sensus within two human-subject studies, one in psychology and one in engineering. Feedback from non-technical users indicates that Sensus is an effective and low-burden system for MCS-based data collection and analysis.
