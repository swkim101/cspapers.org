This paper proposes a novel approach to retrieve news articles related to a specific event and generate a storyline to help people understand the event evolution. First, a similarity calculation method is proposed to retrieve news articles related to the specific event, which combines textual similarity, temporal similarity and entity similarity. Then a multi-view attribute graph is constructed to represent the relationship between retrieved articles. Finally, a community detection algorithm is developed to segment and chain subevents in the graph. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieve better results than existing methods.0F0F
