In this paper, we explore an unsupervised representation learning approach for the first time to capture the long-term global motion dynamics in skeleton sequences. We design a conditional skeleton inpainting architecture for learning a fixed-dimensional representation, guided by additional adversarial training strategies. We quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of our learning approach on three well-established action recognition datasets. Experimental results show that our learned representation is discriminative for classifying actions and can substantially reduce the sequence inpainting errors.
