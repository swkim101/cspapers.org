An analog CMOS VLSI neural processing chip has been designed and fabricated. The device employs "pulse-stream" neural state signalling, and is capable of computing some 360 million synaptic connections per second. In addition to basic characterisation results, the performance of the chip in solving "real-world" problems is also demonstrated.
