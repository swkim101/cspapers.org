This paper proposes the use of virtual machine architectures as a means of modeling and analyzing networks and distributed computing systems. The requirements for such modeling and analysis are explored and defined along with an illustrative study of an X.25 link-level protocol performance under normal execution conditions. The virtualizable architecture used in this work is the Data General Nova 3/D.
