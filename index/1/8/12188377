We propose <b><i>abc-boost</i></b> (adaptive base class boost) for multi-class classification and present <b><i>abc-mart</i></b>, an implementation of <i>abc-boost</i>, based on the multinomial logit model. The key idea is that, at each boosting iteration, we <b><i>adaptively</i></b> and greedily choose a <b><i>base</i></b> class. Our experiments on public datasets demonstrate the improvement of <i>abc-mart</i> over the original <i>mart</i> algorithm.
