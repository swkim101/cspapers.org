This paper presents the LiLFeS system, an efficient feature-structure description language for HPSG. The core engine of LiLFeS is an Abstract Machine for Attribute-Value Logics, proposed by Carpenter and Qu. Basic design policies, the current status, and performance evaluation of the LiLFeS system are described. The paper discusses two implementations of the LiLFeS. The first one is based on an emulator of the abstract machine, while the second one uses a native-code compiler and therefore is much more efficient than the first one.
