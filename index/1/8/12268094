The Indian Buffet Process is a versatile statistical tool for modeling distributions over binary matrices. We provide an efficient spectral algorithm as an alternative to costly Variational Bayes and sampling-based algorithms. We derive a novel tensorial characterization of the moments of the Indian Buffet Process proper and for two of its applications. We give a computationally efficient iterative inference algorithm, concentration of measure bounds, and reconstruction guarantees. Our algorithm provides superior accuracy and cheaper computation than comparable Variational Bayesian approach on a number of reference problems.
