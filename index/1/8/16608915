Many instructors and institutions offer research experiences and training in computing research methods. However, in a national survey, we find that undergraduate students rate their computing research experiences lower than students in other STEM fields. To address this learning gap, we have offered summer undergraduate research experiences in computing that include not only instruction in the important mechanics of research but also grounding in a philosophy of computing science that emphasizes generalized explanation of behavior as a means for control and prediction. After five years, survey results indicate the experience helps close the gap between CS and other STEM fields in benefits gained.
