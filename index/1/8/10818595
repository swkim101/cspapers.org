Symmetry, as one of the key components of Gestalt theory, provides an important mid-level cue that serves as input to higher visual processes such as segmentation. In this work, we propose a complete approach that links the detection of curved reflection symmetries to produce symmetry-constrained segments of structures/regions in real images with clutter. For curved reflection symmetry detection, we leverage on patch-based symmetric features to train a Structured Random Forest classifier that detects multiscaled curved symmetries in 2D images. Next, using these curved symmetries, we modulate a novel symmetry-constrained foreground-background segmentation by their symmetry scores so that we enforce global symmetrical consistency in the final segmentation. This is achieved by imposing a pairwise symmetry prior that encourages symmetric pixels to have the same labels over a MRF-based representation of the input image edges, and the final segmentation is obtained via graph-cuts. Experimental results over four publicly available datasets containing annotated symmetric structures: 1) SYMMAX-300 [38], 2) BSD-Parts, 3) Weizmann Horse (both from [18]) and 4) NY-roads [35] demonstrate the approach's applicability to different environments with state-of-the-art performance.
