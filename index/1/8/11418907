This paper presents a new analogue four-quadrant current multiplier using electronically tunable second-generation current conveyor. The proposed structure is highly suitable for implementation in low cost technology as CMOS technology. PSPICE simulators using the 0.5 Î¼m CMOS parameters are performed to confirm the workability of the proposed structure. The simulation results show that the proposed multiplier yields excellent temperature stability and good analogue multiplication.
