In this paper, we present a novel system for stylus-based GUI interactions: Simulated physics through actuated frictional properties of a touch screen stylus. We present a prototype that implements a series of principles which we propose for the design of frictionally augmented GUIs. It is discussed how such actuation could be a potential addition of value for stylus-controlled GUIs, through enabling prioritized content, allowing for inherent confirmation, and leveraging on manual dexterity.
