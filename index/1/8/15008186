After a very successful edition of the IoT-App workshop, its second edition is conducted in conjunction with SenSys 2015. Again, the workshop succeeded in attracting a high number of high-quality submissions. The topics of the papers submitted feature most prominently urban sensing and smart home or city. Further directions are programming concepts for IoT devices as well as advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning for IoT devices.
