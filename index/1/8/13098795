This paper describes the status of design automation of electronics in three different companies and a university in Sweden. Design automation of MOS circuits at Asea-Hafo (Ingmar Hoglund) Asea-Hafo is a company, which produces high reliability semiconductor devices as integrated circuits, discrete transistors, diodes and opto electronic components. During 1974 CMOS Large scale integrated circuits has become the main product. Asea-Hafo concentrates on custom designed circuits in volumes between 10.000 and 50.000 circuits per design and year. In order to be successful in the competition between producers of MOS circuits Asea-Hafo among other things has to offer a short time of delivery of prototypes and serial produced circuits.
