Grace is an intelligent tutoring system for COBOL which has been used to teach both novice and experienced programmers. While the tutor was quite effective in several classes and was designed with cognitive and interface principles in mind, we discuss a number of interesting issues that we have discovered when novice and experienced programmers used the tutor. Most of these problems are related to incompatibilities between the tutor interactions and the students' expectations in two areas: (1) the interactions with the tutor versus the interactions in their usual work environment and (2) the way in which experienced programmers solve problems. We describe these issues along with our solutions in the revised version of the tutor.
