Supplier selection in industry is a cross-functional, group decision-making problem, frequently solved by a non-programmed decision-making process, and involving long-term commitment for a company. During recent years, how to determine suitable suppliers in the supply chain has become a key strategic consideration. However, the nature of these decisions usually is complex and unstructured. Especially, some decision-making data is undefined, vague and fuzzy data. Especially the determination of weight for supplier selection is very difficult. Considering these circumstances, in this paper, at first we transform the triangular fuzzy numbers into crisp date, and then we use the BP neutral networks to calculate the weight of indexes for supplier selection, the weight we obtained is reliable and reasonable, considering the suitability of grey correlation analysis for supplier selection problem, we use the grey correlation analysis to select the best supplier, Finally, an empirical study is conducted to demonstrate the procedure of the proposed system and identify the suitable supplier.
