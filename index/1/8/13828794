ObjectRank is one of the popular graph mining methods that enables us to evaluate the importance of each vertex on heterogeneous graphs. However, it is computationally expensive to apply it to large graphs since ObjectRank needs to compute the importance of all vertices iteratively. In this work, we present a fast ObjectRank algorithm,FORank, that accurately approximates the keyword search results. FORank iteratively prunes vertices whose convergence score likely has less impact on the results during iterative computation. The experiments showed that FORank runs 7 times faster than ObjectRank computation with over 90% accuracy approximation.
