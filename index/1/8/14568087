The IMPACT Architecture Framework project started in 1987 at the University of Illinois, UrbanaChampaign. The goal was to develop an architectural framework and its enabling compiler technology for instruction-level parallel processing microprocessors. The project was founded based on three fundamental assumptions about the future of microprocessor architectures that were rather controversial at the time. First, the level of intrinsic instruction-level parallelism (ILP) in general applications should be much higher than that accepted by most researchers in the 1980’s. The accepted standard was that fewer than two instructions per cycle could be sustained in non-numerical applications. Second, the compiler’s role would be critical at achieving the increased levels of ILP in general applications. At this time, most researchers viewed advanced hardware mechanisms, such as out-of-order execution and branch prediction, as the only means to extract increased ILP. These assumptions have both been shown to be true through extensive evidence generated by many academic researchers and industrial groups, including the IMPACT team. Finally, industry would be able to implement high issue rate microprocessors at very high clock frequencies. As of 1995, the third assumption has been verified by successful products such as the Digital Alpha 21164.
