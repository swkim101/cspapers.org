This paper describes a project that was carried out by Philips Corporate Design (PCD) to explore ideas for products and services which could be part of our future in the year 2005. It discusses how a socio-cultural tool was used together with technology forecasts to arrive at the creation of scenarios that describe future products and their contexts. The concepts were then communicated to a wide audience in the form of short film clips. The project involved many people from a wide range of disciplines.
