In this paper we approach the problem of providing corrections for incorrectly typed URLs. This problem is significantly different from the classical spelling correction problem. We describe our contribution - building a custom data structure and a search algorithm that can find approximate matches for incorrect URLs. We evaluate the quality of our results through experiments with analysts. Our system is now being used in the Google search engine.
