This paper presents a semi-automatic system for robotically assisted 2D needle steering that uses duty-cycling to perform insertions with arcs of adjustable curvature radius. It combines image feedback manually provided by an operator with an adaptive path planning strategy to compensate for system uncertainties and changes in the workspace during the procedure. Experimental results are presented to validate the proposed platform.
