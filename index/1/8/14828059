Community detection is of crucial importance in understanding structures of complex networks. In many real-world networks, communities naturally overlap since a node usually has multiple community memberships. One popular technique to cope with overlapping community detection is Matrix Factorization (MF). However, existing MF-based models have ignored the fact that besides neighbors, "local non-neighbors" (e.g., my friend's friend but not my direct friend) are helpful when discovering communities. In this paper, we propose a Locality-based Non-negative Matrix Factorization (LNMF) model to refine a preference-based model by incorporating locality into learning objective. We define a subgraph called "k-degree local network" to set a boundary between local nonneighbors and other non-neighbors. By discriminately treating these two class of non-neighbors, our model is able to capture the process of community formation. We propose a fast sampling strategy within the stochastic gradient descent based learning algorithm. We compare our LNMF model with several baseline methods on various real-world networks, including large ones with ground-truth communities. Results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
