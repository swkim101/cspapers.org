Unsolicited bulk e-mail (UBE) or spam constitutes a significant fraction of all e-mail connection attempts and routinely frustrates users, consumes resources, and serves as an infection vector for malicious software. In an effort to scalably and effectively reduce the impact of these e-mails, e-mail system designers have increasingly turned to blacklisting. Blacklisting (blackholing, block listing) is a form of course-grained, reputation-based, dynamic policy enforcement in which real-time feeds of spam sending hosts are sent to networks so that the e-mail from these hosts may be rejected. Unfortunately, current spam blacklist services are highly inaccurate and exhibit both false positives and significant false negatives. In this paper, we explore the root causes of blacklist inaccuracy and show that the trend toward stealthier spam exacerbates the existing tension between false positives and false negatives when assigning spamming IP reputation. We argue that to relieve this tension, global aggregation and reputation assignment should be replaced with local aggregation and reputation assignment, utilizing preexisting global spam collection, with the addition of local usage, policy, and reachability information. We propose two specific techniques based on this premise, dynamic thresholding and speculative aggregation, whose goal is to improve the accuracy of blacklist generation. We evaluate the performance and accuracy of these solutions in the context of our own deployment consisting of 2.5 million production e-mails and 14 million e-mails from spamtraps deployed in 11 domains over a month-long period. We show that the proposed approaches significantly improve the false positive and false negative rates when compared to existing approaches.
