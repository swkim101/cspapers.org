Omnidirectional cameras allow direct tracking and motion estimation of planar regions in images during a long period of time. However, using only one camera leads to plane and trajectory reconstruction up to a scale factor. We propose to develop dense plane tracking based on omnidirectional stereovision to answer this issue. The presented method estimates simultaneously the parameters of several 3D planes along with the camera motion in a spherical model formulation. Results show the efficiency of the approach.
