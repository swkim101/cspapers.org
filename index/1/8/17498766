Having a team of robots to perform a task such as mapping is faster and more reliable than doing the same with a single robot, which can be crucial in scenarios such as search and rescue. We are developing a fully distributed framework for collaborative mapping with large robot swarms that is robust to abrupt departure of robots due to malfunctions or network problems. While several approaches to multi-robot mapping have been proposed, most of them either build a collection of local sub-maps, or rely on a central authority to merge maps built by individual robots. Our framework is unique in that it requires no central authority, yet allows robots to simultaneously contribute to a single global map, which is stored in a decentralized fashion. This greatly improves the scalability of our system with respect to number of robots. However, our approach requires systematic coordination among robots in order to make modifications to the map. Unannounced departure of the robots makes coordination challenging, and can potentially make the map inconsistent or result in loss of data. We borrow ideas from the domain of distributed computing to address those challenges. Further, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed system by subjecting it to various conditions in which participating robots fail.
