In this paper, we propose a new framework for training vision-based agent for First-Person Shooter (FPS) Game, in particular Doom. Our framework combines the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approach (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) model [Mnih et al. (2016)]) with curriculum learning. Our model is simple in design and only uses game states from the AI side, rather than using opponentsâ€™ information [Lample & Chaplot (2016)]. On a known map, our agent won 10 out of the 11 attended games and the champion of Track1 in ViZDoom AI Competition 2016 by a large margin, 35% higher score than the second place.
