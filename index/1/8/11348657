Nowadays, one of the largest environmental challenges that European countries must face consists in dealing with the past half century of nuclear waste. In order to optimize maintenance costs, nuclear waste must be sorted, segregated and stored according to its radiation level. Towards this end, in [1] we have recently proposed a visual-based shared control architecture meant to facilitate a human operator in controlling two remote robotic arms (one equipped with a gripper and another with a camera) during remote manipulation tasks of nuclear waste via a master device. The operator could then receive force cues informative of the feasibility of her/his motion commands during the task execution. The strategy presented in [1], albeit effective, suffers however from a locality issue since the operator can only provide instantaneous velocity commands (in a suitable task space), and receive instantaneous force feedback cues. On the other hand, the ability to ‘steer’ a whole future trajectory in task space, and to receive a corresponding integral force feedback along the whole planned trajectory (because of any constraint of the considered system), could significantly enhance the operator's performance, especially when dealing with complex manipulation tasks. The aim of this work is to then extend [1] towards a planning-based shared control architecture able to take into account the mentioned requirements. A human/hardware-in-the-loop experiment with simulated slave robots and a real master device is reported for demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
