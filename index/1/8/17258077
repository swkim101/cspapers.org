This paper presents a new available feature on the childbirth simulator BirthSIM. This feature offers a risk- free training for novice obstetricians to proceed to forceps extractions. The different forces involved during deliveries are described and modeled. The choice of a control strategy in order to reproduce all these forces is explained and argued. This paper also introduces the concepts of simple and double synchronization during deliveries. Its application allows to minimize the amount of forces exerted with forceps during an instrumental delivery to make it as safe as possible. Simulations of forceps extraction carried out by two junior obstetricians are provided and analyzed. The corresponding results are compared to the literature and to the results obtained by an expert.
