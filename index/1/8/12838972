Dependence on a team of robots to carry out the exploration missions has many benefits such as speeding up the missions; provided that the coordination among robots is maintained. Many circumstances can limit the communication, which is crucial for the coordination among robots (e.g. impenetrable barriers, high temperature etc.). A periodic rendezvous strategy is considered in this paper as a work around in order to overlap communication ranges of the robots. Attending these periodic rendezvous sessions requires that the robots interrupt their current exploration progress periodically and traverse back to the rendezvous points (i.e. Interruptibility). During their trips to these points, they do not gain new knowledge since they cross already explored parts of the area. Therefore, using rendezvous strategies improves the team behavior but has a negative impact on the time efficiency. The contribution of this paper is to mitigate this negative impact of Interruptibility on explorations while maintaining the coordination among robots. The mitigation algorithm is evaluated on several graphs and its performance is compared with other rendezvous approaches where the results are promising.
