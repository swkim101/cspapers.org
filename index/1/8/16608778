This paper demonstrates how non-isomorphic rotational mappings and interaction techniques can be designed and used to build effective spatial 3D user interfaces. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework allowing us to design non-isomorphic 3D rotational mappings and techniques, investigate their usability properties, and evaluate their user performance characteristics. The results suggest that non-isomorphic rotational mappings can be an effective tool in building high-quality manipulation dialogs in 3D interfaces, allowing our subjects to accomplish experimental tasks 13% faster without a statistically detectable loss in accuracy. The current paper will help interface designers to use non-isomorphic rotational mappings effectively.
