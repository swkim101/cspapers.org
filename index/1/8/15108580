We present a novel fine-tuning algorithm in a deep hybrid architecture for semisupervised text classification. During each increment of the online learning process, the fine-tuning algorithm serves as a top-down mechanism for pseudo-jointly modifying model parameters following a bottom-up generative learning pass. The resulting model, trained under what we call the Bottom-Up-Top-Down learning algorithm, is shown to outperform a variety of competitive models and baselines trained across a wide range of splits between supervised and unsupervised training data.
