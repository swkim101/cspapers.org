We present SportSense, a system for interactive sports video retrieval using sketch-based motion queries. SportSense is based on sports videos of games, enriched with an overlay of metadata that incorporates spatio-temporal information about various events and movements. We present how sketch-based motion queries are formulated and executed, as well as the use of various intuitive input interfaces to acquire the query object. The system uses spatio-temporal index structures to facilitate interactive response times.
