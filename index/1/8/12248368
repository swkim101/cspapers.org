In this paper we discuss issues of using students as subjects from the perspective of their benefits in terms of learning. We conduct interviews with students who participated in the experiments and present their perceptions of the experiments in order to validate the claims posed in the existing literature. Finally we show quantitative data on the rate of obtaining the distinctive pass grades for courses with and without experiments. The results show that integrating experiments with courses could lead to improvements of the performance of students on courses.
