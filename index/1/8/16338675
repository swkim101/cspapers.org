Nearly every computer science curriculum includes a course called "Discrete Structures" or "Discrete Mathematics". Over the past few years, considerable attention has been paid to this course in an attempt to overcome the misperception by students that the material is mathematics and not related to computer science. Most of these efforts deal with attempting to explicitly show students the application of discrete mathematics within computer science. We present an application that adds to the efforts of this community by giving instructors a modern, powerful, and elegant example to motivate student engagement in discrete structures.
