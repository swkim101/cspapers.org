This paper shows how the information structures found in textual documents can be used to infer topics in information Retrieval. The notion of topic includes the three following aspects from the fields of linguistics and discourse representation theories: thema (statutory analysis), gwen information (topic-focus articulation), and mtent:ons (discourse representation). Topic derivation rules are defined which consider two types of structural information: ltnguist:c structure, or the way text segments are put together, and discourse structure, dealkrg with the organization of ideas. Finally, an application of those ideas to TEI-based documents is discussed. Specializations of the topic derivation rules are defined for a TEI-representation. The use of cue words as intention markers is also considered in this representation.
