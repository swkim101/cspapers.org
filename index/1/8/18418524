INTRODUCTION Students in Computer Science are constantly asked to understand dynamic processes in the form of computer algorithms. Aside from a pseudocode or computer program implementation, a higher order description for the algorithm is usually conveyed in words, perhaps with a well-chosen picture or two. Unfortunately, computer code, words and individual pictures present only static descriptions, specific views or instances of a dynamic process. Perhaps the reason why some otherwise good students have trouble understanding code examples is that they are unable to translate such static descriptions to a dynamic process in their imagination.
