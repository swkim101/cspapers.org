WaveCluster is an important family of grid-based clustering algorithms that are capable of finding clusters of arbitrary shapes. In this paper, we investigate techniques to perform WaveCluster while ensuring differential privacy.Our goal is to develop a general technique for achieving differential privacy on WaveCluster that accommodates different wavelet transforms. We show that straightforward techniques based on synthetic data generation and introduction of random noise when quantizing the data, though generally preserving the distribution of data, often introduce too much noise to preserve useful clusters. We then propose two optimized techniques, PrivTHR and PrivTHRem, which can significantly reduce data distortion during two key steps of WaveCluster: the quantization step and the significant grid identification step. We conduct extensive experiments based on four datasets that are particularly interesting in the context of clustering, and show that PrivTHR and PrivTHRem achieve high utility when privacy budgets are properly allocated, conforming to our theoretical analysis.
