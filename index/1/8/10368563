In the last decade, consumer electronic devices such as smartphones, are packaged with small cameras, gyroscopes, and accelerometers, all sensors allowing autonomous deployment of aerial robots in GPS-denied environments. Our previous work [1], demonstrated the feasibility of using smartphones for autonomous flight. In many applications, there is a large interest to the use multiple autonomous aerial vehicles in a cooperative manner to speed up the operation of the mission. In this work, we present the first fully autonomous smartphone-based swarm of quadrotors. Multiple vehicles are able to plan safe trajectories avoiding inter-robot collisions, optimizing at the same time a given task and concurrently building in a cooperative manner a 3-D map of the environment. The sensing, sensor fusion, control, and planning are all done on an offthe- shelf Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone using just the single camera and IMU available on the phone. The work allows any consumer with multiple smartphones to autonomously drive a swarm of multiple vehicles without GPS, by downloading an app, and have the swarm cooperatively map a 3-D environment.
