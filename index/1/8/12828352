A framework is presented for hypermedia access to weather information originating from gridded data sets. The information is presented on different media (map, text, graph, table, image), depending on what aspect is emphasized. The user navigates by selecting an element that is already displayed, and a new product is generated that provides additional details about the selected element. The contents of a product is represented by a description, which is an organized chunk of assertions. Each assertion provides a single weather characteristic to a given region and time period. Three knowledge bases (weather, territory, and time models) define the objects participating in the assertions and drive the generation.
