Though there is a multitude of software modeling tools available, the handling of diagrams, which are an essential way of representation, is still difficult. To overcome these problems this PhD thesis investigates the usage of novel visualization and interaction techniques for the software development process, including multi-touch displays, the interaction through zoomable user interfaces and the integration of diagrams drawn by hand. The goal of the work is to create a technical framework which offers respective techniques for the creation of and navigation in software models.
