Image-based localization approaches aim to determine the camera pose from which an image was taken. Finding correct 2D-3D correspondences between query image features and 3D points in the scene model becomes harder as the size of the model increases. Current state-of-the-art methods therefore combine elaborate matching schemes with camera pose estimation techniques that are able to handle large fractions of wrong matches. In this work we study the benefits and limitations of spatial verification compared to appearance-based filtering. We propose a voting-based pose estimation strategy that exhibits O(n) complexity in the number of matches and thus facilitates to consider much more matches than previous approaches - whose complexity grows at least quadratically. This new outlier rejection formulation enables us to evaluate pose estimation for 1-to-many matches and to surpass the state-of-the-art. At the same time, we show that using more matches does not automatically lead to a better performance.
