We present an object recognition system which leverages the additional sensing and calibration information available in a robotics setting together with large amounts of training data to build high fidelity object models for a dataset of textured household objects. We then demonstrate how these models can be used for highly accurate detection and pose estimation in an end-to-end robotic perception system incorporating simultaneous segmentation, object classification, and pose fitting. The system can handle occlusions, illumination changes, multiple objects, and multiple instances of the same object. The system placed first in the ICRA 2011 Solutions in Perception instance recognition challenge. We believe the presented paradigm of building rich 3D models at training time and including depth information at test time is a promising direction for practical robotic perception systems.
