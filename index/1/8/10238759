NAND flash memory is being widely adopted as a storage medium for embedded devices. FTL (Flash Translation Layer) is one of the most essential software components in NAND flash-based embedded devices as it allows to use legacy files systems by emulating the traditional block device interface on top of NAND flash memory.
 In this paper, we propose a novel FTL, called μ-FTL. The main design goal of μ-FTL is to reduce the memory foot-print as small as possible, while providing the best performance by supporting multiple mapping granularities based on variable-sized extents. The mapping information is managed by μ-Tree, which offers an efficient index structure for NAND flash memory. Our evaluation results show that μ-FTL significantly outperforms other block-mapped FTLs with the same memory size by up to 89.7%.
