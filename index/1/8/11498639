In this paper, we firstly give an overview of the security perimeter in modern automotive systems and propose then a cost effective solution for authentication of communication data. The proposed solution provides end to end protection, it covers the aspects data content and generation time (freshness) and it can be implemented for different standard communication busses without a bus protocol change. Its low overhead makes it in particular suited for short data messages of real time systems, like messages on bandwidth restricted automotive buses.
