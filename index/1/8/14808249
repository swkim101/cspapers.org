Recognition of dynamic scenes based on shape information could be useful for various applications. In this study, we aimed at improving the resolution of three-dimensional (3D) data obtained from moving targets. We present a simple clean and robust method that jointly estimates motion parameters and a high-resolution 3D shape. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.
