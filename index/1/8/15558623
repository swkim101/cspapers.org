This paper describes the development of a small laboratory to serve as a prototype for a Data Communications Laboratory. We discuss the planning, construction, capabilities and use of the prototype lab by our three data communications courses. The capabilities and use of the lab in entry level microcomputer communications course, the entry level course, is demonstrated and explained, along with our plans for a larger lab in the near future based on a successful NSF-ILI grant request for additional equipment.
