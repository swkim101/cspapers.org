We present a general framework for incorporating sequential data and arbitrary features into language modeling. The general framework consists of two parts: a hidden Markov component and a recursive neural network component. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by applying it to a specific application: predicting topics and sentiments in dialogues. Experiments on real data demonstrate that our method is substantially more accurate than previ-
