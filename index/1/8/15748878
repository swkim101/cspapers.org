For any positive integer k, the total k-domatic partition problem is to partition the vertices of a graph G into k pairwise disjoint total dominating sets. In this paper, we study the problem for planar graphs, chordal bipartite graphs, convex bipartite graphs, and bipartite permutation graphs. We show that the total 3-domatic partition problem on planar graphs is NP-complete. Moreover, we give an alternative algorithm to solve the total k-domatic partition problem for chordal bipartite graphs with weak elimination orderings, and adapt it to solve the problem in linear time for bipartite permutation graphs and convex bipartite graphs even if Gamma-free forms of the adjacency matrices of the considered graphs are not given.
