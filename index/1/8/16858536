This paper presents a three-step dependency parser to parse Chinese deterministically. By dividing a sentence into several parts and parsing them separately, it aims to reduce the error propagation coming from the greedy characteristic of deterministic parsing. Experimental results showed that compared with the deterministic parser which parsed a sentence in sequence, the proposed parser achieved extremely significant improvement on dependency accuracy.
