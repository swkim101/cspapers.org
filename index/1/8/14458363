We show that any rectilinear polygonal subdivision in the plane can be converted into a " guillotine " subdivision whose length is at most twice that of the original subdivision. " Guillotine " subdivisions have a simple recursive structure that allows one to search for " optimal " such subdivisions in polynomial time, using dynamic programming. In particular , a consequence of our main theorem is a very simple proof that the k-MST problem in the plane has a constant factor polynomial-time approximation algorithm, and the constant factor that we obtain is a substantial improvement over all previous bounds: We obtain a factor of 2 for the Ll metric, and a factor of 2fi for the Lz (Euclidean) metric.
