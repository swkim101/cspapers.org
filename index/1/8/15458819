This paper deals with statistical databases that are generated from statistical surveys and that reside in organizations which perform a large number of surveys--some of which are repetitive. Examples of such organizations are Federal statistical agencies such as the Energy Information Administration, Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Center for Educational Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics, etc; state governments that have bureaus or departments that collect such data; and marketing research departments of most large consumer-oriented companies. Computer processing has provided a powerful tool for storing, manipulating, and analyzing statistical survey data. However, in addition to these advantages, computing has created a major problem in that most data analysts and users have lost touch with the data and their generation. They no longer have the feel and sense for the data that once was possible. In this paper we present an approach to database design that will directly attack this problem and enhance the usefulness of such databases as well.
