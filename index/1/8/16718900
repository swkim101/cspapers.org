The purpose of this paper is to suggest that quantifiers in natural languages do not have a fixed truth functional meaning as has long been held in logical semantics. Instead we suggest that quantifiers can best be modeled as complex inference procedures that are highly dynamic and sensitive to the linguistic context, as well as time and memory constraints.
