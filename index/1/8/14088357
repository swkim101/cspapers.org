Assessing the connectivity of Wireless Sensor Networks in the specific environment in which they are deployed is crucial to develop reliable system services and understand their behavior. In this demo, we introduce Trident, a tool that measures communication with an untethered infrastructure. It enables the execution of connectivity experiments "in the wild", supporting also the sharing of the gathered results.
