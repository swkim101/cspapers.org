As a promising nonvolatile memory technology, Phase Change Memory (PCM) has many advantages over traditional DRAM. Multi-level Cell PCM (MLC) has the benefit of increased memory capacity with low fabrication cost. Due to high per-cell write power and long write latency, MLC PCM requires careful power management to ensure write reliability. Unfortunately, existing power management schemes applied to MLC PCM result in low write throughput and large performance degradation. In this paper, we propose Fine-grained write Power Budgeting (FPB) for MLC PCM. We first identify two major problems for MLC write operations: (i) managing write power without consideration of the iterative write process used by MLC is overly pessimistic, (ii) a heavily written (hot) chip may block the memory from accepting further writes due to chip power restrictions, although most chips may be available. To address these problems, we propose two FPB schemes. First, FPB-IPM observes a global power budget and regulates power across write iterations according to the step-down power demand of each iteration. Second, FPB-GCP integrates a global charge pump on a DIMM to boost power for hot PCM chips while staying within the global power budget. Our experimental results show that these techniques achieve significant improvement on write throughput and system performance. Our schemes also interact positively with PCM effective read latency reduction techniques, such as write cancellation, write pausing and write truncation.
