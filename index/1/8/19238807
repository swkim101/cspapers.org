Welcome to the proceedings of the 41st ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, or SIGCSE 2010. Contained within you will find the archival record of over one hundred papers as well as multiple other session formats that change Computer Science education by bringing together researchers, educators, students, tool creators, textbook authors and publishers, and the many other groups that improve learning in our field. SIGCSE 2010 celebrates and encourages the connections we make as we discuss the challenges and excitement of computer science education, which is why this is SIGCSE's thematic year for "Making Contact". We hope the theme also applies as we all return to our everyday activities: maintain contact with the community you create at SIGCSE and make contact with the students whose learning is the heart and end goal of our efforts! 
 
We are pleased to announce the winners of the two annual SIGCSE awards. Sally Fincher of the University of Kent will receive the SIGCSE award for Outstanding Contribution to CS Education, and will provide the opening keynote. Distinguished Professor Peter Denning of the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey will accept the SIGCSE Award for Lifetime Service to the CS Education Community and speak at our First Timer's Lunch. In addition, we've invited two keynote speakers to discuss the future of pedagogy and technology: Carl E. Wieman--Director of the Carl Wieman Science Education Initiative and Professor of Physics at the University of British Columbia and Director of the Science Education Initiative and Distinguished Professor of Physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder--will give Friday's address on "Science Education for the 21st Century: Using the Insights of Science to Teach/Learn Science." Michael Wrinn--Manager of Innovative Software Education at Intel Corporation--will address Saturday's concluding luncheon on "Suddenly, All Computing Is Parallel: Seizing Opportunity Amid the Clamor."
