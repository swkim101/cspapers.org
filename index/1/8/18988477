D2RQ is a popular RDB-to-RDF mapping platform that supports mapping relational databases to RDF and posing SPARQL queries to these relational databases. However, D2RQ merely provides a read-only RDF view on relational databases. Thus, we introduce D2RQ/Update---an extension of D2RQ to enable executing SPARQL/Update statements on the mapped data, and to facilitate the creation of a read-write Semantic Web.
