Often underlying discussions with those who are not professional computer scientists is the idea that computer scientists are programmers and programmers make tools. Yet many computer science professionals view themselves primarily as scientists, with programs being used to create and express a deeper understanding of computation. This Birds of a Feather session discusses how participants can effectively bridge the gap between toolmaker and scientist views, either through modifying their own view or changing the viewpoint of others. Topics include: participants' personal balance between how they view themselves as scientists and toolmakers; how to encourage students to see themselves as scientists and toolmakers in balance; how to effectively conduct group work with a variety of viewpoints present; how student motivation interacts with how they see themselves as computer scientists; and other viewpoints that exist about what it means to be a computer scientist. Computer scientists and non-computer scientists welcome. Laptop not recommended.
