We show that a practical translation of MRS descriptions into normal dominance constraints is feasible. We start from a recent theoretical translation and verify its assumptions on the outputs of the English Resource Grammar (ERG) on the Redwoods corpus. The main assumption of the translation---that all relevant underspecified descriptions are nets---is validated for a large majority of cases; all non-nets computed by the ERG seem to be systematically incomplete.
