This paper presents a simulation study of a video-on-demand system. We present video server algorithms for real-time disk scheduling, prefetching, and buffer pool management. The performance of these algorithms is compared against the performance of simpler algorithms such as elevator and round-robin disk scheduling and global LRU buffer pool management. Finally, we show that the SPIFFI video-on-demand system scales nearly linearly as the number of disks, videos, and terminals is increased.
