We propose a novel approach for solving unary SAS+ planning problems. This approach extends an SAS+ instance with new state variables representing intentions about how each original state variable will be used or changed next, and splits the original actions into several stages of intention followed by eventual execution. The result is a new SAS+ instance with the same basic solutions as the original. While the transformed problem is larger, it has additional structure that can be exploited to reduce the branching factor, leading to reachable state spaces that are many orders of magnitude smaller (and hence much faster planning) in several test domains with acyclic causal graphs.
