Calliope is a distributed multimedia server constructed from personal computers. Preliminary performance measurements indicate that Calliope can be scaled from a single PC producing about 22 MPEG-1 video streams to hundreds of PCs producing thousands of streams. The system can store both variable-and constant-rate video and audio encodings and can deliver them over any network supported by the underlying operating system. Calliope is cost-effective because it requires only commodity hardware and portable because it runs under Unix.
