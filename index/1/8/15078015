We propose Symbolic heuristic search value iteration (Symbolic HSVI) algorithm, which extends the heuristic search value iteration (HSVI) algorithm in order to handle factored partially observable Markov decision processes (factored POMDPs). The idea is to use algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) for compactly representing the problem itself and all the relevant intermediate computation results in the algorithm. We leverage Symbolic Perseus for computing the lower bound of the optimal value function using ADD operators, and provide a novel ADD-based procedure for computing the upper bound. Experiments on a number of standard factored POMDP problems show that we can achieve an order of magnitude improvement in performance over previously proposed algorithms.
