The interaction of suffixing algorithms and ranking techniques in retrieval performance, particularly in an online environment, was investigated. Three general purpose suffixing algorithms were used for retrieval on the Cranfield 1400, Medlars, and CACM collections, and the results analysed with several standard evaluation measures. An examination of the retrieval performance using suffixing suggested two modifications to ranking techniques: variable weighting of word variants and selective stemming depending on query length. The experimental data is presented, and the limitations of suffixing in an online environment is discussed.
