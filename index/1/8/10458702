We report on our design of Curated City, a website that lets people build their own personal guide to the city's neighborhoods by chronicling their favorite experiences. Although users make their own personal guides, they are immersed in a social curatorial experience where they are influenced directly and indirectly by the guides of others. We use a 2-week field trial involving 20 residents of Pittsburgh as a technological probe to explore the initial design decisions, and we further refine the design landscape through subject interviews. Based on this study, we identify a set of design recommendations for building scalable social platforms for curating the experiences of the city.
