Numerous Built-In Self Testing (BIST) designs now exist for the testing of Programmable Logic Arrays (PLA), but their practical usefulness has not been studied. In this paper, we implement and compare several BIST designs using a common methodology of implementation. We also perform an yield analysis to characterize the yield degradation due to the BIST design methodology. Our preliminary findings of this work is that BIST approach results in considerable degradation of yield, and therefore may not be suitable as a test vehicle for PLAs.
