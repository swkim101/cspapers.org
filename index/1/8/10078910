Modern computer hardware does still interpret machine languages, which are not very far from the von Neumann paradigm. To illustrate the possibilities of hardware structures directly interpreting a high level language (HLL) we report on a BASIC computer, “Abacus”, constructed in this laboratory. Design considerations to obtain hardware which utilizes the parallelism inherent in HLL statements are given. The execution of numerical test programs is roughly twice as fast on Abacus as compiled on a conventional minicomputer.
