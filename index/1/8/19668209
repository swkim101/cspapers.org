Pythy is a web-based programming environment for Python that eliminates software-related barriers to entry for novice programmers, such as installing an IDE or the Python runtime. Using only a web browser, within minutes students can begin writing code, watch it run, and access support materials and tutorials. While there are a number of web-based Python teaching tools, Pythy differs in several respects: it manages student assignment work, including deadlines, turn-in, and grading; it supports live, interactive code examples that instructors can write and students can explore; it provides auto-saving of student work in the cloud, with full, transparent version control; and it supports media-computation-style projects that manipulate images and sounds. Pythy provides a complete ecosystem for student learning, with a user interface that follows a more familiar web browsing model, rather than a developer-focused IDE interface. An evaluation compares student perceptions of Pythy in relation to JES, another student-friendly beginner Python environment. Classroom experiences indicate that Pythy does reduce the novice obstacles that it aims to address.
