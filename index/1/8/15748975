It is important for learning that students receive enough of educational feedback of their work. To get the students to be seriously disposed to the feedback it has to be personal, objective and consistent. In large classes ensuring such feedback can be difficult. Grading rubrics are a solution to the objectivity and consistency.
 ALOHA is an online grading tool based on rubrics which all the graders have to use. Particularly, ALOHA provides features that make the grading process more convenient for the graders and the teacher. By facilitating the graders work ALOHA allows them to focus more on feedback writing.
 To test the effectiveness of ALOHA in objectivity and consistency we did a comparative statistical analysis on the distribution of grades. The results supported the assumptions showing improvement resulting in similar distribution of grades amongst different graders who used the tool.
