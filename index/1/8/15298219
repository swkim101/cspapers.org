Visual exploration of large relational datasets is always a challenge for exploratory analysis and has immediate applications in data mining, information classification and information retrieval. n23Tool is a tool designed for interactive exploratory visualization of large relational datasets and data clusters. It employs the grand tour method to view multidimensional data through 3D dynamic projections. A 3D cluster-guided tour could be designed to display data clusters where path of the tour is determined by cluster centroids. The cluster-guided tour makes inter-clusterdistance-preserving projections in the perspectives that clusters are displayed as separate as possible. n23Tool supports the visualization of very large relational datasets by using volume rendering through texture splatting. Only aggregations or parts of data needed for rendering are retrieved from databases. n23Tool can process continuous variables as well as categorical variables. This approach of multidimensional visualization provides a natural metaphor to visualize large datasets and data clusters by mapping the data onto a timeindexed family of 3D linear projections suitable for human eyeâ€™s exploration.
