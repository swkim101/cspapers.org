We present a novel approach to deal with transitions while performing a sequence of dynamic tasks with a humanoid robot. The simultaneous achievement of several tasks cannot be ensured, so we use a strategy based on weights to represent their relative importance. The robot interacts with a changing environment, and the input torques are different depending on whether the robot performs tasks in a constrained state (e.g. in contact) or not. We develop a solution with smooth weights variations and transitional tasks which avoids sharp torque evolutions. In order to validate this approach, simulations are carried out on a virtual iCub robot which is assigned the realization of a complex mission involving various changing tasks.
