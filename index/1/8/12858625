Due to aging, circuit reliability has become extraordinary challenging. Reliability-aware circuit design flows do virtually not exist and even research is in its infancy. In this paper, we propose to bring aging awareness to EDA tool flows based on so-called degradation-aware cell libraries. These libraries include detailed delay information of gates/cells under the impact that aging has on both threshold voltage (Vth) and carrier mobility (μ) of transistors. This is unlike state of the art which considers Vth only. We show how ignoring ß degradation leads to underestimating guard-bands by 19% on average. Our investigation revealed that the impact of aging is strongly dependent on the operating conditions of gates (i.e. input signal slew and output load capacitance), and not solely on the duty cycle of transistors. Neglecting this fact results in employing insufficient guard-bands and thus not sustaining reliability during lifetime. We demonstrate that degradation-aware libraries and tool flows are indispensable for not only accurately estimating guardbands, but also efficiently containing them. By considering aging degradations during logic synthesis, significantly more resilient circuits can be obtained. We further quantify the impact of aging on the degradation of image processing circuits. This goes far beyond investigating aging with respect to path delays solely. We show that in a standard design without any guardbanding, aging leads to unacceptable image quality after just one year. By contrast, if the synthesis tool is provided with the degradation-aware cell library, high image quality is sustained for 10 years (even under worst-case aging and without a guardband). Hence, using our approach, aging can be effectively suppressed.
