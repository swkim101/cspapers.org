The growing shortage of skilled professionals in cybersecurity and forensics has increased global demand for information systems professionals. To identify and attract more students to cybersecurity and forensics programs, the authors developed a game engine along with a sequence of entertaining, engaging, and educational games, suitable for forensics and cybersecurity courses. This paper focuses on the design and development of a modular educational game framework composed of a game engine and a GUI-based game creator. Following narrative and storylines of the game via interactive dialogs and visualized abstract concepts, students are motivated and engaged to obtain the necessary knowledge. Students will also develop their problem solving skills by using real tools and technologies while playing the game. The GUI-based game creator allows educators to create and develop new educational games by only focusing on game content.
