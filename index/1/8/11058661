This paper aims at leveraging microblogs to address two challenges in music information retrieval (MIR), similarity estimation between music artists and inferring typical listening patterns at different granularity levels (city, country, global). From two collections of several million microblogs, which we gathered over ten months, music-related information is extracted and statistically analyzed. We propose and evaluate four co-occurrence-based methods to compute artist similarity scores. Moreover, we derive and analyze culture-specific music listening patterns to investigate the diversity of listening behavior around the world.
