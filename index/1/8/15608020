Existing taxonomies of computer architecture lack the descriptive tools to deal with the large variety of existing principles, features, and mechanisms of the existing spectrum of single processor, multi processor, and multi computer architectures. Consequently, they lack the discriminating power to be able to taxonomize computer architecture. In the paper, a new approach toward a complete taxonomy is presented. The key to the taxonomy is to start with the dichotomy of 'operational principle' and 'hardware structure' as the foundation of a computer architecture and describe the constituents of the operational principle in terms of 'machine data types' consisting of 'machine data objects', their representations, and the functions applicable on the objects. The resulting taxonomy provides a systematic approach to the design of innovative computer architectures.
