The idea is to trace features of the underlying MIP model and to base search decisions on the features of the current subproblem to be solved. We show how such a system can be trained efficiently by introducing minimal learning bias that traditional model-based machine learning approaches rely on. Experiments on a highly heterogeneous collection of set partitioning instances show significant gains over dynamic search guidance in Cplex as well as instance-specifically tuned pure search heuristics.
