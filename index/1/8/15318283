An automatic placement algorithm for standard cell and polycell LSI is described, which is constructed on the basis of heuristics for a set of interrelated placement subproblems. The algorithm is incorporated into a hierarchical layout system intended not only for standard cell and polycell LSI but for general cell LSI, by which standard cell and polycell LSI have begun to be laid out in practice. A part of implementation results are also shown to reveal how high the layout performance of the placement program.
