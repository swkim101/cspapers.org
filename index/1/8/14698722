Email usage is pervasive among people from different backgrounds, and email corpus can be an important data source to study intricate social structures. Social status and role analysis on a personal email network can help reveal hidden information. The availability of Sarah Palin's email corpus presents a great opportunity to study social statuses and social roles in an email network. However, the email corpus does not readily lend itself to social network analysis due to problems such as noisy email data, scale in size, and temporal constraints. In this paper, we report an initial investigation of social status and role analysis on Sarah Palin's email corpus. In particular, we conduct a preliminary study on Palin's social statuses and roles. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first exploration of Sarah Palin's email corpus recently released by the state of Alaska.
