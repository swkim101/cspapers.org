The retrieval effectiveness of the underlying document search component of an expert search engine can have an important impact on the effectiveness of the generated expert search results. In this large-scale study, we perform novel experiments in the context of the document search and expert search tasks of the TREC Enterprise track, to measure the influence that the performance of the document ranking has on the ranking of candidate experts. In particular, we show, using real and simulated document rankings, that while the expert search system performance is related to the relevance of the retrieved documents, surprisingly, it is not always the case that increasing document search effectiveness causes an increase in expert search performance.
