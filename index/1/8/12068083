There are many different views about how to incorporate writing into the computer science curriculum. These views lead to inevitable questions about process and goals. For example, should writing be taught as a separate course or integrated into traditional content classes? How much latitude should students be given in selecting writing component courses? Should writing focus on developing research skills, workplace skills or personal growth? Who should perform assessment: individual faculty, small teams or the whole department? How can a CS educator assess writing ability – where does one even start? Our panel members will answer these questions differently, sharing both successes and challenges. We represent a large public research university, a small public liberal arts university, a private women’s liberal arts college, and a small private co-educational liberal arts college.
