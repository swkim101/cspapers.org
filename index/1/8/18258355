New telecommunication services and mobility networks have introduced databases in telecommunication networks. Compared with traditional use of databases, telecom databases must fulfill very tough requirements on response time, throughput, and availability. ClustRa is a telecom database prototype developed to run on standard workstations interconnected by an ATM switch. To meet the throughput and real-time response requirements, ClustRa is a main memory database with neighbor main, memory logging. Transactions are executed in parallel. To meet the availability requirements, we use a 2-safe replication scheme over two sites with independent failure modes, a novel declustering strategy, early detection of failures with fast takeover, and by on-line self-repair and maintenance. This paper gives an overview of ClustRa and includes a set of performance measurements.
