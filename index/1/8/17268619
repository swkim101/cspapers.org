This paper describes efforts to use industry wireless software development practices in the classroom. Nokia's OK Java 2 Platform Micro Edition (J2ME) application certification program was chosen for use in a core set of wireless software engineering courses. The adaptation process included 1) modifying Nokia OK application standards for classroom use as examples of what is expected of industry-quality software; 2) incorporating Nokia OK software development tools into a student-friendly software development environment; and 3) implementing in-house Nokia OK certification procedures as a basis for assessing student projects and providing feedback.
