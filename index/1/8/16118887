Congestion control is an important problem in high-speed computer networks. Networks must limit the packet load that they accept to avoid excessive packet loss and delay. Hosts must limit their transmission rates to match what the network can handle at any given time or else suffer high packet drop rates. Rate-based congestion control schemes control network load by regulating the rate of packet transmission into the network. In this paper, we propose the use of loss-load curves to characterize the networkâ€™s packet delivery service to the clients of the network. For a given sender, the loss-load curve expresses the probability of packet loss as a function of offered load at a given time or load condition in the network. Using this information, a sender chooses its own tradeoff between throughput and packet loss. To illustrate the approach, we present and evaluate a specific loss-load algorithm. The algorithm is designed to encourage sender cooperation, to provide protection from misbehaving senders, and to keep offered load close to network capacity at all times. Our analytic and simulation results show that the algorithm converges, without oscillation, to a small and stable overload, and that it provides a bounded and predictable level of packet loss to cooperating senders.
