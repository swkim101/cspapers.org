In the development of substantial integrated computer-aided design systems, one of the most crucial features is the creation of purpose-made data structures. These have to be designed with growth and change in mind and in the course of the design process can reach a substantial size. They form the central source and design information about a particular product. They are used to generate drawings, assembly information schedules etc. for production purposes as well as being the data source and repository of results for integral analytical and detail design procedures. This paper outlines some of ARC's work in the creation, implementation and use of such data structures.
