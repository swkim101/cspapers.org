Recently, several latent topic analysis methods such as LSI, pLSI, and LDA have been widely used for text analysis. However, those methods basically assign topics to words, but do not account for the events in a document. With this background, in this paper, we propose a latent topic extracting method which assigns topics to events. We also show that our proposed method is useful to generate a document summary based on a latent topic.
