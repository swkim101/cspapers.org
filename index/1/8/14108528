The sheer volume of scholarly publications available online significantly challenges how scholars retrieve the new information available and locate the candidate reference papers. While classical text retrieval and pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) algorithms can assist scholars in accessing needed publications, in this study, we propose an innovative publication ranking method with PRF by leveraging a number of meta-paths on the heterogeneous bibliographic graph. Different meta-paths on the graph address different ranking hypotheses, whereas the pseudo-relevant papers (from the retrieval results) are used as the seed nodes on the graph. Meanwhile, unlike prior studies, we propose "restricted meta-path" facilitated by a new context-rich heterogeneous network extracted from full-text publication content along with citation context. By using learning-to-rank, we integrate 18 different meta-path-based ranking features to derive the final ranking scores for candidate cited papers. Experimental results with ACM full-text corpus show that meta-path-based ranking with PRF on the new graph significantly (p < 0.0001) outperforms text retrieval algorithms with text-based or PageRank-based PRF.
