For small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to operate indoor, in urban canyons or other scenarios where signals from global navigation satellite systems are denied or impaired, alternative estimation and control strategies must be applied. In this paper a system is proposed that estimates the self-motion and wind velocity by fusing information from airspeed sensors, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a monocular camera. Such estimates can be used in control systems for managing wind disturbances or chemical plume-based tracking strategies. Simulation results indicate that while the inertial dead-reckoning process is subject to drift, the system is capable of separating the self-motion and wind velocity from the airspeed information.
