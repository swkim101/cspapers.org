In this work, we study keyphrase extraction from research papers by leveraging citation networks. We propose CiteTextRank for keyphrase extraction from research articles, a graph-based algorithm that incorporates evidence from both a document's content as well as the contexts in which the document is referenced within a citation network. Our model obtains significant improvements over the state-of-the-art models for this task. Specifically, on several datasets of research papers, CiteTextRank improves precision at rank 1 by as much as 9-20% over state-of-the-art baselines.
