We present first fully dynamic subquadratic algorithms for: computing maximum matching size, computing maximum bipartite matching weight, computing maximum number of vertex disjoint <i>s, t</i> paths and testing directed vertex <i>k</i>-connectivity of the graph. The presented algorithms are randomized. The algorithms for maximum matching size and disjoint paths support operations in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>1.495</sup>) time. The algorithm for computing the maximum bipartite matching weight maintains the graph with integer edge weights from the set 1,..., <i>W</i> in <i>O</i>(<i>W</i><sup>2.495</sup><i>n</i><sup>1.495</sup>) time. The algorithm for testing directed vertex <i>k</i>-connectivity supports updates in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>1.575</sup> + <i>nk</i><sup>2</sup>) time. For all of these problems the presented dynamic algorithms break the input size barrier --- <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>).
 As a side result we obtain a dynamic algorithm for the dynamic maintenance of the rank of the matrix that support updates in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>1.495</sup>) time.
