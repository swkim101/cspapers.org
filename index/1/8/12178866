We present novel Localized sElf-reconfiGuration algOrithms (LEGO) for a multi-radio wireless mesh network to autonomously and effectively recover from wireless link failures. First, LEGO locally detects link failures by accurately monitoring the network condition and, upon detection of a failure, triggers network reconfiguration. Second, it dynamically forms/deforms a local group for cooperative network reconfiguration among local mesh routers in a fully-distributed manner. Next, LEGO intelligently generates a local network reconfiguration plan through which a thus-formed group recovers from local failures, while keeping network changes to minimum. Finally, by figuring local channel utilization and reconfiguration cost in its planning, LEGO maximizes the network's ability to meet diverse links' QoS demands. LEGO has been implemented on a Linux-based system and experimented on a reallife testbed, demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering from link failures and its improvement of channel efficiency by up to 92%.
