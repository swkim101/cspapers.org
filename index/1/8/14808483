In this paper, we investigate the mobile charging in rechargeable sensor networks. By utilizing the historic charging information, the mobile charger can prefetch the charging requests from sensor nodes before they are sent out, and thus both the charging latency of sensor nodes and the travel distance of mobile charger can be reduced. Furthermore, by controlling the amount of energy to charge to nodes, the energy synchronization of sensor nodes can be achieved, which proactively adjust the arrival order of charging requests at the mobile charger. Combining these ideas, a novel charging scheme with verified efficiency is proposed.
