We want to design adequate computer-based systems helping mankind in its life. To be adequate implies to be useful, correct and efficient. As characteristic of our civilization, such design activity is to be steered by scientific and technical constraints: ships rarely sink during testing or debugging. Hence, we aim at the scientific engineering of software: recall that science is “systematic and formulated knowledge” (Oxford English Dictionary 1982). The industry of software production, which is the first intellectual industry in history, must become a precision industry. In the light of the past 21 years, it is unwise to forecast what the situation will be within 12 years. I, rather, sketch a picture of a possible, but not certain, future.
