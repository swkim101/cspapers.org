We present here an analysis of the stochastic neurodynamics of a neural network composed of three-state neurons described by a master equation. An outer-product representation of the master equation is employed. In this representation, an extension of the analysis from two to three-state neurons is easily performed. We apply this formalism with approximation schemes to a simple three-state network and compare the results with Monte Carlo simulations.
