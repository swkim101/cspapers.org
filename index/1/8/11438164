Distant supervision has attracted recent interest for training information extraction systems because it does not require any human annotation but rather employs existing knowledge bases to heuristically label a training corpus. However, previous work has failed to address the problem of false negative training examples mislabeled due to the incompleteness of knowledge bases. To tackle this problem, we propose a simple yet novel framework that combines a passage retrieval model using coarse features into a state-of-the-art relation extractor using multi-instance learning with fine features. We adapt the information retrieval technique of pseudorelevance feedback to expand knowledge bases, assuming entity pairs in top-ranked passages are more likely to express a relation. Our proposed technique significantly improves the quality of distantly supervised relation extraction, boosting recall from 47.7% to 61.2% with a consistently high level of precision of around 93% in the experiments.
