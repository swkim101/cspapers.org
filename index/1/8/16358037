A common form of live technical presentation is that given by programmers for a programming audience during conferences, demonstrations, code reviews, and tutorials. Such presentations require manual switching between general presentation software and the integrated development environment (IDE), as well as reconfiguration of the IDE's UI to be readable by an audience. In this paper, we present a novel system that allows programmers to easily combine traditional slideware with seamless transitions to user-specified regions of the IDE along with special effects for live demonstration.
