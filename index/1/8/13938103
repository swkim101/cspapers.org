In this paper, we present BabyOS, a compact educational kernel designed to facilitate the preliminary learning of operating systs. It is an in-mory syst running on real hardware, with a multi-phase project covering concurrency, scheduling, inter-process communication, mory management, and networking. Compared with other educational operating systs, BabyOS is a nontraditional project frame; an important distinction lies in that it reflects some design ideas in bedded operating systs. In this way, BabyOS provides a complentary approach to educational operating syst projects.
