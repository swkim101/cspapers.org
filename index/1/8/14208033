In some integration applications, users are allowed to import data from heterogeneous sources, but are not allowed to update source data directly. Imported data may be inconsistent, and even when inconsistencies are detected and solved, these changes may not be propagated to the sources due to their update policies. Therefore, they continue to provide the same inconsistent data in the future until the proper authority updates them. In this paper, we propose PrInt, a model that supports user's decisions on cleaning data to be automatically reapplied in subsequent integration processes. By reproducing previous decisions, the user may focus only on new inconsistencies originated from source modified data. The reproducibility provided by PrInt is based on logging, and by incorporating data provenance in the integration process.
