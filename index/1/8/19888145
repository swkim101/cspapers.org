Electronic System-Level design has arrived - but can ESL provide the bridge from systems to silicon? Comprised of real world designers, this DAC ESL panel will examine and debate what works, what doesn't, and what the gaps are in the methodology and tool offerings. Panelists from a variety of industry segments, including Military/aerospace, storage area networks (SAN), wireless communications and consumer electronics, will share their experiences, lessons learned and further needs.Does ESL bridge the gap between systems to silicon? Hear from designers about their real world experience with ESL. What worked according to expectations? What didn't? What are the gaps in the methodology and tool offerings that need to be filled, and why?This panel of ESL design methodology users will give us a "reality check" that will enable potential users to make an adoption decision, and enable ESL design tool suppliers to evaluate their product strategies against "big picture" requirements.
