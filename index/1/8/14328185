Designing good user interfaces is a difficult, ill-defined task. A number of interface-design approaches have been tried in recent years, ranging from the application of interface standards and quidelines to the use of simplified information-processing theories borrowed from cognitive psychology. To the dismay of those who advocate interface standards, consistency is not the same thing as usability and current information-processing theories are already too simple to explain much of human behavior or be of any practical use to interface designers. Although we do believe that the practice of interface design will eventually come to rely on empirically-based theories of user behavior, the ‘cut and try’ methodology supported by MlRAGE is the most effective approach available, particularly given the current product development process. Although it is true that efforts are under way to fundamentally change the development process in order to place greater emphasis on user considerations, such organizational changes take time and will demaud major advances in the field of human-computer interaction, In lieu of acceptable alternatives, user testing remains an essential aspect of interface design. Rapid Interface Prototyping (RIP) is a methodology that facilitates user testing and exploits the skills of interface designers while, at the same time, accommodating the requirements of the system development process as it exists today.
