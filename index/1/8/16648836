We present the first English syllabification system to improve the accuracy of letter-tophoneme conversion. We propose a novel discriminative approach to automatic syllabification based on structured SVMs. In comparison with a state-of-the-art syllabification system, we reduce the syllabification word error rate for English by 33%. Our approach also performs well on other languages, comparing favorably with published results on German and Dutch.
