A system that can deliver tactile sensation despite an object existing between an actuator and human was developed. This system composed of a control part, power part, output part, and coil. The control part controls the overall system using a microcontroller. The power part generates electric current to create a magnetic field. The output part delivers high energies to the coil. The coil generates a time-varying magnetic field to induce current flow within the body. Through the tactile sensation recognition test, delivery of tactile sensation was confirmed in the air even an object existed between actuator and human skin.
