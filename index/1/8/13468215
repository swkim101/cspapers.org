The increasing dependence on computers for critical infrastructures essential for the functioning of a society and its economy has given rise to host of ethical, social, and legal issues. The ability to make sound ethical decisions is thus an important part of Computing and Software engineerâ€™s professional skills. This paper argues for the significance of teaching professional, social and ethical issues in Software Engineering in a Swedish context and practice. Examples are presented of teaching materials and experiences from the course Professional Ethics in Science and Engineering at Malardalen University, and the PIFF project for support of Software Engineering Master Theses running at Malardalen University, Blekinge Institute of Technology and Lund University.
