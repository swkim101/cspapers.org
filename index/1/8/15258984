We describe the architecture of a class of machines intended to solve computationally intensive problems much faster than can today's machines, at no increase in cost.
 We have investigated the programming of the BVM for several interesting algorithms on a BVM of 2k bit positions per register. More theoretical study of implementations of such highly parallel algorithms is motivated.
