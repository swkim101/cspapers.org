Android malware has been found on various third-party online markets, which poses drastic threats to mobile users in terms of security and privacy. Machine learning is one of the promising approaches to discriminate the malicious applications from the benign ones. Despite its higher malware detection capability, a significant challenge remains: in adversarial environment, an attacker can adapt by maximally sabotaging classifiers by polluting training data. This paper proposes KuafuDet, a two-phase learning enhancing approach that adversarially detects the Android malware. Experiments on more than 50,000 Android applications demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.
