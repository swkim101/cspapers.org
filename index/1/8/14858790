The Wizard of Oz technique (WOz) is an experimental evaluation mechanism. It allows the observation of a user operating an apparently fully functioning system whose missing services are supplemented by a hidden wizard. NEIMO is a multimodal WOz platform including four modalities: two-dimensional manual gesture (mouse), written and spoken natural language and visual interpretation of the subject’s face. A sub-system, NEIMOVision, is responsible for the visual interpretation of the face. It’s functionalities are to normalize the image intensity, locate the face position, orientation and size, identify the subject, detect the direction of gaze, analyse the facial expression and detect speech acts. These functionalities are mainly based on the Eigenface technique developped by Turk [Turk 91]. Demonstration pprograms based on face recognition have been implemented on a Macintosh Quadra 700 equiped with a small CCD camera. At the same time we are currently studying other technical issues related to the integration of vision as an HCI mode. We are using this system to investigate the requirements in computing power, the trade-offs between resolution and processing speed, the use of active vision, the possible extensions to hand-tracking and the role of visual processing as a source of HCI modalities.
