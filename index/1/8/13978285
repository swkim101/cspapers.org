Weblint is a utility for checking the syntax and style of HTML pages. It was inspired by lint [15], which performs a similar function for C and C++ programmers. Weblint does not aspire to be a strict SGML validator, but to provide helpful comments for humans. The importance of quality assurance for web sites is introduced, and one particular area, validation of HTML, is described in more detail. The bulk of the paper is devoted to weblint: what it is, how it is used, and the design and implementation of the current development version.
