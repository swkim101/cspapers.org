However, far more common is a construction in which the entire subordinate clause is extraposed: Weil ich ti versprochen habe, [das Fahrrad zu reparieren]i. In addition, a third construction is possible, which has been called the "third construction", in which only the embedded verb, but not its nominal argument has been extraposed: Weil ich das Fahrrad ti versprochen habe [zu reparieren]i, A similar construction can also be observed ff there are two levels of embedding. In this case, the number of possible word orders increases from 3 to 30, 6 of which are shown in Figure 1. Of the 30 sentences, 7 are clearly ungrammatical (marked "*"), and 3 are extremely marginal, but not "flat out" (marked "?*"). The remaining 20 are acceptable to a greater or lesser degree (marked "ok" or "?"). No attempt has been made in the linguistic or computational literature to account for this full range of data.
