Determining the stance expressed by an author from a post written for a twosided debate in an online debate forum is a relatively new problem. We seek to improve Anand et al.â€™s (2011) approach to debate stance classification by modeling two types of soft extra-linguistic constraints on the stance labels of debate posts, user-interaction constraints and ideology constraints. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of these inter-post constraints in improving debate stance classification.
