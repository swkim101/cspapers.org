We propose a novel deep neural network that is both lightweight and effectively structured for model parallelization. Our network, which we name as SplitNet, automatically learns to split the network weights into either a set or a hierarchy of multiple groups that use disjoint sets of features, by learning both the class-to-group and feature-to-group assignment matrices along with the network weights. This produces a treestructured network that involves no connection between branched subtrees of semantically disparate class groups. SplitNet thus greatly reduces the number of parameters and required computations, and is also embarrassingly modelparallelizable at test time, since the evaluation for each subnetwork is completely independent except for the shared lower layer weights that can be duplicated over multiple processors, or assigned to a separate processor. We validate our method with two different deep network models (ResNet and AlexNet) on two datasets (CIFAR-100 and ILSVRC 2012) for image classification, on which our method obtains networks with significantly reduced number of parameters while achieving comparable or superior accuracies over original full deep networks, and accelerated test speed with multiple GPUs.
