The strategies for effective structuring of data and program code in a two level, directly addressable paged memory system are presented along with the experience gained from deriving and implementing appropriate algorithms in one time-shared system. The experience indicated that a reduction in the paging rate can result through the addition of a slower second-level bulk memory thus leading to improved performance. While improved techniques for structuring these memories coupled with faster and / or cheaper bulk memories offer further improvements in performance, reduction in the paging overhead might offset some of these performance advantages.
