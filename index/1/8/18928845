The study of distributed systems, particularly the study of distributed algorithms, is neglected in most undergraduate computer science programs. In this paper a proposal for a module on distributed systems which would be incorporated in the undergraduate operating systems course is offered. First a description of what we mean by the term “distributed system” is given along with an overview of the problems that are fundamental to the study of distributed systems and the algorithms that solve these problems. This is followed by an argument for including the study of distributed systems in an operating systems course. Finally we present an example of a fundamental problem from distributed systems-determining a consistent global state-and describe an algorithm that solves the problem-the distributed snapshot algorithm of Chandy and Lamport PI-
