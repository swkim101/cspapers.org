We describe a component-based infrastructure for Web-based applications that reduces the need for custom integration. We assume that to construct an application, users will give a specification of three kinds of components: data source, business analysis, and visualization unit. From this specification, our infrastructure will generate the desired application. To support this vision, the infrastructure contains an intelligent component integration system that automates component retrieval, adaptation, and integration.
