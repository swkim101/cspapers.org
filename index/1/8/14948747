Layout-dependent effects (LDEs) have become a critical issue in modern analog and mixed-signal circuit designs. The three major sources of LDEs, well proximity, length of oxide diffusion, and oxide-to-oxide spacing, significantly affect the threshold voltage and mobility of devices. In this paper, we propose the first work to consider the three major sources of LDEs during analog placement. We first transform the three LDE models into nonlinear analytical placement models. Then an LDE-aware analytical analog placement algorithm is presented to mitigate the influence of the LDEs while improving circuit performance. Experimental results show that our placement algorithm can effectively and efficiently reduce the LDE-induced variations and improve circuit performance.
