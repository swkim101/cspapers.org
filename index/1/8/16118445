In this paper) we propose a method for text categoriza Lion task using term weight learning. In our approach, learning is to learn true keywords from the error of clus tering results. Parameters of term weighting are then estimated so as to maximize the true keywords and min imize the other words in the text. The characteristic of our approach is that the degree of context dependency is used in order to judge whether a word in a text is a true keyvvÂ·ord or not. The experiments using Wall Street Journal corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
