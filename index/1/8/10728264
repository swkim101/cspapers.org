With a packaged semiconductor device of this invention, an IC pellet or chip supported on a mounting unit is encapsulated in plastics material, for example, epoxy resin or silicone resin. A plurality of lead strips are disposed at one end in the proximity of the mounting part of the mounting unit. The lead strips are electrically connected to the respective conductive pads of the IC pellet set on the mounting part of the mounting unit. The lead strips extend at the other end outside of an plastics material. Mounting unit-reinforcing side walls project substantially at right angles from the edges of the flat part of the mounting unit. The heat-radiating legs of the mounting unit extend substantially at right angles from the low edges of the side walls with the bottom surface of said legs exposed to the outside of the plastics material.
