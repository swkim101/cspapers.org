Cyber-physical systems are characterized by an IT infrastructure controlling effects in the physical world. Attacks are intentional actions trying to cause undesired physical effects. When process data originating in the physical world is manipulated before being handed to the IT infrastructure, the data security property called "veracity" or trustworthiness will be violated. There is no canonical IT security solution guaranteeing that the inputs from a sensor faithfully represent reality. However, the laws of physics may help the defender to detect impossible or implausible sensor readings. This paper proposes a process-aware approach to detect when a sensor signal is being maliciously manipulated. We present a set of lightweight real-time algorithms for spoofing sensor signals directly at the microcontroller of the field device. The detection of spoofed measurements takes the form of plausibility and consistency checks with the help of the correlation entropy in a cluster of related sensors. We use the Tennessee Eastman challenge process to demonstrate the performance of our approach and to highlight aspects relevant to the detection effectiveness.
