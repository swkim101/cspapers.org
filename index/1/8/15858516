Most of our present-day information systems have been in use for a long time. They have been developed using the system development methods, programming tools, data base handlers, etc. that were available when the development work started. Even if the systems are adapted to changed requirements from the surrounding world, the basic structure and the original technical and methodological ties have been retained. Our goal is to show how an object-oriented development method can be used to gradually modernize an old system, i.e re-engineer the system. We do this by showing how three typical cases of re-engineering are related to object-oriented development. The technique is based on experiences from real projects. The basis of our technology is system development using object-oriented technique. The technology implies that occurrences from the application domain are modelled as objects and associations between objects. The resulting system model will be used as a mapping between the occurrences of the application domain and programming elements in the existing system.
