Fair scheduling of delay and rate-sensitive packet flows over a wireless channel is not addressed effectively by most contemporary wireline fair scheduling algorithms because of two unique characteristics of wireless media: (a) bursty channel errors, and (b) location-dependent channel capacity and errors. Besides, in packet cellular networks, the base station typically performs the task of packet scheduling for both downlink and uplink flows in a cell; however a base station has only a limited knowledge of the arrival processes of uplink flows.In this paper, we propose a new model for wireless fair scheduling based on an adaptation of fluid fair queueing to handle location-dependent error bursts. We describe an ideal wireless fair scheduling algorithm which provides a packetized implementation of the fluid model while assuming full knowledge of the current channel conditions. For this algorithm, we derive the worst-case throughput and delay bounds. Finally, we describe a practical wireless scheduling algorithm which approximates the ideal algorithm. Through simulations, we show that the algorithm achieves the desirable properties identified in the wireless fluid fair queueing model.
