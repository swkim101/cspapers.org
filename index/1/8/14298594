Recent studies showed that Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVT) and Infinitely Variable Transmissions (IVT) can considerably improve the locomotion efficiency in legged robot. A CVT is a transmission whose ratio can be continuously varied and an IVT is a transmission whose ratio can be continuously varied from positive to negative values. However, efficient use of such transmissions in walking applications requires changing the transmission ratio at a minimal energy cost, even at rest, i.e. when the input shaft is not rotating. This contribution proposes a novel CVT and IVT principle which can achieve such ratio variations at rest. The presented CVT is a modified planetary gear, whose planets are conical and mounted on inclined shafts, and whose ring is made of contiguous diabolo-shaped rollers. This configuration enables the control of the transmission ratio by adjusting the point of contact between the cones and rollers that comprise the ring. A traditional planetary gear system can be added to the CVT to form an IVT.
