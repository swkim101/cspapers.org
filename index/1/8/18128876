This paper focuses on recognition and prediction of human reaching motion in industrial manipulation tasks. Several supervised learning methods have been proposed for this purpose, but we seek a method that can build models on-the-fly and adapt to new people and new motion styles as they emerge. Thus, unlike previous work, we propose an unsupervised online learning approach to the problem, which requires no offline training or manual categorization of trajectories. Our approach consists of a two-layer library of Gaussian Mixture Models that can be used both for recognition and prediction. We do not assume that the number of motion classes is known a priori, and thus the library grows if it cannot explain a new observed trajectory. Given an observed portion of a trajectory, the framework can predict the remainder of the trajectory by first determining what GMM it belongs to, and then using Gaussian Mixture Regression to predict the remainder of the trajectory. We tested our method on motion-capture data recorded during assembly tasks. Our results suggest that the proposed framework outperforms supervised methods in terms of both recognition and prediction. We also show the benefit of using our two-layer framework over simpler approaches.
