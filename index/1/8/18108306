Mobile social network aggregators, such as Motoblur and Windows Phone 7 People Hub, emerge as a common tool to access online social networking services on mobile devices. There are limited user studies, however, about how people use and perceive these aggregators. In this study, I explore this research field by deploying an innovative mobile social network aggregator named Linked Internet UI, or LinkedUI. It deeply integrates social networking services into the mobile device user interface and recommends new content that is likely to be interesting to the user. The main research question is that of how people use and perceive these designs, and what user practices these designs enable. The supporting research emphasis is on exploring how we apply user-centered design in the era of online social networking services.
