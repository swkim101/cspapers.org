An open question of [LLS] is whether polynomial time many-one reducibility ≤<subscrpt>m</subscrpt><supscrpt><italic>P</italic></supscrpt> and polynomial time Turing reducibility ≤<subscrpt>T</subscrpt><supscrpt><italic>P</italic></supscrpt> differ on <italic>NP</italic>. An affirmative answer to this question would yield <italic>P</italic> @@@@ <italic>NP</italic> as a corollary, but it is possible that <italic>P</italic> @@@@ <italic>NP</italic> even if the answer is negative. Ladner, Lynch, and Selman [LLS] conjecture that if <italic>P</italic> @@@@ <italic>NP</italic> then ≤<subscrpt>m</subscrpt><supscrpt><italic>P</italic></supscrpt> and ≤<subscrpt>T</subscrpt><supscrpt><italic>P</italic></supscrpt> differ on <italic>NP</italic>. One method that might prove helpful in settling this conjecture is to exhibit an efficient construction that builds from any nonpolynomial set A a set B such that A ≤<subscrpt>T</subscrpt><supscrpt><italic>P</italic></supscrpt> B but A @@@@<subscrpt>m</subscrpt><supscrpt><italic>P</italic></supscrpt> B. If such a construction were sufficiently efficient, then when applied to a set A in <italic>NP - P</italic> it would yield a set B in <italic>NP/</italic>
