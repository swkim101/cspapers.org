NBTI has been a major aging mechanism for advanced CMOS technology and PBTI is also looming as a big concern. This work first proposes a compact on-chip sensor design that tracks both NBTI and PBTI for both logic and SRAM circuits. Embedded in an SRAM array the sensor takes the form of a 6T SRAM cell and is at least 30× smaller than previous designs. Extensively reusing the SRAM peripheral circuitry minimizes control logic overhead. Sensing overhead is further amortized as the sensors can be both reconfigured and recycled as functional SRAM cells, potentially increasing SRAM yield when other bit cells fail due to initial process variation or long time aging effects. The paper also proposes a variation-aware sensor system design methodology by quantifying and leveraging the tradeoff between the size and number of sensors and the system sensing precision. Design examples show that a system of 500 sensors can achieve 4mV precision with 98.8% confidence, and a system of 1K sensors designed for 1M SRAM bit cells achieves 2000× area overhead reduction compared to a worst-case based approach.
