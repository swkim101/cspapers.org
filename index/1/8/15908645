We present a truncation-free stochastic variational inference algorithm for Bayesian nonparametric models. While traditional variational inference algorithms require truncations for the model or the variational distribution, our method adapts model complexity on the fly. We studied our method with Dirichlet process mixture models and hierarchical Dirichlet process topic models on two large data sets. Our method performs better than previous stochastic variational inference algorithms.
