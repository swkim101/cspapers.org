We discuss the problem of identifying inconsistencies in temporal requirements expressed as natural language text. We propose a partially automated approach that aims to minimize analysts' workload and improve accuracy. As one of the ingredients of the approach, we introduce a formal language to represent temporal requirements precisely and unambiguously. We call this language Temporal Action Language (TAL).
