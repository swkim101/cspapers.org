We present work-in-progress on the machine acquisition of a lexicon from sentences that are each an unsegmented phone sequence paired with a primitive representation of meaning. A simple exploratory algorithm is described, along with the direction of current work and a discussion of the relevance of the problem for child language acquisition and computer speech recognition.
