Recent statistics indicate that 4.6% of Bachelor of Science degrees in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Information in 2011 were awarded to African American college students compared to 64.8% of Bachelor of Science degrees which were awarded to Caucasian students or 15.3% to Asian students enrolled in U.S. institutions [6]. Because of the low numbers of underrepresented minorities, specifically African Americans in Computer Science, the U.S. federal government, private industries and concerned American educators seek effective measures to increase the number of African Americans in Computer Science programs across the nation. One strategic approach is to leverage African American college students’ interest in technology (e.g. testing video games) that enables them to construct computing identities in the context of serving as a technical resource to their peers [2]. As a result, many voices representing different perspectives have begun to engage in a discussion of different approaches that stimulate African American students' interest in Computer Science and how to best propel that interest into educational and career choices that increase the number of African Americans in Computer Science [1 – 5].
