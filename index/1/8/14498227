In this work, redundancy resolution and impedance modulation strategies have been employed to enhance intuitiveness and stability in physical human-robot interaction during co-manipulation tasks. An impedance strategy to control a redundant manipulator is defined in the Cartesian space. Different modulation laws for the impedance parameters are tested in combination with different strategies to solve redundancy. The stability of the coupled human-robot system is guaranteed ensuring that the impedance parameters vary in a range evaluated experimentally. Through an extensive experimental study on a 7-DOF KUKA LWR4 arm, we show that using redundancy to decouple the equivalent inertia at the end-effector enables a more flexible choice of the impedance parameters and improves the performance during manual guidance. Moreover, variable impedance is more performant with respect to constant impedance due to a favourable compromise between accuracy and execution time and the enhanced comfort perceived by humans during manual guidance.
