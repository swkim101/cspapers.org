We introduce a natural and flexible framework for collaborative transactions called Consortium. We also define a new model for collaborative interaction that we call “What You See Is What You Want” ( WYSIWYW), an abstraction that permits users to choose their own interaction modes with respect to the shared workspace. Consortium is not an extension to the transaction model but rather a flexible framework for defining collaborative transactions. The contribution of this work is a framework for collaborative transactions that allows a transaction to: (1) support the abstraction of WYSIWYW’, (2) span mtdtiple sessions, (3) have multiple commit points, (4) have different participants at different times, and (5) differentiate between the concepts of owners and participants. In addition, this paper defines the concept of transaction leasing, identifies policies for joining, leaving, and participating in a transaction, extends the notion of transaction ownership by allowing ownership transfer, and describes mechanisms for sharing locks in collaborative transactions.
