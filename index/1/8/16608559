In this paper we present a new method for the cooperative carrying of a rigid object by a robot and a human. This method is based on tactile sensor input. In the carrying mode the robotic system defines constraints for the user's possible movements when manually guiding the object (and robot arm). Thus, instead of using a complex recognition process for interpreting the user's intention the robot determines the next action on basis of the defined constraints and the measured tactile sensor data. The defined constraints only allow the human partner to manipulate the carried object during the carrying procedure in the manner of a water hand pump. In this way, so-called in-place-translations of the object in all directions are possible, while the human partner maintains full control over orientation and position of the object.
