Annotating photographs automatically with content descriptions facilitates organization, storage, and search over visual information. We present an integrated approach for scene classi cation that combines image-based and text-based approaches. On the text side, we use the text accompanying an image in a novel TF*IDF vector-based approach to classi cation. On the image side, we present a novel OF*IIF (object frequency) vector-based approach to classi cation. Objects are de ned by clustering of segmented regions of training images. The image based OF*IIF approach is synergistic with the text based TF*IDF approach. By integrating the TF*IDF approach and the OF*IIF approach, we achieved a classi cation accuracy of 86%. This is an improvement of approximately 12% over existing image classi ers, an improvement of approximately 3% over the TF*IDF image classi er based on textual information, and an improvement of approximately 4% over the OF*IIF image classi er based on visual information.
