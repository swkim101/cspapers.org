This paper describes a dual-camera system intended to accomplish the task of vision-based activity recognition at multiple resolutions. The system is comprised of a wide-angle, fixed field of view camera coupled with a computer-controlled pan/tilt/zoom-lens camera to make detailed measurements of people for activity recognition applications. We demonstrate the use of the system in both indoor and outdoor environments.
