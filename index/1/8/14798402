Extracting domain knowledge from databases can facilitate the development of Web ontologies. In this paper, a formal approach and an automated tool for constructing ontologies from Object-oriented database models (OODMs) are developed. The approach and tool can automatically translate an OODM and its corresponding database instances into the ontology structure and ontology instances, respectively. Case studies show that the approach is feasible and the automated construction tool is efficient.
