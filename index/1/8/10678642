The paper deals with the problem of trajectory formation of human reaching movements. First we review conventional criteria of optimality adopted in robotics and computational neuroscience and formulate a dynamic version of the minimum hand jerk criteria. We call it a minimum driving force change criterion. We compare this criterion with conventional ones and show that it can also be a good candidate to model unconstrained reaching movements. Next, we test the performance of the new criterion for the tasks where human movements are constrained by the external environment. The simulation and experimental results show feasibility of the new criterion.
