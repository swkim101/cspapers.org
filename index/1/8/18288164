In this paper we present a new single port robotic system particularly designed for single port access surgery in the field of colon cancer. In contrast to most state of the art systems the two intracorporeal manipulator arms are set up using a parallel kinematic structure with 5DOF, which are integrated into a shaft of 38mm in diameter. The parallel kinematic structure and its workspace are discussed in detail. As a unique feature, the kinematics uses the translation and rotation of three rods per manipulation arm. Using a parallel kinematic approach enables dynamic, stiff and precise movements which are needed to generate a realistic haptic feedback. The results of several performed circle tests are presented showing the ability of performing precise and dynamic movements with speeds of up to 327 mm/s and under load condition of 4 N.
