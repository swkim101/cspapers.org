Network biology has been successfully used to help reveal complex mechanisms of disease, especially cancer. On the other hand, network biology requires in-depth knowledge to construct disease-specific networks, but our current knowledge is very limited even with the recent advances in human cancer biology. Deep learning has shown an ability to address the problem like this. However, it conventionally used grid-like structured data, thus application of deep learning technologies to the human disease subtypes is yet to be explored. To overcome the issue, we propose a hybrid model, which integrates two key components 1) graph convolution neural network (graph CNN) and 2) relation network (RN). Experimental results on synthetic data and breast cancer data demonstrate that our proposed method shows better performances than existing methods.
