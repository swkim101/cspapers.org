. We present a new technique for obtaining lower bounds on the time-complexity of optimization problems, in the linear decision tree model of computation. We then use this technique to obtain a tight Q(n log n ) lower bound for a problem of finding a minimum cost triangulation of a simple polygon with weighted vertices. This problem is similar to the problem of finding an optimal order of computing a matrix chain produet. If we could extend our lower bound technique to bounded degree algebraic decision trees, we would have a tight C2(n log n ) lower bound for this latter problem.
