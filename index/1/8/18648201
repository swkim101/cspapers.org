In this paper, we report on our use of zero morphemes in Unification-Based Combinatory Categorial Grammar. After illustrating the benefits of this approach with several examples, we describe the algorithm for compiling zero morphemes into unary rules, which allows us to use zero morphemes more efficiently in natural language processing. Then, we discuss the question of equivalence of a grammar with these unary rules to the original grammar. Lastly, we compare our approach to zero morphemes with possible alternatives.
