In this paper, we investigate various strate- gies to predict both syntactic dependency parsing and contiguous multiword expres- sion (MWE) recognition, testing them on the dependency version of French Tree- bank (Abeille and Barrier, 2004), as in- stantiated in the SPMRL Shared Task (Seddah et al., 2013). Our work focuses on using an alternative representation of syntactically regular MWEs, which cap- tures their syntactic internal structure. We obtain a system with comparable perfor- mance to that of previous works on this dataset, but which predicts both syntactic dependencies and the internal structure of MWEs. This can be useful for capturing the various degrees of semantic composi- tionality of MWEs.
