In this paper we present a design space exploration flow to achieve energy efficiency for streaming applications on MPSoCs while meeting the specified throughput constraints. The public domain simulators Sim-Panalyzer and Cacti are used to estimate the energy dissipations of the parameterized architectural components. As the main contributions, we schedule the streaming applications on a multi-clock synchronous modeling framework, guarantee the application timing properties by throughput analysis, and customize both processor voltage-frequency levels and memory sizes in the design space to optimize the application pipeline parallelism for energy efficiency. Two widely used heuristic algorithms (i.e., greedy and taboo search) are used during the design optimization process. Our experiments show an energy reduction of 21% without any loss in application throughput compared with an ad-hoc approach.
