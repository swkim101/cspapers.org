This paper describes a randomized algorithm for approximate counting that preserves the same modest memory requirements of log(log n) bits per counter as the approximate counting algorithm introduced in the seminal paper of R. Morris (1978), and in addition, is characterized by (i) lower expected number of memory accesses and (ii) lower standard error on more than 99 percent of its counting range. An exact analysis of the relevant statistical properties of the algorithm is carried out. Performance evaluation via simulations is also provided to validate the presented theory.
 Given its properties, the presented algorithm is suitable as a basic building block of data streaming applications having a large number of simultaneous counters and/or operating at very high speeds. As such, it is applicable to a wide range of measurement and monitoring operations, including performance monitoring of communication hardware, measurements for optimization in large database systems, and gathering statistics for data compression.
