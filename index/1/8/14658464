The Residue-Driven Architecture presented here is a model of auditory stream segregation from input sounds. A subsystem to extract auditory streams by using some sound attributes is called an agency and the design of each agency is based on the residue-driven architecture. This architecture consists of three kinds of agents: an event-detector, a tracer-generator, and tracers. The event-detector calculates a residue by subtracting the predicted input from the actual input. When a residue exceeds a threshold value, tracer-generator generates a tracerthat extracts an auditory stream from the residue and returns a predicted input of the next time frame to the event-detector. This aproach improves the performance of segregation and the resulting system can segregate a woman's voiced stream, a man's voiced stream, and a noise stream from a mixture of these sounds. Binaural segregation is also designed by the architecture.
