Medical devices historically have been monolithic units — developed, validated, and approved by regulatory authorities as stand-alone entities. Modern medical devices increasingly incorporate connectivity mechanisms that offer the potential to stream device data into electronic health records, integrate information from multiple devices into single customizable displays, and coordinate the actions of groups of cooperating devices to realize “closed loop” scenarios and automate clinical workflows. However, it is not clear what middleware and integration architectures may be best suited for these possibly numerous scenarios. More troubling, current verification and validation techniques used in the device industry are not targeted to assuring groups of integrated devices. In this paper, we propose a publish-subscribe architecture for medical device integration based on the Java Messaging Service, and we report on our experience with this architecture in multiple scenarios that we believe represent the types of deployments that will benefit from rapid device integration. This implementation and the experiments presented in this paper are offered as an open test bed for exploring development, quality assurance, and regulatory issues related to medical device coordination.
