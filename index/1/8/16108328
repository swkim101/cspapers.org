In peer-to-peer networks, finding the appropriate answer for an information request, such as the answer to a query for RDF(S) data, depends on selecting the right peer in the network. We hereinvestigate how social metaphors can be exploited effectively andefficiently to solve this task. To this end, we define a method for query routing, REMINDIN', that lets <em>(i)</em> peers observewhich queries are successfully answered by other peers,<em>(ii)</em>, memorizes this observation, and, <em>(iii)</em>,subsequently uses this information in order to select peers to forward requests to.REMINDIN' has been implemented for the SWAP peer-to-peer platformas well as for a simulation environment. We have used the simulation environment in order to investigate how successfulvariations of REMINDIN' are and how they compare to baseline strategies in terms of number of messages forwarded in the networkand statements appropriately retrieved.
