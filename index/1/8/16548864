We present the local path planning and obstacle avoidance method used on the autonomous tour-guide robot RoboX. It has proven its value during a 5 month operation of ten such robots in a real-world application, a very crowded exhibition. Three known approaches (DWA, elastic band, NF1) have been integrated into a system that performs smooth motion efficiently, in the sense of computational effort as well as goal-directedness. Apart from modifications to the DWA and the elastic band, we present the formulations that allow this fusion.
