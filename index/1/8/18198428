We propose to demo a ubiquitous surveillance patrol robot system which can patrol in a candidate site to perform events detection where a wireless sensor network may be deployed. We have enabled the 3G phone controlled patrol robot (over 3G circuit switched network) with integrated access to the WiFi/Internet. Internet is used to provide sensor query, to send control signal to the robot and to request the real time audiovisual data from the robot. The robot can receive the movement instructions from and pull the real-time multimedia data stream to a remote user via WiFi laptop or 3G terminal. We also implemented a gateway which is a key component for the platform in responsible for the interconnection and heterogeneous communication of the networks.
