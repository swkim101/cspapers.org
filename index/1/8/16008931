In this paper we describe a novel approach for exploratory search over rich entity-relationship data that utilizes a unique combination of expressive, yet intuitive, query language, faceted search, and graph navigation. We describe an extended faceted search solution which allows to index, search, and browse rich entity-relationship data. We report experimental results of an evaluation study, using a benchmark of several of entity-relationship datasets, demonstrating that our exploratory approach is both effective and efficient compared to other existing approaches.
