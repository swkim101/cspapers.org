A course in discrete structures has become a normal prerequisite for courses in data structures and analysis of algorithms. One of the pedagogical problems to deal with in these advanced courses is how to integrate the material of the discrete structures course. These later courses should reinforce for students the need to use mathematical structures and proof techniques as tools in developing correct and efficient algorithms.
