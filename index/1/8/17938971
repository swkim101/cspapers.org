The introduction was written jointly, the second section by Kahn and Szemeredi, and the third by Friedman, Let G be a d-regular (i.e. each vertex has degree d) undirected graph on n nodes. Itâ€™s adjacency matrix is symmetric, and therefore has real eigenvalues Ar = d 2 x2 >_ *-. >_ X, with IX,] 5 d. Graphs for which X2 and
