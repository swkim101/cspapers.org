This paper is focussed on the modelling and control of a hydraulically-driven biologically-inspired robotic leg. The study is part of a larger project aiming at the development of an autonomous quadruped robot (hyQ) for outdoor operations. The leg has two hydraulically-actuated degrees of freedom (DOF), the hip and knee joints. The actuation system is composed of proportional valves and asymmetric cylinders. After a brief description of the prototype leg, the paper shows the development of a comprehensive model of the leg where critical parameters have been experimentally identified. Subsequently the leg control design is presented. The core of this work is the experimental assessment of the pros and cons of single-input single-output (SISO) vs. multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and linear vs. nonlinear control algorithms in this application (the leg is a coupled multivariable system driven by nonlinear actuators). The control schemes developed are a conventional PID (linear SISO), a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller (linear MIMO) and a Feedback Linearisation (FL) controller (nonlinear MIMO). LQR performs well at low frequency but its behaviour worsens at higher frequencies. FL produces the fastest response in simulation, but when implemented is sensitive to parameters uncertainty and needs to be properly modified to achieve equally good performance also in the practical implementation.
