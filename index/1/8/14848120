The QoS-aware web service composition (WSC) problem aims at the automatic construction of a composite web service with the optimal accumulated QoS value. It is, however, intractable to solve the QoS-aware WSC problem for large scale instances, since the problem corresponds to a global optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel anytime algorithm for the QoS-aware WSC problem to identify composite web services with high quality much earlier than an optimal algorithm and the beam stack search [3].
