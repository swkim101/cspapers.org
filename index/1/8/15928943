In this paper we investigate information propagation in Twitter from the geographical view on the global scale. An information propagation phenomenon what we call "information current" has been discovered. According to this phenomenon, we propose a hypothesis that changes of information flows may be related to real-time events. Through analysis of retweets, we show that our hypothesis is supported by experiment results. Moreover, it is discovered that the retweet texts are more effective than common tweet texts for real-time event detection. This means that Twitter could be a good filter of texts for event detection.
