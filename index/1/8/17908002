In this work we discuss an efficient strategy for combining multiple panoramic scans of the same scene to create a single higher contrast image. Prior research papers mainly consider that precise exposure times for multiple images are known and create a new high dynamic range representation for each pixel. We simply consider multiple scans of the same scene where the exposure times are not known, and no special filters or image detectors are used in the image acquisition process. In this unrestricted scenario, the problem is how to select different parts of a scene from the "best" image among a collection of images in order to optimize the overall clarity or contrast of a single final image. Experimental results are shown, and steps to improve results using modified contrast measures for color images are described. The results are enhanced using morphological filtering and image blending.
