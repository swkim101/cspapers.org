In this paper, we present a new tree mining algorithm, DryadeParent, based on the hooking principle first introduced in Dryade (Termier et al, 2004). In the experiments, we demonstrate that the branching factor and depth of the frequent patterns to find are key factor of complexity for tree mining algorithms. We show that DryadeParent outperforms the current fastest algorithm, CMTreeMiner, by orders of magnitude on datasets where the frequent patterns have a high branching factor.
