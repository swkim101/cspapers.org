This paper describes a research study that investigated howdesigners can use frames of reference (egocentric, exocentric, anda combination of the two) to support the mastery of abstractmultidimensional information. The primary focus of this study wasthe relationship between FORs and mastery; the secondary focus wason other factors (individual characteristics and interactionexperience) that were likely to influence the relationship betweenFORs and mastery. This studys outcomes (1) clarify how FORs work inconjunction with other factors in shaping mastery, (2) highlightstrengths and weaknesses of different FORs, (3) demonstrate thebenefits of providing multiple FORs, and (4) provide the basis forour recommendations to HCI researchers and designers.
