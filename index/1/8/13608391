The time-bound hierarchical key assignment problem is to assign time sensitive keys to security classes in a partially ordered hierarchy so that legal data accesses among classes can be enforced. Two time-bound hierarchical key assignment schemes have been proposed in the literature, but both of them were proved insecure against collusive attacks. In this paper, we will propose an RSA-based time-bound hierarchical key assignment scheme and describe its possible application. The security analysis shows that the new scheme is safe against the collusive attacks.
