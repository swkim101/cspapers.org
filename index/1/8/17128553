We reformulate metonymy resolution as a classification task. This is motivated by the regularity of metonymic readings and makes general classification and word sense disambiguation methods available for metonymy resolution. We then present a case study for location names, presenting both a corpus of location names annotated for metonymy as well as experiments with a supervised classification algorithm on this corpus. We especially explore the contribution of features used in word sense disambiguation to metonymy resolution.
