In most prior approaches, either neural network methods or only hippocampal models are used for building cognitive maps, lacking biological fidelity to the entorhinal-hippocampal system. This paper presents a novel computational model to build cognitive maps of real environments using both place cells and grid cells. The proposed model includes two major components: (1) A competitive Hebbian learning algorithm is used to select velocity-coupled grid cell population activities, which path-integrate self-motion signals to determine computation of place cell population activities; (2) Visual cues of environments are used to correct the accumulative errors intrinsically associated with the path integration process. Experiments performed on a mobile robot show that cognitive maps of the real environment can be efficiently built. The proposed model would provide an alternative neuro-inspired approach for robotic mapping, navigation and localization.
