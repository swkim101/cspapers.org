Power gating is essential for controlling leakage power dissipation of modern chip designs. However, power gating introduces unique power delivery integrity issues and tradeoffs between switching and rush current (wake-up) supply noises. In addition, in power-gated power delivery networks (PDNs), the amount of power saving intrinsically trades off with power integrity. In this paper, we propose systemic decoupling capacitance optimization strategies that optimally balance between switching and rush current noises, and tradeoff between power integrity and wake-up time, hence power saving. Furthermore, we propose a novel re-routable decoupling capacitance concept to break the tight interaction between power integrity and power saving, providing further improved tradeoffs between the two. Our design strategies have been implemented in a simulation-based optimization flow and the conducted experimental results have demonstrated significant improvement on leakage power saving through the presented techniques.
