This paper addresses the problem of an efficient dispatch mechanism in an object-oriented system with multiple inheritance. The solution suggested is a direct table indexed branch such as is used in C++. The table slot assignments are made using a coloring algorithm. The method is applicable to strongly typed languages such as C++ (with multiple inheritance added) and Eiffel, and in a slightly slower form to less strongly typed languages like Objective C.
