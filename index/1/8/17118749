This paper reports on an experiment that investigated factors which effect selection time from walking menus and bar or pull-down menus. The primary focus was on the use of impenetrable borders and on expanding target areas on the two menus types. The results show that both factors can be used to facilitate menu selection, with the use of borders being most beneficial. In addition, the results suggest that even on large monitors, the time required to access items from a bar menu is less than that required for the best walking menu.
