Fleas have a unique catapult mechanism with a special muscle configuration. Energy is stored in an elastic material, resilin, and the extensor muscle. Force is applied by the extensor muscle to generate a torque. Energy is released as a small triggering muscle reverses the direction of the aforementioned torque. A flea can jump 150 times its body length using this elastic catapult mechanism. In this paper, a flea-inspired catapult mechanism is presented. This mechanism can be categorized as an active storage and active release elastic catapult. Owing to its unique stiffness change characteristic, a shape-memory-alloy coil spring actuator enables the mimicking of the flea's catapult mechanism. Two types of flea-inspired jumping mechanisms were developed for verifying the feasibility of applying the concept to an efficient jumping robot. The first prototype has a flea-like appearance and the second is simplified to contain just the essential components of the flea-inspired catapult mechanism. The two prototypes are 20-mm- and 30-mm-long and can jump 64 cm and 120 cm, respectively. This unique catapult mechanism can be used not only for jumping robots but also for other small-sized robots to generate fast-releasing motion.
