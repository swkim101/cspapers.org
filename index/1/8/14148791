A new method for multikey access suitable for dynamic files is proposed that transforms multiple key values into a logical address This method is based on a new structure, called predicate tree, that represents the function applied to several keys A predicate tree permits to specify in a unified way various hashing schemes by allowing for different definitions of predicates A logical address qualifies a space partition of a file according to its predicate tree This address is seen as a single key by a digital hashing method which transforms it into a physical address This method is used to address records in a file and to transform a retrieval qualification on a file into a set of partitions to access Finally, a qualitative analysis of the behavior of the method is given which exhibits its value
