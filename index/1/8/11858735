This paper discusses recent galloping results obtained using the Scout II quadrupedal robot, an underactuated robot with minimal sensing. The rotary variation of the gallop has been implemented, resulting in a motion which demonstrates both emergent stability and a circular trajectory, as predicted in earlier simulation studies by other researchers. It also demonstrates phase relationships in the leg touchdown pattern which resemble results from biology.
