A division algorithm suitable for pipelining is presented. The algorithm possesses the on-line property: that is, to generate the jth digit of a result (where a digit consists of n bits for base 2n), it is necessary and sufficient to have the operands available only up to the jth digit plus a predetermined number of extra digits which correspond to an “on-line delay”. This delay is shown to be a small, positive, radix dependent constant. The implementation of this algorithm and the implications on cost and speed are then presented. Finally, alterations in the design making the algorithm suitable for pipelining and its benefits are discussed.
