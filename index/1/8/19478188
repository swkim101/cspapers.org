This paper provides a description of the Stephen F. Austin State University Computer Science Advisory Council and the ongoing advisory program. Experience has shown that a well-formed council operating with the computer science faculty in a well-planned advisory program can contribute significantly toward curriculum refinement, faculty development, financial assistance, resource improvement, and student employment. The methods for forming a council and establishing a program, and the benefits derived - all of which are discussed in the paper - have potential applicability to other computer science departments.
