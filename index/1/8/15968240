In region-based image annotation, keywords are usually associated with images instead of individual regions in the training data set. This poses a major challenge for any learning strategy. In this paper, we formulate image annotation as a supervised learning problem under Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) framework. We present a novel Asymmetrical Support Vector Machine-based MIL algorithm (ASVM-MIL), which extends the conventional Support Vector Machine (SVM) to the MIL setting by introducing asymmetrical loss functions for false positives and false negatives. The proposed ASVM-MIL algorithm is evaluated on both image annotation data sets and the benchmark MUSK data sets.
