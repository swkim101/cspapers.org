Forecasting short term passenger demand for public transport is a core problem in urban mobility. Typically, this is addressed using Poisson regression or homogeneous Poisson processes. However, such approaches have several limitations, including susceptibility to noise at fine time granularities, and the inability to capture complex non-stationary trends. In this paper, we show how such short term demand can be accurately modelled with an inhomogeneous Poisson process, using a neural network as the underlying intensity. This choice of intensity subsumes existing models as special cases, and is powerful enough to capture certain stylised facts of real-world demand. Experiments on real-world bus arrival data from a large metropolitan area in Australia validate our approach.
