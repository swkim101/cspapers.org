Recent advances in network and operating system technology allow applications to directly exploit gigabits of network communication per second. However, most such communication interfaces provide no efficient means of asynchronous notification to processes of incoming messages. Instead, applications are expected to poll frequently. In addition to the burden placed on the programmer, polls are rarely cheap enough to sprinkle indiscriminately in all program loops. We show that the resulting delay in handling messages can be very detrimental to application performance.
