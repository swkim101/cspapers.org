Motion planning as trajectory optimization requires generating trajectories that minimize a desired objective function or performance metric. Finding a globally optimal solution is often intractable in practice: despite the existence of fast motion planning algorithms, most are prone to local minima, which may require re-solving the problem multiple times with different initializations. In this work we provide a novel motion planning algorithm, GPMP-GRAPH, that considers a graph-based initialization that simultaneously explores multiple homotopy classes, helping to contend with the local minima problem. Drawing on previous work to represent continuous-time trajectories as samples from a Gaussian process (GP) and formulating the motion planning problem as inference on a factor graph, we construct a graph of interconnected states such that each path through the graph is a valid trajectory and efficient inference can be performed on the collective factor graph. We perform a variety of benchmarks and show that our approach allows the evaluation of an exponential number of trajectories within a fraction of the computational time required to evaluate them one at a time, yielding a more thorough exploration of the solution space and a higher success rate.
