In this demo we present a testbed environment for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) game architectures. It is based on Planet PI4, an online multiplayer game whose gameplay provides a standard workload for a set of gaming-specific network interfaces. Its pluggable architecture allows for the evaluation and comparison of existing and new P2P networking approaches. Planet PI4 can run on a real network for prototypical evaluation as well as in a discrete-event simulator providing a reproducible environment.
