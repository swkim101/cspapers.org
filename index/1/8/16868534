This paper describes tools [4] which simulate and visualize the CREW PRAM optimal parallel merge sort algorithm by Cole [1]. These tools can be used to run simulations of the algorithm for diflerent data and sampling strategies, to gather statistics during the simulations, to animate the flow of data and the processor allocations during the execution of the algomâ€œthm, and most importantly to aid in understanding the algorithm. These tools can be used in conjunction with a discussion of the algorithm in a course on algorithms or parallel algorithms at the senior undergraduate or graduate level.
