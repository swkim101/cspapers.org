We describe a new dual algorithm for the minimum cost flow problem. It can be regarded as a variation of the best known strongly polynomial minimum cost flow algorithm, due to Orlin, and has the same running t ime of O(mlogm(m + n logn) ) . However, in contrast to Orlin's algorithm we work directly with the capaci tated network (rather than transforming it to a t ransshipment problem). Thus our algorithm may be more efficient in practice. Our algorithm can be interpreted as a cut cancelling algorithm, improving the best known strongly polynomial bound for this important class of algorithms by a factor of m. On the other hand, our algorithm can be considered as a variant of the dual network simplex algorithm. Although dual network simplex algorithms a r e quite efficient in practice, the best worst-case running time known so far exceeds the running time of our algorithm by a factor of n.
