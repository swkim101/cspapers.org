In this paper, we discuss a novel underwater localization system using EM(Electro-Magnetic) wave. Maxwell equation and Friis transmission formula were reconstructed in terms of propagation constant and antenna property, then by combining these two formulas, we have defined the EM wave attenuation function over underwater distance. Using this function, we have developed an underwater sensor model for EM waves. Finally we organized an experimental environment and performed experiments for different frequencies, and through 2D localization using obtained sensor model, we meet with very confident results. The experimental results show a close correlation with the developed sensor model and the possibility of underwater localization systems using EM wave.
