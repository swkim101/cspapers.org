We study on-line versions of weighted matching problems in metric spaces. We present a simple algorithm for online minimum weighted bipartite matching that is 2k â€“ 1 competitive, where 2k is the number of nodes. We show that this bound is optimal. For on-line maximum matching, we prove that the greedy algorithm achieves an optimal competitive factor of 3. In contrast, we prove that greedy algorithm performs exponentially poorly for on-line minimum matching. We show how lower and upper bounds can be translated between this problem and the standard
