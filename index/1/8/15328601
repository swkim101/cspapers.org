This paper sketches a research path that seeks to examine the search for suitable code problem, based on the observation that when code retargeting is included within a code search activity, developers can justify the suitability of these results upfront and thus reduce their searching efforts looking for suitable code. To support this observation, this paper introduces the Snippet Retargeting Approach, or simply SNIPR. SNIPR complements code search with code retargeting capabilities. These capabilities' intent is to help expedite the process of determining if a found example is a best fit. They do that by allowing developers to explore code modification ideas in place, without requiring to leave the search interface. With SNIPR, developers engage in a virtuous loop where they find code, retarget code, and select only code choices they can justify as suitable. This assures immediate feedback on retargeted examples and thus saves valuable time searching for appropriate code.
