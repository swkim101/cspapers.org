Wireless control systems consist of sensing and actuating devices that are commonly driven by a central controller. Wireless communication protocols for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) match this design by employing a "sense → collect → process → disseminate → actuate" flow [6], where typically different protocols are employed for collecting sensor data and disseminating actuation signals.
