There is an increased interest in the efficient creation of city models, be it virtual or as-built. We present a method for synthesizing complex, photo-realistic facade images, from a single example. After parsing the example image into its semantic components, a tiling for it is generated. Novel tilings can then be created, yielding facade textures with different dimensions or with occluded parts in painted. A genetic algorithm guides the novel facades as well as in painted parts to be consistent with the example, both in terms of their overall structure and their detailed textures. Promising results for multiple standard datasets - in particular for the different building styles they contain - demonstrate the potential of the method.
