We present a new data structure of size 3M + &Ogr;(M) bits for solving the “discrete priority queue” problem. When this data structure is used in combination with a new memory topology it provides an O(1) worst case time solution. In doing so we demonstrate how an unconventional, but practically implementable, memory architecture can be employed to sidestep a lower bound (of lg lg M) and achieve constant time performance.
