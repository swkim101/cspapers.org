This paper presents the design of Pharos: a scalable distributed architecture for locating heterogeneous information sources. The system incorporates a hierarchical metadata structure into a multi-level retrieval system. Queries are resolved through an iterative decision-making process. The first step retrieves coarse-grain metadata, about all sources, stored on local, massively replicated, high-level servers. Further steps retrieve more detailed metadata, about a greatly reduced set of sources, stored on remote, sparsely replicated, topic-based mid-level servers. We describe the structure, distribution, and retrieval of the metadata in Pharos to enable users to locate desirable information sources over the Internet.
