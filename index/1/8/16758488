Dataflow is a data-driven, parallel, functional execution model. Datatlow machines are being investigated as an alternative approach to high performance machines. Dataflow machines, while being designed and built, are not widely available for testing purposes. This paper briefly deseribes a dataflow simulator and discusses several educational uses for this simulator. This simulator was designed with flexibility and extension in mind and as a result supports individual computations representing primitive machine level operations or more complex process level computations. With different sets of operations the simulator can be used to simulate a variety of parallel operations. AB CD EF
