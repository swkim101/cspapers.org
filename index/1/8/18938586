We present algorithms that convert a class of parallel programs, called loop programs, from data-driven mode to synchronous mode. Such algorithms enable programmers to use a high-level, data-driven programming language without forfeiting the efficiency of a synchronous machine. We characterize loop programs for which conversion is possible in terms of sets of balancing equations and we present two conversion algorithms.
