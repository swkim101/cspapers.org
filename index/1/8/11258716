In this paper, we describe PortOS, an educational operating system designed to complement undergraduate and graduate level classes on operating systems. PortOS is a complete user-level operating system project, with phases covering concurrency, synchronization, networking and file systems. It focuses particularly on ad hoc and peer-to-peer distributed computing on mobile devices. This paper discusses alternative approaches to operating system projects, and presents our particular design point along with pedagogical justifications.
