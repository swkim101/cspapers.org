An algorithm is described which computes stable models of propositional logic programs with negation as failure using the Assumption Based Truth Maintenance mechanism. Since stable models of logic programs are closely connected to stable expansions of a class of autoepistemic theories, this algorithm points to a link between stable expansions of a class of auto-epistemic theories and ATMS structures.
