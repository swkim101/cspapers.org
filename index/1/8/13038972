This paper aims at providing confluence and determinism properties in concurrent processes, more specifically within the paradigm of object-oriented systems. Such results should allow one to program parallel and distributed applications that behave in a deterministic manner, even if they are distributed over local or wide area networks. For that purpose, an object calculus is proposed. Its key characteristics are asynchronous communications with futures, and sequential execution within each process.While most of previous works exhibit confluence properties only on specific programs -- or patterns of programs, a general condition for confluence is presented here. It is further put in practice to show the deterministic behavior of a typical example.
