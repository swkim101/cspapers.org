In this paper, we present an automated support environment to reduce the time and efforts required to produce and maintain a reusable specification document. Our proposed model has two operation modes: the first one is the forward mode in which our model automatically converts English natural language requirements into UML class diagram models. While the second one is the backward mode in which our model automatically reverses UML class diagram models into English natural language requirements. We compared our model with previous models and the results are promising.
