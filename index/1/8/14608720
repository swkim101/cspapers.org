Multi-methods allow method selection to be based on the types of any number of arguments. Languages that currently support multi-methods do not support static type checking. We show how multi-methods can be statically type checked and how information collected at the time of program compilation can be used to make the run-time dispatch of multi-methods more efficient. The results presented can provide the basis for introducing multi-methods in languages with static type checking and for designing new object-oriented paradigms based on multi-methods.
