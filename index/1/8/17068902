The adoption of model-driven development is leading to increased use of models in conjunction with source code in software testing. Model-based testing, however, introduces new challenges for testing activities, which include creation and maintenance of traceability information among test-related artifacts. Traceability is required to support activities such as model-based result evaluation, regression testing and coverage analysis. In this paper, we present an automated approach that leverages model transformation techniques to support test generation. The test generation process includes creation of test-related models and fine-grained relationships among these models. We also motivate our approach with a simple example demonstrating support for model-based regression testing
