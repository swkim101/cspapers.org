A method for segmenting aerial images using edge information to create regions of similar or smoothly varying intensity is discussed. Region segmentation using edges directly as input cannot be successful because boundaries are seldom perfectly closed. In the present method, we preprocess the edge image to close gaps and create a binary image from which we extract the connected regions. We compare the results obtained with this method and a traditional region-splitting method for 2 different views of an aerial scene.
