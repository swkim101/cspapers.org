This paper addresses some of the criticisms that have been leveled against Ada's stdtabillty for use in trusted computer systems. It treats the use of Ada for both untrusted applications programs and security kernel implementation. (It does not directly address the use of Ada for other trusted software, but much of what is said about its use for security kernels applies to trusted software as well.) The paper concludes that each Ada criticism is either unfounded or poses a problem that has a solution; thus, Ada is Indeed suitable for trusted computer system implementation.
