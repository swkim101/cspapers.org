This work presents an information retrieval model developed to deal with hyperlinked environments. The model is based on belief networks and provides a framework for combining information extracted from the content of the documents with information derived from cross-references among the documents. The information extracted from the content of the documents is based on statistics regarding the keywords in the collection and is one of the basis for traditional information retrieval (IR) ranking algorithms. The information derived from cross-references among the documents is based on link references in a hyperlinked environment and has received increased attention lately due to the success of the Web. We discuss a set of strategies for combining these two types of sources of evidential information and experiment with them using a reference collection extracted from the Web. The results show that this type of combination can improve the retrieval performance without requiring any extra information from the users at query time. In our experiments, the improvements reach up to 59% in terms of average precision figures.
