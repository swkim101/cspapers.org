Physical interconnect effects have a dominant impact on today's deep submicron IC designs. In this tutorial paper we will describe the technology trends which have brought about this interconnect dominance, then consider some of the modeling and analysis approximations available for both pre- and post-layout interconnect design. This coverage will not be an exhaustive summary, but one that is primarily focused on moment-based analysis techniques, from the Elmore delay, to the more recent advances in moment-matching approximations, and the corresponding nonlinear driver/load interfaces. Future modeling, analysis, and design challenges will be considered throughout this paper.
