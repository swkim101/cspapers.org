Searching for prior-art patents is an essential step for the patent examiner to validate or invalidate a patent application. In this paper, we consider the whole patent as the query, which reduces the burden on the user, and also makes many more potential search features available. We explore how to automatically transform the query patent into an effective search query, especially focusing on the effect of different patent fields. Experiments show that the background summary of a patent is the most useful source of terms for generating a query, even though most previous work used the patent claims.
