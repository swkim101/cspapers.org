We consider the problem of covering the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a random subgraph of <i>G</i> by a sparse set of edges, with high probability. The two random models that we consider are subgraphs induced by a random subset of vertices, each vertex included independently with probability <i>p</i>, and subgraphs generated as a random subset of edges, each edge with probability <i>p.</i>Let <i>n</i> be the number of vertices in <i>G.</i> We show that in both cases, there is a covering set <i>Q</i> of cardinality <i>O(n</i> log<i><inf>b</inf> n</i>) where <i>b</i> = <b>1</b>/(1 -- <i>p</i>) (and <i>p</i> is possibly a function of <i>n</i>) and this is asymptotically optimal. More generally, we show a similar bound on the covering set in a matroid, which contains the minimum-weight basis of a random subset with high probability. Also, we give a randomized algorithm which calls an MST subroutine only a polylogarithmic number of times, and finds the covering set with high probability.
