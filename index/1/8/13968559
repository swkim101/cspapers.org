Wang et al. recently proposed a privacy-preserving biometric identification scheme. However, the security assumption of the scheme does not capture practical aspects of real world attacks. In this paper, we consider a practical attack model which results in the leakage of biometric data in Wang et al.'s scheme. We first show the feasibility of our attack model and demonstrate how an attacker is able to recover the biometric data. Then, we propose a new biometric identification scheme that is secure against the attack model.
