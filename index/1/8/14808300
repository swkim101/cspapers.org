This paper proposes a novel framework for representing community 'know-how' on the Semantic Web. Procedural knowledge generated by web communities typically takes the form of natural language instructions or videos and is largely unstructured. The absence of semantic structure impedes the deployment of many useful applications, in particular the ability to discover and integrate know-how automatically. We discuss the characteristics of community know-how and argue that existing knowledge representation frameworks fail to represent it adequately. We present a novel framework for representing the semantic structure of community know-how and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by providing a concrete implementation which includes a method for automatically acquiring procedural knowledge for real-world tasks.
