To better organize and understand online news information, we propose Storybase 1 , a knowledge base for news events that builds upon Wikipedia current events and daily Web news. It first constructs stories and their timelines based on Wikipedia current events and then detects and links daily news to enrich those Wikipedia stories with more comprehensive events. We encode events and develop efficient event clustering and chaining techniques in an event space. We demonstrate Storybase with a news events search engine that helps find historical and ongoing news stories and inspect their dynamic timelines.
