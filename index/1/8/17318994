In this article, we propose a novel classifier based on quantum computation theory. Different from existing methods, we consider the classification as an evolutionary process of a physical system and build the classifier by using the basic quantum mechanics equation. The performance of the experiments on two datasets indicates feasibility and potentiality of the quantum classifier.
