Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a fundamental web language for describing the presentation of web pages. CSS rules are often reused across multiple parts of a page and across multiple pages throughout a site to reduce repetition and to provide a consistent look and feel. When a CSS rule is modified, developers currently have to manually track and visually inspect all possible parts of the site that may be impacted by that change. We present SeeSS, a system that automatically tracks CSS change impact across a site and enables developers to easily visualize all of them. The impacted page fragments are sorted by severity and the differences before and after the change are highlighted using animation.
