A real-time stereo-based pre-crash object detection and classification system is presented. The system employs a model based stereo object detection algorithm to find candidate objects from the scene, followed by a Bayesian classification framework to assign each candidate to its proper class. Our current system detects and classifies several types of objects commonly seen for automotive applications, namely vehicles, pedestrians/bikes, and poles. We describe both the detection and classification algorithms in detail along with real-time implementation issues. A quantitative analysis of performance on a static data set is also presented.
