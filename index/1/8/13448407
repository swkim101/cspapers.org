In this paper we propose the Liquid Query paradigm, to support users in finding responses to multi-domain queries through exploratory information seeking across structured information sources (Web documents, deep Web data, and personal data repositories), wrapped by means of a uniform notion of search service. Liquid Query aims at filling the gap between general-purpose search engines, which are unable to find information spanning multiple topics, and domain-specific search systems, which cannot go beyond their domain limits. The Liquid Query interface consists of interaction primitives that let users pose questions and explore results spanning over multiple sources incrementally, thus getting closer and closer to the sought information. We demonstrate our approach with a prototype built upon the YQL (Yahoo! Query Language) framework.
