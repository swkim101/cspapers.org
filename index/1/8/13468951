Model Management addresses the problem of managing an evolving collection of models, by capturing the relationships between models and providing well-defined operators to manipulate them. In this paper, we describe two such operators for manipulating hierarchical Statecharts: Match, for finding correspondences between models, and Merge, for combining models with respect to known correspondences between them. Our Match operator is heuristic, making use of both static and behavioural properties of the models to improve the accuracy of matching. Our Merge operator preserves the hierarchical structure of the input models, and handles differences in behaviour through parameterization. In this way, we automatically construct merges that preserve the semantics of Statecharts models. We illustrate and evaluate our work by applying our operators to AT&T telecommunication features.
