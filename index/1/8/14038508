Much attention is being focused on participatory sensing, in which real-world data are collected using personal mobile devices as sensor nodes to sense various conditions of the world we live in. In participatory sensing, there is a problem in that the supply of data is insufficient if users are not motivated to participate in sensing services. We previously proposed Top of Worlds, a method for encouraging user participation by presenting rankings in multidimensional hierarchical sets. In this paper, we describe the development of a ranking system and a real-world evaluation to confirm that Top of Worlds can encourage user participation.
