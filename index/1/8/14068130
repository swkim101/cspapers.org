Over four years ago, we developed and implemented an upper division general studies course. “The Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence.” The course has since been team taught every semester by a computer scientist and a philosopher. Here, we draw on our four years' experience with the course to discuss its impact on computer science majors, for whom we feel that it fulfills two main purposes. First, having technical material presented within the coherent framework provided by this course offers students an accessible and consistent context. Secondly, an examination of the philosophical aspects of this material enables the students to look at their own discipline from without for the first time. We contend that a course of this nature neatly rounds off the education of computer scientists.
