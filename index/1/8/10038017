The current move to Cloud Computing raises the need for verifiable delegation of computations, where a weak client delegates his computation to a powerful server, while maintaining the ability to verify that the result is correct. Although there are prior solutions to this problem, none of them is yet both general and practical for real-world use. We demonstrate a relatively efficient and general solution where the client delegates the computation to several servers, and is guaranteed to determine the correct answer as long as even a single server is honest. We show: A protocol for any efficiently computable function, with logarithmically many rounds, based on any collision-resistant hash family. The protocol is set in terms of Turing Machines but can be adapted to other computation models. An adaptation of the protocol for the X86 computation model and a prototype implementation, called Quin, for Windows executables. We describe the architecture of Quin and experiment with several parameters on live clouds. We show that the protocol is practical, can work with nowadays clouds, and is efficient both for the servers and for the client.
