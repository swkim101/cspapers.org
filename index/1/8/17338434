Software is subjected to continuous change, and with increasing size and complexity performing changes becomes more critical. Impact analysis assists in estimating the consequences of a change, and is an important research topic. Nevertheless, until now researchers have not applied and evaluated those techniques in industry. This paper contributes an approach suitable for an industrial setting, and an evaluation of its application in a large software system.
