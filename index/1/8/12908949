Compiler projects frequently use parser generators to help students design and construct non-trivial translators. Unfortunately, the code and data structures produced by such generators, and hence the overall parser, can be difficult to understand and debug. In this paper, we present an extendible and flexible tool for visualizing the operation of generated parsers. The objective of this tool is to provide students with a deeper understanding of parsing algorithms, data structures and techniques.
