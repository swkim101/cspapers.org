The Quiver (QUIz VERification) System is an Internet server for building, maintaining, and administering programming quizzes. It is similar to the online judges used for programming contests but differs in that it targets the classroom use of programming quizzes as a teaching aid and evaluation tool. It can provide very detailed feedback regarding quiz behavior so that the student can debug her program. This system is developed as part of the grant "Intra-Curriculum Software Engineering Education" funded by the National Science Foundation (DUE 0127439).
