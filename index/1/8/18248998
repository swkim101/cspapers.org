Sensors are one of the primary building blocks of IoT. Owing to close proximity of physical world, sensors often collect sensitive information. Invariably, sensor data has rich information content. Here we propose a novel solution IAS: Information Analytics for Sensors to unlock massive potential of sensor data through information analytics and demonstrate an alerting mechanism based on criticality of sensor information. ECG anomaly detection for healthcare, unusual appliance operation detection from smart energy meter data, bad road condition as well as activity detection from accelerometer data are typical use-case scenarios. We use robust statistical and information theoretic approaches. Our approach is unsupervised and is completely sensor agnostic. This abstract provides overview of design and implementation of our tool IAS along with obtained results tested on publicly available datasets. Last but not the least, IAS validates that outliers contain most delicate information.
