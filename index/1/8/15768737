An algorithm is presented to infer the type and operation parameters of polymorphic functions. Operation parameters are named and typed at the function definition, but are selected from the set of overloaded definitions available wherever the function is used. These parameters are always implicit, implying that the complexity of using a function does not increase with the generality of its type.
