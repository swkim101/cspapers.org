Queries to information retrieval systems are often incrementally specified as a result of user interaction with the system. However, most discussions of file organizations consider only completely specified queries. The choice of file organizations to support such incremental specification is discussed qualitatively in this extended abstract. (Quantitative comparisons are partially complete and are not presented here.) Organizations which are advantageous for completely specified queries are not necessarily so for incrementally specified queries (and vice versa).
