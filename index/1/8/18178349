Electronic commerce (EC) has remarkably reshaped today’s business practices. The logic embedded in business transactions are becoming more flexible and sophisticated; the number of components within these business transactions are fastly increasing; and business transactions are getting more distributed and interactive as well. These, on the other hand, make today’s business applications more vulnerable to resource availability constraints and consistency problems due to failures. For example, network congestion, server overload, user absence, and other exceptions all might cause temporary or permanent bottlenecks to ongoing business workflows. Developing system support to make workflow activities more reliable, efficient, and adaptive to changes or exceptions therefore poses important yet challenging questions that call for practical solutions. The TAM project at OGI aims at developing a flexible framework and algorithms that address these challenges. Comparing with other research efforts, our approach is unique in that we combine advanced transaction processing (TP) technologies with adaptive methods to guide our system design, and build the mechanisms by extending the functions of current TP systems. On the theoretical side, we have developed a Transactional Activity Model (TAM) for the specification and management of activities with transactional properties. TAM is a careful combination of a compositional activity model [5] with well-defined extended transaction models (ETMs) [3] such as split/join transactions [9]. It provides simple and effective specification facilities that allow business process designers to specify the behavioral composition and refinement
