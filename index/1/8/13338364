First-year computer science students need to see clearly that computer science as a discipline has an important intellectual role to play and that it offers deep philosophical questions, much like the other hard sciences and mathematics; that CS is not "just programming". An appropriate intellectual focus for CS1/CS2 can be built on the foundations of systems thinking and mathematical modeling, as these principles are manifested in a component-based software paradigm. We outline some of the main technical features of this approach to CS1/CS2 and report preliminary observations from our experience with it.
