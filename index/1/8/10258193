In domains such as Marketing, Advertising or even Human Resources (sourcing), decision-makers have to choose the most suitable channels according to their objectives when starting a campaign. In this paper, three recommender systems providing channel ("user") ranking for a given campaign ("item") are introduced. This work refers exclusively to the new item problem, which is still a challenging topic in the literature. The first two systems are standard content-based recommendation approaches, with different rating estimation techniques (model-based vs heuristic-based). To overcome the lacks of previous approaches, we introduce a new hybrid system using a supervised similarity based on PLS components. Algorithms are compared in a case study: purpose is to predict the ranking of job boards (job search web sites) in terms of ROI (return on investment) per job posting. In this application, the semi-supervised hybrid system outperforms standard approaches.
