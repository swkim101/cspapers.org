The Evergreen State College is a fully accredited four year undergraduate liberal arts college of the State of Washington. Evergreen was founded in the late sixties as an alternative to the prevailing pedagogical model of undergraduate specialization. Evergreen instead favors integrated, thematic academic programs which typically involve faculty from several disciplines. From its inception the College has had a strong commitment to familiarizing its students with the computer as a tool. This paper outlines some of the methods used at Evergreen and indicates some of the lessons we have learned which may be useful to other liberal arts colleges.
