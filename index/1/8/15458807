Most of applications for halftoning images are designed for a particular halftoning method. Under an automatic system, a pre-processor is needed to recognize the halftoning images and then a suitable technique can be applied to them. In this paper, a novel technique is proposed to recognize the visual patterns by order dither technique. It takes the properties of pixel ordering in the halftoning patterns by dither matrices. Our experiments indicate that sixty halftoning images by order dither technique and error diffusion with variant parameters can be correctly classified without manual operations.
