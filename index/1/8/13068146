Web services technology has been widely accepted as a technology that can answer to the requirements of the Service-Oriented Architecture in building software applications out of loosely-coupled software components called services. This opens an opportunity to aggregate functionalities of various services in a software composition. Web services technology offers the WS-BPEL language for service composers to create composite services out of other services by having them collaborate in a workflow. These composite services can be used further as building blocks for constructing other composite services. This paper proposes a basis path testing framework for service testers to examine and test basis paths of WS-BPEL services that are being constructed. The framework is equipped with a tool that can automatically generate test cases and stubs for constituent services within the WS-BPEL flow. The framework defines steps for service testers to take in order to generate the test suite and use it for basis path testing. With the framework, service composers can be assured of the compositions before deploying the composite services.
