This paper initially presents a brief but fairly exhaustive survey of solutions to the concurrency control problem for B-trees. We then propose a new solution, which is characterized by the use of variable-length indices, the employment of a single lock type for the usual access operations and preemptive splits as well as delayed catenations and subdivisions. We also introduce a new compaction algorithm and its concurrent execution, using a new lock type.
