This paper presents a language for the semantic annotation of images, focusing on event types, their participants, and their spatial and orientational conﬁgurations. This language, ImageML, is a self-contained layered speciﬁcation language, building on top of ISOspace, as well as some elements from Spatial Role Labeling and SpatialML. An annotation language characterizing such features surrounding an event and its various aspects could play a signiﬁcant role in structured image retrieval, and a mapping of annotated semantic entities and the image’s low-level features will likely assist event recognition and description generation tasks.
