The Modification Request Control System (MRCS) tracks and reports project change requests and resulting activity through interactive input and extraction of change request data from computer files. MRCS is one of the tools available as part of the Programmer's Workbench (PWB). It was developed to aid in the timely control and coordination of software changes. It provides the capability to: (1) interactively create, update, and print MRS; (2) track and record the flow of the MR through the system development cycle; and (3) provide management with timely MR status information via reports and on-line inquiries. MRCS supports many projects, each project with its own MR data base and commands. It provides, via common control logic, standard operations such as the creation, updating, and printing of MRS, and the extraction of data from them. Each project then defines the fields, validity checks, defaults, prompting sequences, and report formats which satisfy its particular requirements, and these are used to produce an MRCS for that project.
