The rapid growth of global aviation for business and pleasure has created the need for automated terminal systems of increasing complexity and capability. Continued increases in the aircraft population will require higher levels of automation. Sperry Univac is responding to this challenge with a multiprocessing system, including hardware and software, currently under development which will enable controllers to safely manage the crowded skies.
