As the shared memory bus becomes a major performance bottleneck for many numerical applications on multicore chips, understanding how the increased parallelism on chip strains the memory bandwidth and hence affects the efficiency of parallel codes becomes a critical issue. This paper introduces the notion of memory access intensity to facilitate quantitative analysis of program's memory behavior on multicores which employ state-of-the-art prefetching hardware. Three numerical solvers for large scale sparse linear systems are used to demonstrate the estimation of memory access intensity and its effect on program performance.
