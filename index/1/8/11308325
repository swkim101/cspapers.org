This paper discusses a sequence of deductive parsers, called PAD1 -- PAD5, that utilize an axiomatization of the principles and parameters of GB theory, including a restricted transformational component (Move-Î±). PAD2 uses an inference control strategy based on the 'freeze' predicate of Prolog-II, while PAD3 -- 5 utilize the Unfold-Fold transformation to transform the original axiomatization into a form that functions as a recursive descent Prolog parser for the fragment.
