Multimedia applications invariably require guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) and resource reservation. These requirements have raised numerous challenging technical issues for routing in MANETS. We have proposed a hybrid Differentiated Services Architecture (HDSA) to provide QoS provisioning in dynamic topology based MANET. Our proposed HDSA introduces routing metrics such as available bandwidth within each DiffServ class and delay that are more appropriate for QoS routing rather than the hop distance. In order to guarantee QoS we have introduced semi state-full features to differentiated services architecture along with reduced routing packet propagation overhead. The performance of our distributed algorithm is investigated by examples and simulation in both static and dynamic networks. The gain achieved by HDSA is an important achievement in wireless mobile networks.
