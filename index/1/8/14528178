Research can rarely be performed on large-scale, distributed systems at the level of thousands of workstations. In this paper, we describe the motivating constraints, design principles, and architecture for an extensible, distributed system operating in such an environment. The constraints include continuous operation, dynamic system evolution, and integration with extant systems. The Information Bus, our solution, is a novel synthesis of four design principles: core communication protocols have minimal semantics, objects are self-describing, types can be dynamically defined, and communication is anonymous. The current implementation provides both flexibility and high performance, and has been proven in several commercial environments, including integrated circuit fabrication plants and brokerage/trading floors.
