This paper introduces the CYCLOPS, a novel robotic tool for single-access and natural-orifice endoscopic surgery. Based on the concept of tendon-driven parallel robots, this highly original design gives the system some of its unique capabilities. Just to name a few, unparalleled force exertion capabilities of up to 65N, large and adjustable workspace, bimanual instrument triangulation. Due to the simplicity and nature of the design, the system could be adapted to an existing laparoscope or flexible endoscope. This promises a more immediate and accelerated route to clinical translation not only through endearing low-cost and adaptive features, but also by directly addressing several major barriers of existing designs.
