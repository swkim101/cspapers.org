In this paper, we discuss augmentations of the nested relational algebra with programming constructs, such as while-loops and for-loops. We show that the algebras obtained in this way are equivalent to a slight extension of the powerset algebra, thus emphasizing both the strength and the naturalness of the powerset algebra as a tool to manipulate nested relations, and, at the same time, indicating more direct ways to implement this algebra.
