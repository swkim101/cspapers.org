This paper uses rotors in Geometric Algebra to formulate a stable adaptive identifier on the group of rigid body rotations. This identifier is intended to estimate the alignment offsets between independent sensors. The approach provides a straightforward geometric interpretation based on first-order rotor kinematics. Lyapunov theory is used to prove the stability of the identifier, and numerical simulations illustrate its behavior with and without measurement noise.
