This paper presents a method for representing acoustic information with point clouds by tying it to geometrical features. The motivation is to create a representation of this information that is well suited for mobile robotic applications. In particular, the proposed approach is designed to take advantage of the use of multiple coordinate frames. As an illustrative example, we present a way to create an audio augmented point cloud by adding estimated audio power to the point cloud created by a RGB-D camera. A few applications of this method are presented.
