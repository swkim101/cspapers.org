Requirements specification is an important problem in software engineering. Key challenges in Requirements Engineering (RE) include enabling different stakeholders to understand and validate the requirements, and enabling collaboration among different types of stakeholders with different skills and expertise and potentially conflicting needs and expectations. We contend that collaboration among both technical and non-technical stakeholders is improved by a requirements specification technique that provides both precision and usability - and a better balance of the two. We implement our specification technique in iMuse - Interactive Model-based Use-case and Storytelling Environment. In this demo, we show how iMuse can be used by stakeholders to express and view narrative functional requirements.
