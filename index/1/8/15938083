Due to the recent growth of the World Wide Web, numerous spatio-temporal applications can obtain their required information from web sources. In this demonstration we show The WorldInfo Assistant, an application that extracts and integrates spatial, temporal and other information about dierent regions of the world from dierent web sources and databases. This application also provides integration of dierent vector data with the satellite images of dierent regions of the world. Finally, We demonstrate several approaches for ecient querying moving objects with predefined paths and schedules.
