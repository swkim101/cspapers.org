In safety-oriented applications, the software has to fulfil certain stringent reliability requirements. In order to determine the reliability of the software, a variety of different methods can be used. The methods used for the reliability proof of a computerized reactor protection system are discussed in this paper. In addition to the constructive approach with structured programming, defensive programming and other guidelines also concerning the operating system, the analytical approach is taken. This includes the use of an automatic test system for statical and dynamical analysis of the software and automatic test data generation. Finally, a systemtest is conducted, where test data are produced according to the process and the results are compared with the results of a simulation model.
