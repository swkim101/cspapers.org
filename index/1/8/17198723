In the sequence of events normally associated with the design cycle for a digital system, the two operations where simulation has the greatest impact are at opposite ends of the cycle. These are the Design Verification step and the Functional Test Generation step in Figure 1.
 Between Design Verification and Test Generation, the implementation, partitioning, packaging, placement, and routing operations are performed. These operations lead to a complete design, and all work from a common data base. Each step in the cycle augments the data base as the design progresses from concept to hardware.
