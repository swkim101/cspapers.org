Presents our project to develop a personal robot called Diligent. We first discuss the main issues involved in personal robotics. Then we analyze some of the key features implied by what we call "human-friendly navigation". Finally, we present the current state of Diligent. Diligent is already able to navigate safely and repeatedly in a relatively large environment. It is also capable of some preliminary human-robot interactions through very simple and intuitive commands.
