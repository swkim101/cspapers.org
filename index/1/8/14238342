This paper presents EME, a lour-cost solution for a highly modular multiprocessing hardware-software environment that can be useful in designing autonomous mobile robots. High processing capabilities, the ability to interface a large number of sensors and actuators, extensibility, redundancy and flexibility are issues addressed by EME. An autonomous robot equipped with two cameras, one for line-following and the other for visual communication by light signals, is used to demonstrate EME capabilities and performances.
