We address the problem of identifying local experts on Twitter. Specifically, we propose a local expertise framework that integrates both users' topical expertise and their local authority by leveraging over 15 million geo-tagged Twitter lists. We evaluate the proposed approach across 16 queries coupled with over 2,000 individual judgments from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our initial experiments find significant improvement over a naive local expert finding approach, suggesting the promise of exploiting geo-tagged Twitter lists for local expert finding.
