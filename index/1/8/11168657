This paper generalizes the backpropagation method to a general network containing feedback connections. The network model considered consists of interconnected groups of neurons, where each group could be fully interconnected (it could have feedback connections, with possibly asymmetric weights), but no loops between the groups are allowed. A stochastic descent algorithm is applied, under a certain inequality constraint on each intra-group weight matrix which ensures for the network to possess a unique equilibrium state for every input.
