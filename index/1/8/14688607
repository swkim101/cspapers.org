Some general and specific ideas are advanced about the design and implementation of causal monitoring systems for complex sites such as a nuclear power plant or NASA missions control room. Such "causal monitors" are interesting from both the theoretical and engineering viewpoints, and would greatly improve existing man-machine interfaces to complex systems.
