Parallel with the increasing acceptance and utilization of microelectronic techniques has come a corresponding increase in the complexity of required circuits and in the number of factors to be considered when formulating and implementing a design. When one considers that many steps in the design process are repetitive, and that data gathering and documentation occupy the largest percent of the engineering time-cycle, it becomes clear that more help can and must be provided for the designer in the form of computer aids.
 If the full potential power of computers is to be realized in the design and production of electronic systems in tomorrow's industrial environment, an integrated systems approach must be derived. Under a study contract with the Air Force*, a concept known as “DAMES” (Design Automation for the Manufacture of Electronic Systems) has been developed o overcome current limitation, and provide a base for evolution and expansion to accommodate future needs. This paper describes the needs and environment for such a system, the general DAMES approach, and an initial version which could be implemented using currently available hardware and software.
