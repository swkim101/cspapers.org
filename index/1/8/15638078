The Application Display Generator (ADG) is a graphical environment for the design and implementation of embedded system user interfaces. It is a major component of the Graphical Specification Subsystem (GSS) in Lockheed's Express knowledge-based software development environment. ADG gives non-programmers simple and flexible methods for graphically specifying the presentation and behavior of embedded system user interfaces. In the ADG methodology arbitrary presentations are attached to abstract object behaviors. This approach makes it possible to provide unconstrained presentations, intelligent user support, rapid prototyping, and flexible facilities for composing complex objects.
