In this paper, a novel method to synthesize a desired trajectory and sensory feedback control laws for robots based on the statistical characteristics of direct teaching data by a human is proposed. This work was motivated by a poor performance of an origami-folding robot developed by the authors. Since the robot simply replayed a given trajectory without sensory feedback control, it often failed in folding due to the fluctuation of origami paper behaviors.
