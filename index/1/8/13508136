There appears to be a real dichotomy in the use of the UML vs. text based Use Case development for requirements elicitation and documentation, that is, on those projects where use cases are work products. Not only are there different processes in place for text and graphical use case modeling, but also there are a variety of approaches and philosophies in each camp. This paper will discuss the prose vs. graphical approaches to requirements elicitation, observed advantages and disadvantages of each, and suggest best practices for improving and/or creating effective processes for requirements elicitation.
