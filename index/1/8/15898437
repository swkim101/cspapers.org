This paper describes a system being developed to bridge the gap between an application program and a user inexperienced in the ways of computers. The user explores the characteristics of the available programs by a natural language dialogue with the system. The dialogue is supported by a knowledge base covering both the program semantics and the application domain. This paper addresses the problems of representation and inference involved in this approach and describes our solution for them.
