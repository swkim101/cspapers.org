Virtual and augmented reality are becoming the new medium that transcend the way we interact with virtual content, paving the way for many immersive and interactive forms of applications. The main purpose of my research is to create a seamless combination of physiological sensing with virtual reality to provide users with a new layer of input modality or as a form of implicit feedback. To achieve this, my research focuses in novel augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) based application for a multi-user, multi-view, multi-modal system augmented by physiological sensing methods towards an increased public and social acceptance.
