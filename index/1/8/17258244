A <i>totally odd K</i><sub>4</sub>-<i>subdivision</i> is a subdivision of <i>K</i><sub>4</sub> where each subdivided edge has odd length. The recognition of a totally odd <i>K</i><sub>4</sub>-subdivision plays an important role in both graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Sewell and Trotter [53], Zang [63] and Thomassen [60] independently conjectured the existence of a polynomial time recognition algorithm. In this paper, we give the first polynomial time algorithm for solving this problem.
 We also study the <i>the parity two disjoint rooted paths problem</i> where we determine if there exists two vertex disjoint paths of a specified parity between two pairs of terminals.
 Using a similar technique, we give an <i>O</i>(|<i>E</i>(<i>G</i>)||<i>V</i>(<i>G</i>)|α(|<i>E</i>(<i>G</i>)|,|<i>V</i>(<i>G</i>)|)) algorithm for the parity two disjoint rooted paths problem on an input graph <i>G</i>, where α(|<i>E</i>(<i>G</i>)|,|<i>V</i>(<i>G</i>)|) is the inverse of the Ackermann function. We note that this clearly gives an algorithm for the well-known non-parity version of the two disjoint rooted paths problem [19, 50, 52, 55, 58].
 We then extend our approach to give a polynomial time algorithm which determines, for any fixed <i>k</i>, whether there exists a cycle of a given parity through <i>k</i> independent input edges.
 This generalizes the non-parity version of the algorithm in [22]. Thomassen [61] gave a polynomial algorithm for the case <i>k</i> = 2 and hoped to use this algorithm to recognize a totally odd <i>K</i><sub>4</sub>-subdivision. Our algorithm runs in <i>O</i>(|<i>E</i>(<i>G</i>)||<i>V</i>(<i>G</i>)|α(|<i>E</i>(<i>G</i>)|,|<i>V</i>(<i>G</i>)|)) for any fixed <i>k</i>.
 Finally, we give an <i>O</i>(|<i>V</i>(<i>G</i>)|<sup>2</sup> + |<i>E</i>(<i>G</i>)|α(|<i>E</i>(<i>G</i>)|,|<i>V</i>(<i>G</i>)|log|<i>V</i>(<i>G</i>)|)) algorithm to decide whether a graph contains <i>k</i> disjoint paths from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> (with |<i>A</i>| = |<i>B</i>| = <i>k</i>) that are not all of the same parity.
 This answers a conjecture of Thomassen [60]. This problem arises from the study of totally odd-<i>K</i><sub>4</sub>-subdivisions in 3-connected graphs [60].
