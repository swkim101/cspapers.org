This paper describes a dynamic service reconfiguration model where the proxy is composed of a chain of service objects called mobilets (pronounced as mo-be-lets), which can be deployed onto the network actively. This model offers flexibility because the chain of mobilets can be dynamically reconfigured to adapt to the vigorous changes in the characteristics of the wireless environment, without interrupting the service provision for other mobile nodes. Furthermore, mobilets can also be migrated to a new proxy server when the mobile node moves to a different network domain. We have realized the dynamic service reconfiguration model by crafting its design into a programmable infrastructure that forms the baseline architecture of the WebPADS (short for Web Proxy for Actively Deployable Services) system.
