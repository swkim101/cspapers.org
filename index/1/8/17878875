A large autonomous logistics tracked carrier, which can be deployed in a tropical forest for day and night, has been developed. This paper presents details of the architecture and major system components. Emphasis is made on the conversion of a highly non-linear and mechanically-operated vehicle into a computer-controlled system, the perception mechanism used to identify drivable areas, and algorithms developed for vehicle path planning. A suite of active and passive sensors is employed for visual guidance. The data from different sensors are fused and fed to a path planner that takes into account the vehicle dynamics and generates the heading and speed commands for the vehicle control system. The paper includes results from a series of field trials completed in a tropical forest and conditions that are unique to the region.
