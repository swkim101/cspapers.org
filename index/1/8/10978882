Some emerging applications deal with graph data and relie on graph matching and mining. The service-oriented graph matching and mining tool has been required. In this demo we present the web service tool WS-GraphMatching which supports the efficient and visualized matching of polytrees, series-parallel graphs, and arbitrary graphs with bounded feedback vertex set. Its embedded matching algorithms take in account the similarity of vertex-to-vertex and graph structures, allowing path contraction, vertex deletion, and vertex insertions. It provides one-to-one matching queries as well as queries in batch modes including one-to-many matching mode and many-to-many matching mode. It can be used for predicting unknown structured information, comparing and finding conserved patterns, and resolving ambiguous identification of vertices. WS-GraphAligner is available as web-server at: http://odysseus.cs.fiu.edu:8080/MinePW/pages/gmapping/GMMain.html.
