In this paper, we demonstrate that the effects of receiving negative evaluation ITom audio-visual image of oneself on a computer screen am clearly diEerent from that of receiving someone else. When seeing the seKmage, subjects claimed more responsibility for the evaluation, perceived the evaluation to be more valid and objective, and showed higher public self-awareness. Self-image subjects showed less impression management and less negative bias on recognition memory. Implications fi3r using oneâ€™s own Ere in virtual reality and other interfaces are discussed.
