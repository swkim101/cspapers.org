This paper describes an algorithm to transform business process models into a functional requirements specification, specified in the form of use case diagrams. The benefit of such an algorithm is that it helps to draw up a functional requirements specification more quickly, because business process models may be available in an enterprise, while use case diagrams have to be developed by performing interviews. The use case diagrams that result from applying the algorithm, specify a software system that provides automated support for the original business processes. We show this with a case study from practice.
