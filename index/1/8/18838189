Generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPiVs) are used to study symmetric multiserver multiqueue systems in which the polling order is either cyclic, or random, or optimized, and the service discipline is 1-limited. Exact numerical results are obtained by means of GreatSPIV, the software tool for the analysis of GSPNS, and are presented as curves of the average customer waiting and sojourn times for Markovian systems comprising a number of finite-capacity waiting lines. The numerical results indicate that the random and optimal polling strategies provide upper and lower bounds of acceptable tightness on the performance of the cyclic polling case, while being substantially simpler to study and solve.
