Although there exists a computer science certification exam for high school teachers in some states, there appear to be no general requirements for teaching computer science at the high school level in most states. This may imply that CS material taught at the high school level is not always well-suited for students who want to pursue CS in college.This paper discusses some observations on what skills and abilities are important to prepare high school students for a successful career in CS at the college level. It also discusses preconceived ideas of college freshmen on what computer programming is all about.
