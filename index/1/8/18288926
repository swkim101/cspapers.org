This paper presents a system on chip (SoC) designed specifically to control a mm3-sized microrobot called I-SWARM. The robot is intended to be part of a colony of 1000 members for studying swarm behavior in real time with real robots. The SoC offers a well-suited hardware platform to run multi-agent systems software. The SoC enables control of movement, communications and sensing. It is a platform where run multi-agent system software. With these capabilities, the robot is able for example to avoiding collisions, perform cooperative tasks, share information and, of course, solve different swarm scenarios and more complex tasks. The SoC has been fabricated with a 0.13 mum ultra low power CMOS process of STMicroelectronics and consumes less than 1.5 mW.
