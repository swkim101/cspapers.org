A mechanical model of the human vocal system is being developed based on a mechatronics technology under a feedback control. While various ways of vocal sound production have been actively studied so far, a mechanical construction of the vocal system is considered to advantageously realize natural vocalization with its fluid dynamics. Motors are employed for the manipulation of the mechanical system. The system is able to adoptively learn the relations between motor control parameters and the produced vocal sounds using an auditory feedback with neural networks, by mimicking a human vocalization. This paper presents the construction of a talking robot and its singing performance, together with the adaptive control for the pitch learning. The talking robot generates vowel and consonant sounds of different pitches by dynamically controlling the vocal cords, vocal tract and nasal cavity.
