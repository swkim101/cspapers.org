As the number of system users increases, the degree of formal training of the typical user declines. Techniques such as menu selection, which can best accommodate the novice user, almost necessarily must be included in a strategy for person-computer communication. Yet care must be taken that the experienced or sophisticated user is not encumbered with an interface that involves frustratingly slow entry of commands or procedures. This paper details the process and techniques required to develop and test an interface that would satisfy the needs of a broad spectrum of users. Two design and evaluation iterations are described.
