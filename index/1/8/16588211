Addresses in the Internet are typically measured as if they represent larger aggregates. These larger blocks may be based on prefixes advertised through BGP, with larger prefixes broken into "/24s." Such an approach is typical in network mapping and other research, and tries to balance the detail available by probing more addresses with the efficiency available by probing only as many as will discover new information. In this paper, we consider prefix homogeneity: the extent to which addresses within the same prefix are co-located in topology and have similar performance. We consider whether "24" is the right unit of homogeneity, whether additional efficiency is possible by using larger or even discontiguous address aggregates in some cases, and in what situations additional detail may be missed by treating addresses as representative of /24 blocks. With these results, we present a map of homogeneous address aggregates in the network.
