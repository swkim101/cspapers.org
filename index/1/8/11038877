In my research, I propose an automated technique to support bug investigation by using a novel analysis of the history of the source code. During the bug-fixing process, developers spend a high amount of manual effort investigating the bug in order to answer a series of questions about it. My research will support developers in answering the following questions about a bug: Who is the most suitable developer to fix the bug?, Where is the bug located?, When was the bug inserted? and Why was the bug inserted?
