In this paper, we propose a team formation methodology based on cooperative learning teams, adopted from the area of educational research. Cooperative learning is a type of learning where students work in teams and learn through team-based interactions. In education, research in assigning students to appropriate teams and enforcing fair assessment of student performance in a team have generated useful policies and rules. In our multiagent systems project, we use these policies and rules as the underlying framework to evaluate and form teams. We have built a system called I-MINDS as an infrastructure to support cooperative learning among remote and in-class students.
