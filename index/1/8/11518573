Commitment Ordering (CO) is a serializability concept, that allows global serializability to be effectively achieved across multiple autonomous Resource Managers (RMs). The RMs may use different (any) concurrency control mechanisms. Thus, CO provides a solution for the long standing global serializability problem. RM autonomy means that no concurrency control information is shared with other entities, except Atomic Commitment (AC) protocol (e.g. Two Phase Commitment 2PC) messages. CO is a necessary condition for guaranteeing global serializability across autonomous RMs. CO generalizes the popular Strong-Strict Two Phase Locking concept (S-S2PL; “release locks applied on behalf of a transaction only after the transaction has ended”). While S-S2PL is subject to deadlocks, CO exhibits deadlock-free executions when implemented as nonblocking (optimistic) concurrency control mechanisms.
