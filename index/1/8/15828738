There is minimally invasive method called Interventional Radiology (IR) that achieves an operation by using diagnostic imaging equipment such as Computed Tomography (CT). IR has advantages that it is a minimally invasive method and it is applied widely such as lung cancer treatment, liver cancer treatment, biopsy, and so on. However, it has a problem that doctors are exposed by X-ray due to a procedure in the vicinity of the CT gantry. To solve this problem, we have developed a robot so we calling “Zerobot”. Zerobot has six DOF and controlled remotely. We previously conducted animal experiment using a rabbit to evaluate Zerobot. As a result, percutaneous puncture was impossible without epidermis cutting. Therefore, we developed a new function called instantaneously puncture that can achieve high speed and short stroke puncture like a human operator. In this paper, overview of Zerobot is described first. Then, measurement of puncture speed of a human operator is described. Furthermore, design and system structure of instantaneously puncture system is described. Finally, we present results of animal experiment using the instantaneously puncture system.
