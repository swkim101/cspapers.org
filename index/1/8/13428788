X-Net is a new local area network based on the dual, unidirectional bus topology. Stations are connected to two fiber-optic busses using active switches. At light load, X-Net behaves as a random access scheme. With increasing load, transmissions are done in an orderly manner, arranged into cycles.
The main advantage of X-Net is its superior channel utilization and delay performance, compared to other bus schemes. The packet delay is bounded at all loads. Performance is shown to be satisfactory over a wide range of a values, where a is the ratio of end-to-end medium propagation delay to the packet transmission time. Therefore, X-Net is a suitable candidate for operation at high speeds.
