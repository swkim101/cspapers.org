A five week program which involved extensive exposure to a complex object-oriented virtual environment was evaluated for efficacy in learning fundamental object-oriented principles. Students (n=57) from two CS1 classes were asked to write essays on their knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts following their participation in the program. A systematic method for evaluating student knowledge was followed by rating the student's knowledge on a one-to-five rating scale. The results indicated that the students understood, by virtue of their ability to write intelligibly, the concepts of abstraction, inheritance and method override. Demonstrated knowledge of the concept of state was far less convincing.
