Rectangular dualisation is a technique used to generate rectangular topologies for use in top-down floorplanning of integrated circuits. This paper presents an efficient algorithm that transforms an arbitrary graph, representing a custom integrated circuit, into one suitable for rectangular dualisation. The algorithm makes use of efficient techniques in graph processing such as planar embedding and introduces a novel procedure to transform a tree of biconnected sub-graphs into a block neighbourhood graph that is a path.
