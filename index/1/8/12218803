Presents two control strategies based on the data provided by a camera and a 2D laser range sensor for driving a mobile robot towards a target amidst obstacles. The methods are based on the task function formalism and use the robot redundancy with respect to the tracking task to control both the base and the camera during the avoidance phase. Simulation results are given at the end of the paper.
