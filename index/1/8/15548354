We start withan overviewof algorithmiccomplexity problemsin coding theory We then show that the problemof com- puting the minimumdiktanceof a binaryIinwr code is NP-hard,and the corresponding deci~"on problemis W-complete. This constitutes a proof of the conjecture Bedekamp, McEliece,vanTilborg, dating back to 1978. Extensionsand applications of this result to other problemsin codingtheqv are discussed. 1. Introduction. This paper is organized in a manner contrapositive to the talk. In the talk, we give a detailed overview of algorithmic complexity issueain codhg theory. Herein, westart with an overviewof the prominentrole that computational complexity plays in coding theory: we briefly surveythe numerousalgorithmic complexity issuesthat arise in code construction and decoding. Subsequently,we focus on one specific problem. Namely, we consider the problem of computing the minimum distance of a linear code, which is also equivalentto the problem of finding the shortest cycle in a linear matroid over a finite field (90). A long-standing conjecture (12) says that this problem is NP-hard, and we will settle this conjecture in the ai%rmative. We provide a detailed proof. We hope that our proof illustrates some of the elegant techniques used in coding theory today, such as the construction of MDS codes via Vandermonde matri- ces (15, 59, 72) and concatenated coding (23, 31), for instance. It is interesting that algebraic techniques of this kind cart be employed to answer an essentially combinatorial ques- tion. The complexity of computing the minimum distance and the proof of the conjecture of Berlekamp,McEliece, and vanTilborg (12) will be only briefly mentioned in the talk.
