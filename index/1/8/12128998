Let S be a subset of boolean functions f : {0, 1)” + {0, 1). We say that a set X of binary vectors of length n forms an interpolation set for S if for any function f E S the values off on X uniquely determines f. Small interpolation sets are of interest in leaning theory and combinatorial group testing. In this paper we consider the class S; of functions which are symmetric on their sets of (at most k) relevant variables. Our tist result is a proof of existence of an interpolation set for S; of size O(k’ log k log n This comes close to the known lower bound of S2(k 2 log n/ log k). Our second result is an explicit construction of an interpolation set of size O(k’ log’ n), which also yields an efficient algorithm for reconstructing f from its values on X. No interpolation set for S; of size subexponential in k was previously lmown.
