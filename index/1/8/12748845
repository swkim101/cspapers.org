We present an extension of domino tilings of planar lattice regions to three dimensions. The tilings consist of filling "Aztec" octahedral and tetrahedral regions with triangular prisms. The set of tilings corresponds bijectively to a set of ordered domino tilings of planar regions, where the domino tilings are forced to respect a partial order based on a height function representation. We define a natural Markov Chain on the set of tilings and prove that it is rapidly mixing. This is the first nontrivial proof of rapid mixing for a Markov chain on configurations which correspond to a 4-dimensional height function. Simulations based on this Markov chain have shown that a class of octahedral and tetrahedral regions will have frozen regions akin to-the arctic circle theorem, which states that the nonfrozen regions of random tilings of the Aztec diamond converge to a circle. Next, we show that for a second class of tihngs, the octahedral and tetrahedral tilings will have equal entropy. This is surprising because they correspond to ordered tilings of square and Aztec diamond regions, respectively, which are known to have different entropy in two dimensions.
