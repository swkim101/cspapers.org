Web search engines discover indexable documents by recursively 'crawling' from a seed URL. Their rankings take into account link popularity. While this works well, it introduces biases towards older documents. Older documents are more likely to be the target of links, while new documents with few, or no, incoming links are unlikely to rank highly in search results.
 We describe a novel system for 'new-Web' search based on links retrieved from the Twitter micro-blogging service. The Twitter service allows individuals, organisations and governments to rapidly disseminate very short messages to a wide variety of interested parties. When a Twitter message contains a URL, we use the Twitter message as a description of the URL's target. As Twitter is frequently used for discussion of current events, these messages offer useful, up- to-date annotations and instantaneous popularity readings for a small, but timely, portion of the Web.
 Our working system is simple and fast and we believe may offer a significant advantage in revealing new information on the Web that would otherwise be hidden from searchers. Beyond the basic system, we anticipate the Twitter messages may add supplementary terms for a URL, or add weight to existing terms, and that the reputation or authority of each message sender may serve to weight both annotations and query-independent popularity.
