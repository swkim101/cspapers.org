In the analysis of natural images, Gaussian scale mixtures (GSM) have been used to account for the statistics of filter responses, and to inspire hierarchical cortical representational learning schemes. GSMs pose a critical assignment problem, working out which filter responses were generated by a common multiplicative factor. We present a new approach to solving this assignment problem through a probabilistic extension to the basic GSM, and show how to perform inference in the model using Gibbs sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on both synthetic and image data.
