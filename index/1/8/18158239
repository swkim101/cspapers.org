We have been studying the performance of a bottlenosed dolphin on a delayed matching-to-sample task to gain insight into the processes and mechanisms that the animal uses during echolocation. The dolphin recognizes targets by emitting natural sonar signals and listening to the echoes that return. This paper describes a novel neural network architecture, called an integrator gateway network, that we have developed to account for this performance. The integrator gateway network combines information from multiple echoes to classify targets with about 90% accuracy. In contrast, a standard backpropagation network performed with only about 63% accuracy.
