The presence of redundant actuators in dynamic systems increases system efficiency and capability. An example of this increased capability is avoidance of actuator saturation at critical moments. Defining a system maximum efficiency function, this paper transforms the problem of avoiding actuator saturation into an optimization problem with the capability of on-line solution. The paper also presents and evaluates the solution of optimization problems with inequality constraints. Finally, the performance of the proposed system is examined through simulation.
