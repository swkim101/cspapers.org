A video sharing service allows “user generated”video clips to be uploaded, and users of the service can view, rate, and comment on uploaded videos. Prior work has focused mostly on the YouTube video sharing service [1,2]. While YouTube is arguably the most popular video sharing service, studying the workload characteristics of other video sharing services, and identifying invariant properties as well as significant differences, is an important step towards building a broader understanding of this type of service. With the aforementioned objective, we collected traces from four video sharing services: Dailymotion, Yahoo! video, Veoh, and Metacafe. Dailymotion is France’s leading video sharing service and caters mostly to French-speaking demographics, while Yahoo! video, Veoh, and Metacafe are USbased services. While all four host user generated video clips, Veoh, in addition, also serves content from major studios and independent production houses, and utilizes peerto-peer technology to distribute longer videos. Metacafe is distinctive among these services in its use of a revenue sharing model in which content creators are paid for videos that exceed a certain threshold of views. These services cover a spectrum of possibilities in the realm of video sharing.
