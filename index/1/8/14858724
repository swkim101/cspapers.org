This extremely challenging combinatorial problem requires determining the number of sites in the protein and the set of residues involved in each of them. We formulate it as a distance-based supervised clustering task, where training proteins are employed to learn a proper distance function between residues. A partial clustering is then returned by searching for maximum-weight cliques in the resulting weighted graph representation of proteins. A novel stochastic local search algorithm is proposed to efficiently generate approximate solutions. Our method achieves substantial improvements over a previous structured-output approach for metal binding site prediction. Significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art are also achieved in predicting catalytic sites from 3D structure in enzymes.
