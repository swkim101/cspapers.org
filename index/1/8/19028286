The Δ-MIN method consists of a best-first backtracking algorithm applicable to a large class of information-gathering problems, such as most natural language analyzers, many speech understanding systems, and some forms of planning and automated knowledge acquisition. This paper focuses on the general Δ-MIN search-control method and characterizes the problem spaces to which it may apply. Essentially, Δ-MIN provides a best-first search mechanism over the space of alternate interpretations of an input sequence, where the interpreter is assumed to be organized as a set of cooperating expert modules.
