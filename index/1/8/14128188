Yalut is a novel user-centric hybrid content sharing overlay for social networking. Yalut enables the users to retain control over their own data and preserve their privacy, whilst still using the popular centralized services. In this demonstration, we show the feasibility of Yalut by integrating the service with the popular social networking apps on Android devices, Mac and Windows desktop platforms. We show that it is possible to provide the benefits of distributed content sharing on top of the existing centralized services with minimal changes to the content sharing process.
