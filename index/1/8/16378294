Several computational applications, such as randomizing algorithms [Ra], stochastic simulation [SC, KG] and cryptographic protocols [B11, GM, W] assume a fast source of unbiased, independent coin flips. Unfortunately, the available physical sources of randomness, such as noise diodes and geiger counters are at best imperfect [Mu]. Santha and Vazirani [SV] consider a very general model for such imperfect sources of randomness: the slightly random source. A slightly random source is a black box
