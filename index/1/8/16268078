This paper attempts to unify a variety of dynamic hashing methods. Spiral storage, linear hashing and to a certain extent, linear hashing with partial expansions can be seen as particular cases of a more general technique. The approach is closest to spiral storage in concept. A new instantiation of the general method is offered which permits an adjustment to the dynamic growth rate during expansion. In addition, “optimai” performance results if a sufficiently accurate estimate of the file size is possible. UNIFIED DYNAMIC HASHING
