Neural network is a technology for Intelligent Transportation System and it is important in Vehicle type recognition. However, traditional vehicle type recognition method always utilize BP network. A new vehicle type recognition based on radial basic function neural network was proposed. Also discussed are the problem of feature of vehicle feature vector, the problem of normalization of the image-size, and the problem of training algorithm of hidden layerâ€™s neural nodes. Experiments have been conducted for video monitored by vehicle monitor. The results show that compared with BP neural network, the RBF neural network can decrease the error rate, the training time, and the recognition time efficiently.
