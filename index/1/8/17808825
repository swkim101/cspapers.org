In this paper we introduce a shoe-integrated system for human abnormal gait detection. This intelligent system focuses on detecting the following patterns: normal gait, toe in, toe out, oversupination, and heel walking gait abnormalities. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) consisting of three-dimensional gyroscopes and accelerometers is employed to measure angular velocities and accelerations of the foot. Four force sensing resistors (FSRs) and one bend sensor are installed on the insole of each foot for force and flexion information acquisition. The proposed detection method is mainly based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature generation and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for multi-pattern classification. In the present study, four subjects tested the shoe-integrated device in outdoor environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust and efficient in detecting abnormal gait patterns. Our goal is to provide a cost-effective system for detecting gait abnormalities in order to assist persons with abnormal gaits in the developing of a normal walking pattern in their daily life.
