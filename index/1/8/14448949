Vision systems that have successfully supported nontrivial tasks have invariably taken advantage of constraints derived from the task and environment to increase reliability and lower the complexity of perception. We propose that it is possible to build a general purpose vision system, that is, one that can support a wide variety of tasks, and take advantage of such constraints. The central idea within our proposed architecture is the reactive skill. Skills are concurrent control routines assembled at run time using instructions from a symbolic execution system. Visual modules are used as resources in the construction of these skills. Skills control the agent as continuous feedback loops but are constructed using discrete, symbolic instructions. The key to general-purpose vision is the ability to parametrize the primitive elements of the vision system and to compose visual and control routines in a variety of ways. We demonstrate the architecture in the context of an implemented example task of a robot collecting trash off a floor and depositing it in a garbage can.
