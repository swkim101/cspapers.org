In real applications, a given user buys or rates an item based on his/her interests. Learning to leverage this interest information is often critical for recommender systems. However, in existing recommender systems, the information about latent user interests are largely under-explored. To that end, in this paper, we propose an interest expansion strategy via personalized ranking based on the topic model, named iExpand, for building an interest-oriented collaborative filtering framework. The iExpand method introduces a three-layer, user-interest-item, representation scheme, which leads to more interpretable recommendation results and helps the understanding of the interactions among users, items, and user interests. Moreover, iExpand strategically deals with many issues, such as the overspecialization and the cold-start problems. Finally, we evaluate iExpand on benchmark data sets, and experimental results show that iExpand outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
