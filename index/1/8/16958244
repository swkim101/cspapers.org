During system design, one or more portions of the system may be implemented with standard components that have a fixed pin structure and communication protocol. This paper described a new technique, interface process generation, for interfacing standard components that have incompatible protocols. Given an HDL description of the two protocols, we present a method to generate an interface process that allows the two protocols to communicate with each other.
