Because of their simplicity, wave variables have become almost a standard strategy for stabilizing delayed bilateral teleoperation systems. However, the price to pay for a stable behavior is a degradation in the performance of the teleoperation system. Recently, more flexible and transparency oriented bilateral architectures have been proposed (e.g. TDPN, PSPM, Two-Layer approach) but they are complex to implement and to tune. In [1], a strategy for blending the high performance of the new control methodologies with the simplicity of wave based bilateral teleoperation has been proposed. Nevertheless, while appealing in terms of simplicity, this method is conservative in terms of the transparency that can be achieved. In this paper, we extend the architecture in [1] in order to optimize the use of the energy and for achieving a coupling that is as close as possible to the desired one while preserving the passivity of the overall system.
