A useful approach for enabling computers to automatically create new content is utilizing the text, media, and information already present on the World Wide Web. The newly created content is known as "machine-generated content". For example, a machine-generated content system may create a multimedia news show with two animated anchors presenting a news story; one anchor reads the news story with text taken from an existing news article, and the other anchor regularly interrupts with his or her own opinion about the story. In this paper, we present such a system, and describe in detail its strategy for autonomously extracting and selecting the opinions given by the second anchor.
