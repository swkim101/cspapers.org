During recent years, the amount of variability that has to be supported by a software artifact is growing considerably and its management is developing as a main challenge during development, usage, and evolution of software artifacts. Successful management of variability in software artifacts leads to better customizable software products that are in turn likely to result in higher market success.The aim of this workshop is to study software variability management both from a 'problems' and from a 'solutions' perspective by bringing together people from industrial practice and from applied research in academia to present and discuss their respective experience.Issues to be addressed include, but are not limited to, technological, process, and organizational aspects as well as notation, assessment, design, and evolution aspects.
