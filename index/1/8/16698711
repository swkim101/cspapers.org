We propose a new method for implementing impedance control, which is designed to take advantage of the error-correction capabilities of position controllers, while maintaining good impedance tracking performance. The proposed instantaneous model impedance control re-initializes the impedance model to the current position of the robot so the model does not accumulate position errors. The novelty of the method is in using the position feedback both in the outer loop, to track the desired impedance, and in the inner loop to improve robustness. The proposed method includes the dynamic-based and the position-based methods as specific cases, and can be tuned to trade between their corresponding merits. Using simulations, we demonstrate the performance of the new method in comparison with the previous methods. We consider two scenarios: stiff environment, which challenges the position based approach, and load uncertainties, which challenges the dynamic based approach.
