This paper presents a remote gesture input solution for interacting indirectly with user interfaces on mobile and wearable devices. The proposed solution uses a wearable ring platform worn on users index finger. The ring detects and interprets various gestures performed on any available surface, and wirelessly transmits the gestures to the remote device. The ring opportunistically harvests energy from an NFC-enabled phone for perpetual operation without explicit charging. We use a finger-tendon pressure-based solution to detect touch, and a light-weight audio based solution for detecting finger motion on a surface. The two level energy efficient classification algorithms identify 23 unique gestures that include tapping, swipes, scrolling, and strokes for hand written text entry. The classification algorithms have an average accuracy of 73% with no explicit user training. Our implementation supports 10 hours of interactions on a surface at 2 Hz gesture frequency. The prototype was built with off-the-shelf components has a size similar to a large ring.
