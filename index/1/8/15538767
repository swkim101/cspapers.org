We close the gaps between known lower and upper bounds for the online partial-sums problem in the RAM and group models of computation. If elements are chosen from an abstract group, we prove an Ω(lg <i>n</i>) lower bound on the number of algebraic operations that must be performed, matching a well-known upper bound. In the RAM model with <i>b</i>-bit memory registers, we consider the well-studied case when the elements of the array can be changed additively by Δ-bit integers. We give a RAM algorithm that achieves a running time of Θ(1 + lg <i>n</i> / lg(<i>b</i> / Δ)) and prove a matching lower bound in the cell-probe model. Our lower bound is for the amortized complexity, and makes minimal assumptions about the relations between <i>n</i>, <i>b</i>, and Δ. The best previous lower bound was Ω(lg <i>n</i> = (lg lg <i>n</i>+lg <i>b</i>)), and the best previous upper bound matched only in the special case <i>b</i> = Θ(lg <i>n</i>) and Δ = <i>O</i>(lg lg <i>n</i>).
