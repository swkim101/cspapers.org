We have developed a highly functional untethered micro-robot that can manipulate cells with high gripping force in a micro-fluidic chip. The robot has gripping mechanism for grasping and transportation of cells with sufficient power. A permanent magnet is attached at the center of the gripping mechanism, and an electrical magnet controls the position of the magnet from the bottom of the micro-fluidic chip. The distance accuracy of the gripper is 3.0 Î¼m, and it can activate about 50 Hz. The robot has four permanent magnets for positioning, and other four permanent magnets control the robot from the bottom of the micro-fluidic chip. The robot is made very thin and small to allow maneuverability in a micro-fluidic chip. We succeeded in high-power handling and cutting of a cell using this micro-robot.
