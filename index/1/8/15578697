We report on our experience with the accuracy of mean value analysis analytical models for evaluating shared bus multiprocessors operating in a throughput-oriented environment. Having developed separate models for multiprocessors with circuit switched and split transaction, pipelined (packet switched) buses, wc compare the results of the models with those of an actual trace-driven simulation for 5,376 multiprocessor configurations.We find that the analytical models are accurate in predicting the individual processor throughputs and partial bus utilizations. For processor throughput, the difference between the results of the models and simulation are within 1% for 75% of the cases and within 3% in 94% of all cases. For partial bus utilization the model results are with 1% of simulation results in 70% of all cases and within 3% in 92% of all cases. The models are less accurate in predicting cache miss latency.
