Modern warehouse-scale computers (WSCs) are being outfitted with accelerators to provide the significant compute required by emerging intelligent personal assistant (IPA) workloads such as voice recognition, image classification, and natural language processing. It is well known that the diurnal user access pattern of user-facing services provides a strong incentive to co-locate applications for better accelerator utilization and efficiency, and prior work has focused on enabling co-location on multicore processors. However, interference when co-locating applications on non-preemptive accelerators is fundamentally different than contention on multi-core CPUs and introduces a new set of challenges to reduce QoS violation. To address this open problem, we first identify the underlying causes for QoS violation in accelerator-outfitted servers. Our experiments show that queuing delay for the compute resources and PCI-e bandwidth contention for data transfer are the main two factors that contribute to the long tails of user-facing applications. We then present Baymax, a runtime system that orchestrates the execution of compute tasks from different applications and mitigates PCI-e bandwidth contention to deliver the required QoS for user-facing applications and increase the accelerator utilization. Using DjiNN, a deep neural network service, Sirius, an end-to-end IPA workload, and traditional applications on a Nvidia K40 GPU, our evaluation shows that Baymax improves the accelerator utilization by 91.3% while achieving the desired 99%-ile latency target for for user-facing applications. In fact, Baymax reduces the 99%-ile latency of user-facing applications by up to 195x over default execution.
