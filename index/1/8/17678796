A robotic manipulation system that is supposed to replace a human operator needs to deal with a variety of possible manipulation actions. These actions may be more or less constrained in their motion profile and in the accuracy of the transport goals. Some of this variation can be used to simplify the control and to optimize the base placement to improve the efficiency of the generated motion. We present an analysis tool that uses the abstraction of the human actions to generate path with efficient motion profiles. We compare the dynamics of a robot for different paths. We show in experiments that certain path properties are preferred to support efficient control and that the intuitive solution does not necessarily agree with the results optimizing for efficiency.
