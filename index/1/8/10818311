Since for each bundle judges must give a uniform answer on all issues, different partitions of the issues may result in an outcome that significantly differs from the "true," issue-wise, decision. We prove that the bundling problem faced by the chairperson, i.e. trying to bias the outcome towards her own opinion, is computationally difficult in the worst case. Then we study the probability that an effective bundling attack exists as the disparity between the opinions of the judges and the chair varies. We show that if every judge initially agrees with the chair on every issue with probability of at least 1/2, then there is almost always a bundling attack (i.e. a partition) where the opinion of the chair on all issues is approved. Moreover, such a partition can be found efficiently. In contrast, when the probability is lower than 1/2 then the chair cannot force her opinion using bundling even on a single issue.
