Correlation analysis is a basic problem in the field of data stream mining. Typical approaches add sliding window to data streams to get the recent results, but the window length defined by users is always fixed which is not suitable for the changing stream environment. We propose a Boolean representation based data-adaptive method for correlation analysis among a large number of time series streams. The periodical trends of each stream series to are monitored to choose the most suitable window size and group the series with the same trends together. Instead of adopting complex pair-wise calculation, we can also quickly get the correlation pairs of series at the optimal window sizes. All the processing is realized by simple Boolean operations. Both the theory analysis and the experimental evaluations show that our method has good computation efficiency with high accuracy.
