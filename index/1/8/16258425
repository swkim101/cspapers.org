This paper studies the capacity of an indoor wireless system operating at 60 GHZ using a physical channel model that incorporates multiple elements at both antenna terminals. The proposed channel model utilizes the geometric characteristics of the environment, the angle of arrival and angle of departure of each one of the propagation paths, the antenna elements and their spacing. The results showed that the system capacity increases significantly if SIMO, MISO or MIMO configuration is utilized instead of the basic SISO channel. The capacity decreases, as the distance between the terminals increase. In the 90% of the cases the capacity remains above 4 b/s/HZ, even when the receiver is 15 m away from the base station. Finally, very high data rates, even higher than 155 Mb/s, can be achieved maintaining low SNR.
