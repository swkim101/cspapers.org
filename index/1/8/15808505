This paper describes the control of a human-like robotic neck actuated with tendons. The controller regulates the length of the tendons to achieve a desired orientation of the neck and at the same time it maintains the tension of the tendons within certain limits. The solution we propose does not use any model of the system, but it relies on online learning of the different Jacobian mappings required by the controller. Learning, data acquisition and control are simultaneous; thus learning is completely autonomous, and purely online. We show that after enough iterations the controller produces straight trajectories in the task space and is able to maintain the tension of the tendons within safe limits.
