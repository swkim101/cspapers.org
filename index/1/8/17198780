In recent years there has been increasing controversy surrounding the choice of a language for introducing programming to computer science majors. The issue has been complicated by the increasing acceptance of the importance of non-procedural paradigms. This paper compares the available vehicles for teaching programming to beginners. These comparisons are based on the results of a survey conducted by the authors in early 1995 and on the published reports and opinions of other workers in this area.
