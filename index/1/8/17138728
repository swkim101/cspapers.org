(MATH) Let <i>f</i>: {0,1}<sup>n</sup> → {0,1} be a boolean function. For ε&roe; 0 <i>D<inf>e</inf></i>(<i>f</i>) be the minimum depth of a decision tree for <i>f</i> that makes an error for &xie;ε fraction of the inputs &khar; &Egr; {0,1}<sup>n</sup>. We also make an appropriate definition of the approximate certificate complexity of <i>f</i>, <i>C<inf>ε</inf></i>(<i>f</i>). In particular, <i>D<inf>0</inf></i>(<i>f</i>) and <i>C<inf>0</inf></i>(<i>f</i>) are the ordinary decision and certificate complexities of <i>f</i>. It is known that $D_0(f) \leq (C_0(f))^2$. Answering a question of Tardos from 1989, we show that for all $\Ge > 0$ there exists a $\Gd' > 0$ such that for all $0 \leq \Gd < \Gd'$, we have $D_\Ge(f) \leq K (C_\Gd(f))^2$ where $K = K(\Ge,\Gd) > 0$ is a constant independent of <i>f</i>. The algorithm used in the proof is modeled after those developed by R. Impagliazzo and S. Rudich for use in other problems.
