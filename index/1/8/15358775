Draw-a-Secret password schemes, like the Google Android Pattern Lock, entail stroking out a shape on a touch screen. This paper explores techniques for expanding the richness of this input modality (multitouch input, off-target interaction) in order to increase password entropy and resistance to observation. A formative user study highlights user perceptions and usability issues relating to this design space and suggests directions for future development of this concept.
