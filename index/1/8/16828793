Our demonstration consists of sensor nodes suitable for imageintensive network applications. We developed nodes for stationary and mobile deployment, for face recognition and human detection applications, respectively. Both designs consist of a visible spectrum camera sensor and a Zigbee-compliant wireless data transceiver. The stationary model receives input from a PIR motion sensor, while the mobile model incorporates distance measures from either an infrared or ultrasonic sensor and includes a robot for demonstration of mobility. Our node uses strictly commercial off the-shelf components, and not including the robotic accoutrement, is relatively inexpensive. The stationary node will be on display for face recognition of attendees. Additionally, we intend to demonstrate the mobile node for a human detection application, wherein the node detects objects, and transmits them to a host machine for face detection processing.
