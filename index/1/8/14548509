While the idea of extending XML to include object-oriented features has been gaining popularity in general, the potential of inheritance in document design has not been well recognized in contemporary research. In this paper we demonstrate that XML with dynamic inheritance aids better document designs and decreased management overheads and support increased autonomy. As an extended application, we point out that dynamic inheritance also helps effective automated web portal and ontology designs.We present an object-oriented extension to the language of XML to include dynamic inheritance and describe a middle layer that implements our system. We explain our system with several practical examples.
