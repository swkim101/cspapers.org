1. Description of purpose 1.1 Problem Description The object-oriented language community is broadly classified into three categories, i.e. class-based, object-based, and role-based [7, 6]. In class-based systems, the only way to describe an object is through its class. In object-based and role-based systems importance is given to objects. The key feature of a role-based system is the dynamic binding of an object to any other roleobject.
