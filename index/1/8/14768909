Advances in low cost digital computing have spawned new design techniques. One of these, design optimization by adaptive control (DOAC), is explained. The point is made that modeling an entire system to optimize one component has many disadvantages. When using the ideas presented here, a component is removed from a physical system and replaced with a minicomputer, D/A and A/D hardware, transducers, and an adaptive simulation algorithm. An example implementation is given, and some future possibilities are outlined.
