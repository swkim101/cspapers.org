In this work, a cartesian impedance controller purposely designed for dexterous manipulation is described. Based on the main features of the DLR Hand II, concerning kinematic structure and sensory equipment of fingers, this control strategy allows to overcome the main problems encountered in fine manipulation, namely: effects of the friction (and unmodeled dynamics) on robot performances and occurrence of singularity conditions. The achieved control scheme bas been experimentally validated by testing it on a finger of the DLR Hand.
