Massively mesh-connected parallel machines are an efficient and scalable class of computer systems used to execute supercomputing applications. In such systems, a number of independent smaller tasks (from the same or different applications) come in, each requiring at run time a separate subsystem (or partition) to execute. There is a need for the operating system to dynamically partition the computer system to allocate resources to incoming tasks, as well as to deallocate resources (and recombine partitions) as soon as they become available when a task completes. A number of processor allocation and deallocation techniques have been proposed in the past, with various degrees of time complexity and system performance. In this paper, we present a new best-fit “quad-tree-based” subsystem allocation/deallocation technique, which has smaller time complexity than existing techniques, while yielding better system performance. We prove analytically that the time complexity of our approach is only O(Na) (where Na is the number of allocated tasks, N the system size, and Na< N) which is better than the best of the existing mesh-based strategies (such as the O(Na√N) of “Quick Allocation”, the O(Na) of “Busy List”, and the O(Nf) of “Free Sub-List”, where Nf is the number of free sub-systems and Nf < N). Our simulation studies show that our “quad-tree based” allocation/deallocation technique also results in a 33% improvement in system performance (in terms of system utilization and average task completion time).
