This paper explores some theoretical issues of robot system planning from the perspective of propositional dynamic logic. A generalized notion of "progression" and "regression" of conditions through actions is developed. This leads to a bidirectional single - level planning algorithm that Is easily extended to hierarchical planning. Multiple pre-/postcondition pairs, complex (e.g., conjunctive, disjunctive) goals, goals of maintenance and prevention, and plans with tests are all handled in a natural way. The logical framwork is used to clarify gaps in existing "nonlinear" and "hierachical" planning strategies.
