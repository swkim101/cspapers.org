Unsupervised Relation Identification is the task of automatically discovering interesting relations between entities in a large text corpora. Relations are identified by clustering the frequently co-occurring pairs of entities in such a way that pairs occurring in similar contexts end up belonging to the same clusters. In this paper we compare several clustering setups, some of them novel and others already tried. The setups include feature extraction and selection methods and clustering algorithms. In order to do the comparison, we develop a clustering evaluation metric, specifically adapted for the relation identification task. Our experiments demonstrate significant superiority of the single-linkage hierarchical clustering with the novel threshold selection technique over the other tested clustering algorithms. Also, the experiments indicate that for successful relation identification it is important to use rich complex features of two kinds: features that test both relation slots together ("relation features"), and features that test only one slot each ("entity features"). We have found that using both kinds of features with the best of the algorithms produces very high-precision results, significantly improving over the previous work.
