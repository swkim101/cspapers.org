Most existing works focused on low-level visual features composition for style representation. However, little effort has been devoted to automatic mid-level or high-level style features learning by reorganizing low-level descriptors. Moreover, styles are usually spread out and not easy to differentiate from one to another. In this paper, we call these less representative images as weak style images. To address these issues, we propose a consensus style centralizing auto-encoder (CSCAE) to extract robust style features to facilitate weak style classification. CSCAE is the ensemble of several style centralizing auto-encoders (SCAEs) with consensus constraint. Each SCAE centralizes each feature of certain category in a progressive way. We apply our method in fashion style classification and manga style classification as two example applications. In addition, we collect a new dataset, Online Shopping, for fashion style classification evaluation, which will be publicly available for vision based fashion style research. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SCAE and CSCAE on both public and newly collected datasets when compared with the most recent state-of-the-art works.
