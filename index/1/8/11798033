Bringing robots as collaborative partners into homes presents various challenges to human-robot interaction. Robots will need to interact with untrained users in environments that are originally designed for humans. Compared to their industrial homologous form, humanoid robots can not be preprogrammed with an initial set of behaviours. They should adapt their skills to a huge range of possible tasks without needing to change the environments and tools to fit their needs. The rise of these humanoids implies an inherent social dimension to this technology, where the end-users should be able to teach new skills to these robots in an intuitive manner, relying only on their experience in teaching new skills to other human partners. Our research aims at designing a generic Robot Programming by Demonstration (RPD) framework based on a probabilistic representation of the task constraints, which allows to integrate information from cross-situational statistics and from various social cues such as joint attention or vocal intonation. This paper presents our ongoing research towards bringing user- friendly human-robot teaching systems that would speed up the skill transfer process.
