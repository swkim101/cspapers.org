Database security has paramount importance in industrial, civilian and government domains. Despite its importance, our search reveals that only a small number of database security courses are being offered. In this paper, we share our experience in developing and offering an undergraduate elective course on database security with limited resources. We believe that database security should be considered in its entirety rather than being component specific. Therefore, we emphasize that students develop and implement a database security plan for a typical real world application. In addition to the key theoretical concepts, students obtain hands-on experience with two popular database systems. We encourage students to learn independently making use of the documentation and technical resources freely available on the Internet. This way, our hope is that they will be able to adapt to emerging systems and application scenarios.
