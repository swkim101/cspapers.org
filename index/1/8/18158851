In this paper we propose a full text search system based on optics. The storage and processing of the textual data are performed by an optical back-end system to an electronic computer. In this way we can take advantage of the speed and parallelism of digital optical processing. Using the proposed configuration we show how one might implement a set of text processing operations using lasers, spatial light modulators and photodetectors.
