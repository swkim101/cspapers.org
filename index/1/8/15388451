This paper extends the work of the BRACElet project [17] by assessing the program comprehension skills of intermediate level students. Student performance on a pathfinder algorithm simulation task is reviewed to assess the students' comprehension levels, as categorized according to the SOLO educational taxonomy. The paper describes the nature of student responses, and the variety of representations provided, illustrating the role of discovery in effective student learning.
