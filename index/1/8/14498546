The Graspables project is an exploration of how measuring the way people hold and manipulate objects can be used as a user interface. As computational ability continues to be implemented in more and more objects and devices, new interaction methods need to be developed. The Graspables System is embodied by a physical set of sensors combined with pattern recognition software that can determine how users hold a device. The Graspables System has been implemented in two prototypes, the Bar of Soap and the Ball of Soap. Applications developed for these prototypes demonstrate the effectiveness of grasp-recognition as an interface in multiple scenarios.
