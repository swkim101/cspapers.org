The problem of computing maximally-specific generalizations (MSCG's) of relational descriptions can be modelled as tree search. We describe several transformations and pruning methods for reducing the complexity of the problem. Based on this analysis, we have implemented a search program (X-search) for finding the MSCG's. Experiments compare the separate and combined effects of pruning methods on search efficiency. With effective pruning methods, full-width search appears feasible for moderately sized relational descriptions.
