In wireless sensor networks, various schemes have been proposed to efficiently store and process sensed data. Among them, the Data-Centric Storage (DCS) scheme is one of the most well-known. The DCS scheme distributes data regions and stores the data in the sensor that is responsible for the region. In this paper, we propose a new DCS based scheme, called Time-Parameterized Data-Centric Storage (TPDCS), that avoids the problems of storage hot-spots and query hotspots. To decentralize the skewed data and queries, the data regions are assigned by a time dimension as well as data dimensions in our proposed scheme. Therefore, TPDCS extends the lifetime of sensor networks. It is shown through various experiments that our scheme outperforms the existing schemes.
