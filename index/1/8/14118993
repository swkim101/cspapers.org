Trading systems are used widely in the financial industry. A trading system must implement the complex business process correctly, and provide good interoperability with clients and legacy systems in different organizations. In addition, it has to be highly scalable and reliable. How to develop a trading system that meets all these requirements with low cost is a challenging problem. In this paper we present our experience on building an XML-based framework for rapid development of such systems with guaranteed correctness, reliability, scalability, and good interoperability. We focus our discussion on the following aspects: (1) Business process modeling. (2) Data modeling. (3) Performance and interoperability.
