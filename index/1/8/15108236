Given a point set p, a chain is a subset C C p of points in which for any two points one is dominated by the other. A two-chain is a subset of p that can be partitioned into two chains. A two-chain with maximum cardinality among all possible two-chains is called a maximum two-chain. In this paper we present a O(nlog n) time and O(n) space algorithm for finding a maximum two-chain in a point set p, where n = IpI. Maximum two-chain finds applications in, for example, graph-theoretic problems; VLSI layout, and sequence manipulation.
