The various ways of interacting with social media, web collaboration tools, co-authorship and citation networks for scientific and research purposes remain distinct. In this paper, we propose a solution to align such information. We particularly developed an exploratory visualization of research networks. The result is a scholar centered, multi-perspective view of conferences and people based on their collaborations and online interactions. We measured the relevance and user acceptance of this type of interactive visualization. Preliminary results indicate a high precision both for recognized people and conferences. The majority in a group of test-users responded positively to a set of statements about the acceptance.
