A transshipment problem with demands that exceed network capacity can be solved by sending flow in several waves. How can this be done in the minimum number of waves? This is the question tackled in the zerotransit time, quickest transshipment problem. Hoppe and Tardos [12] describe the only known polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem. They actually solve the problem with general transit times. However, their algorithm repeatedly minimizes submodular functions using the ellipsoid method, and is therefore not at all practical. We present an algorithm that finds a quickest transshipment with a polynomial number of maximum flow computations, and a faster algorithm that also uses minimum cost flow computations, in the case when all arc transit times are zero. When there is only one sink, we show how the algorithm can be sped up to return a solution in the same asymptotic time as O(k) Goldberg-Tarjan maximum flow computations, where k is the number of sources. Hajek and Ogier [ll] describe an algorithm that finds a fractional solution to the single-sink quickest transshipment problem with zero transit times on a network with n nodes using O(n) maximum flow computations. They actually solve the universally quickest transshipment-a dynamic flow that minimizes the amount of supply left in the network at every moment of time. In this paper, we show how to solve this problem in O(mnlog(n2/m)) time, using the parametric maximum flow algorithm of Gallo, Grigoriadis, and Tarjan.
