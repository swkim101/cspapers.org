In this paper we provide a brief discussion of the relationship of tactile sensation to other sensory modalities currently showing prominence in industrial robots. A tactile sensor is presented which provides a matrix of the forces existing between it and the object with which it is in contact. The possible uses of this information in the control of the manipulation of objects by a robot arm/hand system are considered. Examples of the data retrieved from the sensor are given and possible initial processing steps are discussed.
