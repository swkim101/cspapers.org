Accreditation standards have been developed for BS programs in Information Systems and have been widely reviewed. The standards drew heavily on the existing computer science accreditation standard and recent curriculum efforts in information systems. The effort was facilitated by support from the National Science Foundation (NSFDUE 9812278). Recently CSAB approved the process to accredit IS programs and that accreditation will begin in Fall 2002.
