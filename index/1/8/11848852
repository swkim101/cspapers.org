The demand for computing professionals in the U.S. workforce is expected to increase over the next several years, while the number of students intending to major in computing has declined. In this BOF session, we focus on the use of service learning to address the growing concern of creating a sustainable pipeline for computing professionals, with an emphasis on broadening participation in computing. We center the discussion around our experiences with the STARS Computing Corps, which engages college students in service-learning to address the national computing talent shortage. The model has been shown to be effective in retaining college students in computing, and STARS alumni credit participation in STARS with helping to develop professional skills. This session will include interactive small group discussions on goals, obstacles, and strategies for applying service learning to broaden participation in computing, grow the K-12 pipeline, and prepare college students with skills demanded in the 21st century workforce.
