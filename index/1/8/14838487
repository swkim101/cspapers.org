Pinching is an important capability for mobile robots handling small items or tools. Successful pinching requires force-closure and, in underwater applications, gentle suction flow at the fingertips can dramatically improve the handling of light objects by counteracting the negative effects of water lubrication and enhancing friction. In addition, monitoring the flow gives a measure of suction-engagement and can act as a binary tactile sensor. Although a suction system adds complexity, elastic tubes can double as passive spring elements for desired finger kinematics.
