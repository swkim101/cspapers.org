This paper presents and analyses ten criteria that assess the quality of a set of three-finger grips suitable for dextrous manipulation on real 2D parts. The set of candidate hand configurations is the result of a previous process of grasp generation from the object image. The proposed criteria include six that depend on the actual finger configuration of the gripper. The kinematics of the Barrett hand has been used. The criteria are merged to give a global quality value that can be used to select the best grip to execute. Experimental results include tests on stability and the effect of parameter variation.
