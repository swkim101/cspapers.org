In recent years multiple simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms have been proposed, which address the challenges of 3D environments in combination with six degress of freedom in the robot position. Commonly, solutions based on scan-matching algorithms are applied. In contrast to these approaches, we propose to use a particle filter transferring the concept of the 2D Rao-Blackwellized particle filter SLAM to 3D. As filter input, 3D laser range data and odometry readings are obtained while the robot is in motion. The ground plane is estimated based on previously built map parts, thereby approaching the problem that not all degrees of freedom are covered by the odometry. To gain control of the high memory requirements for the particles' 3D map representations, we introduce a memory efficient search structure and adapt a technique to efficiently organize and share maps between particles. We evaluate our approach based on experimental results obtained by
