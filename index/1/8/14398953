In response to the national computer security crisis, colleges and universities have developed security tracks and specialized security courses. While security tracks are effective at producing security experts, they only reach a small subset of students and occur after students have established a foundation of coding techniques. Most undergraduate computing students learn programming and design with little regard to security issues.
 To complement our security track and reach all computing students at the beginning of their studies, we piloted security integration across sections of CS0 and CS1, using a series of security laboratory modules. Preliminary results show increased security knowledge in the security-targeted sections. This paper describes the details and results of this pilot, which serves as a model for further integration throughout the CS curriculum.
