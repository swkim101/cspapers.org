We present a new framework in which considerations of both register allocation and instruction scheduling can be applied uniformly and simultaneously. In this framework an optimal coloring of a graph, called the parallel interference graph, provides an optimal register allocation and preserves the property that no false dependences are introduced, thus all the options for parallelism are kept for the scheduler to handle. For this framework we provide heuristics for trading off parallel scheduling with register spilling.
