Potentially, the advantages of marker-passing over local connectionist techniques for associative inference are (1) the ability to differentiate variable bindings, and (2) reduction in the search space and/or number of processing elements. However, the latter advantage has mostly been realized at the expense of accuracy and predictability. In this paper we consider a class of associative inference to which marker passing is often applied, variously called abductive inference, schema selection, or pattern completion. Analysis of marker semantics in a standard semantic net representation leads to a proposal for more strictly regulated marker propagation. An implementation strategy employing an augmented relaxation network is outlined.
