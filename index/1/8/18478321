Developing, testing, debugging, and evaluating communication protocols for low-power wireless networks is a long and cumbersome task. Simulators can be helpful in the early stages of development, but their models of hardware components and the wireless channel are often rather simplistic and hence cannot substitute experiments on real sensor node platforms. The resources available on common platforms are however very limited, and so are the possibilities for non-intrusive debugging and testing. With most existing testbeds it is only possible to collect information from the serial port, which requires adding highly intrusive logging statements that alter the timing behavior of the software running on the nodes. This is particularly detrimental to the operation of time-critical components, such as radio drivers, media access control (MAC) protocols, and certain flooding protocols [2], hindering their testbed-assisted development.
