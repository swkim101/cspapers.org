Selective induction techniques perform poorly when the features are inappropriate for the target concept. One solution is to have the learning system construct new features automatically; unfortunately feature construction is a difficult and poorly understood problem. In this paper we present a definition of feature construction in concept learning, and offer a framework for its study based on four aspects: detection, selection, generalization, and evaluation. This framework is used in the analysis of existing learning systems and as the basis for the design of a new system, CITRE. CITRE performs feature construction using decision trees and simple domain knowledge as constructive biases. Initial results on a set of spatial-dependent problems suggest the importance of domain knowledge and feature generalization, i.e., constructive induction.
