The current Internet is not reliable; packet loss rates are frequently high, and varying over time. Transmitting high-quality interactive video over the Internet is challenging because the quality of compressed video is very susceptible to packet losses. Loss of packets belonging to a video frame manifests itself not only in the reduced quality of that frame but also in the propagation of that distortion to successive frames. This error propagation problem is inherent in many motion-based video codecs due to the interdependence of encoded video frames. This paper presents a dynamic loss recovery scheme, called RESCU, to address the error propagation problem. In this new scheme, picture coding patterns are dynamically adapted to current network conditions in order to maximize the effectiveness of hybrid transport level recovery (employing both forward error correction and retransmission) in reducing error propagation. Since RESCU does not introduce any playout delay at the receiver, it is suitable for interactive video communication. An experimental study based on actual Internet transmission traces representing various network conditions shows that dynamic hybrid RESCU exhibits better error resilience and incurs much less bit overhead than existing error recovery techniques such as NEWPRED and Intra-H.261.
