Software fault isolation (SFI) is an effective mechanism to confine untrusted modules inside isolated domains to protect their host applications. Since its debut, researchers have proposed different SFI systems for many purposes such as safe execution of untrusted native browser plugins. However, most of these systems focus on the x86 architecture. Inrecent years, ARM has become the dominant architecture for mobile devices and gains in popularity in data centers.Hence there is a compellingneed for an efficient SFI system for the ARM architecture. Unfortunately, existing systems either have prohibitively high performance overhead or place various limitations on the memory layout and instructions of untrusted modules. In this paper, we propose ARMlock, a hardware-based fault isolation for ARM. It uniquely leverages the memory domain support in ARM processors to create multiple sandboxes. Memory accesses by the untrusted module (including read, write, and execution) are strictly confined by the hardware,and instructions running inside the sandbox execute at the same speed as those outside it. ARMlock imposes virtually no structural constraints on untrusted modules. For example, they can use self-modifying code, receive exceptions, and make system calls. Moreover, system calls can be interposed by ARMlock to enforce the policies set by the host. We have implemented a prototype of ARMlock for Linux that supports the popular ARMv6 and ARMv7 sub-architecture. Our security assessment and performance measurement show that ARMlock is practical, effective, and efficient.
