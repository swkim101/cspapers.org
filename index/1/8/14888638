Reliability of component based robot software depends on the quality of each component because any defective components will have a ripple effect on systems built with them. Thus, testing of unit component, composite component and component based robot software is critical for checking the correctness of the software functionality. This paper proposes Web-based automated black-box testing framework for component based robot software. The proposed framework provides automated testing service, testing for different robot platform and distributed test environment, and sharing test resources. We have implemented the proposed framework and evaluated it on the component based front guidance application to output a guidance statement by sensing front obstacles, and control robot wheels by sensing a back user.
