Hybrid architectures have been used in several recent knowledge representation systems. This paper explores some distinctions between various hybrid representation architectures, focusing in particular on systems built around restricted representation languages. This restricted language architecture is illustrated by describing KL-TWO, a hybrid reasoner based on the restricted representation facility RUP. The bulk of this paper discusses KL-TWO, its subcomponents, and the techniques used to interface them.
