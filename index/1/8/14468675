This p~per gives a partitioning scheme for the geometric, planar traveling salesman problem, under the Euclidean metric: given a set S of n points in the Diane. find a shortest ;losed tour (path) v;siting all the “point’s. The scheme employs randomization, and gives a tour that can be expected to be short, if S satisfies the condition that a random subset R C S has o]: average a tour much shorter than an optimal tour of S. ‘~his condition holds for points independently, identiccdly distributed in the plane, for example, for which a tour within 1 -I-c of shortest can be found in expected time nk22k, whew k = O(log log n)3/e2. One algorithm employed in the scheme is of interest in its own right: when given a simple polygon P, it finds a Steiner triangulation of the interior of P. If P has n sides and perimeter LP, the edges of the triangulation have total length LP O(log n). If this algorithm is applied to a simple polygon induced by a minimum spanning tree of a point set, the result is a Steiner triangulation of the set with total length within a factor of O(log n) of the minimum possible.
