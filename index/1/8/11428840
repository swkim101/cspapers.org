This paper considers the interpretation (as a three-dimensional velocity field) of the changing intensity pattern induced by a smoothly deforming Lambertian surface of uniform albedo illuminated by a distant point light source. The requisite "Intensity Rate Constraint" which is derived contains no terms relating to the tangential components of surface velocity, so the determination of the velocity field is ill-posed, exhibiting a form of "Aperture Problem". A stretch-based regulariser is applied to enable estimation of the velocity field and tests with synthetic data show a requirement for high accuracy.
