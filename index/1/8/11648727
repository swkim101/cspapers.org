Bayesian EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) is cross-fertilized with Navier's equations solid deformation modeling to compute 3D non-rigid structure from monocular camera motion. The method operates with a projective camera and autonomously computes -for every sequence frame- both the geometry and the matches. The combination results in an sequential efficient method to code the rich available physical priors, particularly relevant for medical monocular endoscope sequences such as those observing the abdominal cavity.
