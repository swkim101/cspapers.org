: Our previous research focused on reducing continuous monitoring overhead by employing architectural design that performs adaptive monitoring. In this paper we explore the use of other AOP or AOP-like tools for instrumentation. The goal is to find a tool that has lower overhead than AspectJ. Support for runtime changes of monitoring configuration is also considered. Our main topic of interest is DiSL framework, because it has similar syntax as, already used AspectJ, but allows for more instrumentation options.
