The theory of average case completeness initiated by Leonid Levin and further developed by others [Levin 86, Venkatesan Levin 88, Gurevich 90, Impagliazzo Levin 90, BenDavid Chor Goldreich Luby 89, Blass Gurevich 91] proposes a robust notion of hard-onaverage problems. It considers NP problems with their instances generated under samplable (generatable in polynomial time) distributions. Such a complete problem can not have a fast on average algorithm unless every NP problem under every samplable distribution has one. Showing the hardness of “typical” or “random” inst antes proves difficult since the reductions must preserve the average case complexity, and hence, the distributions. Consequently, they can not use special structures as in usual NP completeness proofs. We believe that the development
