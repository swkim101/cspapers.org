Radio frequency identification (RFID) applications increasingly widely in recent years. RFID System has been widely implemented in various fields. Such as baggage monitoring, warehousing management, transportation monitoring, protection control, library management and medical management. However, in a highly intensive RFID tags environment, it needs to use large number of tag reader access. It easily caused redundant reader's problem and waste construct cost. Many studies were not put forward a strategy to resolve the above problem, such RRE, LEO algorithm. This paper presents a hybrid algorithm to check reading the number of devices as a basis for discrimination, first of all, the whole environment to calculate the number of RFID tags, and then determine which RFID readers is redundant.
