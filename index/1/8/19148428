Compared to the single image based person re-id methods, video-based personre-id has attracted widespread attentions because extra space-time information and more appearance cues that can beused to greatly improve the matching performance. However, most existing video-based person re-id methods equally treatall video frames, ignoring their quality discrepancy caused by object occlusion and motions, which is a common phenomenonin real surveillance scenario. Based on this finding, we propose a novel video-based person re-id method via self paced weighting (SPW). Firstly, we propose a self paced outlier detection method to evaluate the noise degree of video sub sequences. Thereafter, a weighted multi-pair distance metric learning approach is adopted to measure the distance of two person image sequences. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over current state-of-the-art work.
