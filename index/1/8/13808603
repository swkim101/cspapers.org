For an effective intelligent active mobility assistance robot, the walking pattern of a patient or an elderly person has to be analyzed precisely. A well-known fact is that the walking patterns are gaits, that is, cyclic patterns with several consecutive phases. These cyclic motions can be modeled using the consecutive gait phases. In this paper, we present a completely non-invasive framework for analyzing a normal human walking gait pattern. Our framework utilizes a laser range finder sensor to collect the data, a combination of filters to preprocess these data, and an appropriately synthesized Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for state estimation, and recognition of the gait data. We demonstrate the applicability of this setup using real data, collected from an ensemble of different persons. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed human data analysis scheme has the potential to provide the necessary methodological (modeling, inference, and learning) framework for a cognitive behavior-based robot control system. More specifically, the proposed framework has the potential to be used for the recognition of abnormal gait patterns and the subsequent classification of specific walking pathologies, which is needed for the development of a context-aware robot mobility assistant.
