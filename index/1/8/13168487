We contribute a novel approach to understand, dialogue, plan, and execute complex sentences to command a mobile service robot. We define a complex command as a natural language sentence consisting of sensing-based conditionals, conjunctions, and disjunctions. We introduce a flexible templatebased algorithm to extract such structure from the parse tree of the sentence. As the complexity of the command increases, extracting the right structure using the template-based algorithm decreases becomes more problematic. We introduce two different dialogue approaches that enable the user to confirm or correct the extracted command structure. We present how the structure used to represent complex commands can be directly used for planning and execution by the service robot. We show results on a corpus of 100 complex commands.
