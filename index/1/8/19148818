Current computational approaches to identifying emotional messages, i.e., messages that contain emotional support, are typically based on a set of handcrafted features. In this paper, we show that high-level and abstract features derived from a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks can be successfully employed for emotional message identification and can obviate the need for handcrafted features.
