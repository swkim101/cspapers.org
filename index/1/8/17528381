As robots become more sophisticated and pervasive, theywill be forced to operate in more dynamic and social envi-ronments. In order to develop a theory of mind to accountfor the intents, beliefs, and motivations of other individuals,a robot needs to be able to distinguish between another en-tity and itself. One proposed method of learning the differ-ence between self and other is to use contingency, the timedependence of perception and action.Watson (1994) suggested contingency as a method usedby infants when learning to detect self. He outlined fourgeneral methods for detecting contingency: contiguity, tem-poral correlation, conditional probability, and causal impli-cation.Forourexperiment,wechosetoimplementWatsonâ€™s
