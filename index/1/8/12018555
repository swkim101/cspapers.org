Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP) is a field that has recently been getting more and more attention from academia and industry. However, very few open-source, off-the-shelf tools are currently available to solve DCOPs; examples are FRODO, DisChoco and DCOPolis. A DCOP platform should possess the following key qualities: the framework should be reliable and extensively tested, deployable in a truly distributed setting, and modular so that it is easy to customize and extend. This paper introduces the Java-based FRODO 2.0 framework, which possesses all three qualities. It is a complete re-design of the FRODO framework, released under the GNU Affero GPL license.
