Simultaneous motion control of multiple joints has many potential applications such as Tai Chi, Yoga etc. The capability of vibrotactile cues to assist this kind of motor task has not been well explored. In this paper, we studied the effect of vibrotactile cues for guiding procedural motion of two joints on human's upper limbs. By mounting eight vibrotactile motors on two arms, we performed two experiments to measure human's perception and motor performance in response to the vibrotactile commands. In the first experiment, we measured perceptual performance of correctly identifying the location of two active vibrotactile cues. The difference between sustained, pulsed and hybrid vibration conditions was compared. To explore the possible reasons leading to the wrong perception results, the correct rate was ranked among different combinations of cues. In the second experiment, the correct rate of procedural motion control of two joints was measured, while vibrotactile cues were used as guidance signals to produce the motion command. The results showed that average correct rate of two cues localization on upper limbs was as high as 98%, while the average correct rate of procedural motion control of two joints was only 86%. Further analysis revealed that low correct rate of procedural motion control was caused by the unnatural motion pattern, i.e. two joints on a same arm and rotate in opposite directions.
