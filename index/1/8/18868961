Automotive software has been growing in size, criticality and complexity with each new generation of vehicles. Testing at the model and code level is an important step in validating the software against various types of defects that may be introduced in the development process. Model based testing (MBT) methodology, paves a road towards automation of testing activities. Test generation is a computationally complex task, which requires efficient constraint solving techniques and some guidance from the test engineer when this task cannot be solved by a tool. At the same time, automatic tools can hardly substitute domain testing experts which can develop more effective tests or at least test fragments than any tool. This is why we believe that future test generation tools should support “tester-in-the-loop” MBT approaches. In this paper, we provide a brief report on our results in this direction.
