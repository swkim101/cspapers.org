Unlike lab environments, the existing environment is not built for smart applications, but rather should be "upgraded" to support new technologies. The result of this process is called the "accidentally smart home". We developed Clipoid, an augmentable wireless technology toolkit for supporting the development of an "accidentally smart home" environment. We observed the real user context (static, moving) with Clipoid. We present a guideline for developing an augmentation toolkit, and identify human needs of close proximity physical interaction and multiple users-public platforms.
