Grid applications have been prone to encountering problems such as failures or malicious attacks during execution, due to their distributed and large-scale features. The application itself, however, has limited power to address these problems. This paper presents the design, and implementation of an adaptive framework - Dynasa, which strives to handle security problems using adaptive fault-tolerance (i.e., checkpointing and replication) during the execution of applications according to the status of the grid environments.
