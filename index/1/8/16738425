In this paper, the coordination and trajectory tracking control design of multiple mini rotorcraft systems are discussed. The dynamic model of a mini rotorcraft is presented using the Newton-Euler formalism. Our approach is based on a leader/follower structure of multiple robot systems. The centroid of the coordinated control subsystem is used for trajectory tracking purposes. A nonlinear coordinated control design for multiple autonomous vehicle synchronization is developed. The analytic results are supported by simulation tests.
