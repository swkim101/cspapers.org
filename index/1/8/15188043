This work presents the novel concept of Tele-Impedance as a method for controlling/teleoperating a robotic arm while performing tasks which require significant dynamics variation. As an alternative method to bilateral force-reflecting teleoperation control approach, which uses a position/velocity command combined with force feedback from the robot side, Tele-Impedance enriches the command sent to the slave robot by combining the position reference with a stiffness (or full impedance) reference estimated from the arm of the human operator. We propose a new method to estimate the stiffness of the human arm based on the agonist-antagonist muscular co activations. The concept of the Tele-Impedance is demonstrated using the KUKA light weight robotic arm as the slave manipulator in a ball reception experiment. The performance of Tele-Impedance control method is assessed by comparing the results obtained while receiving the ball, with the slave arm under i) constant low stiffness, ii) constant high stiffness or iii) under Tele-Impedance control. Performance indexes are defined and used for the comparative study of the ball reception performances under the different endpoint elastic profiles. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the task-related Tele-Impedance control method and highlight its potential use to execute tasks which require significant dynamics variation.
