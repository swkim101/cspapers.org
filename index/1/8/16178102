We designed and implemented TAGME, a system that is able to efficiently and judiciously augment a plain-text with pertinent hyperlinks to Wikipedia pages. The specialty of TAGME with respect to known systems [5,8] is that it may annotate texts which are short and poorly composed, such as snippets of search-engine results, tweets, news, etc.. This annotation is extremely informative, so any task that is currently addressed using the bag-of-words paradigm could benefit from using this annotation to draw upon (the millions of) Wikipedia pages and their inter-relations.
