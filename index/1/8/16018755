This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from the community interested in predictable assembly from certifiable components. The goal of this workshop is to ensure continued collaboration among the members of this community. One output of the workshop will be an understanding of composition theory and how it applies to community model problems that were suggested at the workshop on component-based software engineering held at ICSE in 2001. A second output will be the identification of research opportunities that lie on the perimeter of predictable assembly.
