Software systems development demands sound methodologies, models, principles and appropriate tools. The MOMPES workshops focus on the theoretical and practical aspects related to the adoption of Model-based Development (MBD) methodologies for supporting the construction of software for pervasive and embedded systems. This International Workshop on Model-based Methodologies for Pervasive and Embedded Software (MOMPES 2010) is the 7th edition of this workshop series. Over the years, the workshops have always contained a mix of industry and academic research papers, fostering productive collaboration amongst the two communities. 
 
Since its first edition in 2004, the workshop has been co-located with prestigious international scientific conferences: ACSD 2004, ACSD 2005, ECBS 2006, ETAPS 2007, ETAPS 2008 and ICSE 2009. In 2010, MOMPES is co-located with the 25th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2010), one of the leading conferences on Software Engineering. 
 
This book compiles the proceedings of the workshop held on 20 September 2010 in Antwerp, Belgium in conjunction with ASE 2010. Out of 14 submissions, 9 were selected for inclusion in the proceedings and presentation at the workshop. Each submission was reviewed by at least three program committee members. 
 
The papers cover a large spectrum of topics including such model-driven engineering, model-based testing, variability modeling, modeling of avionic systems, design space exploration, domain-specific modeling, application of model transformations, specification of test oracles, wireless sensor networks, and Simulink-based analysis of systems.
