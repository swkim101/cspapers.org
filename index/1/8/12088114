Whenever attentiveness for direct human computer interaction is unavailable, i.e., when a person must not be distracted from performing a task or is handicapped through wearable limitations (e.g., by protective clothing), mobile location-based systems offer implicit, hands-free interaction mechanisms enabling users to trigger actions by the physical presence of an (authorized) traceable mobile device at a predefined location. This paper utilizes the basic idea of this well-proven interaction principle, presents its successful industrial application at Austria's largest car logistics company (HÃ¶dlmayr International) and demonstrates its potential savings for the logistics domain in the course of a perennial observation of production figures.
