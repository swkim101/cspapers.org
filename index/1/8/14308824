Speaker change detection (SCD) is an important task in dialog modeling. Our paper addresses the problem of text-based SCD, which differs from existing audio-based studies and is useful in various scenarios, for example, processing dialog transcripts where speaker identities are missing (e.g., OpenSubtitle), and enhancing audio SCD with textual information. We formulate text-based SCD as a matching problem of utterances before and after a certain decision point; we propose a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN) with static sentence-level attention. Experimental results show that neural networks consistently achieve better performance than feature-based approaches, and that our attention-based model significantly outperforms non-attention neural networks.
