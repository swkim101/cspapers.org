Russian Doll Search (RDS) is a well-known algorithm for combinatorial optimization. In this paper we extend it from mono-objective to multi-objective optimization. We demonstrate its practical applicability in the challenging multiple-orbit SPOT5 instances. Besides being much more efficient than any other alternatives, multi-objective RDS can solve an instance which could not have been solved previously.
