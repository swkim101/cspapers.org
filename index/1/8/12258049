Risk management of product failure is perceived as a key strategic challenge by an increasing number of software-intensive product builders, and is especially difficult in the context of hardware/software co-design. This paper argues that traditional plan-driven, workshop based risk management approaches suffer from a number of limitations when applied to this context. Mu—èphy, a novel approach for risk management in hardware/software co-design is presented. This approach exploits Web 2.0 social technologies for continuous risk monitoring and harvesting collective risk intelligence.
