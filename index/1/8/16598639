Harmonic and intermodulation distortion effects play an important role in numerous analog applications, particularly in such areas as wireless communication systems. In this paper, we present a two-dimensional harmonic balance semiconductor device simulator which accurately models these nonlinear effects at the physical (drift-diffusion) level. The simulator is based on Stanford University's PISCES code, and supports the full range of physical models and features present in the time-domain version of the program. A modified block Gauss-Seidel-Newton nonlinear relaxation scheme is developed to efficiently handle the extremely large size of two-dimensional harmonic balance semiconductor device simulation problems.
