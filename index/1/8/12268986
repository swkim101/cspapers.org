A neurophysiologically-based model is presented that controls a simulated kinematic arm during goal-directed reaches. The network generates a quasi-feedforward motor command that is learned using training signals generated by corrective movements. For each target, the network selects and sets the output of a subset of pattern generators. During the movement, feedback from proprioceptors turns off the pattern generators. The task facing individual pattern generators is to recognize when the arm reaches the target and to turn off. A distributed representation of the motor command that resembles population vectors seen in vivo was produced naturally by these simulations.
