To test whether the known connectivies of neurons in the lamprey spinal cord are sufficient to account for locomotor rhythmogenesis, a "connectionist" neural network simulation was done using identical cells connected according to experimentally established patterns. It was demonstrated that the network oscillates in a stable manner with the same phase relationships among the neurons as observed in the lamprey. The model was then used to explore coupling between identical oscillators. It was concluded that the neurons can have a dual role as rhythm generators and as coordinators between oscillators to produce the phase relations observed among segmental oscillators during swimming.
