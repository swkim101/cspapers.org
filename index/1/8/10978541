A review of the literature dealing with automatic test generation yields a wide variety of subject matter applications. Most decriptives, however, deal with college level projects. This paper out lines secondary school requirements that may encourage the development of appropriate test generation models. Our discussion will center on a common need for remediation at the secondary level, namely, mathematics skill building (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). The subject matter selection is only to assure that the suggestions made are as concrete as possible. The paper will concentrate on the structural and procedural aspects of school site test generation and will not deal with the computer programming requirements.
 The basic model assumes remedial curriculum that will be directed as a student population of 500 students. This supposes that the entire student population is not utilizing a single test generation package. The recommendations allow for adding additional curriculum services and increasing student use. A test generating laboratory should emerge that would operate as a service bureau. This center will be detailed below.
 The discussion will be organized under the following headings:
