Graphs are widely used to represent many differentkinds of real world data such as social networks, protein-proteininteractions, and road networks. In many cases, each node in agraph is associated with a set of its attributes and it is criticalto not only consider the link structure of a graph but also usethe attribute information to achieve more meaningful results invarious graph mining tasks. Most previous works dealing withattributed graphs take into account attribute relationships onlybetween individually connected nodes. However, it should begreatly valuable to find out which sets of attributes are associatedwith each other and whether or not they are statistically signifi-cant over an entire graph. Mining such significant associations, we can uncover novel relationships among the sets of attributes inthe graph. We propose an algorithm that can find those attributeassociations efficiently and effectively, and show experimentalresults that confirm the high efficacy of the proposed algorithm.
