A study of file replication policies for distributed data bases will be approached through the analysis of an M/M/m queue subjected to state-independent, preemptive interruptions of service. The durations of periods of interruption constitute a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables. Independently, the times measured from the termination of one period of interruption to the beginning of the next form a sequence of independent, exponentially distributed random variables. Preempted customers resume service at the terminations of interrupt periods.
