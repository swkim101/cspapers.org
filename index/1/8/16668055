Slot ﬁlling aims to extract the values ( slot ﬁllers ) of speciﬁc attributes ( slots types ) for a given entity ( query ) from a large-scale corpus. Slot ﬁlling remains very challenging over the past seven years. We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised approach to extract slot ﬁllers based on the following two observations: (1) a trigger is usually a salient node relative to the query and ﬁller nodes in the dependency graph of a context sentence; (2) a relation is likely to exist if the query and candidate ﬁller nodes are strongly connected by a relation-speciﬁc trigger. Thus we design a graph-based algorithm to automatically identify triggers based on personalized PageRank and Afﬁnity Propagation for a given ( query , ﬁller ) pair and then label the slot type based on the identiﬁed triggers. Our approach achieves 11.6%-25% higher F-score over state-of-the-art English slot ﬁlling methods. Our experiments also demonstrate that as long as a few trigger seeds, name tagging and dependency parsing capabilities exist, this approach can be quickly adapted to any language and new slot types. Our promising results on Chinese slot ﬁlling can serve as a new benchmark.
