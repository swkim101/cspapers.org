This paper describes an analysis of telegraphic fragments as regular structures (not errors) handled by minimal extensions to a system designed for processing the standard language. The modular approach which has been implemented in the Unisys natural language processing system PUNDIT is based on a division of labor in which syntax regulates the occurrence and distribution of elided elements, and semantics and pragmatics use the system's standard mechanisms to interpret them.
