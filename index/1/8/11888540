In run-time evolving systems, components may evolve while the system is being operated. Unsafe run-time changes may compromise the correct execution of the entire system. Traditional design-time verification techniques difficultly cope with run-time changes, and run-time monitoring may detect disfunctions only too late, when the failure arises. The desire would be to define advanced monitors with the ability to predict and prevent the potential errors happening in the future. In this direction, this paper proposes CASSANDRA, a new approach that by combining design-time and run-time analysis techniques, can “look ahead” in the near execution future, and predict potential failures. During run-time we on-the-fly construct a model of the future k-step global state space according to design-time specifications and the current execution state. Consequently, we can run-time check whether possible failures might happen in the future.
