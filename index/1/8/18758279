The complexity of the issue tracking systems (ITS) which meet the requirements of the Infrastructure Technology Information Library (ITIL) encumbers their selection. In addition, we have to consider some other variables, such as the wide range of tools, their functionality level and their costs. Regarding the cost of the ITS, nowadays the use of ITS based on Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) is an increasing trend. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to present a model to evaluate the quality characteristics of the FLOSS-ITS according to ITIL recommendations. This quality model is aimed at selecting the best of the available tools. The set of characteristics evaluated is presented based on the product perspective of the Software Quality Systemic Model (MOSCA). This perspective is inspired on the ISO/IEC 9126 standard and Dromey's quality model. Also it was applied to a case study -a venezuelan company-, which is willing to exploit and extend the capabilities of this type of tools to its customers. The case study allowed us to establish the FLOSS-ITS's quality requirements: functionality, reliability and usability. Lastly, validation of the model through its application to three FLOSS-ITS tools is presented.
