This paper describes a probabilistic model for coordination disambiguation integrated into syntactic and case structure analysis. Our model probabilistically assesses the parallelism of a candidate coordinate structure using syntactic/semantic similarities and cooccurrence statistics. We integrate these probabilities into the framework of fully-lexicalized parsing based on largescale case frames. This approach simultaneously addresses two tasks of coordination disambiguation: the detection of coordinate conjunctions and the scope disambiguation of coordinate structures. Experimental results on web sentences indicate the effectiveness of our approach.
