However, this cannot be said about online discussions and comments. In such postings, the discussions can get highly emotional and heated with many emotional statements, and even personal attacks. As a result, many of the postings and sentences do not express positive or negative opinions about the topic being discussed. To find peopleâ€™s opinions on a topic and its different aspects, which we call evaluative opinions, those irrelevant sentences should be removed. The goal of this research is thus to identify evaluative opinion sentences. A novel unsupervised approach is proposed to solve the problem, and our experimental results show that it performs well.
