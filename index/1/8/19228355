We present a series of programming exercises based on photographic images of Mars collected by the NASA Viking Orbiter. Even without the news that there may once have been life on Mars [1], we feel that these exercises provide an exciting platform for exploring machine representation of data, presentation of data, and methods of storing and extracting data from files. All exercises are on the level easily mastered in the first programming course.
