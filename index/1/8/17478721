EXEL is a family of programming languages, which has been designed in the framework of a research on computer architecture : the EOELWEISS system [VAS-BLA]. The development of EXEL is such as to place it in the framework of structured programming. The noti.one of label and “GOTO” have disappeared and are replaced by those of program schemata equations. This gives rise to important mathematical properties which are useful in organizing the system. Furthermore, this fact may bring profound implications in the theory of programming CARS] ; in particular, we foreeee powerful methods proving the correctness of programs.
