A rotatable line storage spool is mounted transverse to the direction of line payout. A disengageable spool gear is associated with the spool, and a drive gear meshes with the spool gear. A drive mechanism and associated star drag mechanism includes an adjustable friction coupling between the crank drive shaft and the drive gear, the friction coupling being manually variable or adjustable by rotation of a star wheel. The drag mechanism includes an extension assembly, which functions as a spacer in the drag adjusting mechanism, and which is extended or contracted independently of the manual drag adjustment to provide a further drag control. The extension or contraction of this extension assembly is controlled by a follower arm bearing either against the spooled line or the line merging with the spool to detect the reeling radius, and coupled to the extension assembly. The applied drag torque is decreased in response to reduction of the reeling radius, and is increased in response to an increase in the reeling radius.
