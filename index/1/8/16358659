Multiprocessor Xiaodong Zhang Division of Mathematics and Computer Science University of Texas at San Antonio San Antonio, Texas 78249 Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architectures make it possible to build large-scale shared memory multiprocesSOr systems in comparison with the non-scalable Uniform Memory Access (UMA) architectures. Most NUMA multiprocessor operations such as scheduling and synchronizing processes, accessing data from processors to memory models and allocating distributed memory space to different processors, are performed through interconnection networks such as a multistage switching network. The efficiency of these basic operations determines the parallel processing performance on a N UMA multiprocessor. This paper presents several analytical models to predict and evaluate dynamic and static load scheduling performance on a NUMA shared memory multiprocessor. Performance measurements to support the models and analyses through several numerical examples have been done on the BBN GP1OOO, a NUMA shared memory multiprocessor. Both analytical and experimental results give a comprehensive and clear understanding of the various effects, which are important for the effective use of a NUMA shared memory multiprocessor. The results in this paper may be used to determine optimal strategies in developing an efficient programming environment for a NUMA system.
