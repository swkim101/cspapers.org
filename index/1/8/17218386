A fully "sensitive skin" can be thought of as the ultimate goal for the application of somatic sensors. This paper describes further work in the creation of a "somatic alphabet" for humanoid robotics. Populations of individual force sensing resistors are combined into receptive fields. This paper details the algorithms used to infer direction of motion of the centroid of a stimulus as well as orientation.
