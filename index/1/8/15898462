One of the major problems of list processing programs is that of garbage collection. This paper presents a new practical parallel garbage collection algorithm and its improvements, and proposes a special processor for parallel garbage collection.
 For the parallel garbage collection system, an urgent requirement is to reduce the the garbage collector cycle time that is defined as the total execution time for the marking and reclaiming phase. The effect of improvements discussed here reduces the garbage collector cycle time to one half of that for the original algorithm.
 The performance of the processor tailored for parallel garbage collection is six times faster than that of an ordinary processor, while it requires a little bit larger amount of hardware than a typical channel controller. This processor satisfies the effectiveness condition for parallelism, even if the list process node consumption rate is high, e.g. when a compiled program is executed.
