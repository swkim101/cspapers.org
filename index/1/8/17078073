We consider noisy Euclidean traveling salesman problems in the plane, which are random combinatorial problems with underlying structure. Gibbs sampling is used to compute average trajectories, which estimate the underlying structure common to all instances. This procedure requires identifying the exact relationship between permutations and tours. In a learning setting, the average trajectory is used as a model to construct solutions to new instances sampled from the same source. Experimental results show that the average trajectory can in fact estimate the underlying structure and that overfitting effects occur if the trajectory adapts too closely to a single instance.
