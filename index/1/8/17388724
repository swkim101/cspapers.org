Computer Science educators continually strive to provide fertile environments for fostering success in introductory programming courses. Recent research indicates that one feature clearly dktinguishing the novice from the expert programmer is the ability to plan. Furthermore, it appears that the planning process can be facilitated through decomposition or modularization. The study described here sought to determine if the modularization skills of novice programmers could be improved by an instructional treatment that emphasizes practice in buildlng programs from previously existing modules. If improvement did occur, the study asked if it varied according to student ability or problem difficulty. The subjects for this study were thirty-eight students selected from a beginning Pascal programming course at a private suburban college. None of the students chosen had more than a year of high school BASIC or a semester of college level programming and they were thereby classified as novice programmers. Administrative conditions precluded the use of a control group. The methodology used was pretest, treatment, posttest. Statistical tests compared pretest and posttest results to e .â€™aluate the effectiveness of the treatment.
