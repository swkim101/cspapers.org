Safety of road travel can be increased if vehicles can be made to form groups for mutual interaction with each other. With the number of sensors available on vehicles increasing, a need has arisen to make collaborative use of the information collected by individual vehicles to form an enhanced dataset to improve the inter-vehicular safety features. This paper presents a novel approach to increase the safety of road travel using the concept of wireless sensor networks. We discuss how a group of vehicles can form a mobile ad hoc network and exchange data sensed by the on-board sensors. The fusion of these data could give a better understanding of the surrounding traffic conditions. As the simulation results show, this would definitely increase the traveling safety on the road.
