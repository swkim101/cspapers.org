This paper addresses the problem of mz-transportability, that is, transferring causal knowledge collected in several heterogeneous domains to a target domain in which only passive observations and limited experimental data can be collected. The paper first establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding the feasibility of mz-transportability, i.e., whether causal effects in the target domain are estimable from the information available. It further proves that a previously established algorithm for computing transport formula is in fact complete, that is, failure of the algorithm implies non-existence of a transport formula. Finally, the paper shows that the do-calculus is complete for the mz-transportability class.
