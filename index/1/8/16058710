Continuous integration (CI) is a hot topic in software development today. CI is a critical enabler for Agile methods and higher software development velocity and productivity. However, adopting the practice of Continuous Integration can be difficult, especially when developing software for embedded systems. Practices such as Agile and Continuous Integration are designed to enable engineers to constantly improve and update their products. However, these processes can break down without access to the target system, a way to collaborate with other teams and team members, and the ability to automate tests. This paper outlines how simulation can enable teams to more effectively manage their integration and test practice, using virtual platforms as a key part of the test setup and simulation as a key part of the test strategy.
