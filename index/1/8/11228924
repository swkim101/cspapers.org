For generations, the academic community has relied on peer review as a way of encouraging scholarship and enhancing the knowledge base. Peer review has been widely used in the classroom since at least the 1970s, with hundreds of papers on its use in diverse academic fields appearing in the literature (for a comprehensive survey, see [1]). Its use appears to be on the upswing, given the current interest in active learning and teamwork. In computer science, peer review seems to have very broad application. It can be used to evaluate the contributions of various members to a project team; it can be used for design documents and code reviews, in writing assignments, and in capstone project courses. The experience of the panelists is illustrative of the wide range of peer-review practices. This panel will serve to introduce the audience to some of these applications. Since many computer-science instructors have experimented with peer review, we are anxious to have them share their experiences during the open discussion period.
