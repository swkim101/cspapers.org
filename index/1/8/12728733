We introduce a novel frequent pattern mining approach to discover leaders and tribes in social networks. In particular, we consider social networks where users perform actions. Actions may be as simple as tagging resources (urls) as in del.icio.us, rating songs as in Yahoo! Music, or movies as in Yahoo! Movies, or users buying gadgets such as cameras, handhelds, etc. and blogging a review on the gadgets. The assumption is that actions performed by a user can be seen by their network friends. Users seeing their friends' actions are sometimes tempted to perform those actions. We are interested in the problem of studying the propagation of such "influence", and on this basis, identifying which users are leaders when it comes to setting the trend for performing various actions. We consider alternative definitions of leaders based on frequent patterns and develop algorithms for their efficient discovery. Our definitions are based on observing the way influence propagates in a time window, as the window is moved in time. Given a social graph and a table of user actions, our algorithms can discover leaders of various flavors by making one pass over the actions table. We run detailed experiments to evaluate the utility and scalability of our algorithms on real-life data. The results of our experiments confirm on the one hand, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and on the other hand, the effectiveness and relevance of the overall framework. To the best of our knowledge, this the first frequent pattern based approach to social network mining.
