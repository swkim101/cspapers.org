In this paper, an approach to the problem of exploiting parallelism within nested loops is proposed. The proposed method first finds out all the initially independent computations, and then, based on them, identifies the valid partitioning bases to partition the entire iteration space of the loop nest. Because the shape of the iteration space is taken into account, pseudo-dependence relations are eliminated and hence more parallelism is exploited. Our approach provides a systematic method to maximize the degree of fine- or coarse-grain parallelism and is free from the open question of how to combine different loop transformations for the goal of maximizing parallelism. It is also shown that our approach can exploit more parallelism than other related work and have many advantages over them.
