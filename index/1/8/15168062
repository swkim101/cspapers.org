Pattern discovery in sequences is an important problem in many applications, especially in computational biology and text mining. However, due to the noisy nature of data, the traditional sequential pattern model may fail to reflect the underlying characteristics of sequence data in these applications. There are two challenges: First, the mutation noise exists in the data, and therefore symbols may be misrepresented by other symbols; Secondly, the order of symbols in sequences could be permutated. To address the above problems, in this paper we propose a new sequential pattern model called mutable permutation patterns. Since the Apriori property does not hold for our permutation pattern model, a novel Permu-pattern algorithm is devised to mine frequent mutable permutation patterns from sequence databases. A reachability property is identified to prune the candidate set. Last but not least, we apply the permutation pattern model to a real genome dataset to discover gene clusters, which shows the effectiveness of the model. A large amount of synthetic data is also utilized to demonstrate the efficiency of the Permu-pattern algorithm.
