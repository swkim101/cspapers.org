Computation of approximate polynomial gcds exemplifies numerical approach to algebraic computing and is important both theoretically and due to applications, in particular to network theory and linear control systems. We study two methods unexplored so far, in spite of intensive recent work in this area. Correlation to numerical Pride approximation enables us to improve computations for both problems (gcds and Pade). Reduction to approximating polynomial zeros enables us to obtain a new insight into the gcd problem and to devise effective solution algorithms. Unlike the known algorithms, we bound the degree of approximate gcds at a low computational cost and certify the correctness of the solution for a large class of inputs. We also restate the problem in terms of the perturbation of te zeros (rather than coefficients) of the input polynomials, which always leads us to certified solution via the computation of maximum matchings or connected components in the associated bipartite
