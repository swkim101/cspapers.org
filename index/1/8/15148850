Meetings are considered to be indispensable for decision making of groups, and thus efficiency is required for meetings. However, it is difficult to discuss the efficiency of meeting in a quantitative way. Based on this background, we define metrics to quantify the meeting activity and we implement a system to evaluate the metrics called KAIHUI. A smartphone is used as a KAIHUI client to record meeting audio. Then a KAIHUI server analyzes and calculates activeness according to the proposed metrics. In this demonstration, we show the basic operations of KAIHUI using a smartphone.
