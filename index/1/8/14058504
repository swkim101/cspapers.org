Since 1982 Valparaiso University has developed and used a Virtual Disk Access Method (vDAM) software system as an integral part of teaching a second year undergraduate course in File Structures and Algorithms. This software allows a student to emulate the management of a variety of fde organizations on a bulk storage device. VDAM is dynamic in that it can display what has occurred on a disk device or in the management of open channels at any stage of accessing a pretend, or virtu~ disk. These displays allow students to study many things which are not readily available in the usual programming environment. Students have been enthusiastic about using VDAM and have contributed revisions of the system to include new features and improve the user interface. Our experience indicates that this tool has enjoyed great success in the File Structures and Algorithms course by stimulating student interest and understanding.
