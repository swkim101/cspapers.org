In this paper, we reference the idea of work[1] to investigate more complicated system where EDFA amplifier and Coherent receiver are used to enhance signal quality. Calculating model of RoF transport system using direct modulation technique at transmitter, EDFA and Coherent receiver is proposed. We calculate and determine BER and SNR of the NRZ system using many kinds of different silica-doped materials of optic fiber. We then build algorithm chart to find out system essential parameters such as EDFA's Gain, EDFA's position for enhancing SNR and reducing BER at the end of system corresponding to different lengths (from 100 km to 180 km). Next, we write and make MatLab-based program run to draw graphs that show system performance such as BER, SNR versus fiber link length with different silica-doped materials. The results could be used effectively in calculating, designing and operating the RoF systems.
