Software inspections, although they have proved cost-effective, are still practised infrequently or not at all. Their value may be understated and the effort required for arranging inspection meetings is too often considered to be a waste of time. One approach to removing the resistance that inspections frequently meet with is organizing them on a network and automating the most laborious tasks in the process by means of a collaborative software package or software especially intended for reviewing or inspecting documentation. We suggest that the inspection process should be adjusted to allow for increased flexibility and smooth computer support. Furthermore, we are of the opinion that the World Wide Web provides a natural and effortless framework for an inspection tool. Our experiments with web-based inspection tools have pointed to some important challenges that inspection software must face. The tools that we introduce are capable of handling any software documentation presented in HTML. They endeavour to follow the metaphor of seeking defects in paper documents for maximal ease of use, but their most important features are automated material distribution, and instruments for participants to perform the inspection anywhere and at any time.
