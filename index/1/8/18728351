This paper investigates how to design a robot that uses sonar. Governing equations describing the evolution of geometric measurements are derived as a function of 6-DOF robot dynamics. A non-dimensional analysis of the governing equations is presented, to determine which terms are relevant to specific robots. The contributions of waves and currents are considered. The equations are then expanded to evaluate the effect of transducer location on the robot. Finally, the computational complexity of detecting and tracking arbitrarily curved objects is derived as a function of dynamics and sonar properties.
