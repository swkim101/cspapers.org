This paper describes a simple, inexpensive, and scalable technique for enabling high-resolution multi-touch sensing on rear-projected interactive surfaces based on frustrated total internal reflection. We review previous applications of this phenomenon to sensing, provide implementation details, discuss results from our initial prototype, and outline future directions.
