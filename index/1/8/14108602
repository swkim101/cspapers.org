The increasing use of digital documents, and the need to refer to them conveniently and unambiguously, raise an important question: can one “name” a digital document in a way that conveniently enables users to find it, and at the same time enables a user in possession of a document to be sure that it is indeed the one that is referred to by the name? One crucial piece of a complete solution to this problem would be a method that provides a cryptographically verifiable label for any bit-string (for example, the content, in a particular format, of the document). This problem has become even more acute with the emergence of the WorldWide Web, where a document (whose only existence may be on-line) is now typically named by giving its URL, which is merely a pointer to its virtual location at a particular moment in time. In the traditional world of paper documents, there arc usually reasonable guarantees of this connection. In the cast of printed books and magazines, large print runs that arc the result of single typesetting efforts make it easier to be confident that all copies of a printed document are the same, with a definite name printed in a conventional place in the document. Making a change to a paper document of any sort, even a small change, typically leaves forensic cvidcncc.
