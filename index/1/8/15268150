This paper discusses the internationalization of the X Window System developed by the MIT X consortium. The main purpose is to enable X Window System Release 4 (X11R4) and earlier versions to support Asian languages, primarily Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. Unlike English and other European-based languages, Asian languages involve idiographic character manipulation. X Window System XIlR4 and earlier versions can output such ideograms when the corresponding fonts are provided, but they have no corresponding input feature. Asian language input thus involves more than one keystroke to input a single ideogram, e.g., Japanese-language input uses romaji-kana-kanji conversion. This paper proposes an ideogram input architecture on the X Window System and discusses the interfaces between conversion systems Window oriented and X application programs. Like the X System, our input-conversion feature is to a distributed network environment.
