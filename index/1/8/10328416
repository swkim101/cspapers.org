This paper describes a course in Data Compression to be offered as an enrichment experience to junior and senior Computer Science majors at Cal Poly Pomona. Data compression is the process of reducing the amount of space needed to store files on computers or of reducing the amount of time taken to transmit information over a network. It is a topic of obvious interest to computer professionals and the subject of a great deal of current research. However, there are no available textbooks that present a complete and balanced coverage of the subject. This paper provides recommendations for course content and reference materials.
