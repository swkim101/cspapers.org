This application depicts a rectangular color cathode ray tube having a faceplate and a mating funnel, on the faceplate of which is a system of four suspension devices, one at each corner of the faceplate, for detachably supporting a non-self-rigid shadow mask adjacent a screen-bearing inner surface of the faceplate. At least three of the mask suspension devices each comprise detachably engageable mask-mounted and envelope-associated components. One of the components includes an axially extending leaf spring. The mask-mounted component includes a novel metal bracket affixed to a corner of the mask. The bracket provides a precisely located and rigidly held surface for supporting the spring, or alternatively for engaging the spring.
