We are interested in the use of analog neural networks for recognizing visual objects. Objects are described by the set of parts they are composed of and their structural relationship. Structural models are stored in a database and the recognition problem reduces to matching data to models in a structurally consistent way. The object recognition problem is in general very difficult in that it involves coupled problems of grouping, segmentation and matching. We limit the problem here to the simultaneous labelling of the parts of a single object and the determination of analog parameters. This coupled problem reduces to a weighted match problem in which an optimizing neural network must minimize E(M, p) = Σαi Mαi Wαi(p), where the {Mαi} are binary match variables for data parts i to model parts α and {Wαi(P)} are weights dependent on parameters p. In this work we show that by first solving for estimates p without solving for Mαi, we may obtain good initial parameter estimates that yield better solutions for M and p.
