Wireless sensor networks are emerging technologies that offer low cost, distributed monitoring solutions for a wide variety of applications and systems. One application driving the development of sensor networks is the reporting of conditions within a region of interest where the environment can abruptly change due to an sudden event, such as enemy and target movements on the battlefield, or biochemical attacks, fires, etc. Our work focuses on sensor systems that need to efficiently deliver information during and immediately following an event that triggers such an abrupt change. Congestion control and load balancing are critical issues in such sensor networks where the sensor field can move instantaneously from almost zero load to overload conditions. It is during these impulse or overload periods that the events in transit are of most importance and most likely to be lost due to congestion. Existing congestion control algorithms [1] [2] [3] are limited under these conditions because they rely on rate control or packet drop mechanisms at source or intermediate sensor nodes that can significantly impact the applicationâ€™s fidelity, as measured at one or more physical sinks. We propose randomly distributing a small number of allwireless dual radio virtual sinks throughout the sensor field that are capable of offering the existing low-power sensor network enhanced congestion avoidance support when persistent congestion is detected. In essence virtual sinks operate as safety valves in the sensor field to selectively siphon off high load traffic in order to maintain the fidelity of the application signal at the physical sink and to alleviate the funneling effect, as discussed in Section 2.1. We call these specialized nodes virtual sinks to distinguish them from physical sinks, which typically have a wireline
