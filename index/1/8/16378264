Automatic book indexing systems are based on the generation of phrase structures capable of reflecting text content. Some approaches are given for the automatic construction of back-of-book indexes using a syntactic analysis of the available texts, followed by the identification of nominal constructions, the assignment of importance weights to the term phrases, and the choice of phrases as indexing units.
