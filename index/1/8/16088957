Energy efficient compliant actuation is the missing ingredient and key enabler of next-generation autonomous systems, domestic robots, prosthetic devices, orthotic devices, and wearable exoskeletons, to name a few. For all these devices, one would wish to develop actuators enabling wide range impedance modulation with low energy cost. Using conventional and biologically-inspired compliant actuation, previous research led to functional devices but with high energy cost. Here we introduce a minimalistic compliant actuator to realize impedance modulation with low energy cost. Using this actuator we demonstrate stiffness augmentation in human-machine collaboration. We argue that the non-biologically-inspired actuation concept presented here may effectively complement a biological system, by restoring or extending its functionality, with negligible energy cost.
