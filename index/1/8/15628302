To fully understand the conceptual principles behind operating systems it must be possible to 'see' what is happening inside the system as the execution of a task progresses. A graphic representation of information flow would give a clear picture of what is happening inside an operating system at every moment. Currently there are no tools which help visualize the flow of information as a task executes. GraphOS is a teaching tool that presents to the student a graphic representation of information flow inside an operating system. This paper discusses GraphOS and the advantages of using the system as a complement to the lectures in an operating systems course.
