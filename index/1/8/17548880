We investigate the problem of determining the polarity of sentiments when one or more occurrences of a negation term such as "not" appear in a sentence. The concept of the scope of a negation term is introduced. By using a parse tree and typed dependencies generated by a parser and special rules proposed by us, we provide a procedure to identify the scope of each negation term. Experimental results show that the identification of the scope of negation improves both the accuracy of sentiment analysis and the retrieval effectiveness of opinion retrieval.
