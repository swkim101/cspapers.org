In order to take on the challenge of fully automatic program parallelizing, one of the last and probably the most decisive missing tool is a performance estimation system. In this paper a new performance prediction tool is introduced, which automatically derives performance estimates for single program multiple data (SPMD) parallel Fortran 77 programs based on distributed memory systems (DMS). The underlying methodology is based on static and dynamic techniques. This paper discusses in particular a high level abstract description of the parallel program, which is utilized to derive performance estimates. The salient features of the overall design of this tool and its components are described.
