In this paper, we study a variant of reachability queries, called label-constraint reachability (LCR) queries, specifically,given a label set S and two vertices u1 and u2 in a large directed graph G, we verify whether there exists a path from u1 to u2 under label constraint S. Like traditional reachability queries, LCR queries are very useful, such as pathway finding in biological networks, inferring over RDF (resource description f ramework) graphs, relationship finding in social networks. However, LCR queries are much more complicated than their traditional counterpart.Several techniques are proposed in this paper to minimize the search space in computing path-label transitive closure. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of our method by extensive experiments.
