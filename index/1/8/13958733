Cultural theory breaks with Modern analysis by 
rejecting traditional notions of race, gender, class and 
sexuality. In doing so, alternative frameworks such as 
Post-Feminism emerge which are useful for thinking 
about culture, technology and what our interactions 
with it mean. From a Post-Feminist perspective it can 
be seen how in our multi-cultural, post-industrial, 
digitized world, there is space to move beyond 
traditional ways of dividing up society such as ‘male’ 
and ‘female’. We are then free to re-construct our 
identity in light of a rich diversity of individually 
relevant experiences. Therefore, in order to get a better 
understanding of the highly nuanced cultural 
interactions that characterize our use of technology, 
this paper argues against using the inherently 
stereotyped lens of gender and allowing a new set of 
user needs to emerge.
