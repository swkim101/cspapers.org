In this paper we wish to consider the problem of proving assertions about programs that construct and alter data structures. Our method will be to define a suitable assertion language L for data structures, to define a simple programming language L' for constructing and altering data structures, to give axioms and rules of inference (in the style of [Hoare 1969]) which specify the effect of program segments on data structures (described by formulas in L) and finally to prove that these axioms are correct (relative to a formal definition of the semantics of L') and, in a reasonable sense, complete. Thus our intention is to provide a complete theoretical framework for describing arbitrary data structures and proving assertions about programs that manipulate them.
