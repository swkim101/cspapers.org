The paper presents control architecture for steer-by-wire (SBW) vehicles based on conventional ones. Estimation techniques linked to state space design enter in the control loop. The active observer (AOB) is extended to under-actuated multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Stochastic strategies are presented. Simulation results for the model-matching problem are presented. In the presence of road disturbances (e.g. lateral wind), SBW vehicles have superior performance.
