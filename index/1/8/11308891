This paper describes a process for evolving a stable humanoid walking gait that is based around parameterised loci of motion. The parameters of the loci are chosen by an evolutionary process based on the criteria that the robot's ZMP (zero moment point) follows a desirable path. The paper illustrates the evolution of a straight line walking gait. The gait has been tested on a 1.2 m tall humanoid robot (GuRoo). The results, apart form illustrating a successful walk, illustrate the effectiveness of the ZMP path criterion in not only ensuring a stable walk, but also in achieving efficient use of the actuators.
