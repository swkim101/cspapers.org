Online Scientific Applications (OSA) require statistical analysis of large multidimensional datasets. Towards this end, we have designed and developed a data storage and retrieval system, called ProDA, which deploys wavelet transform and provides fast approximate answers with progressively increasing accuracy in support of the OSA queries. ProDA employs a standard web-service infrastructure to enable remote users to interact with their data. These web-services enable wavelet transformation of large multidimensional datasets as well as inserting, updating, and exact, approximate and progressive querying of these datasets in the wavelet domain. We demonstrate the features of ProDA on a massive atmospheric dataset provided to us by NASA/JPL.
