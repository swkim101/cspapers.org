As digital computing systems become more complex, diagnostic programs are being used more to detect and isolate failures in the logic system. One method of producing diagnostic programs which is receiving increased attention recently is automatic diagnostic program generation which has a logic simulator program as its central element. The simulator is effectively used if the viewpoint of Seshu and Freeman1 on logic failures is adopted. This viewpoint says that a logic failure transforms a good machine into a different machine. Thus if there are N possible failures, there are N+1 different possible machines. The simulator is then used to test each of the N+1 machines. Testing is developed by following the method described by Bruli et al.2 and is briefly outlined below.
