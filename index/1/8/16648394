This paper discusses the " real number " data type as implemented by " floating point " numbers. Floating point implementations and a theorem that characterizes their truncations are presented. A teachable floating point system is presented, chosen so that most problems can be worked out with paper and pencil. Then major differences between floating point number systems and the continuous real number system are presented. Important floating point formats are next discussed. Two examples derived from actual computing practice on mainframes, minicomputers, and PCs are presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of where floating point arithmetic should be taught in standard courses in the ACM curriculum. FLOATING POINT BASICS Floating point numbers are used to implement the abstract data type often called " real ". In typical scientific notation, a number is of the form a * 10b, where 1 c = a
