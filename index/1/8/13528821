Full automatic software measurement from conceptual models is now accepted by academics, although take-up of these model-based measurement procedures in practice by software practitioners has been slow. To encourage acceptance in industry, an acceptance model for measurement procedures is proposed, identifying a set of factors that influence perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use when a user employs a measurement procedure. Analyzing the results of an empirical study carried out with software engineering academics, we find which factors have an influence on other factors. Using regression analysis, certain factors are identified that affect perceived usefulness and ease of use, and which in turn will affect intention to use.
