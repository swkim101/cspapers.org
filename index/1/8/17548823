This paper explores the use of commands in a query language as an abstract data type (ADT) in data base management systems Basically, an ADT facility allows new data types, such as polygons, lines, money, time, arrays of floating point numbers, bit vectors, etc, to supplement the built-in data types in a data base system. In this paper we demonstrate the power of adding a data type corresponding to commands in a query language We also propose three extensions to the query language QUEL to enhance its power in this augmented environment.
