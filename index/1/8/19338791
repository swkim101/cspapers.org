Among the sources of information that can be used to guide the processing of visual sensory data are the constraints implied by the geometry of the objects being viewed. Experiments have been performed using representations of this type of knowledge to control image processing. They show how such geometric knowledge can be used to aid in the identification of object projections in images of natural outdoor scenes.
