We present a novel, data-driven method for integrated shallow and deep parsing. Mediated by an XML-based multi-layer annotation architecture, we interleave a robust, but accurate stochastic topological field parser of German with a constraint-based HPSG parser. Our annotation-based method for dovetailing shallow and deep phrasal constraints is highly flexible, allowing targeted and fine-grained guidance of constraint-based parsing. We conduct systematic experiments that demonstrate substantial performance gains.
