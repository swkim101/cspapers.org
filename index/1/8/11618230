The SWAP system consists of an interconnected set of computer programs whose general purpose is to aid in the design and fabrication of electronic equipment. The principal input to the system at this stage is a list of Boolean logical equations, which describe the design of a piece of digital equipment; for example, an airborne computer. Other possible inputs describe the logical, electronic and geometric properties of the circuit modules which are used to build the equipment, the geometric properties of the boards upon which these circuits are to be laid out, the symbols which correspond to the circuit elements, the time intervals over which simulation is observed, the placement of specific modules on the boards, and various options which are available to the program user. The final output of the SWAP system is a complete diagrammed layout of the equipment in the form in which it will be fabricated; the fabrication process is actually controlled indirectly by the computer output. A record of the logical behavior of the equipment during simulation can also be provided as well as a diagram of the final module layout and various listings which can be used to check the input.
