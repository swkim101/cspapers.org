Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a fully generative approach to language modelling which overcomes the inconsistent generative semantics of Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI). This paper shows that PLSI is a maximum a posteriori estimated LDA model under a uniform Dirichlet prior, therefore the perceived shortcomings of PLSI can be resolved and elucidated within the LDA framework.
