New hard real-time Advanced Driver Assistance Systems such as the Collision-Avoidance System push the bandwidth requirements of the communication infrastructure to a new level. Controller Area Network (CAN) and FlexRay are reaching their limits. Ethernet-based automotive networks such as Ethernet AVB are capable of addressing these requirements. However, designing predictable Ethernet networks is more complex than the design of a traditional CAN bus. Formal real-time performance characteristics are key to a successful Ethernet integration. In this paper we present an improved Ethernet AVB performance analysis which exploits traffic-stream correlations. The results are significantly tighter compared to related work.
