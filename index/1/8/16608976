In this demo we present a novel ranging based on Time Of Flight (TOF) measurements for Wireless LAN (WLAN) and demonstrate the tracking capability of the distance from a WLAN Access Point (AP) to a WLAN mobile device. Conference participants can move with the mobile device around the coverage range of the AP to observe both the accuracy and the convergence of distance tracking. Using our software-based prototype implementation, we achieve accuracies of few meters at a walking speed and in different channel conditions.
