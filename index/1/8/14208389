Localization and mapping in indoor environments, such as airports and hospitals, are key tasks for almost every robotic platform. Some researchers suggest the use of RO (Range Only) sensors based on WiFi (Wireless Fidelity) technology with SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) techniques. The current state of the art in RO SLAM is mainly focused on the filtering approach, while the study of smoothing approach with RO sensors is quite incomplete. This paper presents a comparison between a filtering algorithm, the EKF, and a smoothing algorithm, the SAM (Smoothing And Mapping). Experimental results are obtained, first in an outdoor environment using two types of RO sensors and then in an indoor environment with WiFi sensors. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the smoothing approach with WiFi sensors in indoors.
