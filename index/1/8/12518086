Repeated studies have shown that a single switching technique, either circuit or packet switching, cannot optimally support a heterogeneous traffic mix composed of voice, video and data. Integrated networks support such heterogeneous traffic by combining circuit and packet switching in a single network. To manage the statistical variations of network traffic, we introduce a new, adaptive routing algorithm called hybrid, weighted routing. Simulations show that hybrid, weighted routing is preferable to other adaptive routing techniques for both packet switched networks and integrated networks.
