This paper presents an approach to estimate traffic queue lengths. It does not rely on any sort of object tracking or background subtraction. The method is based on the detection of low level-features (corners) which can be associated to the presence of vehicles. Then, features are classified as moving or static. An analysis of the locations of static corners allows to measure queue lengths in meters. Errors are smaller than vehicle lengths. The algorithm has been tested with around the clock recordings in different real scenarios.
