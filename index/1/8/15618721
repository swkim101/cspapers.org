This paper describes a control method for noncyclic swing motions such as throwing, hitting and kicking in multiple-joint robots by using “time reversal integral.” This method calculates a control input sequence and an initial posture of the robot to reach a designated terminal state by integrating a dynamic system without directly designating trajectories. The terminal end-tip speed is maximized by optimizing the target terminal state under constraints such as friction and the joint position limits. Feasibility of the method is evaluated by ball throwing experiments.
