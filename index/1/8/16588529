Continuous-flow microfluidics have evolved rapidly in the last decades, due to their advantages in effective and accurate control. However, complex control results in complicated valve actuations. As a result, sophisticated interactions between control and flow layers substantially raise the design difficulty. Previous work on design automation for microfluidics neglects the interactions between the control and flow layers and designs each layer separately, which leads to unrealistic designs. We propose the first planarity-guaranteed architectural model, and the first physical-design module models for important microfluidic components, which have modelled the interactions between both control and flow layers, while reducing the design difficulty. Based on the above, we propose the co-layout synthesis tool called Columba, which considers the pressure sharing among different valves, and routes channels in an any-angled manner. Experimental results show that complicated designs considering layer interactions can be synthesized for the first time.
