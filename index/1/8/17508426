In this paper, we propose model of longitudinally loaded cable based on the Bouc-Wen hysteresis model and within the framework of the Duhem operator. By optimizing the 9 hysteresis model parameters with a genetic algorithm, the proposed model is shown to be capable of representing quasi-static response of two different diameter cables, 0.61 mm (thin) and 1.19 mm (thick), used for the RAVEN II surgical robotic surgery platform. The construction of the cable is 7 strands with 19 individual wires per strand. Furthermore, it is shown that the dynamic response of the cables are captured by adding a linear damping term. The hysteresis model and linear damper with the optimized parameters accurately models a longitudinal vibration test result in terms of frequency, steady state stretch, and logarithmic decrement. Energy dissipation due solely to the hysteresis term is approximately calculated to be 57 and 71% of the total energy loss for the thin and thick cables respectively. The proposed model may be used for cables with different contraction and diameter and can be applied for control of cable driven robots in which cables are stretched longitudinally without large excitation of other modes.
