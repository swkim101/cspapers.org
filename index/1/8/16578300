A scalable SIMD/MIMD mixed-mode parallel processor architecture called XC core is proposed to meet the high and diverse performance requirements of embedded multimedia applications. XC core supports both the SIMD and MIMD computing models at low hardware cost by dynamically reconfiguring itself into datapath circuits or control circuits, i.e., trading off between performance and flexibility. A control processor is used to broadcast instructions to a whole SIMD PE (Processing Element) array or to a part of it while assigning a separate program to each PU (Processing Unit), that is mainly composed of the hardware resources of several PEs. RTL synthesis results show that area overhead for reconfiguration is merely 10% of the total area. Benchmark results show that the SIMD mode is effectively achieving high performance towards the regular and massive data parallelism portions of applications, while the MIMD mode enables acceleration of the remaining part of applications whose implementation using a pure highly parallel SIMD architecture would otherwise be impossible. The results show that the XC core design is competitive against more complex processors, with respect to both its cost efficiency as a highly parallel SIMD processor and its flexibility as a multicore MIMD processor, against a wide range of applications.
