This paper describes an application of FRL to the monitoring of a large computer network. The design utilizes frame models for the network domain and a general graphics system, and a method for coupling the two domains by analogy creation and maintenance. We also explore the use of heuristics to control the selection of viewable descriptions, at their various abstraction levels and sizes. An ultimate goal of the project is to provide a convenient means for developers to create new graphic descriptions of the domain, without worry as to size of the description, and allow the heuristics to decide how and when the descriptions should be placed on the screen.
