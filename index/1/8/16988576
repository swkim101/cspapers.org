For any fixed l > 0, we present an algorithm which takes as input a semi-algebraic set, S, defined by P<inf>1</inf> ≥ 0,...,P<inf>s</inf> ≥ 0, where each P<inf>i</inf> ∈ R[X<inf>1</inf>,...,X<inf>k</inf>] has degree ≤ 2, and computes the top l Betti numbers of S, b<inf>k-1</inf>(S), ..., b<inf>k-l</inf>(S), in polynomial time. The complexity of the algorithm, stated more precisely, is Σ<inf>i=0</inf><sup>l+2</sup> (<sup>s</sup><inf>i</inf> k<sup>2<sup>O((l,s))</sup></sup>. For fixed l, the complexity of the algorithm can be expressed as s<sup>l+2</sup> k<sup>2<sup>O(l)</sup></sup>, which is polynomial in the input parameters s and k. To our knowledge this is the first polynomial time algorithm for computing non-trivial topological invariants of semi-algebraic sets in R<sup>k</sup> defined by polynomial inequalities, where the number of inequalities is not fixed and the polynomials are allowed to have degree greater than one. For fixed s, we obtain by letting l = k, an algorithm for computing all the Betti numbers of S whose complexity is k<sup>2<sup>O(s)</sup></sup>
