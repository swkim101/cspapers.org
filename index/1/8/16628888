However, the scale of the problem has increased dramatically because of the prevalence of the Web. In this paper, we aim to explore the efficient top-k similar string matching problem. Several efficient strategies are introduced, such as length aware and adaptive q-gram selection. We present a general q-gram based framework and propose two efficient algorithms based on the strategies introduced. Our techniques are experimentally evaluated on three real data sets and show a superior performance.
