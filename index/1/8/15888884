A consistent query answer in a possibly inconsistent database is an answer which is true in every (minimal) repair of the database. We present here a practical framework for computing consistent query answers for large, possibly inconsistent relational databases. We consider relational algebra queries without projection, and denial constraints. Because our framework handles union queries, we can effectively (and efficiently) extract indefinite disjunctive information from an inconsistent database. We describe a number of novel optimization techniques applicable in this context and summarize experimental results that validate our approach.
