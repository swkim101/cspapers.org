We introduce a hierarchical labeling scheme called ORDPATH that is implemented in the upcoming version of Microsoft® SQL Server™. ORDPATH labels nodes of an XML tree without requiring a schema (the most general case---a schema simplifies the problem). An example of an ORDPATH value display format is "1.5.3.9.1". A compressed binary representation of ORDPATH provides document order by simple byte-by-byte comparison and ancestry relationship equally simply. In addition, the ORDPATH scheme supports insertion of new nodes at arbitrary positions in the XML tree, their ORDPATH values "careted in" between ORDPATHs of sibling nodes, without relabeling any old nodes.
