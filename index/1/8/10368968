Most approaches to topic modeling assume an independence between documents that is frequently violated. We present an topic model that makes use of one or more user-specified graphs describing relationships between documents. These graph are encoded in the form of a Markov random field over topics and serve to encourage related documents to have similar topic structures. Experiments on show upwards of a 10% improvement in modeling performance.
