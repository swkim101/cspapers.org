We present exact analytical equilibrium solutions for a class of recurrent neural network models, with both sequential and parallel neuronal dynamics, in which there is a tunable competition between nearest-neighbour and long-range synaptic interactions. This competition is found to induce novel coexistence phenomena as well as discontinuous transitions between pattern recall states, 2-cycles and non-recall states.
