Currently available tools tend to use either labels or features for classification, but both are necessary to describe the image properly. There have been recent successes in using vector-valued functions, which construct matrix-valued kernels, to explore the multi-label structure in the output space. This has motivated us to develop multi-view vector-valued manifold regularization (MV$^3$MR) in order to integrate multiple features. MV$^3$MR exploits the complementary properties of different features, and discovers the intrinsic local geometry of the compact support shared by different features, under the theme of manifold regularization. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed MV$^3$MR methodology for image classification by conducting extensive experiments on two challenge datasets, PASCAL VOC' 07 and MIR Flickr.
