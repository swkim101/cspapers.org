Given a pair of stream images of a dynamic scene with multiple moving object, how does the scene look like from a new viewing position in between two reference cameras? We tackle this interpolation problem using layered representation of the scene in this paper. The dynamic scene is separated into two different layers; a static background layer and a dynamically changing foreground layer. The foreground layer is further separated into sublayers according to the correspondences of each object in the scene. Different interpolation methods are used for the background and foreground layers. The joint view triangulation method is used for the background layer and interpolation using a local transformation of each object is used for the foreground layer. View interpolation of a dynamic scene is achieved by combining these separately interpolated background and foreground layers. Obtained photo-realistic interpolated images are presented.
