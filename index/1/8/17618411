An applicative language based upon recent ideas by John Backus has been developed. The language provides a powerful formalism for the expression of complex database queries. Though currently implemented with an interface to a CODASYL system, the language employs a sufficiently general data model that use with other database management systems is possible. This paper describes the language through a number of examples and outlines its implementation.
