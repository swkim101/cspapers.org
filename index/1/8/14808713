Computer science instructors often rely on the final version of a program for assessment and feedback. This ignores the process the student used to arrive at the final program. When the instructor has the ability to observe real-time development progress of each student, they are better equipped to provide appropriate and timely feedback. CodeWave, a software program developed at the University of North Carolina Wilmington looks to alleviate these issues.
 CodeWave is a real-time, collaborative Integrated Development Environment with traditional features such as syntax highlighting and non-traditional features such as integrated messaging and logged playback. CodeWave enhances productivity by integrating many common tools students and instructors use during the programming process. Communication is effortless and allows a user to specify a point in the code as a link in the message body. Log playback provides the ability to review the entire development process. In this paper, we describe the software program we developed to enhance learning in computer science programming courses.
