Graph-based methods for semi-supervised learning have recently been shown to be promising for combining labeled and unlabeled data in classification problems. However, inference for graph-based methods often does not scale well to very large data sets, since it requires inversion of a large matrix or solution of a large linear program. Moreover, such approaches are inherently transductive, giving predictions for only those points in the unlabeled set, and not for an arbitrary test point. In this paper a new approach is presented that preserves the strengths of graph-based semi-supervised learning while overcoming the limitations of scalability and non-inductive inference, through a combination of generative mixture models and discriminative regularization using the graph Laplacian. Experimental results show that this approach preserves the accuracy of purely graph-based transductive methods when the data has "manifold structure," and at the same time achieves inductive learning with significantly reduced computational cost.
