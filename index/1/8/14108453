Clustering is a technique that is usually applied as a tool for exploratory data analysis. Because of the exploratory nature of this task, it would be beneficial if a clustering method generates interpretable results, and allows incorporating domain knowledge. This motivates us to develop a probabilistic discriminative model that learns a rectangular decision rule for each cluster, we call Discriminative Rectangle Mixture (DReaM) model. DReaM gives interpretable clustering results, because the rectangular decision rules discovered explicitly illustrate how one cluster is defined and differs from other clusters. It also facilitates us to take advantage of existing rules because we can choose informative prior distributions for the rectangular rules. Moreover, DReaM allows that the features for generating rules do not have to be the same as the features for discovering cluster structure. We approximate the distribution for the rules discovered via variational inference. Experimental results demonstrate that DReaM gives more interpretable clustering results, and yet its performance is comparable to existing clustering methods when solving traditional clustering. Furthermore, in real applications, DReaM is able to effectively take advantage of domain knowledge, and to generate reasonable clustering results.
