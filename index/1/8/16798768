The organization of a program for linguistic analysis of geometrical patterns is described. The program belongs to the system of pattern recognition for industrial drawings and objects [1,2,7] 
 
We started from the formalism suggested by Evans [3, 4]. In completing practical tasks, we haved eveloped the methods of economical grammar construction, exact description of various geometrical relations between pattern elements and our program implementation. The program is written in FORTRAN with the use of the LIDI-T2 list processing system L5, 63. 
 
The grammar is represented by a stiitic lint structure. Geometrical relations and structural transformations of quantitative information, included in the sytitem, are implemented as a set of subroutines. The program algorithm to organize the analysis is grammar-independent, but the passing of the program control to the program segments to process the quantitative information is controlled by the grammar and vice-versa, i.e. the taking of information out of the grammar is controlled by the results. of the processing of the quantitative information about the actual object (and by the given atrategy of the use of the grammar as well).
