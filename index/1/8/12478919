Model-driven development (MDD) is gaining importance as an approach to resolving lifecycle challenges of large-scale distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems (e.g., avionics mission computing). DRE systems are characterized by their stringent requirements for quality of service (QoS), such as predictable end-to-end latencies, timeliness and scalability. Delivering the QoS needs of DRE systems entails the need to configure correctly, fine tune and provision the infrastructure used to host the DRE systems, which crosscuts different layers of middleware, operating systems and networks. Addressing these tangled deployment and configuration concerns of DRE systems requires integrating the principles of Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD) with MDD. This demo showcases a set of software tools that resolve both the inherently and accidental complexities arising due to the configuration and deployment crosscutting concerns of component middleware-based DRE systems.
