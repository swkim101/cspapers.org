This TechNote introduces WebCard, an integrated maillnews reader and Web browser. As a maillnews reader, WebCard is fairly conventional; the innovation is that Web pages are fully integrated in the mail/news reader. The user interface is based on folders, where an “item” in a folder can be a mail message, news article or Web page. When displaying a Web page, users can follow links, and the new pages will appear as items in the current folder. Users can copy and move items between folders, forward items, and can also use folders to organize material on the Web, such as hotlists, query results, and breadth-first expansions. INTRODUCTION As people are spending increasing amounts of time sending e-mail, reading news, and surfing the Web, an integrated user interface to the three activities is increasingly appealing. Leading-edge Web browsers are moving toward this goal by starting to include features for handling e-mail and news. For instance, Netscape (version 1.IN) [4] provides a polished interface for reading news and posting articles. Netscape, like most Web browsers, allows a user to send e-mail; however, no browsers support reading e-mail. Leading-edge mail readers are moving in the same direction, by starting to provide access to the Web. For example, Z -Mai 1 [5] allows e-mail to reference HTML documents as MIME attachments. The text part of the mail message is shown in the standard fashion, and clicking on the “attachment” button invokes a Web browser of the user’s choice that displays the attachment. Once the Web browser is running, it is completely independent of the mail reader, however. This TechNote introduces WebCard, a folder-based mail/news reader (think of it as a combination of xmh and xrn) that has been enhanced to handle Web pages using the same inter-face that it already uses for handling mail messages and newsgroup posting.

WEBCARD At first blush, WebCard is a conventional folder-based e-mail reader. At any given time there is an open folder, and one message from the open folder, called the selected message, is displayed in the display pane of the WebCard window. The user can respond to the selected message, forward it, copy or move it to another folder, and so on. (Actually, more than one message can be selected, but some operations, like ‘<Reply,” are only valid when there is a single selected message.) Users can also perform standard folder operations, such as creating, renaming, and deleting folders. WebCard handles newsgroups in the same way: a folder whose name refers to a newsgroup contains the postings in the newsgroup. Users can respond to a news article by using the “Reply” button, copy postings to folders, and so on. The only difference between a newsgroup folder and any other folder is that newsgroup folders are “read-only;” users cannot delete messages from a news folder or copy messages into a news folder. WebCard uses the name of the folder to distinguish between newsgroup folders and ordinary folders; a period in the folder name indicates a newsgroup. The Andrew Messages System [3] is the only other system we know of that deals uniformly with e-mail and bulletin boards. WebCard also integrates Web pages in the same way: folders can contain Web pages. Web pages are rendered just as they would be in a stand-alone graphical Web browser, and displayed in WebCard’s display pane where the contents of a message normally are displayed (textually). The subject of the Web page “message” is the “<TITLE>” field of the Web page. The only operation that doesn’t make sense for a Web page “message” is “Reply.” There are three ways to display a Web page: clicking on a URL that appears in the currently displayed mail message or news article, primary-selecting a URL (in any window on the screen) and then middle-clicking on the “URE’ button, and using the “Open URL7 dialog. Once a Web page is displayed. clicking on a link fetches the new page. Depending on keyboard modifiers, the new page either replaces the existing page or is added as a “message” in the current folder. November 14-17, 1995 UIST ’95 197 These screen dumps show WebCard in action. The top part of the WebCard window contains a browser listing the subjects of mail messages or news postings and titles of Web pages. The bottom part of the window displays the mail message, news posting or Web page. At the left, WebCard is displaying a URL that had been mentioned in a news article posted by a user named “websurfer”. That article had been copied into the inbox as message 10. The image at the right shows WebCard after clicking on the “Mr. Showbiz” icon, and then on a link to retrieve a review of the movie Dangerous Minds. M, Stww+,zw,l, do wha&,,,ake$ roauermk?~.

WebCard allows users to “Detach” items from the folder, and temporarily display them in a separate pane in the WebCard window. When a detached item is a Web page, the user can click on links and the new page is added to the folder and it appears back on the display pane rather than obscuring the detached page. Thus, the user can have a page, such as a table of contents or index, visible for an extended period, even while following another chain of links on the main body of the folder. Folders provide a convenient way for users to organize material. For example, a user can keep the home pages of all of his or her colleagues together in a folder named “Colleagues,” or keep several “hotlists”, each in its own folder. WebCard also uses folders to return the results of certain operations. For example, WebCard has an “Expand One Level” command which traverses every link on a particular page, and returns all resulting pages in a new folder. IMPLEMENTATION WebCard is implemented in Modula–3 [2], and makes use of two existing Modula–3 applications, Postcard and DeckScape. Postcard is a folder-based maillnews reader that has been in daily use at SRC since 1988. DeckScape[l] is an experimental Web browser based on the metaphor of a deck, collections of Web pages only one of which is visible at a time. The DeckScape display consists of multiple decks, all in a single top-level window. Users can move, resize or iconify decks, move or copy pages between decks, and so on. Decks in DeckScape serve the function of folders in WebCard. WebCard support HTML2.0, including inline images (rendered in black-and-white), forms, and active maps. WebCard does not support external viewers. CONCLUSION WebCard has introduced a new interaction technique for browsing the Web. It integrates e-mail, news, and Web browsing into a single user interface, thereby avoiding the contextswitching inherent when using independent applications. As a Web browser, WebCard supports folders, a flexible way to organize, browse, and store large numbers of documents. We do not claim that WebCard the correct way to browse the Web, to organize material on the Web, to integrate mail and news, or even to integrate mailfnews with Web browsing. Discovering and quantifying the strengths and weaknesses of the interaction techniques introduced by WebCard are challenges for the future.
