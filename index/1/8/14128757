Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in content-based web applications, from news to shopping sites. Nonetheless, an aspect that has been largely overlooked so far in the recommender system literature is that of automatically building explanations for a particular recommendation. This paper focuses on the news domain, and proposes to enhance effectiveness of news recommender systems by adding, to each recommendation, an explanatory statement to help the user to better understand if, and why, the item can be her interest. We consider the news recommender system as a black-box, and generate different types of explanations employing pieces of information associated with the news. In particular, we engineer text-based, entity-based, and usage-based explanations, and make use of a Markov Logic Networks to rank the explanations on the basis of their effectiveness. The assessment of the model is conducted via a user study on a dataset of news read consecutively by actual users. Experiments show that news recommender systems can greatly benefit from our explanation module as it allows users to discriminate between interesting and not interesting news in the majority of the cases.
