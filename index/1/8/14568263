The problem of testing whether or not an arbitrary context-free grammar is LALR(k) for a fixed integer k â‰¥ 1 (i.e. only the subject grammar is a problem parameter) is shown to be PSPACE-complete. The result is in contrast with testing the membership in several other easily parsed classes of grammars, such as LR(k), SLR(k), LC(k) and LL(k) grammars, for which deterministic polynomial time membership tests are known. The PSPACE-hardness of the problem is proved using a transformation from the finite state automaton non-universality problem. A nondeterministic algorithm for constructing sets of LR(k) items leads to a polynomially space bounded algorithm for LALR(k) testing.
