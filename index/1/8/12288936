CPU processor design involves a large set of increasingly complex design decisions, and simulating all possible designs is typically not feasible. Sensitivity analysis, a commonly used technique, can be dependent on the starting point of the design and does not necessarily account for the cost of each parameter. This work proposes a method to simultaneously analyzes multiple parameters with a small number of experiments by leveraging the Plackett and Burman (P&B) analysis method. It builds upon the technique in two specific ways. It allows a parameter to take multiple values and replaces the unit-less impact factor with cost-proportional values.
