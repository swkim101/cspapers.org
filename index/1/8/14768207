In this paper we present a unique approach to make use of CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) [1] from IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) in a situation aware mode. The protocol adapts its characteristic for resource optimization depending on the indication inferred from sensed data. We consider a use-case for vehicular telemetry using a constrained in-vehicle sensor gateway which posts the vehicular information (accelerometer, GPS, device-identifier, time). In this use-case bandwidth usage is the main concern for the sensor gateway whereas usage of power which is directly impacted by overall bandwidth consumption is a key factor in case of mobile phone used as sensor gateway. We have reduced communication cost and optimized resource usage in terms of energy and bandwidth which are essential for any constrained sensor gateway by adapting characteristics of CoAP as mentioned above. The improvements are established by analyzing the data captured in real field.
