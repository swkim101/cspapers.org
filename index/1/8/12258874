In this paper, we derive closed form expressions for average symbol error rate of M-ary signalling for MIMO-MRC (MRT) systems over Rayleigh fading channels taking account of channel estimation errors. Following the moment generating function (mgf), we formulate the final expressions in the form of hypergeometric functions. The expressions are valid for an arbitrary number of antennas and any modulation levels. MRT system suffers significant performance degradation due to Gaussian estimation errors. Evenly distributed antenna system offers better trade-offs.
