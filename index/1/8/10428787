Real time intelligent robots usually consist of more than one processing unit (pu) to ensure parallel operation of several functions. Each pu in a robot executes repetitive monitoring and controlling operations as well as information exchange to and from other pu's. Since timing of each operation is independent of others, if the robot operating software supports concurrent process facilities, it would be helpful in robot programming. 
 
A self-contained robot "Yamabico 9" has been constructed to be a tool for investigating how a mobile robot understands the outer world. In order to support software production on the robot, Robot Control System (RCS) has been implemented, including simple job commands and a supervisor call (SVC) system. The concurrent process monitor is a part of RCS and some of SVC's are for these facilities. The monitor adopts a "message sending" method to synchronize execution of two processes and to exchange information between processes and pu's. An example of a concurrent process program, "walk along left walls", is given to demonstrate the describing power of our system.
