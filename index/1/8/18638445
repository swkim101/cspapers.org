In order to cope with image signal variations in imaging devices, a d i r e c t i o n coding method is proposed f o r stable scene analysis and object recognition. This method makes extensive use of macroscopic processing of direction-coded images to achieve noise-free analysis. Examples showing recognition of obliquely-imaged box-like objects whose surfaces are rather complicated are included. Additional e f f o r t s are made to recognize surface information of objects by s p a t i a l l y transforming the surface image as if it were viewed from a v e r t i c a l d i r e c t i o n . This method also involves positioninvariant and r o t a t i o n i n v a r i a n t image data transformation techniques, thus raising the p o s s i b i l i t y of more e f f e c t i v e image analysis in actual application.
