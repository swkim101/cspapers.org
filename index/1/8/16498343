The transformation of constructive program synthesis proofs is discussed and compared with the more traditional approaches to program transformation. An example system for adapting programs to special situations by transforming constructive synthesis proofs has been reconstructed and is compared with the original implementation [Goad, 1980b, Goad, 1980a]. A brief account of more general proof transformation applications is also presented.
