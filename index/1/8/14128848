We propose a novel multi-perspective multi-layer interaction using a mobile device, which provides an immersive experience of 3D navigation through an object. The mobile device serves as a window, through which the user can observe the object in detail from various perspectives by orienting the device differently. Various layers of the object can also be shown while users move the device away and toward themselves. Our approach is real-time, completely mobile (running on Android) and does not depend on external sensor/displays (e.g., camera and projector).
