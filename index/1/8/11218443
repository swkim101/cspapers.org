Despite their power and simplicity, randomized algorithms are often under-emphasized in the classroom (and as a consequence, ultimately in practice) since they can be more challenging to analyze than their deterministic counterparts. In this paper, we describe a simplified framework that streamlines the analysis of dozens of common randomized algorithms and data structures. The key component of this framework, which we call the randomized reduction lemma, builds on intuition that is already commonly held by most students based on their experience with deterministic algorithms, and reduces the necessary prerequisites one must know from probability theory to a minimal subset. For example, one can prove that randomized quicksort runs in O(n log n) time with high probability in two paragraphs, without knowledge of random variables or Chernoff bounds. This paper is intended to be self-contained and written in a sufficiently student-friendly fashion so that it may serve as a classroom handout.
