We present a smartphone app based system for crowd monitoring and management during large public events. The app has been deployed during a number of large scale public events including a large parade in London (Lord Mayor's Show), the Vienna marathon, the new Year's Eve celebrations in Zurich and the crowning ceremony of King Willem Alexander in Amsterdam.
