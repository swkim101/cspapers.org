ODE is a database system and environment based on the object paradigm. It offers one integrated data model for both database and general purpose manipulation. The database is defined, queried and manipulated in the database programming language O++ which is based on C++. O++ borrows and extends the object definition facility of C++, called the class. Classes support data encapsulation and multiple inheritance. We provide facilities for creating persistent and versioned objects, defining sets, and iterating over sets and clusters of persistent objects. We also provide facilities to associate constraints and triggers with objects. This paper presents the linguistic facilities provided in O++ and the data model it supports.
