In this paper, we propose an entirely new manipulation strategy for dynamic manipulation of a flexible rope with a high-speed robot arm. The manipulation strategy involves manipulating the object at a constant, high speed. Then, we can assume that the dynamic behavior of the flexible rope can be obtained by performing algebraic calculations of the robot motion using the proposed strategy. Based on this assumption, we derive a model of the flexible rope and suggest a motion planning method using the proposed model. Finally, we show experimental results of rope deformation control based on the proposed method.
