Shape analyses are concerned with precise abstractions of the heap to capture detailed structural properties. To do so, they need to build and decompose summaries of disjoint memory regions. Unfortunately, many data structure invariants require relations be tracked across disjoint regions, such as intricate numerical data invariants or structural invariants concerning back and cross pointers. In this paper, we identify issues inherent to analyzing relational structures and design an abstract domain that is parameterized both by an abstract domain for pure data properties and by user-supplied specifications of the data structure invariants to check. Particularly, it supports hybrid invariants about shape and data and features a generic mechanism for materializing summaries at the beginning, middle, or end of inductive structures. Around this domain, we build a shape analysis whose interesting components include a pre-analysis on the user-supplied specifications that guides the abstract interpretation and a widening operator over the combined shape and data domain. We then demonstrate our techniques on the proof of preservation of the red-black tree invariants during insertion.
