A GOMS theory of stimulus-response compatibility is presented and applied to remembering computer command abbreviations. Two abbreviation techniques, vowel-deletion and special-character-plus-first-letter, are compared in an encoding task. Significant differences are found in the time to type the first letter of the abbreviation, and in the time to complete the typing of the abbreviation. These differences are analyzed using the theory which produces an excellent quantitative fit to the data (r2 = 0.97).
