Text summarization is a data reduction process. The use of text summarization enables users to reduce the amount of text that must be read while still assimilating the core information. The data reduction offered by text summarization is particularly useful in the biomedical domain, where physicians must continuously find clinical trial study information to incorporate into their patient treatment efforts. Such efforts are often hampered by the high-volume of publications. Our contribution is two-fold: 1) to propose the frequency of domain concepts as a method to identify important sentences within a full-text; and 2) propose a novel frequency distribution model and algorithm for identifying important sentences based on term or concept frequency distribution. An evaluation of several existing summarization systems using biomedical texts is presented in order to determine a performance baseline. For domain concept comparison, a recent high-performing frequency-based algorithm using terms is adapted to use concepts and evaluated using both terms and concepts. It is shown that the use of concepts performs closely with the use of terms for sentence selection. Our proposed frequency distribution model and algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art approach.
