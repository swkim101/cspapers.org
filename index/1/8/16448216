An online posture modification method termed Jacobi compensation is proposed which is suitable to modify precalculated step trajectories for a humanoid robot in certain task coordinate directions. This method can account for modeling errors in trajectory precalculation by shifting e.g. the center of mass (CoM) or certain parts of the humanoid mechanism to increase walking stability and performance. A theoretical analysis of stability properties is given.
