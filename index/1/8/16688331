In this short paper we present three methods to valorise score relevance of some documents basing on their characteristics in order to enhance their ranking. Our framework is an information retrieval system dedicated to children. The valorisation methods aim to increase the relevance score of some documents by an additional value which is proportional to the number of multimedia objects included, the number of objects linked to the user particulars and the included topics. All of the three valorization methods use fuzzy rules to identify the valorization value.
