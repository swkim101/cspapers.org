As design patterns are gaining widespread acceptance at industrial level, efforts have come into play to formalize them. The formalization of design patterns is done to clear ambiguities in their concept, check consistency in models by developing verification tools, and provide ease of use to the designer. In this paper, we survey the work on formalization of design patterns. The approach proposed of Kim and Carrington has been studied in detail, which focuses on formalizing design patterns in Object-Z. We use this approach to formalize bridge, composite, and decorator patterns. We believe that formalization of these design patterns will lead to a better and minimal fault implementation of the final software
