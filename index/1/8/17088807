While scalable NoC (Network-on-Chip) based communication architectures have clear advantages over long point-to-point communication channels, their power consumption can be very high. In contrast to most of the existing hardware-based efforts on NoC power optimization, this paper proposes a compiler-directed approach where the compiler decides the appropriate voltage/frequency levels to be used for each communication channel in the NoC. Our approach builds and operates on a novel graph based representation of a parallel program and has been implemented within an optimizing compiler and tested using 12 embedded benchmarks. Our experiments indicate that the proposed approach behaves better - from both performance and power perspectives - than a hardwarebased scheme and the energy savings it achieves are very close to the savings that could be obtained from an optimal, but hypothetical voltage/frequency scaling scheme.
