Motivated by the need to access internet content on mobile devices with expensive or non-existent network access, this paper discusses the possibility for contextual information extracted from electronic calendars to be used as sources for Internet content predictive retrieval (pre-caching). Our results show that calendar based contextual information is useful for this purpose and that calendar based information can produce web queries that are relevant to the users' task supportive information needs.
