Someday mobile robots will operate continually. Day after day, they will be in receipt of a never ending stream of images. In anticipation of this, this paper is about having a mobile robot generate apt and compact summaries of its life experience. We consider a robot moving around its environment both revisiting and exploring, accruing images as it goes. We describe how we can choose a subset of images to summarise the robot's cumulative visual experience. Moreover we show how to do this such that the time cost of generating an summary is largely independent of the total number of images processed. No one day is harder to summarise than any other.
