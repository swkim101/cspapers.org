This paper presents the results of experiments in which we tested different kinds of features for retrieval of Chinese opinionated texts. We assume that the task of retrieval of opinionated texts (OIR) can be regarded as a subtask of general IR, but with some distinct features. The experiments showed that the best results were obtained from the combination of character-based processing, dictionary look up (maximum matching) and a negation check.
