Providing consistent, instant, and detailed feedback to students has been a great challenge in teaching Web based computing. We present the prototype of an automated grading system called ProtoAPOGEE for enriching students' learning experience and elevating faculty productivity. Unlike other automated graders used in introductory programming classes, ProtoAPOGEE emphasizes the examination of quality attributes of student project submissions, in addition to the basic functionality requirements. The tool is able to generate step by step play-back guidance for failed test cases, hence providing informative feedback to help students make reflective and iterative improvements in learning.
