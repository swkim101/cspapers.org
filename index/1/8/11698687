To alleviate the vocabulary problem, this paper investigates the role of user term feedback in interactive text-based image retrieval. Term feedback refers to the feedback from a user on specific terms regarding their relevance to a target image. Previous studies have indicated the effectiveness of term feedback in interactive text retrieval [14]. However, the term feedback has not shown to be effective in our experiments on text-based image retrieval. Our results indicate that, although term feedback has a positive effect by allowing users to identify more relevant terms, it also has a strong negative effect by providing more opportunities for users to specify irrelevant terms. To understand these different effects and their implications on the potential of term feedback, this paper further presents analysis of important factors that contribute to the utility of term feedback and discusses the outlook of term feedback in interactive text-based image retrieval.
