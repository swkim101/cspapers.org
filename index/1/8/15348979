This paper is motivated to improve the performance of individual ensembles using a hybrid mechanism in the regression setting. Based on an error-ambiguity decomposition, we formally analyze the optimal linear combination of two base ensembles, which is then extended to multiple individual ensembles via pairwise combinations. The Cocktail ensemble approach is proposed based on this analysis. Experiments over a broad range of data sets show that the proposed approach outperforms the individual ensembles, two other methods of ensemble combination, and two state-of-the-art regression approaches.
