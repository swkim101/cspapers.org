The advent (and promise) of shared, widely available, high-speed networks provides the potential for new approaches to the collection, organization, storage, and analysis of high-speed and high-volume data streams from high data-rate, on-line instruments. We have worked in this area for several years, have identified and addressed a variety of problems associated with this scenario, and have evolved an architecture, implementations, and a monitoring methodology that have been successful in addressing several different application areas. We describe a distributed, wide area network-based architecture that deals with data streams that originate from online instruments. Such instruments and imaging systems are a staple of modern scientific, health care, and intelligence environments. Our work provides an approach for reliable, distributed real-time analysis, cataloguing, and archiving of the data streams through the integration and distributed management of a high-speed distributed cache, distributed high performance applications, and tertiary storage systems.
