In this paper, we develop an algorithm to improve object recognition by integrating human-generated contextual information with vision algorithms. Specifically, we examine how interactive systems such as robots can utilize two types of context information--verbal descriptions of an environment and human-labeled datasets. We propose a re-ranking schema, MultiRank, for object recognition that can efficiently combine such information with the computer vision results. In our experiments, we achieve up to 9.4% and 16.6% accuracy improvements using the oracle and the detected bounding boxes, respectively, over the vision-only recognizers. We conclude that our algorithm has the ability to make a significant impact on object recognition in robotics and beyond.
