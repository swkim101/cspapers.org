In legged systems design an important question applies to: "What can be inferred from the performance of a legged robot of a similarly configured system, but scaled to a smaller or larger size?" Our work attempts to answer this question and set the basis for a systematic approach in sizing legged robots. This paper focuses on the influence of permanent magnet DC electric drives on the size of quadruped running robots. The reason is twofold. First, many of the existing legged machines have used such actuators for propulsion. The second, the performance of electric motors scales differently from torque- speed requirements of legged robots. Specifically, we show that there exists a particularly sized quadruped running robot that is superior according to desired performance criteria, and under the existing technologic limitations and economic restraints. Therefore, valuable information on legged systems design and insight for optimizing the size of a quadruped robot emerges.
