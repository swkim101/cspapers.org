An image is often represented by a set of detected features. We get an enormous compression by representing images in this way. Furthermore, we get a representation which is little affected by small amounts of noise in the image. However, features are typically chosen in an ad hoc manner. We show how a good set of features can be obtained using sufficient statistics. The idea of sparse data representation naturally arises. We treat the 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional signal reconstruction problem to make our ideas concrete.
