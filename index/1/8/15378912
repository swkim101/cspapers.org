We present a computationally efficient method for deriving the most appropriate transformation and mapping of a nested loop for a given hierarchical parallel machine. This method is in the context of our systematic and general theory of unimodular loop transformations for the problem of iteration space partitioning [7]. Finding an optimal mapping or an optimal associated unimodular transformation is NP-complete. We present a polynomial time method for obtaining a ‘good’ transformation using a simple parameterized model of the hierarchical machine. We outline a systematic methodology for obtaining the most appropriate mapping.
