In tegral equation approaches based on layered media Green's functions are often used to extract models of integrated circuit structures. The primary advan tage of these approaches over equiv alen t-sourcebased schemes is the dramatic reduction in problem size. When combined with an SVD-accelerated sc heme for the solution of the associated dense linear system, this leads to a substantial speedup.
In this paper we deriv e and solve for these multila yered 3D Green's functions using a transmission line circuit analog. A generalized image method for an arbitrary number of layers is presen ted. This method is rapidly con vergen t for near-field in teractions. F or the far field, a Chebyshev interpolation approach is adopted, where a database is precomputed (using a Fast Hankel T ransform) and stored. The combination of these tw o approaches leads to an extremely efficient scheme for the generation of Green's functions.
We combine the SVD-accelerated integral equation solver IES3 with the multila yered Green's function approach, apply it to the extraction of IC parasitics and passive components, and we demonstrate its speed, accuracy and versatility via a number of examples.
