An adjustable automotive vehicle seat has independent front and rear edge adjusting and supporting means to provide for vertical adjustment of the seat between raised and lowered positions, and for tilt adjustment of the seat between an untilted position and a forwardly tilted position while preventing rearward tilting of the seat. A first control member is operable to provide only downward movement of the front edge of the seat, while a second control member is operable to provide only upward movement of the rear edge of the seat. A third control member is operable to provide either upward or downward movement of both front and rear edges simultaneously. Preferably the adjusting and support means comprises separate motors and the control members are switch operators.
