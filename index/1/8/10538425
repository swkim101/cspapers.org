This paper presents a general method for structuring domains that is based on the notion of locality. We consider a localized domain description to be one that is partitioned into regions of activity, each of which has some independent significance. The use of locality can be very beneficial for domain representation and reasoning, especially for parallel, muItiagent domains. We show how localized domain descriptions can alleviate aspects of the frame problem and serve as the foundation of a planning technique based on localized planning spaces. Because domain constraints and properties are localized, potential interactions among these search spaces are fewer and more easily identified.
