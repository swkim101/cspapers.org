Target tracking is one of many important applications in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). For this tracking application, it is necessary to implement some techniques such as estimation and prediction in order to determine state and position of an unknown target. In this paper, we propose a new particle cloud propagation algorithm that is based on Particle Filter for target tracking in WSN. The proposed method allows to track different kind of targets, including unfriendly targets in nonlinear and/or non-Gaussian environment. Our simulation result shows that the proposed method outperforms existing particle propagation algorithms, particularly in the case of high noisy environment.
