The wide variety of software development tools available today have a great potential to improve the way developers make software, but that potential goes unfulfilled when developers are not aware of useful tools. In this paper, I introduce the idea of continuous social screencasting, a novel mechanism to help developers gain awareness of relevant tools by enabling them to learn remotely and asychronously from their peers. The idea builds on the strength of several existing techniques that developers already use for discovering new tools, including screencasts and online social networks.
