We consider the problem of computing the determinant of a matrix of polynomials; we compare two algorithms (expansion by minors and Gaussian elimination), examining each under two models for polynomial computation (dense univariate and totally sparse). The results, while interesting in themselves, also serve to display two points: 1. Asymptotic results are sometimes misleading for noninfinite (e.g., practical) problems. 2. Models of computation are by definition simplifications of reality: Algorithmic analysis should be carried out under several distinct computational models, and should be supported by empirical data.
