Obtaining the optimal cost-to-go map for large scale rough terrains is computationally very expensive both in terms of duration and memory resources. A fast algorithm for approximation of the optimal cost-to-go map in terms of terrain traversability measures for path planning on known large scale rough terrains is developed. The results show that the majority of the cost-to-go map values, computed from every terrain location with respect to the goal location, are near-optimal. Unlike Dijkstra algorithm, the proposed algorithm has inherently parallel structure, and can be significantly speeded up depending on the number of used CPU cores.
