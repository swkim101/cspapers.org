Analyses of vision have tended to focus on what may be under observation rather than considering the larger configuration including observer and observed. It is, however, possible to think systematically about the "missing link" of observer/observed relationships. The paper aims to clarify the logic associated with these relationships. At least three main types of observer/ observed relationship are interesting: when viewpoint is general, when viewpoint is representative, and when viewpoint is privileged. It is shown that knowledge about such relationships can support interesting conclusions - though the exact forms of these conclusions will reflect other empirical and a priori knowledge. The various viewpoint analyses may be regarded as aspects of a single issue - when and how an observer may legitimately assume that properties of stimulation are simply and directly indicative of features of the world. Also, expressing observer/observed relationships calls for appropriate ways of classifying observables: so understanding observer/observed relationships feeds back into understanding what may be observed.
