The authors present an active vision system which performs a surveillance task in everyday dynamic scenes. The system is based around simple, rapid motion processors and a control strategy which uses both position and velocity information. The surveillance task is defined in terms of two separate behavioral subsystems, saccade and smooth pursuit, which are demonstrated individually on the system. It is shown how these and other elementary responses to 2D motion can be built up into behavior sequences, and how judicious close cooperation between vision and control results in smooth transitions between the behaviors. These ideas are demonstrated by an implementation of a saccade to smooth pursuit surveillance system on a high-performance robotic hand/eye platform.
