MLC (multi-level cell) NAND flash memory based solid state drives (SSDs) have been increasingly used in supercomputing centers because of their merits in cost, performance, and energy-efficiency. However, as each cell starts to store two or more bits, a threshold voltage range employed to represent a state has to be continuously shrunk, and a narrowed threshold voltage range causes more bit errors. An ad-hoc solution to this problem is to apply an enhanced ECC (error correction code) scheme. Still, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of threshold voltage on MLC flash performance and reliability is an open question. In this paper, we first empirically measure the correlations between threshold voltage and program/erase (P/E) performance as well as reliability. After analyzing experimental results, we make several interesting observations: 1) a memory cell programmed to a lower threshold voltage has a faster programming speed (up to 31%) as well as a fewer number of bit errors; 2) the programming time of an MSB page is about 2 to 3 times shorter than that of an LSB page; 3) erase performance is highly correlated to threshold voltage. These new findings provide system implications for the development of a better SSD. Further, to demonstrate how these findings can be leveraged to enhance MLC flash, we propose an approach called threshold voltage reduction (TVR), which increases programming speed and longevity by 50% and 7.1%, respectively. Finally, we conduct a study on TVR-powered SSDs. Simulation results show that overall mean response time can be reduced by up to 35%.
