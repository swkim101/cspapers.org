This Student Paper describes work in progress within the field of architectural evolution. The research done for this PhD Thesis has involved study of individual architectural changes, a view that is now integrated to study how companies have evolved with their software architectures. Participation in EDSER will provide opportunity to discuss the relation between an organizationâ€™s business model and software architecture; and to discuss how architectural initiatives are best funded and organized.
