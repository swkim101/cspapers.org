While purchasing a product, consumers often rely on specifications as well as online reviews of the product for decision-making. While comparing, one often has in mind a specific aspect or a set of aspects which are of interest to them. Previous work has used comparative sentences, where two entities are compared directly in a single sentence by the review author, towards the comparison task. In this paper, we extend the existing model by incorporating the feature specifications of the products, which are easily available, and learn the importance to be associated with each of them. To test the validity of these product ranking measures, we comprehensively test it on a digital camera dataset from Amazon.com and the results show good empirical outperformance over the state-of-the-art baselines.
