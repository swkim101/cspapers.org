The Intelligent Space is a space where we can easily interact with computers and robots, and get useful service from them. To achieve such a space, a distributed intelligent networked device (DIND) has been proposed. Many DINDs are installed in a space and they cooperate each other to make the space to become an Intelligent Space. In this paper, an optimal DIND placement, self-calibration of DIND and handover protocol for cooperation among DINDs, are described.
