The requirements for a main memory data storage model are both compactness and efficient processing for all database operations. The DBGraph storage model, proposed in this paper, achieves these goals. By representing the entire database in a unique graph-based data structure, called DBGraph, it fully exploits the directaccess capability of main memory systems. For example, Selection, Join and Transitive closure operations over base or temporary relations are performed by a DBGraph traversal without tuple comparison and move. Furthermore, it is decomposable so that only the useful subset of the database can be loaded from disk without format conversion. Complex database queries can be processed by either set-oriented or pipelined mode depending on the way the graph is traversed. Analysis shows good storage occupancy and excellent performance for both update and retrieval operations.
