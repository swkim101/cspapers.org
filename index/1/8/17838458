We propose a novel scheme for manipulating a passive object using an active plate. The objective of this study is to control an object's orientation with respect to the gravitational force direction by using an active plate for realizing hitherto unrealized object motion. In this context, motions of the object and active plate are designed to be cyclic. A state vector composed of the object's angle and angular velocity is defined, and the cyclic motion is expressed as a nonlinear discrete system. Fixed points of the state vector are searched for in the designed cyclic motion. A stability analysis around the fixed points is conducted using a PoincareÃÅ map. As a result, the fixed points are shown to be asymptotically stable. Finally, experimental results are used to verify that the object's angle can be manipulated with the designed cyclic motion using the plate.
