This invited talk presents an overview of the TeachScheme! and DrScheme projects. The former aims at bringing the principles of programming and programming languages into the introductory programming curriculum. The latter is a program development environment that supports the pedagogy and design principles of the TeachScheme! project. Carrying out these projects enriched our research life with many interesting programming language and system design problems.
