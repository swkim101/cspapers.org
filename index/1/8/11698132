This paper describes research and development of a compact vision system for real-time cell detection and manipulation in a capillary in order to apply on the "automated nuclear transplantation" project which will achieve sort of cell manipulation tasks such as positioning, cutting, sizing, and so on, automatically between different interconnected modules. Here, we propose a vision system boarded on a PDMS based silicon chip, which can be utilized in a complex network for continuous monitoring of mammalian egg and donor cells of sizes in the range of 10 to 100 micron. The developed prototype has sufficient resolution and is accompanied with a robust detection method for cell-based microfluidic applications.
