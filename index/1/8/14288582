In this paper, we give an approximate algorithm for distance based outlier detection using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique. We propose an algorithm for the centralized case wherein the entire dataset is locally available for processing. However, in case of very large datasets collected from various input sources, often the data is distributed across the network. Accordingly, we show that our algorithm can be effectively extended to a constant round protocol with low communication costs, in a distributed setting with horizontal partitioning.
