This paper describes an automatic content indexing system for news programs, with a special emphasis on its segmentation process. The process can successfully segment an entire news program into topic-centered news stories; the primary tool is a linguistic topic segmentation algorithm. Experiments show that the resulting speech-based segments are fairly accurate, and scene change points supplied by an external video processor can be of help in improving segmentation effectiveness.
