Understanding data, models and predictions is im-portant for machine learning applications. Due to the limitations of our spatial perception and intuition, analysing high-dimensional data is inherently difﬁcult. Furthermore, black-box models achieving high predictive accuracy are widely used, yet the logic behind their predictions is often opaque. Use of textualisation – a natural language narrative of selected phenomena – can tackle these shortcom-ings. When extended with argumentation theory we could envisage machine learning models and predictions arguing persuasively for their choices.
