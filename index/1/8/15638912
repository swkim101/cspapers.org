The effect of delay along long wires in VLSI on the area-time complexity of computing certain functions has been investigated recently [CMSl(a), CMSl(b), Ag83]. However, in these papers, tradeoffs have been established only for the cases where the delay is a polynomial in the length of the wire. On the other hand, most researchers [Th80, Ra82, BPP82, NMB83] believe that a more pragmatic model is one that has e( log I) delay along a wire of length 1. Although, Thompson indicated some area-time bounds in his influential thesis [Th80], no serious effort has gone into establishing optimal tradeoffs or lower bounds in this model. In this paper, we attempt to eliminate this deficiency by investigating bounds on area and time for computing certain transitive functions and addition in the subpolynomial delay models. In particular, we demonstrate some truly surprising results which contradict both intuition as well as some widely held conjectures. (See (PRS81] and remark (21 for details.)
