We present a novel system that combines the advantages of social communication and Web search by simultaneously discovering important pages and users. First, the system provides a communication interface attached to pages, which allows users to talk with each other in real time while browsing the same page, i.e., page-centric communication. Then, the system can efficiently provide two ranking lists of pages and users by analyzing a hybrid structure of hyperlinks (page-page relationship) and social links (page-user relationship and user-user relationship). Thus, users can efficiently search for important pages as well as important users related to their queries through the ranking function, and immediately obtain useful information or knowledge from not only pages themselves but also from other users.
