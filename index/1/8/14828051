We introduce the Multiple Relationship Similarity Spreading Algorithm (MRSSA) to enhance IR effectiveness. This method has similarity computed in an iterative "spreading" fashion for multiple object types, combining both inter- and intra-object relationships. We demonstrate the value of this approach in the context of the WWW, where the key objects are web pages and queries, Relationships considered are derived from hyperlinks (in- and out-links) and click-through logs.
