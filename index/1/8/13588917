Those aspects of computer science dealing with the selection of computer hardware, the selection of computer software, the tradeoffs between in-house development and purchase, the transition to a new system, computer performance evaluation, and computer center management are not covered or are covered very lightly in an undergraduate curriculum. This paper presents the evolution and content of a senior-level course on these subjects taught at Indiana-Purdue at Fort Wayne.
