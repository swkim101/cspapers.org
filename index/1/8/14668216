This paper discusses a dexterous hyper plate inspired by pizza manipulation. We first discuss the necessary combinations of active degrees of freedom of the plate for manipulating an object to arbitrary position and orientation on the plate, under the gravity. While there are nine patterns for choosing two active degrees of freedom of the plate, we show one of them can satisfy a sufficient condition for manipulating the object with the weakest coupling among object's motions and eventually leads to a simple manipulation scheme. A couple of experiments are shown to confirm the basic idea.
