In this paper we describe a new language for statistical data modelling, which offers a general framework for the representation of elementary and summary data. There are three main characteristics of the language: 1) the types of modeling primitives of the language are particularly suited for representing objects from a statistical point of view; 2) the language includes a rich set of structuring mechanisms for both elementary and summary data, which are given a formal semantics by means of logic; 3) the language is equipped with specialized inference procedures, allowing for performing different kinds of checks on the representation.
