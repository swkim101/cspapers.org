For some time now we have also been interested in studying human factors aspects of computer text editors. We have surveyed the literature [9], and we have conducted several investigations of our own [10] ranging from an application of file-comparison algorithms in editor research [1], through prediction of editing performance [7], to the design and implementation of SIMPLE, our own editing system for beginners [8, 11].
 Currently we are concentrating our efforts on gathering data to determine how much time users spend performing various editing activities. We intend to extend the work begun in previous studies, to investigate suboptimal editor performance including errors and nonoptimal means of achieving goals, and to study the broder aspects of editing such as file manipulation and job control that have largely been ignored.
