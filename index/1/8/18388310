This paper introduces computation compatibility and communication compatibility as requirements for a distributed mechanism implementation. Just as payments are used to create incentive compatible mechanisms, some technique must be used to create computation/communication compatible mechanisms. This paper explores computation redundancy and communication redundancy as two such techniques. This paper uses interdomain routing as an example domain, and considers where redundancy can succeed and fail in addressing cheating with respect to computation and communication.
