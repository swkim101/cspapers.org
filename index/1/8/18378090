In this paper, we revisit the dependence language modelfor information retrieval proposed in [1], and show that thismodel is deficient from a theoretical point of view. We thenpropose a new model, well founded theoretically, for integratingdependencies between terms in the language model.This new model is simpler, yet more general, than the oneproposed in [1], and yields similar results in our experiments,on both syntactic and semantic dependencies.
