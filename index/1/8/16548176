Abstract : This paper briefly reports on the current architecture and status of EDISON, a computer model being designed to understand natural language descriptions of mechanical devices and generate novel device representations through heuristic strategies of mutation and analogy. The representational constructs in EDISON must support both of these tasks and include: goal/plan information, spatial relationships, forces, motion, contact, regions, constraints on (and principles of) device operation, levels of abstraction, and naive mechanics dependencies and inferences.
