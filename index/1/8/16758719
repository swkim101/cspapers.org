Feature oriented refactoring (FOR) is the process of decomposinga program into features, where a feature is an increment in programfunctionality. We develop a theory of FOR that relates code refac-toring to algebraic factoring. Our theory explains relationshipsbetween features and their implementing modules, and why fea-tures in different programs of a product-line can have differentimplementations. We describe a tool and refactoring methodologybased on our theory, and present a validating case study.
