High speed robot locomotion is one of the most challenging problems in mobile robots. Fast robots push the limits of mechanical design, control and perception. The cheetah is an existence proof of what the authors term an Ultra-High Speed Locomotor, which can attain speeds of greater than 50 leg lengths per second and can cover 10 meters in a single gait cycle.
