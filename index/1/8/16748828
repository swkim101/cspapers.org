Most approaches to full-text information retrieval currently index documents based on the words they contain, and retrieve them based on the wordâ€™s frequency of occurrence. This can cause many irrelevant documents to be retrieved because words are often ambiguous. We propose an approach in which documents are indexed by word aenaea, and in which these senses are taken from a machine-readable dictionary. We review some of the work on machine-readable dictionaries and the approaches that have been taken to word sense disambiguation. We then discuss our own approach to the problem based on the use of multiple sources of evidence. We conclude with the results of some experiments that indicate the degree to which lexical ambiguity is a factor in current systems.
