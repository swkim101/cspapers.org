A new class of data structures called "bumptrees" is described. These structures are useful for efficiently implementing a number of neural network related operations. An empirical comparison with radial basis functions is presented on a robot arm mapping learning task. Applications to density estimation, classification, and constraint representation and learning are also outlined.
