In the last year, the digitalization of the power grids has been pushed further, creating an ever increasing need for security approaches in this domain. One of the most prominent and visible aspects are smart meters, which are being deployed in millions of homes with the intend to optimize billing, but also to generate data for energy saving, load balancing, and other use cases. The first session of the workshop focuses on the privacy of smart meter data, which is an important precondition for a successful and widely accepted rollout, and to make efficient use of the smart metering data. For the overall smartgrid, the workshop takes a higher level view, discussing risk analysis and overall security strategy approaches towards a secure grid. Finally, the topic addresses issues of implementations, discussing new findings on weaknesses in smart grid deployments as well as testing tools.
