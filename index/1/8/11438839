This paper presents a new polyhedra scanning system called CodeGen+ to address the challenge of generating high-performance code for complex iteration spaces resulting from compiler optimization and autotuning systems. The strength of our approach lies in two new algorithms. First, a loop overhead removal algorithm provides precise control of trade-offs between loop overhead and code size based on actual loop nesting depth. Second, an if-statement simplification algorithm further reduces the number of comparisons in the code. These algorithms combined with the expressive power of Presburger arithmetic enable CodeGen+ to support complex optimization strategies expressed in iteration spaces. We compare with the state-of-the-art polyhedra scanning tool CLooG on five loop nest computations, demonstrating that CodeGen+ generates code that is simpler and up to 1.15x faster.
