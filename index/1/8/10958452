In this paper, we propose PriMa (<u>Pri</u>vacy <u>Ma</u>nager), a privacy protection mechanism which supports semi-automated generation of access rules for users' profile information. PriMa access rules are tailored by the users' privacy preferences for their profile data, the sensitivity of the data itself, and the objective risk of disclosing this data to other users. The resulting rules are simple, yet powerful specifications indicating the adequate level of protection for each user, and are dynamically adapted to the ever changing setting of the users' preferences and SN configuration.
