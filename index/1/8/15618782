Information dissemination in wide area networks has recently garnered much attention. Two differing models, publish/subscribe and rendezvous-based multicast atop overlay networks, have emerged as the two leading approaches for this goal. Event-based publish/subscribe supports contentbased services with powerful filtering capabilities, while peer-to-peer rendezvous-based services allow for efficient communication in a dynamic network infrastructure. We describe Reach, a system that integrates these two approaches to provide efficient and scalable content-based services in a dynamic network setting.
