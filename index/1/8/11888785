The textual context of an element, structurally, contains traces of evidences. Utilizing this context in scoring is called contextualization. In this study we hypothesize that the context of an XML-element originated from its \textit{preceding} and \textit{following} elements in the sequential ordering of a document improves the quality of retrieval. In the tree form of the document's structure, \textit{kinship} contextualization means, contextualization based on the horizontal and vertical elements in the \textit{kinship tree,} or elements in closer to a wider structural kinship. We have tested several variants of kinship contextualization and verified notable improvements in comparison with the baseline system and gold standards in the retrieval of focused elements.
