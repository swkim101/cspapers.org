Although advancing technology is making more and more complex systems available to the small-system user, the interface between the user and such systems cannot become correspondingly more complex. Instead, the interface must become easier to use so that more people can take advantage of the richer function. In the small business environment, in particular, it is crucial that new systems be usable by a customer's current staff and not require the addition of new and sophisticated data processing expertise. Personnel costs already comprise 45-50% of most data processing budgets (1).
 Much of the ease-of-use of smaller systems has been due to their limited function. The user has been able to learn to use the system interfaces because each interface involved only a few functions and the interfaces were few in number. Conversely, very large and complex systems have traditionally been programmed and managed by high powered, highly trained staffs with the resources and the sophistication to cope with complex challenges. Here too, however, the high cost and the limited availability of such people increase the need for ease-of-use breakthroughs(5).
