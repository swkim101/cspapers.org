A session-based communication network is a store-and-forward message (or packet) switching network in which each session (conversation from logon until logoff) is assigned to a single communication route (or path) until its termination. Examples of such networks are TYMNET and SNA. A route selection algorithm can be either static or dynamic. A static selection is based on given route selection tables which are usually provided to the system by the system generation process. A dynamic selection uses dynamically changing information of the network for determining an optimal route for the new session to be assigned to.
 This paper develops both static and dynamic route selection algorithms which may be used in a session-based communication network. Route selection algorithms will be classified into several classes depending on the network work-load information available for making decisions. It will be shown that very simple algorithms give good robustness with good response time.
