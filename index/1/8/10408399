In this paper we present AutoBlackTest, a tool for the automatic generation of test cases for interactive applications. AutoBlackTest interacts with the application though its GUI, and uses reinforcement learning techniques to understand the interaction modalities and to generate relevant testing scenarios. Early results show that the tool has the potential of automatically discovering bugs and generating useful system and regression test suites.
