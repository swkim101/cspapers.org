A coding method and apparatus that supports bidirectional scanning is disclosed for sequences of fields of variable length and/or type. Symmetric difference separators of the two immediately adjacent data field types are generated by exclusive-OR addition and utilized as punctuation marks to support bidirectional scanning. Parity checking techniques and hardware are utilized to resolve boundary alignment problems when a separator is in error. An extension of the concept of the invention to hierarchical parenthesized structures permit skipping over subtrees without scanning their contents.
