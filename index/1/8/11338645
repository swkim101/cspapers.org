Previous on-line index maintenance strategies are mainly designed for document insertions without considering document deletions. In a truly dynamic search environment, however, documents may be added to and removed from the collection at any point in time. In this paper, we examine issues of on-line index maintenance with support for instantaneous document deletions and insertions. We present a DBT Merge strategy that can dynamically adjust the sequence of sub-index merge operations during index construction, and offers better query processing performance than previous methods, while providing an equivalent level of index maintenance performance when document insertions and deletions exist in parallel. Using experiments on 426 GB of web data we demonstrate the efficiency of our method in practice, showing that on-line index construction for dynamic text collections can be performed efficiently and almost as fast as for growing text collections.
