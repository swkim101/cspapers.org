An algorithm which allows the robot to avoid moving obstacles and to reach the assigned goal is proposed. For this purpose, a dynamical system (DS) modulation matrix is calculated using the distance from the obstacles and their velocity, without the need of an analytical representation of the obstacles. This matrix modulates a generic first order DS, used to generate the desired path, saving the equilibrium points of the modulated system. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated with numerical simulations and experiments on a 7 DOF KUKA light weight arm.
