We have been trying to induce a quadruped robot to walk with medium walking speed on irregular terrain based on biological concepts. We propose the essential conditions for stable dynamic walking on irregular terrain in general, and we design the mechanical system and the neural system by comparing biological concepts with those essential conditions described in physical terms. PD-controller at joints constructs the virtual spring-damper system as the visco-elasticity model of a muscle. The neural system model consists of a CPG (central pattern generator), reflexes and responses. A CPG generates rhythmic motion for walking. We define a "reflex" as joint torque generation based on sensor information and a "response" as CPG phase modulation through sensory feedback to a CPG. The state of the virtual spring-damper system is switched based on the phase signal of the CPG. CPGs, the motion of the virtual spring-damper system of each leg and the rolling motion of the body are mutually entrained through the rolling motion feedback to CPGs, and can generate adaptive walking. We report our experimental results of dynamic walking on irregular terrain in outdoor environment using a self-contained quadruped robot in order to verify the effectiveness of the designed neuro-mechanical system.
