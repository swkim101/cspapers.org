Video streaming on smartphones is one of the most popular but also most energy hungry services today. Using mobile video services results in two contradictory sources of energy waste for smartphones: i) energy waste because of excessively aggressive prefetching of content that the user will not watch because of abandoning the session, and ii) excessive amount of tail energy, which is energy wasted by keeping the wireless interface powered on after receiving a chunk of content; this is caused by prefetching chunks that are too small. To remedy this, we propose a novel download scheduling algorithm based on crowd-sourced video viewing statistics. Our algorithm judiciously evaluates the probability of a user interrupting a video viewing in order to perform the right amount of prefetching. In this way, the algorithm balances the amount of the two above-mentioned kinds of energy waste. By simulations, we show that our scheduler cuts the energy waste to half compared to existing download strategies. We have also developed an Android prototype that implements the download scheduler together with a novel downloader that speeds up the download by exploiting the Fast Start technique. The prototype exhibits the desired properties of the scheduler, and its faster downloading mechanism yields further energy savings of up to 80% compared to the default Android YouTube app.
