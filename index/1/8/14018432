Achieving timely and comprehensive functional design verifi cation is a ubiquitous problem in electronics. This panel offers p spectives on verification from designers of cardiac pacemake communications satellites, compute servers, networking equ ment, and IP. The panelists will begin by dissecting the bottlenecks in the verification processes. For example, are simulators too slow? Or test vector generation and coverage analysis consume the m time? The panelists will present their ideas for new EDA produc which might accelerate verification. Finally, the panelists will dis cuss what compromises they would accept in order to achieve acceleration. Would they learn a new HDL? Restrict their desi styles? Forsake legacy designs?
