Extracting high-resolution information from highly degraded facial images is an important problem with several applications in science and technology. Here we describe a single frame super resolution technique that uses a transport-based formulation of the problem. The method consists of a training and a testing phase. In the training phase, a nonlinear Lagrangian model of high-resolution facial appearance is constructed fully automatically. In the testing phase, the resolution of a degraded image is enhanced by finding the model parameters that best fit the given low resolution data. We test the approach on two face datasets, namely the extended Yale Face Database B and the AR face datasets, and compare it to state of the art methods. The proposed method outperforms existing solutions in problems related to enhancing images of very low resolution.
