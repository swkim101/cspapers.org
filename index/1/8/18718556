Most current virtual reality (VR) interactions are mediated by hand-held input devices or hand gestures and they usually display only a partial representation of the user in the synthetic environment. We believe, representing the user as a full avatar that is controlled by natural movements of the person in the real world will lead to a greater sense of presence in VR. Possible applications exist in various domains such as entertainment, therapy, travel, real estate, education, social interaction and professional assistance. In this demo, we present MetaSpace, a virtual reality system that allows co-located users to explore a VR world together by walking around in physical space. Each user's body is represented by an avatar that is dynamically controlled by their body movements. We achieve this by tracking each user's body with a Kinect device such that their physical movements are mirrored in the virtual world. Users can see their own avatar and the other person's avatar allowing them to perceive and act intuitively in the virtual environment.
