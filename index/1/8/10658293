This paper presents wiping motion as a task during which the movement and deformation of a deformable object occur simultaneously. During the wiping motion of a deformable object, there is contact, but no relative movement, between the manipulator and the object, while there is both contact and relative movement between the object and the floor during the displacement of the object. We first describe wiping motion and distinguish wiping slide from wiping deformation by displacement of the internal points of an object. In addition, we show that a wiping motion is an extended system of pushing and sliding of rigid objects. As an example of wiping motion, we utilize grasping of a fabric, and we demonstrate the grasping motion of a fabric using a single-armed gripper.
