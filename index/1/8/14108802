This paper studies the effects of training data on binary text classification and postulates that negative training data is not needed and may even be harmful for the task. Traditional binary classification involves building a classifier using labeled positive and negative training examples. The classifier is then applied to classify test instances into positive and negative classes. A fundamental assumption is that the training and test data are identically distributed. However, this assumption may not hold in practice. In this paper, we study a particular problem where the positive data is identically distributed but the negative data may or may not be so. Many practical text classification and retrieval applications fit this model. We argue that in this setting negative training data should not be used, and that PU learning can be employed to solve the problem. Empirical evaluation has been conducted to support our claim. This result is important as it may fundamentally change the current binary classification paradigm.
