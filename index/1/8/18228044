In this paper, we describe WebVideo, a library of simple tools for video browsing and viewing. The library offers a solid basis for developing web applications to view and browse video sequences and slide sets, as well as for distributing videos and images from real-time video sources. Since video transmission is based on a de-facto standard technology, the server-push method, remote users do not need any specific hardware or software in addition to a web browser. The tools offer an adequate support for applications where image quality and simplicity of use are more important than high frame rates and perfect audio synchronization. WebVideo is available in the public domain and has been used for over one year in applications such as distance learning, slides presentations, and Internet TV broadcasting.
