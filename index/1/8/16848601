Directory Systems to support communications networks are currently the subject of serious international standardization efforts. The most recent CCITT and ISO proposals for Directory Systems are summarized, and within this context the requirements for flexible and robust access control mechanisms are examined. The existence of varied access control policies at the international, national and local levels and the need to maintain the integrity of Directory System information are identified as major factors determining access control procedures. Techniques are suggested for access control mechanisms capable of capturing and enforcing the relevant access control semantics at each network site.
