Problem: 
• Routing is a challenge in DTNs (Delay Tolerant Networks). Regular ad- hoc routing protocols fail because the topology suffers from connectivity disruptions. 
Proposition: 
• We propose to use mobility patterns of nodes, i.e. regularities in nodes contacts or movements, to define their position in a virtual Euclidean space used for routing. This space is called the MobySpace. 
• Each node’s position in the MobySpace (its MobyPoint) is flooded throughout the network. Other nodes use this information for routing. 
• To route a bundle, a node chooses among its physical neighbors. It passes the bundle to the neighbor whose MobyPoint is closest to the destination’s. 
• The MobySpace can be defined in many ways, e.g. type/number of dimensions, distance function. This poster describes preliminary work.
