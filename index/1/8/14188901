We present the realization of quick turning motion of a humanoid robot on its toes via slipping between its feet and the floor. A rotation model is described on the basis of our hypothesis that turning via slip occurs as a result of minimizing the power caused by floor friction. Using the model, the trajectory of the center of the foot can be generated to realize the desired rotational angle. Toe joints are used to realize quicker turning motion, while avoiding excessive motor load due to frictional torque. Quick slip-turn motion with toe support is successfully demonstrated using a humanoid robot HRP-4C.
