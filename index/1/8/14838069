A fundamental issue with current truth discovery methods is that they generally assume only one true value for each object, while in reality objects may have multiple true values. In this work, we propose a graph-based approach, called SmartMTD, to relax this assumption in truth discovery. SmartMTD models two types of source relations with additional quantification to precisely estimate source reliability and to detect malicious agreement among sources for multi-truth discovery. In particular, two graphs are constructed based on the modeled source relations, which are further used to derive two aspects of source reliability via random walk computation.
