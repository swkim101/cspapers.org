Adaptive robust controller is proposed for read/write head systems for hard disk drives (HDD). This structure can be applied to both track seeking and track following modes, and it makes the mode switching control algorithms proposed in conventional HDD servo system unnecessary. This controller theoretically guarantees a prescribed transient performance and tracking in presence of parametric uncertainties. An improved desired compensation ARC (IDCARC) scheme is then proposed, which has powered by a dynamic adaptive term compared to DCARC. The regressor is calculated using reference trajectory information. This has been done by structural vibration minimized acceleration trajectory control method. Simulation result show that the dynamic adaptation mechanism in IDCARC provide better performance compared to that of ARC, DCARC and the conventional servo system with mode switches control law.
