The recent standardization of WebGL opened new possibilities for graphically-intensive web-based applications. In this paper, we show how we can interactively visualize very large texture datasets (in the order of gigapixels) on arbitrary 3D geometry using WebGL and JavaScript. Our re-sults show that real-time performance can be achieved on current-generation hardware and browsers
