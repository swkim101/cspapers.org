In recent years there has been a proliferation of electronic office products developed under the umbrella label of “office of the future”. The justification for office automation has been the promise of increased office productivity and significant cost-benefits to the user. In most cases these systems have been driven by the rapid evolution of technological advances in the computer industry. As a result, these technologically leading edge solutions often must then search for a set of office problems to solve.
 The present study evolved out of the identification of one such set of office problems. Office communications have increasingly been identified as a major source of inefficiency and frustration.
 The purpose of the present study was to investigate ways of solving the variety of problems associated with the use of the telephone. The telephone has been labelled as probably the most intrusive device on work flow in the office (Bair, Farber, & Uhlig, 1980). Typically office principals, particularly those without a personal secretary, don't have any means of screening themselves from telephone interruptions. Unsuccessful attempts to call someone are another source of inefficiency.
