Mechanical and electrical noise in nanopositioning systems is unavoidable and dictates the maximum positioning resolution. The proper specification of resolution is critical for defining the smallest possible dimensions in a manufacturing processes or the smallest measurable features in an imaging application. This article defines a standard for the reporting of resolution and demonstrates how this parameter can be measured and predicted from frequency domain data.
