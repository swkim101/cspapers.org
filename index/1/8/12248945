While numerous gaits in the horizontal regime (e.g. walking or running) have been defined for legged systems on level ground, no dynamically grounded definitions have been developed for dynamic vertical running. Gaits have clear implications to robotic control strategy, efficiency, and stability. However, while several climbing robotic systems have been described as achieving `running', the question of whether distinct dynamic gaits exist and what classifies these gaits has not been rigorously explored. In this paper, by applying definitions developed in the horizontal regime, we show evidence of three distinct gaits as well as discuss the implications of these gaits on the development of dynamic climbing systems.
