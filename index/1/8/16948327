We present a file organization scheme providing fast access to spatially referenced objects in a data base. The method utilizes a geometric file structure based on extendible cells together with a so-called topological representation of areas. It is shown to have O(1) expected access cost for the "point-in-polygonnetwork-query" in typical situations. The method can be used as a spatial directory to a data base. Performance indicators are reported.
