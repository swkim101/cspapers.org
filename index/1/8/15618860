We propose a PAC-Bayes sample compression approach to kernel methods that can accommodate any bounded similarity function and show that the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is a particular case of a more general class of data-dependent classifiers known as majority votes of sample-compressed classifiers. We provide novel risk bounds for these majority votes and learning algorithms that minimize these bounds.
