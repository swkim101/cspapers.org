The technologies which enabled the World Wide Web (HTML, HTTP, XML) have had an equally dramatic impact within corporate IT. Similarly the Semantic Web and its underlying technologies may have their greatest impact within the enterprise. Specifically, large enterprises struggle with business information being spread across thousands of databases each of which is semantically different. This creates an information quality problem and an environment which cannot support the flexibility required by modern business. The paper describes how semantics may be applied to enterprise data management and presents a case study in which Unicorn Solutions and Intel® worked together to capture the formal semantics of two incompatible systems within Intel’s manufacturing planning. This allowed subtle discrepancies to be surfaced improving information quality and thus operational efficiency.
