Finding out about a topic online involves visiting multiple news sites, encyclopedia entries, video repositories and other resources while discarding irrelevant information. MakeMyPage aims to speed the search process by combining automatic aggregation of information with social media to build persistent web pages with images, videos and links to important information about popular topics. Automatic aggregation provides the initial content of the web pages organized by type: blogs, news, web links, images, video and a main article. Social media provides adequate ranking of this content. MakeMyPage creates a main web page about the topic by selecting a few items from each category,and creates secondary webpages with more resources for each of these categories. Users can vote on the resources they like best and, based on these votes, links are promoted to and within the main web page in the appropriate category. In this paper, we argue that this combination of automatic retrieval and social media results in more relevant content about popular topics when compared to both traditional social media aggregators and automatic content aggregators designed to retrieve highly diversied information.
