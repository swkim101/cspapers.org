We describe a first prototype of an Interactive Storytelling system, whose objective is to allow user intervention within a pre-defined storyline. The system is character-based rather than plot-based, each characterâ€™s role being dynamically computed using HTN planning. The interaction between characters creates various instantiations of the baseline narrative, with which the user can interfere at any time. After introducing the basic AI techniques used in the prototype, we discuss the modalities of user intervention and present an example story produced by the system.
