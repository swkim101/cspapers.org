The retention of old electronic devices is a practice of importance to sustainability and ubicomp. In this research, we aim to understand people's reasons for keeping out-of-use electronic devices. Using the Personal Inventories qualitative method we conducted 17 in-home visits to learn what technologies people keep and explore their relationships with out-of-use technologies. We identify various reasons for keeping devices that build upon existing work on electronics and sustainability.
