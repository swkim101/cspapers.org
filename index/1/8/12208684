An object-oriented framework for composite multimedia is described. In analogy to constructing complex graphics entities from graphics primitives and geometric transformations, composite multimedia is constructed from multimedia primitives and temporal transformations. Active objects based on real-time processes are proposed as multimedia primitives. Their combination to form composite multimedia and the requisite temporal transformations are illustrated.
