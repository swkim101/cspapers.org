This paper introduces an optical based three axis force sensor which can be integrated with the robot arm of the EU project STIFF-FLOP (STIFFness controllable Flexible and Learnable Manipulator for Surgical Operations) in order to measure applied external forces. The structure of the STIFF-FLOP arm is free of metal components and electric circuits and, hence, is inherently safe near patients during surgical operations. In addition, this feature makes the performance of this sensing system immune against strong magnetic fields inside magnetic resonance (MR) imaging scanners. The hollow structure of the sensor allows the implementation of distributed actuation and sensing along the body of the manipulator. In this paper, we describe the design and calibration procedure of the proposed three axis optics-based force sensor. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our optical sensing approach and its applicability to determine the force and momentum components during the physical interaction of the robot arm with its environment.
