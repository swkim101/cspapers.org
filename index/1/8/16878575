In this paper, we present a novel semisupervised regression algorithm working on multiclass data that may lie on multiple manifolds. Unlike conventional manifold regression algorithms that do not consider the class distinction of samples, our method introduces the class information to the regression process and tries to exploit the similar configurations shared by the label distribution of multi-class data. To utilize the correlations among data from different classes, we develop a cross-manifold label propagation process and employ labels from different classes to enhance the regression performance. The interclass relations are coded by a set of intermanifold graphs and a regularization item is introduced to impose inter-class smoothness on the possible solutions. In addition, the algorithm is further extended with the kernel trick for predicting labels of the out-of-sample data even without class information. Experiments on both synthesized data and real world problems validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for semisupervised regression.
