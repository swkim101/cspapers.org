We present an information-theoretic approach for estimating the informativeness of an object's local geometry with respect to orientation estimation. Identifying the regions and viewing directions which show the most unambiguous local features is of interest for long-term autonomy as it enables to actively plan to observe these features as well as to actively select image frames out of passively acquired image streams.
