To accomplish high mobility and working performance, an active ankle mechanism with multi-degrees of freedom is required for multi-legged walking vehicle. In this paper, a novel active ankle mechanism with 2 degrees of freedom is proposed. This mechanism has large workspace, high mechanical strength and coupled driving system.
