A large category model base can provide object-level knowledge for various perception tasks of the intelligent vehicle system. The automatic and efficient construction of such a model base is highly desirable but challenging. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised approach to discover possible prototype models of 3D object structures from the point cloud of a large and complex environment, given a limited number of seeds in an object category. Our method incrementally trains the models while simultaneously collecting object samples. Considering the bias problem of model learning caused by bias accumulation in a sample collection, we propose to gradually differentiate the standard category model into several sub-category models to represent different intra-category structural styles. Thus, new sub-categories are discovered and modeled, old models are improved, and redundant models for similar structures are deleted iteratively during the learning process. This multiple-model strategy provides several interactive options for the category boundary to deal with the bias problem. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and high efficiency of our approach to model mining from “big point cloud data”.
