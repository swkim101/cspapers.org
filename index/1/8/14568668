Through-silicon vias (TSVs) are required for transmitting signals among different dies for the three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) technology. The significant silicon areas occupied by TSVs bring critical challenges for 3D IC placement. Unlike most published 3D placement works that only minimize the number of TSVs during placement due to the limitations in their techniques, this paper proposes a new 3D cell placement algorithm which can additionally consider the sizes of TSVs and the physical positions for TSV insertion during placement. The algorithm consists of three stages: (1) 3D analytical global placement with density optimization and whitespace reservation for TSVs, (2) TSV insertion and TSV-aware legalization, and (3) layer-by-layer detailed placement. In particular, the global placement is based on a novel weighted-average wirelength model, giving the first model in the literature that can outperform the well-known log-sum-exp wirelength model theoretically and empirically. Further, 3D routing can easily be accomplished by traditional 2D routers since the physical positions of TSVs are determined during placement. Compared with state-of-the-art 3D cell placement works, our algorithm can achieve the best routed wirelength, TSV counts, and total silicon area, in shortest running time.
