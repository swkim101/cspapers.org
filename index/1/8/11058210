Research in sensor networks has begun to address the use of mobility to improve the reachability of the network, but a number of network principles and application patterns remain to be explored in this context. We propose here a network architecture that uses energy constrained devices for enabling new campus wide applications. Specifically, our demonstration illustrates a new network stack and application framework for a class of locality specific applications. The locality specific nature favors exploiting the limited, slow and regional mobility pattern present in large campuses, as opposed to exclusively exploiting the Internet or the cellular network.
