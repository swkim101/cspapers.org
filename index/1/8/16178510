This poster presents an innovative dual-mode medium access control scheme that combines the ultra low power MAC protocol WiseMAC with the wireless sensor networking standard IEEE 802.15.4. Each network device can independently and autonomously switch between the two modes depending on its residual energy resources and the current application traffic. We observe that this approach can reduce the power consumption and the average latency by almost two orders of magnitude.
