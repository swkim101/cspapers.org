The logic simulator MOSSIM is designed specifically to serve the needs of the MOS LSI designer. It models a MOS circuit as a network of field-effect transistor "switches", with node states 0, 1, and X (unknown) and transistor states "open", "closed", and "unknown". MOSSIM has proved quite versatile and accurate in simulating a variety of MOS designs including ones for which the network was extracted automatically from the mask specifications. Because it models the network at a logical level, it has a performance comparable to conventional logic gate simulators.
