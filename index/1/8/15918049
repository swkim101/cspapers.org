In this paper, we study how users interact with a search assistance tool while completing tasks of varying complexity. We designed a novel tool referred to as the search guide (SG) that displays the search trails (queries issued, results clicked, pages bookmarked) from three previous users who completed the task. We report on a laboratory study with 48 participants that investigates different factors that may influence user interaction with the SG and the effects of the SG on different outcome measures. Participants were asked to find and bookmark pages for four tasks of varying complexity and the SG was made available to half the participants. We collected log data and conducted retrospective stimulated recall interviews to learn about participants' use of the SG. Our results suggest the following trends. First, interaction with the SG was greater for more complex tasks. Second, the a priori determinability of the task (i.e., whether the task was perceived to be well-defined) helped predict whether participants gained a bookmark from the SG. Third, participants who interacted with the SG, but did not gain a bookmark, felt less system support than those who gained a bookmark and those who did not interact. Finally, a qualitative analysis of our interviews suggests differences in motivation and benefits from SG use for different levels of task complexity. Our findings extend prior research on search assistance tools and provide insights for the design of systems to help users with complex search tasks.
