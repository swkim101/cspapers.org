Consider the problem of processing shape information derived from a noisy source such as a digital scanner. The object is to construct a polygon or a closed curve that matches the input polygon to within a fixed error tolerance and maximizes some intuitive notion of “smoothness and simplicity”. Part of this goal should be to minimize the number of inflections. The algorithm presented here finds an inflectionminimizing polygonal approximation and produces a data structure that characterizes a set of closed curves that fall within the error tolerance and minimize the number of inflections. The algorithm runs in linear time, is reasonably fast in practice, and can be implemented in low-precision integer arithmetic.
