CP-PACS (Computational Physics by Parallel Array Computer System) is a massively parallel processor with 2048 processing units built at Center for Computational Physics, University of Tsukuba. It has an MIMD architecture with distributed memory system. The node processor of CPPACS is a RISC microprocessor enhanced by Pseudo Vector Processing feature, which can realize high-performance vector processing. The interconnection network is 3-dimensional Hyper-Crossbar Network, which has high exibility and embeddability for various network topologies and communication patterns. The theoretical peak performance of whole system is 614.4 GFLOPS. In this paper, we describe the overview of CP-PACS architecture and several special architectural characteristics of it. Then, several performance evaluations both for single node processor and for parallel system are described based on LINPACK and Kernel CG of NAS Parallel Benchmarks. Through these evaluations, the e ectiveness of Pseudo Vector Processing and Hyper-Crossbar Network is shown.
