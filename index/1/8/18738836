Due to the fast query speed and low storage cost, hashing based approximate nearest neighbor search methods have attracted much attention recently. Many state of the art methods are based on eigenvalue decomposition. In these approaches, the information caught in different dimensions is unbalanced and generally most of the information is contained in the top eigenvectors. We demonstrate that this leads to an unexpected phenomenon that longer hashing code does not necessarily yield better performance. In this work, we introduce a random subspace strategy to address this limitation. At first, a small fraction of the whole feature space is randomly sampled to train the hashing algorithms each time and only the top eigenvectors are kept to generate one piece of short code. This process will be repeated several times and then the obtained many pieces of short codes are concatenated into one piece of long code. Theoretical analysis and experiments on two benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for hashing.
