We propose an information extraction system that is designed for mobile devices with low hardware resources. The proposed system extracts temporal instances (dates and times) and named instances (locations and topics) from Korean short messages in an appointment management domain. To efficiently extract temporal instances with limited numbers of surface forms, the proposed system uses wellrefined finite state automata. To effectively extract various surface forms of named instances with low hardware resources, the proposed system uses a modified HMM based on syllable n-grams. In the experiment on instance boundary labeling, the proposed system showed better performances than traditional classifiers.
