We combine simple retrieval with domain-specific validation of retrieved cases to produce a useful practical tool for case-based reasoning. Based on 200 real-world cases, we retrieve between three and six cases over a wide range of new problems. This represents a selectivity ranging from 1.5% to 3%, compared to an average selectivity of only 11% from simple retrieval alone.
