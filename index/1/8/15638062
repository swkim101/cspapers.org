The proposal of Elisa Marengo's thesis is to extend commitment protocols in order to (i) allow for expressing commitments to temporal regulations, and (ii) to supply a tool for expressing laws, conventions and the like, in order to specify legal interactions. These two aspects will be deeply investigated in the proposal of a unified framework. This proposal is part of ongoing work that will be included in the thesis.
