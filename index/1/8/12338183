This paper addresses the problem of learning long binary codes from high-dimensional data. We observe that two key challenges arise while learning and using long binary codes: (1) lack of an effective regularizer for the learned high-dimensional mapping and (2) high computational cost for computing long codes. In this paper, we overcome both these problems by introducing a sparsity encouraging regularizer that reduces the effective number of parameters involved in the learned projection operator. This regularizer not only reduces overfitting but, due to the sparse nature of the projection matrix, also leads to a dramatic reduction in the computational cost. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze its performance on the problems of nearest neighbour search, image retrieval and image classification. Experiments on a number of challenging datasets show that our method leads to better accuracy than dense projections (ITQ [11] and LSH [16]) with the same code lengths, and meanwhile is over an order of magnitude faster. Furthermore, our method is also more accurate and faster than other recently proposed methods for speeding up high-dimensional binary encoding.
