This paper introduces a multidimensional semantic framework for adaptive systems. Different planes allow us to represent ontologies of user, her actions, context, device, domain, while the intersection between planes allow us to represent the semantic rules for inferring new user features or adaptation strategies. The adoption of ontology-based framework aims at creating a server for user modeling and adaptation strategy.
