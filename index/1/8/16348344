The problem of deciding whether a full join dependency (JD) ⋈ [<italic>R</italic>] and a set of functional dependencies (FDs) <italic>F</italic> imply an embedded join dependency (EJD) ⋈ [<italic>S</italic>] is known to be NP-complete. We show that the problem can be decided in polynomial time if <italic>S</italic> ⊆ <italic>R</italic> and <italic>F</italic> is embedded in <italic>R</italic>. Our work uses arguments based on an extension of complete intersection graphs rather than tableaus. This approach has facilitated our results and should prove useful for future research.
