In this paper, we introduce a dictionary learning framework using RGB-D covariance descriptors on point cloud data for performing object classification. Dictionary learning in combination with RGB-D covariance descriptors provides a compact and flexible description of point cloud data. Furthermore, the proposed framework is ideal for updating and sharing dictionaries among robots in a decentralized or cloud network. This work demonstrates the increased performance of 3D object classification utilizing covariance descriptors and dictionary learning over previous results with experiments performed on a publicly available RGB-D database.
