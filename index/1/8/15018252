This paper introduces hierarchical quasi-clustering methods, a generalization of hierarchical clustering for asymmetric networks where the output structure preserves the asymmetry of the input data. We show that this output structure is equivalent to a finite quasi-ultrametric space and study admissibility with respect to two desirable properties. We prove that a modified version of single linkage is the only admissible quasi-clustering method. Moreover, we show stability of the proposed method and we establish invariance properties fulfilled by it. Algorithms are further developed and the value of quasi-clustering analysis is illustrated with a study of internal migration within United States.
