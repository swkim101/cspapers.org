We often think of ourselves as individuals with steady capabilities. However, converging strands of research indicate that this is not the case. Our biochemistry varies significantly over the course of a 24 hour period. Consequently our levels of alertness, productivity, physical activity, and even sensitivity to pain fluctuate throughout the day. This offers a considerable opportunity for the UbiComp community to identify novel measurements and interventions that can leverage these daily variations. To illustrate this potential, we present results from an empirical study with 9 participants over 97 days investigating whether such variations manifest in low-level smartphone use, focusing on daily rhythms related to sleep. Our findings demonstrate that phone usage patterns can be used to detect and predict individual daily variations indicative of temporal preference, sleep duration, and deprivation. We also identify opportunities and challenges for measuring and enhancing well-being using these simple and effective markers of circadian rhythms.
