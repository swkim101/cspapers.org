Technological advances in miniaturisation and communication are enabling revolutionary transformations: computation can be embedded in almost any object and the increasing bandwidth and ubiquity of communication networks connects objects and frees them spatially. However, the ambitions for ubiquitous computing typically go further. For example 'ambient intelligence' aims to provide users with a constant serviced cocoon that envelopes them in appropriate information, communication and services, protecting, enabling and empowering them wherever they are. We share some of these visions, but argue that profound difficulties stand in their way: Far from simplifying computing, ubiquity risks making it much more complex and confusing, e.g. by obscuring the relation between action and reaction. In this keynote we will discuss some of the challenges in realizing the promises of pervasive technologies and present ideas for the design of technology that supports learning, exploration and continued development. To this end people need to be able to grasp, both physically and conceptually, what technologies are doing and could do for them. We have termed this 'palpable computing'.
