Humans can communicate with each other by gestures. This paper presents a robot system with such capability. The robot detects its user by recognizing his/her face. It can accept his/her commands given by gestures. The user may use unknown gestures to the robot. If the robot does not respond to his/her gesture, the user usually iterates the same gesture. The robot detects this repetitive pattern as an intentional gesture by which the user wants to give it some order. Then it shows a little action according to the meaning of the gesture that the robot guesses. It observes the user's reaction to its action. If he/she continues the same pattern gesture, the robot considers that its understanding is right, completing the action. It also registers the pattern as a gesture of the guessed meaning. Otherwise, it iterates the same procedure by taking another action as a candidate of the meaning. We have implemented such interactive capability on our intelligent wheelchair.
