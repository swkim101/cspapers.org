This study describes the theoretical and practical aspects of the design and computer simulation of a heuristic based navigation algorithm. An algorithm is developed which provides a convenient testing system for generalized navigation strategies on a fixed map which may be known or unknown to a system. A variety of maps are simulated and the navigation results are compared.
