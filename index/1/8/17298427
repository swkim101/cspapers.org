A beautiful and well-laid out Web page greatly facilitates users' accessing and enhances browsing experiences. We use "visual quality (VQ)" to denote the aesthetics of Web pages. In this paper, a computational aesthetics approach is proposed to learn the evaluation model for the visual quality of Web pages. First, a Web page layout extraction algorithm (V-LBE) is introduced to partition a Web page into major layout blocks. Then, regarding a Web page as a semi-structured image, features known to significantly affect the visual quality of a Web page are extracted to construct a feature vector. The experimental results show the initial success of our approach. Potential applications include Web search and Web design.
