There have been many multistage interconnection networks proposed in the literature for interconnecting the processors that comprise large parallel processing systems. In this paper, the use of a multistage network in the MIMD mode of operation is considered. A tag based routing scheme is proposed for the Augmented Data Manipulator network. Also included is a rerouting scheme that allows a message blocked by a busy link in its present path to dynamically make use of a non-busy link and continue, when possible. Finally, a tag based broadcasting scheme is introduced that allows one processor to send messages to a power of two other processors.
