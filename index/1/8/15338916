In this paper, we will describe ODIE, the On-Demand Information Extraction system. Given a user's query, the system will produce tables of the salient information about the topic in structured form. It produces the tables in less than one minute without any knowledge engineering by hand, i.e. pattern creation or paraphrase knowledge creation, which was the largest obstacle in traditional IE. This demonstration is based on the idea and technologies reported in (Sekine 06). A substantial speed-up over the previous system (which required about 15 minutes to analyze one year of newspaper) was achieved through a new approach to handling pattern candidates; now less than one minute is required when using 11 years of newspaper corpus. In addition, functionality was added to facilitate investigation of the extracted information.
