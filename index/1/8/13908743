Programming by demonstration is an attractive model for allowing both experts and non-experts to command robots' actions. In this work, we contribute an approach for learning precise reaching trajectories for robotic manipulators. We use dimensionality reduction to smooth the example trajectories and transform their representation to a space more amenable to planning. Key to this approach is the careful selection of neighboring points within and between trajectories. This algorithm is capable of creating efficient, collision-free plans even under typical real-world training conditions such as incomplete sensor coverage and lack of an environment model, without imposing additional requirements upon the user such as constraining the types of example trajectories provided. Experimental results are presented to validate this approach.
