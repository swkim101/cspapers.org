A short account is given of various investigations of neural network properties, beginning with the classic work of McCulloch & Pitts. Early work on neurodynamics and statistical mechanics, analogies with magnetic materials, fault tolerance via parallel distributed processing, memory, learning, and pattern recognition, is described.
