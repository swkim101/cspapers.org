Large-scale web search engines need to crawl the Web continuously to discover and download newly created web content. The speed at which the new content is discovered and the quality of the discovered content can have a big impact on the coverage and quality of the results provided by the search engine. In this paper, we propose a search-centric solution to the problem of prioritizing the pages in the frontier of a crawler for download. Our approach essentially orders the web pages in the frontier through a random walk model that takes into account the pages' potential impact on user-perceived search quality. In addition, we propose a link graph enrichment technique that extends this solution. Finally, we explore a machine learning approach that combines different frontier prioritization approaches. We conduct experiments using two very large, real-life web datasets to observe various search quality metrics. Comparisons with several baseline techniques indicate that the proposed approaches have the potential to improve the user-perceived quality of web search results considerably.
