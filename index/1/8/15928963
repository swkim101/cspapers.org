The authors analyze the feasibility of the finger tracking paradigm for multi-finger manipulation introduced by D. Rus (1992) and relate it to task-directed programming issues. By using the geometry of singularities that arise in solving the instantaneous motion problem they are able to characterize regions of feasibility associated with an initial grasp and quantify how much reorientation is possible starting from this grasp. This results in a provably correct global strategy for reorientation.
