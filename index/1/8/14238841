Understanding the intent underlying user's queries may help personalize search results and therefore improve user satisfaction. We develop a methodology for using the content of search engine result pages (SERPs) along with the information obtained from query strings to study characteristics of query intent, with a particular focus on sponsored search. This work represents an initial step towards the development and evaluation of an ontology for commercial search, considering queries that reference specific products, brands and retailers. The characteristics of query categories are studied with respect to aggregated user's clickthrough behavior on advertising links. We present a model for clickthrough behavior that considers the influence of such factors as the location of ads and the rank of ads, along with query category. We evaluate our work using a large corpus of clickthrough data obtained from a major commercial search engine. Our findings suggest that query based features, along with the content of SERPs, are effective in detecting query intent. The clickthrough behavior is found to be consistent with the classification for the general categories of query intent, while for product, brand and retailer categories, all is true to a lesser extent.
