This paper examines daydreaming: spontaneously recalling or imagining personal or vicarious experiences in the past or future. The following functions of daydreaming, for both humans and computers, are discussed: support for processes of creativity, future planning and rehearsal, learning from successes and failures, emotion modification, and motivation. A computational theory of daydreaming is being implemented and tested in a computer program called DAYDREAMER. A prototype version of DAYDREAMER which produces several daydreams (in English) is currently running.
