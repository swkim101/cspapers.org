This paper will describe current and ongoing developments of wireless-connected RFID reader systems for evaluation of a passive user localization system. A two-tier architecture of different wireless-connected RFID readers will be introduced. On the lower level, i.e. the first tier, several wireless technologies can co-exist using different kinds of communication technologies to connect different RFID readers. These technologies are connected through a fully meshed WiFi/WLAN network to bring them into the IP world. This IP infrastructure is the second tier, built up on IEEE 802.11.
