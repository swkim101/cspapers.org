Wearable devices and mobile devices have great potential to detect various body motions as they are attached to different body parts. We present M-Gesture, a geometric gesture authoring framework using multiple wearable devices. We implemented physical metaphor, geometric gesture language, and continuity in spatial layout for easy and clear gesture authoring. M-Gesture demonstrates the use of geometric notation as an intuitive gesture language.
