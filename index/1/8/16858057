We introduce a language-independent strategy for inducing part of speech tags from corpora. Unlike other techniques that use language-specific lexicons, rulesets, and so forth to tag, our algorithm bootstraps only from cluster properties and language universals. We describe the theory and illustrate an introductory experiment which verifies the feasibility of this nearknowledge-free tag induction strategy. We induce tags for perfect syntactic clusters generated from the Brown corpus getting 77% of our hypotheses correct.
