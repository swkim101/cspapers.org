Autonomous robots in dynamic and unstructured environments require high performance, energy efficient and reliable actuators. In this paper we give an overview of the first results of two lines of research regarding the novel actuation principle we introduced: Series-Parallel Elastic Actuation (SPEA). Firstly, we introduce the SPEA concept and present first prototypes and results. Secondly, we discuss the potential of self-healing materials in robotics, and discuss the results on the first self-healing pneumatic cell and selfhealing mechanical fuse. Both concepts have the potential to improve performance, energy efficiency and reliability.
