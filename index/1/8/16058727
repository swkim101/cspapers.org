This paper addresses the problem of building expert interfaces to information retrieval systems. In particular, the problem of augmenting the capabilities of such interfaces with user modeling features is discussed and the main benefits of this approach are outlined. The paper presents a prototype system called IR-NLI II, devoted to model by means of artificial intelligence techniques the human intermediary to information retrieval systems. The overall organization of the IR-NLI II system is presented, together with a short description of the two main modules implemented so far, namely the Information Retrieval Expert Subsystem and the User Modeling Subsystem. An example of interaction with IR-NLI II is described. Perspectives and future research directions are finally outlined.
