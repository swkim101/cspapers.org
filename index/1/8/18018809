Since linear resolution with clause ordering is incomplete for consequence-finding, it has been used mainly for proof-finding. In this paper, we re-evaluate consequence-finding. Firstly, consequence-finding is generalized to the problem in which only interesting clauses having a certain property (called characteristic clauses) should be found. Then, we show how adding a skip rule to ordered linear resolution makes it complete for consequence-finding in this general sense. Compared with set-of-support resolution, the proposed method generates fewer clauses to find such a subset of consequences. In the propositional case, this is an elegant tool for computing the prime implicants/implicates. The importance of the results lies in their applicability to a wide class of AI problems including procedures for nonmonotonic and abductive reasoning and truth maintenance systems.
