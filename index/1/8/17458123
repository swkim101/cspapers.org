Differences in computer science and business information systems academic programs would seem to justify assumptions about psychological differences in students enrolled in them. In the interest of testing these assumptions, samples from the two populations were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to test for attitudes and motivations about computers. Analysis of questionnaire responses suggests that some of the initial assumptions are warranted while others are not. In addition, the analysis hints at general psychological profiles that may prove useful in understanding and predicting the programming performance of computer students.
