Motivated by the "beyond 3g" vision of radio access network integration and coordinated radio resource management, a purely analytical performance assessment is presented for a single access point integrating multiple radio accesses. Principal focus is placed on the evaluation of multi-user diversity, multi-access diversity and trunking gains. Scenarios with persistent and non-persistent data flows are investigated, concentrating on throughput and transfer time performance, respectively. A number of numerical experiments are included in order to quantify the relative contribution of the distinguished aspects to the performance gain. These experiments indicate that the exploitation of multi-user diversity with a channel-aware access selection scheme attains the most significant gains, while also the trunking gain that is due to an above-proportional performance enhancement when aggregating system-specific capacities, is noted to be significant. The assignment of multiple accesses to a given flow is demonstrated to have limited potential.
