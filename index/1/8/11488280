Is there such a thing anymore as a software system that doesnâ€™t need to be secure? Almost every softwarecontrolled system faces threats from potential adversaries, from Internet-aware client applications running on PCs, to complex telecommunications and power systems accessible over the Internet, to commodity software with copy protection mechanisms. Software engineers must be cognizant of these threats and engineer systems with credible defenses, while still delivering value to customers. In this paper, we present our perspectives on the research issues that arise in the interactions between software engineering and security.
