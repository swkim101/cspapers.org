A crucial objective in battery operated embedded systems is to work under the minimal power consumption that provides a desired level of performance. Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) and Dynamic. Power Management (DPM) are typical techniques used on processors and devices to reduce the power consumption through speed variations and power switching, respectively. The effectivenes of both DVS and DPM needs to be considered in the development of a power management policy for a system that consists of both DVS-enabled and DPM-enabled components.
 This paper explores how to efficiently reduce the power consumption of real-time applications with constrained resources, like energy, CPU, and transmission bandwidth. A combined DVS-DP approach with a reduced complexity is proposed to make use of online strategies for embedded systems. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
