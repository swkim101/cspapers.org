In this paper, a new method proposed for finding and extracting the SRRs. The method first detects content dense nodes on HTML DOM and then extracts SRRs to suggest a list of candidate HTML DOM nodes for a given single research result Web page instance. Afterwards an evaluation algorithm has been applied to the candidate list to find the best solution without any human interaction and manual process. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are successful for finding and extracting the SRRs.
