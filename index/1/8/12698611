Recently, there is a large demand by many scientific applications for managing, querying and reasoning ontology concepts and instances. We demonstrate OntoQuest, a system that provides powerful yet easy-to-use query and reasoning utilities by which the ontological data exploration experience is made easy. Even without any knowledge of ontology query languages, one can easily get a hands-on ontological data exploration experience using OntoQuest. The method is to categorize commonly asked queries based on their usage contexts so to prompt the user with context-aware guidance throughout the exploration process. OntoQuest is also designed to offer extended mapping schemes for storing OWL ontologies into back-end databases. Most existing ontology storage systems support mappings only for RDF data. Lastly, OntoQuest supports bulk insertion and updating of instances.In this demonstration, we show how OntoQuest guides a user through the inquiry (querying and reasoning) process and also have a peek at the underlying handling of storing, querying, reasoning, and interacting with the user.
