We establish tight bounds on the intrinsic cost (either minimizing delay d for fixed server and receiver bandwidths, or minimizing server bandwidth for fixed delay and receiver bandwidth) of broadcasting a movie of length m over a channel of bandwidth S in such a way that a receiver (with bandwidth R), starting at an arbitrary time t, can download the movie so that it can begin playback after a delay of at most d time units.Our bounds are realized by a simple abstract protocol that partitions the movie into a fixed number of segments, partitions the server bandwidth into an equivalent number of equal bandwidth subchannels, and broadcasts each segment repeatedly on its flown subchannel. This protocol can be implemented as a concrete discrete protocol in which movie information is packaged into discrete fixed length packets using only a modest overhead (measured in terms of increased delay or server bandwidth).Our primary contribution is a lower bound on the required delay that applies in a very general model of communication. This lower bound matches the behaviour of our abstract protocol in the limit as the number of segments approaches infinity. We are also able to relate its behaviour to arbitrary protocols that have a fixed number of segments.
