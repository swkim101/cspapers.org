A distributed algorithm for the detection of deadlocks in store-and-forward communication networks is presented. At first, we focus on a static environment and develop an efficient knot detection algorithm for general graphs. The knot detection algorithm uses at most &Ogr;(n2 + m) messages and &Ogr;(log(n)) bits of memory to detect all deadlocked nodes in the static network. Using the knot detection algorithm as a building block, a deadlock detection algorithm in a dynamic environment is developed. This algorithm has the following properties: It detects all the nodes which cause the deadlock. The algorithm is triggered only when there is a potential for deadlock and only those nodes which are potentially deadlocked perform the algorithm. The algorithm does not affect other processes at the nodes.
