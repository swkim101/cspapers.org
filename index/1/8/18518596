This paper describes an application of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to crop allocation for generating realistic landscapes. The aim is to cover optimally a bare landscape, represented by its plot graph, with spatial patterns describing local arrangements of crops. This problem belongs to the hard class of graph packing problems and is modeled in the framework of ASP. The approach provides a compact solution to the basic problem and at the same time allows extensions such as a flexible integration of expert knowledge. Particular attention is paid to the treatment of symmetries, especially due to sub-graph isomorphism issues. Experiments were conducted on a database of simulated and real landscapes. Currently, the approach can process graphs of medium size, a size that enables studies on real agricultural practices.
