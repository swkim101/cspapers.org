Previous work in mixture model clustering has focused primarily on the issue of model selection. Model scoring functions (including penalized likelihood and Bayesian approximations) can guide a search of the model parameter and structure space. Relatively little research has addressed the issue of how to move through this space. Local optimization techniques, such as expectation maxi-mization, solve only part of the problem; we still need to move between diierent local op-tima. The traditional approach, restarting the search from diierent random conngura-tions, is ineecient. We describe a more directed and controlled way of moving between local maxima. Using multi-resolution kd-trees for fast density estimation, we search by modifying models within regions where they fail to predict the datapoint density. We compare this algorithm with a canonical clustering method, nding favorable results on a variety of large, low-dimensional datasets.
