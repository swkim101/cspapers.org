3D DRAM is the next-generation memory system targeting high bandwidth, low power, and small form factor. This paper presents a cross-domain CAD/architectural platform that addresses DC power noise issues in 3D DRAM targeting stacked DDR3, Wide I/O, and hybrid memory cube technologies. Our design and analysis include both individual DRAM dies and a host logic die that communicates with them in the same stack. Moreover, our comprehensive solutions encompass all major factors in design, packaging, and architecture domains, including power delivery network wire sizing, redistribution layer routing, distributed, and dedicated TSV placement, die bonding style, backside wire bonding, and read policy optimization. We conduct regression analysis and optimization to obtain high quality solutions under noise, cost, and performance tradeoff. Compared with industry standard baseline designs and policies, our methods achieve up to 68.2% IR-drop reduction and 30.6% performance enhancement.
