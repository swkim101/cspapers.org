The issue of deadline tardiness is considered under earliest-deadline-first (GEDF) multiprocessor scheduling. New schedulability tests are presented for determining whether a set of sporadic tasks with arbitrary relative deadlines can be scheduled under either preemptive or non-preemptive GEDF so that pre-defined tardiness bounds are met. These tests are of pseudo-polynomial time complexity, and can be used in hard real-time, soft real-time, and mixed contexts.
