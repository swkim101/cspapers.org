For the past two years, this panel examined design automation as professionals evaluating our own profession. With tongue only slightly in cheek, we discussed “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Implementation” in 1978, and “Adapting to the Joys of Madness” in 1979. Both sessions were hard-hitting self appraisals of the way we do business. This year we elected to include a new element in “The Real World of Design Automation”: THE USER. Too frequently, we become blinded by the brilliance of our own creation. We fail to recognize the reason for our existance. The user is, after all, the bottom line in Design Automation. Our future depends on his successor failure.
