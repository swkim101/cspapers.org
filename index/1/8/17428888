Secure key distribution is a critical component in secure communications. Finding 'proven secure' practical key distribution systems is one of the major goals in cryptography. The Diffie-Hellman variants, a family of key distribution systems, achieve some of the objectives of this goal. In particular, the 'non-paradoxical' system (by Matsumoto-Takashima-Imai and Yacobi) is claimed to be secure against a known-key attack. In this paper we show that the argument used to prove this is flawed, and we explain how it can be fixed.
