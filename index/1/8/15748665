We consider blog feed search: identifying relevant blogs for a given topic. An individual's search behavior often involves a combination of exploratory behavior triggered by salient features of the information objects being examined plus goal-directed in-depth information seeking behavior. We present a two-stage blog feed search model that directly builds on this insight. We first rank blog posts for a given topic, and use their parent blogs as selection of blogs that we rank using a blog-based model.
