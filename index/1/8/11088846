Pascal, the core language for over a decade in most Computer Science programs, is beginning to show its age. Its widespread adoption began at a time when faculty wanted to introduce structured programming techniques to beginning students. Pascalâ€™s simplicity and enforcement of the principles of structured programming quickly led to its becoming the predominant language for the first course (CS 1). While suitable for teaching structured programming in the introductory course, standard Pascal is not the best choice for teaching data abstraction, the implementation of object-oriented designs, or team progr amming. Thus, many schools are now experimenting with using a second language like Ada or C++ in the second course (CS2). However, most of us have found that using different languages in CS 1 and CS2 dc)es not work well. Because our students are struggling with both syntactic and semantic problems, many of them experience great difficulties in learning two languages during their first year of study. A solution to this problem adopted at an increasing number of schools is to use A& in both courses.
