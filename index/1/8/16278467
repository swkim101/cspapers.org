Document summarization has become a hot topic in recent years. However, most of existing summarization methods work on a batch of documents and do not consider that documents may arrive in a sequence and the corresponding summaries need to be updated in real time. In this paper, we propose a new summarization method based on an incremental hierarchical clustering framework to update summaries as soon as a new document arrives. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.
