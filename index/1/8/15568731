The highly dynamic nature of domain ontologies has a direct impact on semantic mappings established between concepts from different ontologies. Mappings must therefore be maintained according to ongoing ontology changes. Since many software applications exploit mappings for managing information and knowledge, it is important to define appropriate adaptation strategies to apply to existing mappings in order to keep their validity over time. In this article, we propose a set of mapping adaptation actions and present how they are used to maintain mappings up-to-date based on ontology change operations of different nature. We conduct an experimental evaluation using life sciences ontologies and mappings. We measure the evolution of mappings based on the proposed approach to mapping adaptation. The results confirm that mappings must be individually adapted according to the different types of ontology change.
