We consider fundamental data manipulation operations such as broadcasting, prefix sum, data sum, data shift, data accumulation, consecutive sum, adjacent sum, sorting, and random access reads and writes, and show how these may be performed on the distributed memory bus computer (DMBC). The DMBC algorithms are generally simpler than corresponding algorithms of the same time complexity developed for other reconfigurable bus computers.
