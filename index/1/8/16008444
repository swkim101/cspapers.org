The rapid spread of mobile internet and location-acquisition technologies have led to the increasing popularity of Location-Based Social Networks(LBSNs). Users in LBSNs can share their life by checking in at various venues at any time. In LBSNs, identifying home locations of users is significant for effective location-based services like personalized search, targeted advertisement, local recommendation and so on. In this paper, we propose a Home Location Global Positioning System called HLGPS to tackle with the home location identification problem in LBSNs. Firstly, HLGPS uses an influence model named as IME to model edges in LBSNs. Then HLGPS uses a global iteration algorithm based on IME model to position home location of users so that the joint probability of generating all the edges in LBSNs is maximum. Extensive experiments on a large real-world LBSN dataset demonstrate that HLGPS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 14.7%.
