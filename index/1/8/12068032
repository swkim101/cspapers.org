Most CAD research to date has focused on a narrow class of topics - design rule checking, placement and routing, simulation, etc. This research has lead to high-quality tools for a limited set of tasks. Other steps in the design of a major electronic system, such as exploring alternate architectures, managing multiple representations of a constantly changing design, and maintaining project time schedules remain largely unsupported by today's CAD systems. These tasks remain labor-intensive, tedious, and error prone. This panel brings together experienced system designers to hear their views on what tasks require better support, and what kinds of tools might assist these tasks. It is hoped that this panel will provide inspiration for new research areas in CAD.
