The first year of computer science instruction typically consists of a two-course sequence in which students are taught (1) programming in some high level language and (2) an introduction to algorithms and data structures. Our first two courses introduce in addition (3) methods for deriving algorithms and verifying their correctness. These methods provide a central theme for the curriculum and a unified approach to the traditional topics.
