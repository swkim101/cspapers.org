In this paper, we generalize our random matrix based (RM-based) uncertainty model for manipulator Jacobian matrix to the dynamic model of the robotic systems. Conventional random variable based (RV-based) schemes require a detailed knowledge of the system parameters variation and may be not able to fully characterize the uncertainties of the complex dynamic systems. However, the proposed RM-based approach provides a probabilistic framework for systematic characterization of the uncertainties in the complex systems with limited available information. Moreover, RM-based uncertainty model is an efficient mathematical tool that ensures the kinematic and dynamic consistency and takes into account the system complexity, configuration, structural inter-dependencies, etc. The application of the RM-based uncertainty model is investigated using an example of kinematically redundant planar parallel manipulator (3-(P)RRR). The simulation results are compared with those obtained through conventional RV-based approach and the effectiveness of the proposed method is discussed.
