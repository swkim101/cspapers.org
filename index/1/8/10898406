In this paper I will report the result of a quantitative analysis of the dynamics of the constituent elements of Japanese terminology. In Japanese technical terms, the linguistic contribution of morphemes greatly differ according to their types of origin. To analyse this aspect, a quantitative method is applied, which can properly characterise the dynamic nature of morphemes in terminology on the basis of a small sample.
