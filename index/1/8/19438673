This poster presents preliminary data in the field of computing education research, focusing on the relationship between high school student participation in Exploring Computer Science (ECS) and their achievement on the math portion of the California Standard Test (CST). The course uses an inquiry-based approach that is expected to improve students' problem solving skills. Students who enrolled in ECS at ten high schools in San Jose, California were monitored over a three-year period to investigate possible relationships between participation in ECS and scores on standardized math tests. Results show a statistically significant difference between ECS participants and their peers for two of three project years.
