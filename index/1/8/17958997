In this paper, we describe a plan generator for planning the sequence of machining cuts of mechanical parts. This system, named GARI, makes use of weighted pieces of advice representing the expertise of human specialists. The complexity of the application domain guided us toward the implementation of a rather sophisticated control structure including hypothesis generation, fact deduction, and conflict resolution. Experiments with GARI suggest that more research effort should be devoted to abstract representation of control as opposed to the exhaustive representations defended by several authors during the last few years.
