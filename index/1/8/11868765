We present an experimental characterization of the physical and MAC layers in CDMA 1xEV-DO and their impact on transport layer performance. The 1xEV-DO network is currently the fastest mobile broadband cellular network, offering data rates of up to 3.1 Mbps for both stationary and mobile users. These rates are achieved by using novel capacity enhancement techniques at the lower layers. Specifically, 1xEV-DO incorporates rapid channel rate adaptation in response to signal conditions, and opportunistic scheduling to exploit channel fluctuations. Although shown to perform well in isolation, there is no comprehensive literature that examines the impact of these features on transport layer and application performance in real networks.
 We take the first step in addressing this issue through a large set of experiments conducted on a commercial 1xEV-DO network. Our evaluation includes both stationary and mobile scenarios wherein we transferred data using four popular transport protocols: TCPReno, TCP-Vegas, TCP-Westwood, and TCP-Cubic, and logged detailed measurements about wireless channel level characteristics as well as transport layer performance. We analyzed data from several days of experiments and inferred the properties of the physical, MAC and transport layers, as well as potential interactions between them. We find that the wireless channel data rate shows significant variability over long time scales on the order of hours, but retains high memory and predictability over small time scales on the order of milliseconds. We also find that loss-based TCP variants are largely unaffected by channel variations due to the presence of large buffers, and hence able to achieve in excess of 80% of the system capacity.
