Efficient parallel algorithms are presented for singular band matrix computations over arbitrary fields including solving systems of linear equations, and computation of the rank and a maximal nonsingular minor of a nonsingular band matrix. The algorithms are reasonably fast: for computations of band matrices of order n and band width m they are only an O(log m log2 log n) factor slower than the fastest known algorithms for singular (or nonsingular) band matrix computations. As well, sequential implementations of the new algorithms are asymptotically faster than previous algorithms if an asymptotically efficient matrix multiplication algorithm is used as a subroutine.
