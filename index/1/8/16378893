In a junior- or senior-level undergraduate software engineering course that uses real-world projects for real clients, different parts of a project are inherently unequal in difficulty, time requirements, and desirability. A perennial problem is assigning portions of the project to student teams equitably. Fair division is a highly effective strategy for making an equitable, proportional, and envy-free assignment of tasks and in serving as the basis for fair grading of assignments which vary in difficulty, desirability, and time requirements.
