This paper presents a placement-driven technology mapping procedure based on fuzzy delay curves. The fuzziness has been introduced to deal with the inherent vagueness in wiring loads (derived from a dynamically updated placement) and used by the mapper to calculate the signal arrival times. In the process we describe a number of fuzzy operations which are needed to generate the fuzzy delay curves and to select a minimum area mapping solution satisfying a set of timing constraints. This procedure has been implemented and the results are on average 1% and 26% (5% and 3%)better in terms of area and delay compared to a technology mapping procedure with zero (crisp) wire load values.
