This paper presents an approach to identifying conjuncts of coordinate conjunctions appearing in text which has been labelled with syntactic and semantic tags. The overall project of which this research is a part is also briefly discussed. The program was tested on a 10,000 word chapter of the Merck Veterinary Manual. The algorithm is deterministic and domain independent and it performs relatively well on a large real-life domain. Constructs not handled by the simple algorithm are also described in some detail.
