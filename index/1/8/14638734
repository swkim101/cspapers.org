The important step towards a comprehensiveCAD framework is the development of a suitable, completedesign model on which the design system's components arebased. To date, we generally find "island" solutions for differentaspects as data and process management, but in future, weneed more and more integrated solutions. Only the integrationgives us the traceability we need for design planning, to generateparts of the design tool√Ωs code automatically, etc.This paper describes how a suitable Design Task Model canbe used to link the Product and Flow Models which are currentlyseparated in most frameworks. Using the PLAYOUTDesign Model as an example, we show how the Product, theTask, and the Flow Models may fit together, and we describe amodeling environment that guarantees the development ofconsistent, integrated models.
