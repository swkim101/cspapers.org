Recently Linsker [2] and MacKay and Miller [3,4] have analysed Hebbian correlational rules for synaptic development in the visual system, and Miller [5,8] has studied such rules in the case of two populations of fibres (particularly two eyes). Miller's analysis has so far assumed that each of the two populations has exactly the same correlational structure. Relaxing this constraint by considering the effects of small perturbative correlations within and between eyes permits study of the stability of the solutions. We predict circumstances in which qualitative changes are seen, including the production of binocularly rather than monocularly driven units.
