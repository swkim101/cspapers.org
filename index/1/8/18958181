LIGA (Layout Intelligence for Graphics Automation) is a prototype system that contains graphic design knowledge about text and image layout. The goal of the program is to produce layouts that reflect the logical structure of the content, are legible for the given viewing context, and are consistent in style. The system can generate effective layouts of information as well as adapt layouts on the fly to accommodate changes in the presentation environment.
