Discrete relaxation is frequently used to compute the fixed point of a discrete system where / is monotonic with respect to some partial order Given an appropriate init ial value for X, discrete relaxation repeats the assignment until a fixed point for / is found. Monotonicity of / with respect to is a sufficient (but in general not necessary) condition for iterative, hill-climbing techniques such as discrete relaxation to find the f ixed point of / .
