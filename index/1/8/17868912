Effective knowledge management may require going beyond initial knowledge capture, to support decisions about how to extend previously-captured knowledge. Electronic <i>concept maps,</i> interlinked with other concept maps and multimedia resources, can provide rich <i>knowledge models</i> for human knowledge capture and sharing. This paper presents research on methods for supporting experts as they extend these knowledge models, by searching the Web for new context-relevant topics as candidates for inclusion. This topic search problem presents two challenges: First, how to formulate queries to seek topics that reflect the context of the current knowledge model, and, second, how to identify candidate topics with the right balance of novelty and relevance. More generally, this problem raises the broad question of the interaction of topic information from the local analysis space (a collected set of documents) and the global search space (the Web). The paper develops a framework for understanding this interaction, and proposes and evaluates techniques for addressing the query formation and topic identification questions by dynamically extracting topic descriptors and discriminators from a knowledge model, to characterize information needs for retrieval and filtering of relevant material. Using these techniques, we have developed a support tool that starts from a knowledge model under construction and automatically produces a set of suggestions for topics to include, proactively supporting users as they extend knowledge models.
