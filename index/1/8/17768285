The goal of this paper is to present a study of the compatibility of policies, security or other. Two policies are said to be compatible at a given system if the system behaviours satisfy the requirements of both policies. Incompatibility can be a result of the environment in which the system is intended to operate, or, of the actual behavioural requirements on the system and its components. We introduce a means of assessing the compatibility of policies, and the requirements for compatible policies, in a closed system model.
