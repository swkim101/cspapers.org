Protein-protein interaction plays an important role in understanding biological processes. In order to resolve the parsing error resulted from modal verb phrases and the noise interference brought by appositive dependency, an improved tree kernel-based PPI extraction method is proposed in this paper. Both modal verbs and appositive dependency features are considered to define some relevant processing rules which can effectively optimize and expand the shortest dependency path between two proteins in the new method. On the basis of these rules, the effective optimization and expanding path is used to direct the cutting of constituent parse tree, which makes the constituent parse tree for protein-protein interaction extraction more precise and concise. The experimental results show that the new method achieves better results on five commonly used corpora.
