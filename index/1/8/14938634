SISP/I is an interactive system whose goal is the automatic inference of LISP functions from a finite set of examples {(x., f(x.))) where x. is a list belonging to the domain of the function f we want to infer. SISP/I is able to infer the recursive form of many linear recursive functions and its stop-condition. SISP/l tries to work with one example only. When it fails, it asks for new ones: using then a method of generating new partial sub-problems, SISP/I is able to perfect its generated recursive function until it gets a correct one.
