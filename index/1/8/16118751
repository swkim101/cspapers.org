We present an asymptotic fully-polynomial approximation scheme for pricing Asian options on the lattice. For an option with strike price X on an n-step binomial tree, we give a O(kn 2) time algorithm with one-sided error of nX/k, for any positive integer k. Our technique works for both European Asian and American Asian options and is powerful enough to extend to other pathdependent options with similar properties. We also show several heuristic optimizations to this algorithm which maintain similar guarantees and present some experimental results. This is the first algorithm for Asian options to give guaranteed error bounds in polynomial time.
