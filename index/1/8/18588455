This paper presents two VLSI architectures for the recognition of context-free languages and finite-state languages. The architecture for context-free languages consists of n(n+1)/2 identical cells and it is capable of recognizing an input string of length n in 2n time units. The architecture for finite-state languages consists of n cells and it can recognize a string of length n in constant time. Since both architectures have characteristics such as modular layout, simple constrol and dataflow pattern, high degree of multiprocessing and/or pipelining, etc., they are very suitable for VLSI implementation.
