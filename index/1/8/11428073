In an instructionless environment, there are neither teachers nor books. The only feedback comes from interaction with the target. All information appears from within the subject or from observation of the environment. In this setting, subjects rely upon experimentation to develop an understanding of the target. They form hypotheses by analogy or inference and test these hypotheses via experiments of calibration, replication, confirmation, exploration, and discrimination.
 This paper describes subjects' performance in a particular instructionless environment. The target object is a programmable toy robot tank. We use the hypotheses formed by subjects and form of the experiments performed, to assess subjects' knowledge of the system. This knowledge falls into distinguishable categories: syntactic knowledge of the programming language, semantic knowledge of the actions of the device, and model knowledge which addresses the structure of the device. Exemplary selections of our protocols are used to support the various aspects of the learning model.
