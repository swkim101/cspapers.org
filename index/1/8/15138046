Existing formalisms of inheritance are not sufficient to model the complexities of the kind of multiple inheritance exemplified in C++. Any satisfactory formalism must model the complicating effects of virtual and non-virtual base classes as well as virtual and non-virtual methods. By abstracting the implementational notion of a subobject and formalizing subobject selection, we develop a formalism to model this combination of features. Not intended as a formal semantics of C++, the resulting model should nevertheless provide an essential level of understanding for language theorists and implementors in their dealings with C++ and related languages.
