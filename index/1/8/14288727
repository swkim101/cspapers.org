We consider the problem of broadcasting in an unknown radio network modeled as a directed graph <i>G</i> = (<i>V, E</i>), where |<i>V</i>| = <i>n</i>. In unknown networks, every node knows only its own label, while it is unaware of any other parameter of the network, included its neighborhood and even any upper bound on the number of nodes. We show an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i> log log <i>n</i>) upper bound on the time complexity of deterministic broadcasting improving upon the time complexity of the currently best known algorithms [6, 12].
