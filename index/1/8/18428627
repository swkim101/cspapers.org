While many efficient algorithms for the maximum flow problem have been proposed over the years, they are designed to work with static networks, and thus they need to recompute a new solution from scratch every time an update occurs. Such approaches are impractical in many current application where updates are frequent. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes efficient incremental algorithms for maintaining the maximum flow in dynamic networks.
