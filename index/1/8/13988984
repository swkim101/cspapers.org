We give near-optimal space bounds in the streaming model for linear algebra problems that include estimation of matrix products, linear regression, low-rank approximation, and approximation of matrix rank. In the streaming model, sketches of input matrices are maintained under updates of matrix entries; we prove results for turnstile updates, given in an arbitrary order. We give the first lower bounds known for the space needed by the sketches, for a given estimation error ε. We sharpen prior upper bounds, with respect to combinations of space, failure probability, and number of passes. The sketch we use for matrix A is simply S<sup>T</sup>A, where S is a sign matrix. Our results include the following upper and lower bounds on the bits of space needed for 1-pass algorithms. Here A is an n x d matrix, B is an n x d' matrix, and c := d+d'. These results are given for fixed failure probability; for failure probability δ>0, the upper bounds require a factor of log(1/δ) more space. We assume the inputs have integer entries specified by O(log(nc)) bits, or O(log(nd)) bits. (Matrix Product) Output matrix C with F(A<sup>T</sup>B-C) ≤ ε F(A) F(B). We show that Θ(cε<sup>-2</sup>log(nc)) space is needed. (Linear Regression) For d'=1, so that B is a vector b, find x so that Ax-b ≤ (1+ε) min<sub>x' ∈ Real<sup>d</sup></sub> Ax'-b. We show that Θ(d<sup>2</sup>ε<sup>-1</sup> log(nd)) space is needed. (Rank-k Approximation) Find matrix tA<sub>k</sub> of rank no more than k, so that F(A-tA<sub>k</sub>) ≤ (1+ε) F{A-A<sub>k</sub>}, where A<sub>k</sub> is the best rank-k approximation to A. Our lower bound is Ω(kε<sup>-1</sup>(n+d)log(nd)) space, and we give a one-pass algorithm matching this when A is given row-wise or column-wise. For general updates, we give a one-pass algorithm needing [O(kε<sup>-2</sup>(n + d/ε<sup>2</sup>)log(nd))] space. We also give upper and lower bounds for algorithms using multiple passes, and a sketching analog of the CUR decomposition.
