The NISAT testbed consists of a center server and many test units. The test units probe the internal interconnected signals inside the motes with extra hardware sniffers. The server gathers, parses and analyzes all data from test units to obtain the information on the network behavior. By adopting the passive sniffing mechanism, NISAT has no side effect on the normal behavior of sensor networks, and it is transparent to the software running on motes. NISAT offers accurate and precise test data for the studies on sensor networks, especially for the high-precision performance measurements and black-box tests without source codes.
