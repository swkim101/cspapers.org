This paper introduces new specificity determining methods for terms using compositional and contextual information. Specificity of terms is the quantity of domain specific information that is contained in the terms. The methods are modeled as information theory like measures. As the methods don't use domain specific information, they can be applied to other domains without extra processes. Experiments showed very promising result with the precision of 82.0% when the methods were applied to the terms in MeSH thesaurus.
