We give a randomized variant of Johnson's algorithm for MAX SAT [12] and show that its expected approximation ratio is 3/4. Our solution also works in an online setting where variables are revealed one by one together with the clauses they appear in. Our simple algorithm does not use the power of linear programming and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first such algorithm to reach approximation ratio 3/4. We also investigate a variant of Johnson's algorithm proposed in [5] that processes variables in random order. Here we show that the expected approximation ratio is worse than 3/4, thus providing a partial answer to a question of [5].
