We examine time-optimal straight-line trajectory generation for three-wheeled omni-directional mobile robots. Our studies are based on the mobile robot dynamics with battery voltage bounds. We formulate a multi-objective problem that has both translational and rotational costs for time-optimality. Using the switching functions by maximum principle, we present a new approach to determine extreme control components used as motor input. Through the proposed method, we find three combinations of optimal candidates to be the optimal solutions of our problem.
