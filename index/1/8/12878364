For solving search problems in AI field, multi-process description is more elegant than the backtracking/coroutine description, from the standpoint of flexible search, high modularity and simple program structure. We propose the language specification of Concurrent LISP, which is a concurrent programming language based on LISP. We have implemented its interpreter on a large scale computer. We are working at the implementation of its interpreter on multi-micro-processor system to realize further efficient execution.
