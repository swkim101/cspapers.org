Reachability is an important dynamic property of Petri nets. Its determination given an unbounded net and initial marking has remained an open problem since 1960s. Due to its extreme difficulty, a great deal of research has been focused on some subclasses of unbounded nets. For arbitrary ones, this work intends to propose a new reachability tree (NRT), which consists of only but all reachable markings from its initial marking. Furthermore, an NRT-based method to decide deadlocks of unbounded nets is presented. An example is provided to show the new results.
