This paper proposes a novel general label aggregation method for both binary and multi-class labeling in crowdsourcing, namely Bi-Layer Clustering (BLC), which clusters two layers of features - the conceptual-level and the physical-level features - to infer true labels of instances. BLC first clusters the instances using the conceptual-level features extracted from their multiple noisy labels and then performs clustering again using the physical-level features. It can facilitate tracking the uncertainty changes of the instances, so that the integrated labels that are likely to be falsely inferred on the conceptual layer can be easily corrected using the estimated labels on the physical layer. Experimental results on two real-world crowdsourcing data sets show that BLC outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods.
