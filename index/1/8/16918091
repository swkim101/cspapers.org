We consider the problem of generating random subsets of a set of n events in time that is sensitive to the size of the subset generated. In the simplest case, events are, independent and each is determined by a biased coin flip. We generalize this using the notion of a random generation tree, which can represent other distributions of subsets, including the case of mutually exclusive events such as generated by rolling an n-sided biased die. We present output-sensitive algorithms for generating subsets of events from a random generation tree in both the static and dynamic cases. For static trees, our algorithm is optimal, thus solving the static case of a set of biased coins. We also present a simpler algorithm, optimal when the expected output size is Q(logn), for generating subsets of events determined by a dynamically changing set of biased coins.
