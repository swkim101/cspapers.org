In this paper we described the development of both the hardware and the algorithms for a novel laser vision system suitable for measuring distances from both solid and mesh-like targets in underwater environments. The system was developed as a part of the AQUABOT project that developed an underwater robotic system for autonomous inspection of offshore aquaculture installation. The system takes into account the hemispherical optics typical in underwater vehicle designs and implements an array of line-lasers to ensure that mesh-like targets provide reflections in a consistent manner. The developed algorithms for the laser vision system are capable of providing either raw pointcloud data sets from each laser or with additional processing high level information like distance and relative orientation of the target with respect to the ROV can be recovered. An automatic calibration procedure along with the accompanying hardware that was developed, is described in this paper, to reduce the calibration overhead required by regular maintenance operations as is typical for underwater vehicles operating in sea-water. A set of experimental results in controlled laboratory environment as well as at offshore aquaculture installations demonstrate the performance of the system.
