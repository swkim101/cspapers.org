Fitts pointing model has proven extremely useful forunderstanding basic selection in WIMP user interfaces. Yet todaysinterfaces involve more complex navigation within electronicenvironments. As navigation amounts to a form of multi-scalepointing, Fitts model can be applied to these more complex tasks.We report the results of a preliminary pointing experiment thatshows that users can handle higher levels of task difficulty withtwo-scale rather than traditional one-scale pointing control. Also,in tasks with very high-precision hand movements, performance ishigher with a stylus than with a mouse.
