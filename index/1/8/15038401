This paper proposes an approach to minimally constrained synchronization for the parallel execution of imperative programs in a shared-memory environment. Anti-dependencies and output-dependencies arising from array references within loops are completely removed, using run-time analysis if necessary. A parallel reference-pattern generation scheme based on one proposed in [13] is used in conjunction with dynamic allocation and binding of storage, to completely remove non-intrinsic data dependencies during execution.
