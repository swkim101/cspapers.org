This paper presents an approach to automatically extracting the bilingual translations of many Web query terms through mining the Web anchor texts. Some preliminary experiments are conducted on using 109,416 Web pages containing both Chinese and English anchor texts in their in-links to extract Chinese translations of 200 English queries selected from popular query terms in Taiwan. It is found that the effective translations of 75% of the popular query terms can be extracted, in which 87.2% cannot be obtained in common translation dictionaries.
