The resolution at which a sensor network collects data is a crucial parameter of performance since it governs the range of applications that are feasible to be developed using that network. A higher resolution, in most situations, enables more applications and improves the reliability of existing ones. In this paper we discuss a system architecture that uses controlled motion to provide virtual high-resolution in a network of cameras. Several orders of magnitude advantage in resolution may be achieved, depending on tolerable tradeoffs. We discuss several system design choices in the context of our prototype camera network implementation that realizes the proposed architecture. We also mention how some of our techniques may apply to sensors other than cameras. Real world data is collected using our prototype system and used for the evaluation of our proposed methods.
