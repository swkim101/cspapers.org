In this paper, based on the optimality of hierarchical bubble sorting, the problem of two-sided single-detour untangling for single-layer bus routing is firstly formulated. Compared with an optimal O(n3) algorithm[4] for one-sided single-detour untangling without capacity consideration, an optimal O(n2) algorithm is proposed to solve the two-sided single-detour untangling problem without capacity consideration. For two-sided single-detour untangling with capacity consideration, an efficient O(n2) algorithm is proposed and the experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can successfully untangle all the twisted nets for the tested examples in less CPU time.
