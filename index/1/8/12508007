Faculty in small departments (perhaps 3 FTE, perhaps only 1 or 2,&) face special situations - both challenges and strengths. In this BOF, members will have a chance to talk about both. Challenges include maintaining a well-rounded curriculum and attracting students. Strengths include a close relationship with other members of the department and majors. These and other topics are open for discussion; the specific topics will be based upon the composition and interests of the group assembled.
