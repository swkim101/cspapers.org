Many conventional approaches to text analysis and information retrieval prove ineffective when large text collections must be processed in heterogeneous subject areas. An alternative text manipulation system is outlined useful for the retrieval of large heterogeneous texts, and for the recognition of content similarities between text excerpts, based on flexible text matching procedures carried out in several contexts of different scope. The methods are illustrated by search experiments performed with the 29-volume Funk and Wagnalls encyclopedia. Approaches to Text Retrieval We are addressing the problem of text retrieval from large, heterogeneous text databases, where the vocabulary varies widely and the subject matter is unrestricted. This includes newspaper articles, newswire dispatches, textbooks, dictionaries and encyclopedias, manuals, magazine articles, and so on. Necessarily, the retrieval operations must be preceded by some form of text analysis, or text indexing operation, leading to the assignment to query and document texts of appropriate content identifications. When content identifiers are attached to text items, the text retrieval operations can be carried out by comparing the identifications assigned to the various text items with the query identifications, and retrieving texts that appear sufficiently similar to the corresponding queries.

In the keyword approach, single-term concepts, known as keywords,
