Analysis and comparison of simulation data with various nuclear scenarios are the primary tasks performed by nuclear researchers and technologists in a daily basis. In this paper, we present a real-time computer graphical user interface for Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) case comparison using the Modular Accident Analysis Program (MAAP). The interface was aimed to yield an effective tool for data visualization and case comparison given various nuclear scenarios or simulation results with different MAAP versions. In addition, the interface was designed in an attempt to process the simulated data instantaneously and display the corresponding results as the MAAP simulation proceeds. To help nuclear researchers or technologists, the interface was also incorporated with a number of user-friendly functions for display, hardcopy, and documentation. The results demonstrated that the graphical user interface could be used simultaneously with the MAAP software during simulation. Case comparison was also possible for various nuclear scenarios or MAAP versions. In summary, the proposed interface offer a potential solution to ease the time-consuming and labor-intensive task performed by nuclear researchers or technologists, leading to put them in a position to focus on the analysis of nuclear data and thereby maintain the safe operation of the nuclear reactor.
