We present a simple direct approach for solving the ICA problem, using density estimation and maximum likelihood. Given a candidate orthogonal frame, we model each of the coordinates using a semi-parametric density estimate based on cubic splines. Since our estimates have two continuous derivatives, we can easily run a second order search for the frame parameters. Our method performs very favorably when compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
