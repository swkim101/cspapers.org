A trusted execution environment (TEE) is a secure processing environment that is isolated from the normal processing environment where the device operating system and applications run. The first mobile phones with hardware-based TEEs appeared almost a decade ago, and today almost every smartphone and tablet contains a TEE like ARM TrustZone. Despite such a large-scale deployment, the use of TEE functionality has been limited for developers. With emerging standardization this situation is about to change. In this tutorial, we explain the security features provided by mobile TEEs and describe On-board Credentials (ObC) system that enables third-party TEE development. We discuss ongoing TEE standardization activities, including the recent Global Platform standards and the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 specification, and identify open problems for the near future of mobile hardware security.
