We present a framework for considering the impact of satellite communications on high level computer communication protocols. Within that framework, we present a model for analyzing these effects, and using that model, we derive some bounds on the amount of data that may be transferred over a communication channel which contains a satellite link. As our example, we use the flow control mechanism of an early version of a planned NBS transport protocol.
