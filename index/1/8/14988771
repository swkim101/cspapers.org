Non-linear continuous change is common in real-world problems, especially those that model physical systems. We present an algorithm which builds upon existent temporal planning techniques based on linear programming to approximate non-linear continuous monotonic functions. These are integrated through a semantic attachment mechanism, allowing external libraries or functions that are difficult to model in native PDDL to be evaluated during the planning process. A new planning system implementing this algorithm was developed and evaluated. Results show that the addition of this algorithm to the planning process can enable it to solve a broader set of planning problems.
