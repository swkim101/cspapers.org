This paper reports on a measurement study of the Scheduler in the PDP-10 TENEX Operating System under normal loads in a Computer Science research environment at Case Western Reserve University.
 A complete description of the methodology and the results of a Covariance Analysis is presented here. The analysis was made in parallel with the analysis of the collected data, therefore a brief description of the experiments as well as some comments of the most interesting results are also discussed in this report.
