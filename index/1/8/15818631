We explore the consequences of representing token segmentations as hierarchical structures (trees) for the task of Multiword Expression (MWE) recognition, in isolation or in combination with dependency parsing. We propose a novel representation of token segmentation as trees on tokens, resembling dependency trees. Given this new representation, we present and evaluate two different architectures to combine MWE recognition and dependency parsing in the easy-first framework: a pipeline and a joint system, both taking advantage of lexical and syntactic dimensions. We experimentally validate that MWE recognition significantly helps syntactic parsing.
