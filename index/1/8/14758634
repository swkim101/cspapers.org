Reducing energy consumption is an important consideration in embedded real-time system development. This work examines systems that contain a DVFS managed CPU executing packet producing tasks and a DPM-controlled network interface. We introduce a novel approach to minimize energy consumed by the network resource on such a system, through careful selection of voltage and frequency levels on the CPU. Contrary to existing claims which state that DVFS should not be employed when the CPU is not a significant consumer of energy, we show that our DVFS technique can reduce system energy by as much as 35%, even when the CPU energy consumption is negligible. Furthermore, we motivate the need to balance the CPU and network energy and present two techniques to do so. One is based on off-line analysis and the other is a conservative on-line approach. We then validate the proposed methods using both simulation and an implementation in the Linux kernel
