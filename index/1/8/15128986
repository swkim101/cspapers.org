As social networks are growing in terms of the number of users, resources and interactions; the user may be lost or unable to find useful information. Social elements could avoid this disorientation like the social annotations (tags) which become more and more popular and contribute to avoid the disorientation of the user. Representing a user based on these social annotations has showed their utility in reflecting an accurate user profile which could be used for a recommendation purpose. In this paper, we give a state of the art of characteristics of social user and techniques which model and update a tag-based profile. We show how to treat social annotations and the utility of modelling tag-based profiles for recommendation purposes.
