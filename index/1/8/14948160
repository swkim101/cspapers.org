Stratified case-based reasoning is a technique in which abstract solutions produced during hierarchical problem solving are used to assist case-based retrieval, matching, and adaptation. We describe the motivation for the integration of case-based reasoning with hierarchical problem solving, exemplify its benefits, detail a set of algorithms that implement our approach, and present their comparative empirical evaluation on a path planning task. Our results show that stratified case-based reasoning significantly decreases the computational expense required to retrieve, match, and adapt cases, leading to performance superior both to simple case-based reasoning and to hierarchical problem solving ab initio.
