The motivations for the design study of a modular, shared resource computing system are given by discussing fault-tolerance and resource utilization issues in parallel processing architectures. A design is presented which employs an array of pipelined arithmetic processors to perform array operations. The design provides for fault-tolerance (“graceful degradation”) capability and is efficient in using main memory bandwidth. Various architectural tradeoffs of the design are discussed. Some results of simulations used for the verification of design decisions are also reported.
