DASOM (Computer Aided SDL-Oriented Methodology) is a system development tool which especially gives computer support to specification and design, but also provides support for implementation, production and maintenance of software systems in the communication- and process control areas.
The tool is based on a software engineering methodology called SOM (SDL-Oriented Methodology). This includes the intentionally standardized Specification and Description Language (SDL), defined by CCITT. SOM is based on ten years of practical experience, while DASOM has been developed during the last five years in a cooperation between Electronic Research Laboratory (ELAB) at the Norwegian Institute of Technology and A. S Computas.
The use of DASOM increases the productivity and the quality significantly. The estimated productivity increase is 20-70%. Higher quality is achieved because a formalized methodology is used in combination with syntax- and consistency checks provided by the tool.
