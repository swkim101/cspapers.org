As the object-oriented paradigm becomes increasingly important in the computer science curriculum, educators will face a new set of challenges and issues. One of these new issues will be the role that programming libraries should assume in teaching both software engineering methodologies and recurring concepts in computer science. Object-oriented languages place a strong emphasis on both code and design reuse, and data abstraction via encapsulation, in order to model complex problem domains. Libraries provide the primary technology for reuse and storage of modules. As a result, they assume great importance in this programming methodology. This paper explores pedagogical issues related to object-oriented class libraries and presents empirical evidence based on an exploratory study conducted by us. Experimental results indicate the superiority of object-oriented class libraries in writing data-structure intensive applications.
