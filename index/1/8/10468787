This paper discusses how lexical resources based on semantic roles (i.e. FrameNet, PropBank, VerbNet) can be used for Question Answering, especially Web Question Answering. Two algorithms have been implemented to this end, with quite different characteristics. We discuss both approaches when applied to each of the resources and a combination of these and give an evaluation. We argue that employing semantic roles can indeed be highly beneficial for a QA system.
