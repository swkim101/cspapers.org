Web Observatories aim to develop techniques and methods to allow researchers to interrogate and answer questions about society through the multitudes of digital traces people now create. In this paper, we propose that a possible path towards surmounting the inevitable obstacle of personal privacy towards such a goal, is to keep data with individuals, under their own control, while enabling them to participate in Web Observatory-style analyses in situ. We discuss the kinds of applications such a global, distributed, linked network of Personal Web Observatories might have, a few of the many challenges that must be resolved towards realising such an architecture in practice, and finally, our work towards a fundamental reference building block of such a network.
