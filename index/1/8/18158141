Many users need to refer to content in existing files (pictures, tables, emails, web pages and etc.) when they write documents(programs, presentations, proposals and etc.), and often need to revisit these referenced files for review, revision or reconfirmation. Therefore it is meaningful to discover an approach to help users revisit these references effectively. Traditional approaches (file explorer, desktop search, and etc.) fail to work in this case. In this paper, we propose an efficient solution for this problem. We firstly define a new personal data relationship: Context-based Reference (CR), which is generated by user behaviors. We also propose efficient methods to identify CR relationship and present a new type of query based on it: Context-based Query(C-Query), which helps users efficiently revisit personal documents based on CR relationship. Our experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.
