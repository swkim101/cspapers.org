This paper describes a graphical data mining system called AutoDomainMine. It is based on our proposed approach of integrating clustering and classification to mine scientific data stored in a database. The data consists of input conditions of scientific experiments and graphs plotted as their results. This system mines the stored data in order to submit exact or approximate ranked responses to user queries intended to optimize the scientific processes.
