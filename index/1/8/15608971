The similarity search and indexing problem is well known to be a di cult one for high dimensional applications. Most indexing structures show a rapid degradation with increasing dimensionality which leads to an access of the entire database for each query. Furthermore, recent research results show that in high dimensional space, even the concept of similarity may not be very meaningful. In this paper, we propose the IGrid-index; a method for similarity indexing which uses a distance function whose meaningfulness is retained with increasing dimensionality. In addition, this technique shows performance which is unique to all known index structures; the percentage of data accessed is inversely proportional to the overall data dimensionality. Thus, this technique relies on the dimensionality to be high in order to provide performance e cient similarity results. The IGridindex can also support a special kind of query which we refer to as projected range queries; a query which is increasingly relevant for very high dimensional data mining applications.
