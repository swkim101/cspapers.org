This session will demonstrate best practices for introducing peer instruction and pedagogical code reviews into the computer science classroom. Presenters play the role of instructors on the first day of class. Audience members play the role of students as they collaborate on a variety of sample activities. By providing models of active learning in computing contexts, we seek to motivate instructors to adopt these pedagogies in their classrooms. Sufficient time will be reserved for questions and discussion.
