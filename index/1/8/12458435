This paper describes a hierarchical approach to the detection of the critical faults of a digital board, i.e., those most likely to occur. The failure probabilities of the nodes of a board are estimated and used as weights in selecting the nodes for fault detection. The study has indicated both a saving in pattern generation and a higher fault detection per pattern. This approach introduces a new definition of fault coverage. The approach is also applicable to analog circuits. In addition, it allows for continual incorporation of field data, thus improving the estimation of the failure probabilities.
