The publicly indexable Web contains an estimated 800 million pages, however it is estimated that the largest search engine contains only 300 million of these pages. As the number of Internet users and the number of accessible Web pages grows, it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to find documents that are relevant to their particular needs. Often users must browse through a large hierarchy of categories to find the information for which they are looking. To provide the user with the most useful information in the least amount of time, we need a system that uses each user’s view of the world for classification. This paper explores a way to use a user’s personal arrangement of concepts to navigate the Web. This system is built by using the characterizations for a particular site created by the Ontology Based Informing Web Agent Navigation (OBIWAN) system and mapping from them to the user’s personal ontologies. OBIWAN allows users to explore multiple sites via the same browsing hierarchy. This paper extends OBIWAN to allow users to explore multiple sites via their own browsing hierarchy. The mapping of the reference ontology to the personal ontology is shown to have a promising level of correctness and precision.
