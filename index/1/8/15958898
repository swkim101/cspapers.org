This paper examines some aspects of the design considerations of the human-computer interface as related to personal computers. It is shown that the success of a popular personal computer software product, visiCalc, may be attributed to a thoughtful reconciliation of these design factors with the hardware constraints. The trends of advancement in personal computer software for management-science- engineering problem-solving and decision-making are exemplified by discussing the microcomputer implementation of the Question Answering System on mathematical models and related data bases.
