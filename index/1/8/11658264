PICASSO is a graphical user interface development environment built using the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS). This paper describes how CLOS features including multiple inheritance, instance methods, multimethods, and method combinations were used to implement the system. In addition, the benefits and drawbacks of CLOS development are discussed including code quality, maintainability and performance.
