General-purpose commercial database systems, though widely used, fail to meet the performance requirements of applications requiring short, predictable response times, and extremely high throughput rates. As a result, most high performance applications are custom designed and lack the flexibility needed to adapt to unforeseen, evolving requirements. In the military domain, command centers often contain numerous “stovepipe” systems unable to share data easily. The need for improved data management is apparent with the rapid growth of communication networks and the increasing demand by end users for network-centric solutions that require flexibility and high performance. These applications share the need for real-time response to a dynamically changing external environment; the need to store a substantial amount of data; and the need to process transactions that have the usual ACID guarantees of traditional database
