Direct content analysis reveals important details about movies including those of gender representations and potential biases. We investigate the differences between male and female character depictions in movies, based on patterns of language used. Specifically, we use an automatically generated lexicon of linguistic norms characterizing gender ladenness. We use multivariate analysis to investigate gender depictions and correlate them with elements of movie production. The proposed metric differentiates between male and female utterances and exhibits some interesting interactions with movie genres and the screenplay writer gender.
