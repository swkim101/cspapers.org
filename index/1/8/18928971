The advantages of mechanical compliance have driven the development of devices using new smart materials. A new kind of magnetorheological piston based on a toroidal array of magnetorheological valves, has been previously tested to prove its feasibility. However, being an initial prototype its potential was still limited by its complex design, and low output force. This study presents the revisions done to the design with several improvements targeting key performance parameters. An improved annular piston design is also introduced as comparison with conventional devices. The toroidal and annular piston head prototypes are built and tested, and their force performance compared with the previous iteration. The experimental results show an overall performance improvement of the toroidal assembly. However, the force model used in the study still fails to accurately predict the magnetic flux at the gaps of the piston head. This deviation is later verify and corrected using a FEM analysis. The force performance of the new toroidal assembly is on par with the commonplace annular design. It also displays a more linear behaviour, at the expense of lower energy efficiency. Finally, it also shows potential for a greater degree of customisation to meet different system requirements.
