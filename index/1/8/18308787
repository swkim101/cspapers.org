Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are often advertised with high sensing accuracy, long lifetime, and easy deployment. However, they are still not widely used in environmental research due to of poor tool support and high complexity. A wider use of WSNs in field science would enable researchers to address scientific questions that are infeasible today.
 To address this issue, we designed and prototyped a Software Factory for WSNs that hides the complexity of software development for embedded systems. It exposes a visual domain-specific modeling language and supports code generation for resource constrained devices. The proposed Software Factory simplifies the integration of domain experts into the development process, making WSNs more attractive as a tool for researchers from outside of the computer science field. This could lead to a wider adoption of WSNs in field sciences.
