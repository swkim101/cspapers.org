In this paper we will explore the limitations imposed by entropic constraints, both in generality and for specific problems. We list below the main questions that we will address.
 (1) In the binary number system, addition is easy while multiplication is hard for VLSI. Is there an “ideal” number representation, in which all arithmetic operations have efficient VLSI implementations?
 (2) Can one build multipliers for binary numbers, which achieve both small area and fast average computation time?
 (3) Thompson's technique applies only to multiple output functions. How can one prove area-time bounds for single output functions?
 (4) What other ways are there for deriving entropic constraints from consideration of data movement?
 Answers to these questions will be discussed in the ensuing sections.
