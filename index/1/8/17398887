The real usability of data stream systems depends on the practical aspect of building applications on data streams. In this demo we show two possible applications on data streams implemented on our prototype platform XTream. One application integrates VoIP and E-Mail, the other one incorporates streams in a Smart Home setting. Using these applications we try to identify and discuss the functionality that data stream management systems should provide. Those attending the demo will be able to compose their own applications.
