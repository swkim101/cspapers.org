The next generation of automobiles (also known as CyberVehicles) will increasingly incorporate electronic control units in novel automotive control applications. Recent work has demonstrated vulnerability of modern automotive control systems to security attacks that directly impact CyberVehicles' physical safety and dependability. The First International Academic Workshop on Security, Privacy and Dependability for CyberVehicles (CyCAR'13) focuses on security and privacy topics in CyberVehicles that are within the scope of ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). Specifically, the workshop targets issues related to security and privacy issues in computerized, complex, and connected modern vehicles as well as their complex supply chains. This workshop offers an opportunity to trigger the transfer of the accumulated knowledge by the ACM CCS community to the car industry while taking into account typical automotive constraints such as interoperability, reliability, dependability, quality, resource constraints and/or complex supply chain.
