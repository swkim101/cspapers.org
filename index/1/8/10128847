Certain pronoun contexts are argued to establish a local center (LC), i.e., a conventionalized indexical similar to 1st/2nd pers. pronouns. Demonstrative pronouns, also indexicals, are shown to access entities that are not LCs because they lack discourse relevance or because they are not yet in the universe of discourse.
