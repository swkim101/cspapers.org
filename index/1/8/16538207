The most typical user of this embodied experience is not likely to be the organization with the greatest past focus on methodology and process. Instead, it is likely to be the one that is quickest to abandon pre-defined approaches and leap in to take advantage of some new niche-specific method. Visual Basic is a perfect example of this: an application that would have been in COBOL only a few years ago may today be implemented in Visual Basic for Applications sitting on top of a spread sheet. The methodology and process that would have been germane to the COBOL project are not only ill-adapted to this new kind of project; they would be a positive deterrent to undertaking it in the first place.
