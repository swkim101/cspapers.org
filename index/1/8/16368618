In this paper, the implementation of a variable stiffness joint actuated by a couple of twisted string actuators in antagonistic configuration is presented. The twisted string actuation system is particularly suitable for very compact and light-weight robotic devices, like artificial limbs and exoskeletons, since it renders a very low apparent inertia at the load side, allowing the implementation of powerful tendon-based driving systems, using small-size DC motors characterized by high speed, low torque and very limited inertia. After the presentation of the basic properties of the twisted string actuation system, the way how they are used for the implementation of a variable stiffness joint is discussed. A simple PID-based motor-side algorithm for controlling simultaneously both the joint stiffness and position is discussed, then the identification of the system parameters is performed on an experimental setup for verifying the proposed model and control approach.
