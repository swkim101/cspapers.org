In this paper we address the problem of finding the complete set of correlated equilibria for general-sum stochastic games with perfect information. We present QPACE â€” an algorithm orders of magnitude more efficient than previous approaches while maintaining a guarantee of convergence and bounded error. Finally, we validate our claims and demonstrate the limits of our algorithm with extensive empirical tests.
