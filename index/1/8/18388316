Since the introduction of inking technology, computer science and engineering education has experienced a flurry of new instructional approaches. Many studies have assessed qualitative improvements over traditional classroom presentation techniques. In this paper, we present quantitative results on the improved student perception of teaching when using Classroom Presenter instead of PowerPoint for classroom presentation. We present an overview on how Classroom Presenter was used in a large undergraduate digital design course and discuss the assessment of results and their analysis. Our data shows with statistical significance that students perceive lectures with Classroom Presenter as more interesting and more adequately paced.
