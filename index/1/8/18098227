In order to execute multiple tasks in offices and houses, robots require a large amount of information. If each item that is part of the ambience is endowed with some intelligence, robots can simply change the state of the item as requested by the item itself. We refer to such an ambience as “intelligent ambience (IA).” This paper describes a constitution method for designing an IA. We constructed two IA models — one comprised a drawer and a mobile robot and the other comprised two types of doors and a drawer, a device developed specially for this IA, and a humanoid robot. We also verified the effectiveness of the IA experimentally.
