As a well-known semantic repository, WordNet is widely used in many applications. However, due to costly edit and maintenance, WordNet's capability of keeping up with the emergence of new concepts is poor compared with on-line encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. To keep WordNet current with folk wisdom, we propose a method to enhance WordNet automatically by merging Wikipedia entities into WordNet, and construct an enriched ontology, named as WorkiNet. WorkiNet keeps the desirable structure of WordNet. At the same time, it captures abundant information from Wikipedia. We also propose a learning approach which is able to generate a tailor-made semantic concept collection for a given document collection. The learning process takes the characteristics of the given document collection into consideration and the semantic concepts in the tailor-made collection can be used as new features for document representation. The experimental results show that the adaptively generated feature space can outperform a static one significantly in text mining tasks, and WorkiNet dominates WordNet most of the time due to its high coverage.
