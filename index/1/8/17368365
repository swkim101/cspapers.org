Because even little children can produce multieententiaJ text, the task of discourse generation appears deceptively easy. It is actually extremely complex, in part because it usually involves many different kinds of knowledge. The skilled writer must know the subiect matter, the beliefs of the reader and his own reasons for writing. He must also know the syntax, semantics, inferential patterns, text structures and words of the language. It would be complex enough if these were all independent bodies of knowledge, independently employed. Unfortunately, they are all interdependent in intricate ways. The use of each must be coordinated with all of the others.
