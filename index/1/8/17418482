A mobile computing environment imposes various restrictions on users. For example, most mobile devices have a liited screen size, and it may be di&ult to watch the screen closelyWhile the user is walking or standing in a bus or train, he or she may have only one hand free to manipulate the device. Therefore, some new operation method must be developed for comfortable information browsing in the mobile environment. In this paper, several existing methods are first introduced and compared from the viewpoint of their applicability in a mobile environment. A new input device for such an environment, named WaviPoint,” is then introduced NaviPoint is a specialized device for mobile information browsing. By using this device, a user cau perform three types of input “analog input,” “digital input.,” and “click input?’ with just one finger. After an explanation of the conceptual structure and a qualitative analysis of NaviPoint, the structure of a prototype is described Experiments using the prototype show that information browsing is possible with an overhead of less than 50% on the usual “mouse and scroll bar” method
