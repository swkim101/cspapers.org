Capsule endoscopy is becoming an important tool for diagnosis in the digestive system. In certain parts of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the stomach, the capsule should be self-propelled. This study examines the swimming mechanism for a miniature gastric pill endoscope. Our method is based on a constant external magnetic field, such as the B0 field of an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), that drives a pair of coils in order to create an undulating swimming motion. We present a dynamic model of the two coil swimmer and compare it to the results obtained using PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry). We demonstrate that our swimmer is able to create an average propulsive force of 0.03 mN and 0.07 mN for the flow regimes tested, which is in a reasonable agreement with the results of the proposed dynamic model.
