Agile development methods favor speed and feature producing iterations. Software architecture, on the other hand, is ripe with techniques that are slow and not oriented directly towards implementation of costumers' needs. Thus, there is a major challenge in retaining architectural information in a fast-faced agile project. We propose to embed as much architectural information as possible in the central artefact of the agile universe, the code. We argue that thereby valuable architectural information is retained for (automatic) documentation, validation, and further analysis, based on a relatively small investment of effort. We outline some preliminary examples of architectural annotations in Java and Python and their applicability in practice.
