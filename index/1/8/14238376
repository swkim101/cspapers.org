With the popularity of “bag of visual terms” representations of images, many text indexing techniques have been applied in large-scale image retrieval systems. However, due to a fundamental difference between an image query (e.g. 1500 visual terms) and a text query (e.g. 3–5 terms), the usages of some text indexing techniques, e.g. inverted list, are misleading. In this work, we develop a novel indexing technique for this problem. The basic idea is to decompose a document-like representation of an image into two components, one for dimension reduction and the other for residual information preservation. The computing of similarity of two images can be transferred to measuring similarities of their components. The decomposition has two major merits: 1) these components have good properties which enable them to be efficiently indexed and retrieved; 2) The decomposition has better generalization ability than other dimension reduction algorithms. The decomposition can be achieved by either a graphical model or a matrix factorization approach. Theoretic analysis and extensive experiments over a 2.3 million image database show that this framework is scalable to index large scale image database to support fast and accurate visual search.
