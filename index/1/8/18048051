The weakly electric fish, Gnathonemus petersii, explores its environment by generating pulsed electric fields and detecting small perturbations in the fields resulting from nearby objects. Accordingly, the fish detects and discriminates objects on the basis of a sequence of electric "images" whose temporal and spatial properties depend on the timing of the fish's electric organ discharge and its body position relative to objects in its environment. We are interested in investigating how these fish utilize timing and body-position during exploration to aid in object discrimination. We have developed a finite-element simulation of the fish's self-generated electric fields so as to reconstruct the electrosensory consequences of body position and electric organ discharge timing in the fish. This paper describes this finite-element simulation system and presents preliminary electric field measurements which are being used to tune the simulation.
