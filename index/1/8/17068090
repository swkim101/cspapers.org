The technology of opinion extraction allows users to retrieve and analyze peopleâ€™s opinions scattered over Web documents. We define an opinion unit as a quadruple consisting of the opinion holder, the subject being evaluated, the part or the attribute in which the subject is evaluated, and the value of the evaluation that expresses a positive or negative assessment. We use this definition as the basis for our opinion extraction task. We focus on two important subtasks of opinion extraction: (a) extracting aspect-evaluation relations, and (b) extracting aspect-of relations, and we approach each task using methods which combine contextual and statistical clues. Our experiments on Japanese weblog posts show that the use of contextual clues improve the performance for both tasks.
