Ensemble methods for classification have been effectively used for decades, while for outlier detection it has only been studied recently. In this work, we design a new ensemble approach for outlier detection in multi-dimensional point data, which provides improved accuracy by reducing error through both bias and variance by considering outlier detection as a binary classification task with unobserved labels. In this paper, we propose a sequential ensemble approach called CARE that employs a two-phase aggregation of the intermediate results in each iteration to reach the final outcome. Unlike existing outlier ensembles, our ensemble incorporates both the parallel and sequential building blocks to reduce bias as well as variance by (i) successively eliminating outliers from the original dataset to build a better data model on which outlierness is estimated (sequentially), and (ii) combining the results from individual base detectors and across iterations (parallelly). Through extensive experiments on 16 real-world datasets mainly from the UCI machine learning repository [1], we show that CARE performs significantly better than or at least similar to the individual baselines as well as the existing state-of-the-art outlier ensembles.
