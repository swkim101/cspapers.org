The foundational structure of a new model of user perception of computer system response time is proposed. It is suggested that the development of such a model is now of central importance to the computer system configuration design effort. The new model is seen to explain the success of an earlier measure, designed for the non-interactive environment, in predicting user estimates of response time for interactive systems. The results of new empirical studies, designed to delineate specific components of the model, are also discussed.
