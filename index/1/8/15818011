Randomization is a key element in sequential and distributed computing. Reasoning about randomized algorithms is highly non-trivial. In the 1980s, this initiated first proof methods, logics, and model-checking algorithms. The field of probabilistic verification has developed considerably since then. This paper surveys the algorithmic verification of probabilistic models, in particular probabilistic model checking. We provide an informal account of the main models, the underlying algorithms, applications from reliability and dependability analysis—and beyond—and describe recent developments towards automated parameter synthesis.
