The state-of-the art in visual object retrieval from large databases allows to search millions of images on the object level. Recently, complementary works have proposed systems to crawl large object databases from community photo collections on the Internet. We combine these two lines of work to a large-scale system for auto-annotation of holiday snaps. The resulting method allows for automatic labeling objects such as landmark buildings, scenes, pieces of art etc. at the object level in a fully automatic manner. The labeling is multi-modal and consists of textual tags, geographic location, and related content on the Internet. Furthermore, the efficiency of the retrieval process is optimized by creating more compact and precise indices for visual vocabularies using background information obtained in the crawling stage of the system. We demonstrate the scalability and precision of the proposed method by conducting experiments on millions of images downloaded from community photo collections on the Internet.
