We describe an algorithm and hardware system of a 3D self-localization method for very cost effective hovering robots. The hardware system consists of very compact calculation and sensor units, instead of using a high performance calculation unit like a laptop PC. In the experiment, the comparison with the ground truth sensor is discussed and implementation of the system on a palm-sized quad-copter is studied to realize a very compact, on-board, fully autonomous quad-copter.
