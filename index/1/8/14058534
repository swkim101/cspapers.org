The S-Map is a network with a simple learning algorithm that combines the self-organization capability of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and the probabilistic interpretability of the Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM). The simulations suggest that the S-Map algorithm has a stronger tendency to self-organize from random initial configuration than the GTM. The S-Map algorithm can be further simplified to employ pure Hebbian learning, without changing the qualitative behaviour of the network.
