In this paper, we address dynamic reconfiguration from the point of view of the enforcement of the policies that organisations wish to see imposed through the way information systems support business. We address the process of evolution by proposing a primitive-coordination context-for modelling the circumstances in which reconfiguration can and should take place. The idea is for business policies to emerge as properties of process executions when controlled through the coordination contexts that will have been defined for supporting business activities.
