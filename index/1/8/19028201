We present a physics-based approach for illuminant color estimation of arbitrary images, which is explicitly designed for handling images with multiple illuminants. The majority of techniques that extract the illuminant color assume that the illumination is constant across the scene. This, however, is not often the case. We propose an illuminant-color estimation method which is based on robust local illuminant estimates. There are no assumptions on the number or type of illuminants. An illuminant color estimate is obtained independently from distinct image mini-regions. From these mini-regions a robust local illumination color is computed by consensus. These local estimates are then used in deriving the chromaticity of the dominant illuminants. Experiments on an established benchmark database of real-world images show that our technique performs comparably to uniform-illuminant estimation methods. Furthermore, extensive tests on real-world images show that we can reliably process mixed illuminant scenes.
