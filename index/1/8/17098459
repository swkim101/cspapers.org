Background: The focus of this research is on the effective harnessing of multiprocessing power through strategies that control shared memory contention and achieve high system capacity. Memory contention results from multiple processes accessing the same variable stored in the shared memory of a multiprocessor system. Preserving the integrity of data requires the serialization of accesses to the shared variable that may lead to a decrease in system performance. The problem is well studied in the context of scientific programs running on multiprocessors. In this research we are concerned with a different environment: a telephone switch that uses a shared memory multiprocessor system. The major components of a telephone switch include line interfaces, the switching fabric, and the call control module. Increasing the capacity of a switch requires scaling up in the capacity (throughput) of each of these components. In this research we are interested in a scalable multiprocessor-based call control module the capacity of which can be improved on demand through the incorporation of additional processors.
