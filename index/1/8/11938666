Model-based Systems Engineering plays a key role in the automotive industry by reducing the development costs while designing more complex controllers. Thanks to the continuous improvement of models accuracy and their computational performance, introducing system simulation in form of “in-the-loop” simulations in early stages of the development is possible. However, this is often limited by the efforts required to integrate and co-simulate heterogeneous models originating from different domains (e.g. electronic, mechanic, hybrid, etc). This work presents a standard-based integration, simulation and analysis solution leveraging the AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture (AUTOSAR) and the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) [1] standard, and enabling a seamless transition from Model- to Software-in-the-loop simulations. Moreover, we demonstrate an accurate powertrain co-simulation based on the above-mentioned solution.
