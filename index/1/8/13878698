Among the many techniques in computer graphics, ray tracing is prized because it can render realistic images, albeit at great computational expense. In this note we explore the performance of several approaches to ray tracing on a distributed memory parallel system. A set of performance instrumentation tools and their associated visualization software are used to identify the underlying causes of performance differences.
