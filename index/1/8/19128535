This is due to the lack of open source implementations provided by the authors. Even if the source code is available, then re-implementing research papers in a different library is a daunting task. To address these challenges, we propose a novel extensible approach, DLPaper2Code, to extract and understand deep learning design flow diagrams and tables available in a research paper and convert them to an abstract computational graph. The extracted computational graph is then converted into execution ready source code in both Keras and Caffe, in real-time. An arXiv-like website is created where the automatically generated designs is made publicly available for 5,000 research papers. The generated designs could be rated and edited using an intuitive drag-and-drop UI framework in a crowd sourced manner. To evaluate our approach, we create a simulated dataset with over 216,000 valid deep learning design flow diagrams using a manually defined grammar. Experiments on the simulated dataset show that the proposed framework provide more than 93% accuracy in flow diagram content extraction.
