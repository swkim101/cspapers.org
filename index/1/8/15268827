In this paper, we consider a 3D grasping problem. In previous work, we presented the central-axis approach and proven its capability to analyze multifingered grasps. In the present paper, we extend our study by developing and analyzing modified force-closure algorithms, and giving rigorous theoretical demonstrations. Through numerical simulations, we show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient when comparing with the qualitative ray-shooting algorithm. The proposed quantitative force-closure test offers a good quality metric without computing the convex hull of the primitive contact wrenches in R6, which efficiently reduces the amount of computation. Several simulation examples showing the efficiency of the proposed approach are included in the paper.
