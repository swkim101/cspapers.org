The COE acrobat robot, called SMB (Super Mechano-Boy), is considered as a model of a gymnast with a horizontal bar. Our final objective is to perform skillful motions with the system same as a gymnast. In this paper, we consider the landing control after actions on the horizontal bar using a linear complementarity problem. We also consider a parameter estimation using the relationship between Lagrange multiplier and sensitivity of the constrained system.
