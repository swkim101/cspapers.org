Analysis of Algorithms Wojciech Szpankowskit spa~cs. purdue. edu We consider a functional-differential equation of the form ah~(z, u)+,8h(z, u) = ~(zap, u). h(zuq, a)+ a(.z, u) with h(O, ti) = 1 where p + q = 1, cz,~ are nonnegative constants, h~(.,.) denotes the partial derivative with respect to z, and a and z are complex numbers, This equation arises in numerous problems in combinatorics, computer science, data compression and molecular biology (e.g., complexity oft he quicksort, number of phrases in the Lempel-Ziv parsing algorithm, enumeration of parsings of given length, external/internal path length in digital search trees, etc.). We obtain an asymptotic solution of this equation for large Z, and apply it to settle some open problems in the area of analysis of algorithms. In particular, we solve a problem posed by Aldous and Shields concerning the limiting distribution of the number of phrases in the fundamental parsing scheme due to Lempel and Ziv. Actually, we reduce this problem to another one, namely, finding the limiting distribution of the internal path length in a digital search tree. In addition, we can enumerate parsings of given length, obtain limiting distribution of the external path lengths of other digital trees such as tries and Patricia tries, and so forth.
