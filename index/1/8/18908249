In this paper we present an intrinsically passive telemanipulation scheme over a digital transmission line Internet-like. We present an analysis of the energetic behavior of the communication line both in case of loss of packages and in case of variable delay. The sample data nature of the passive controller is explicitly taken into account following the approach outlined.
