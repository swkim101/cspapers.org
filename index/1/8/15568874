In this paper we introduce a multilayer cylindrical histogram based feature space for representing 3D shape context of human body. Dynamics of gestures are analyzed using discrete hidden Markov models (DHMM) with quantized feature vectors. Extensive experimental trials with multiple subjects and a range of gesture classes are presented. Gesture recognition accuracies of over 85% (for nine gestures, and 9 subjects) and over 95% (for seven gestures) support the basic feasibility and robustness of the approach.
