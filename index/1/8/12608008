This paper reviews the structured design concept and conventional diagnostic methods. It presents an alternate approach, called structured-trace method, for diagnosing failures on high level packages, which are structurally designed, such as LSSD structure. Implications of structured designs on failure diagnosis are discussed. Results from an evaluation study of the method are presented.
