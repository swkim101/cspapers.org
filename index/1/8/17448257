This paper discusses a dynamic nonprehensile manipulation of a deformable object, where the shape of a thin object is dynamically controlled by the plate's rapid motion. After explaining the manipulation principle, we introduce a simplified analytical model where an object is modeled by two mass points and the plate has two degrees of freedom: a translational motion and a rotational one. After categorizing jump patterns of the mass point with considering the plate's acceleration, we show that gait-like behaviors of the object are generated on the periodic plate's motion. Through simulation analysis, we show the deformation velocity transition of the object with respect to the amplitude of plate's acceleration. We reveal that the transition is characterized by particular amplitudes which govern the jump patterns of the mass point. We make clear that the optimum plate's motion leading to the maximal deformation velocity exists on one of such particular amplitudes.
