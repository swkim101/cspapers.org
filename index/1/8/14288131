We present the tool TAXI which implements the XML-based partition testing approach for the automated generation of XML instances conforming to a given XML schema. In addition it provides a set of weighted test strategies to guide the systematic derivation of instances. TAXI can be used for black-box testing of applications accepting in input XML instances and for benchmarking of database management systems.
