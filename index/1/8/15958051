Attributed translations are a means of specifying the input-output relation of a language processing device, such as for example the lexical or syntax box of a compiler. Considered as a mathematical object, an attributed translation is a mapping of certain strings of attributed “input symbols” into strings of attributed “action symbols”. Under the interpretation that action symbols represent the act of emitting an attributed output or the performing of some other “semantic actions”, and the attributes represent “semantic” information associated with the symbols, the model can be applied in depth to practical compiling problems. Theorems are proved giving conditions under which an attributed translation can be performed by an augmented pushdown machine while it is parsing top down or bottom up. Attributed translations are based on the ideas of attributed grammars [1] and syntax directed translations [2,3]. Other relevant concepts are property grammars and table machines [4], and attributed grammars with relations [5].
