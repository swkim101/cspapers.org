In the physical design of VLSI circuits, routing is one of the most important tasks. Usually done towards the end of the design process, especially the detailed routing phase has to obey virtually all design rules. As the feature size become ever smaller, shifts towards gridless design paradigms are necessary and a formerly trivial task, namely pin access, now becomes difficult.
