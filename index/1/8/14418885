Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a low-rank factorization is commonly employed to speed up matrix problems including matrix completion, subspace tracking, and SDP relaxation. In this paper, we exhibit a step size scheme for SGD on a low-rank least-squares problem, and we prove that, under broad sampling conditions, our method converges globally from a random starting point within $O(\epsilon^{-1} n \log n)$ steps with constant probability for constant-rank problems. Our modification of SGD relates it to stochastic power iteration. We also show experiments to illustrate the runtime and convergence of the algorithm.
