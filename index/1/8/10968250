This paper presents a parametric system, devised and implemented to perform hierarchical planning by delegating the actual search to an external planner (the "parameter") at any level of abstraction, including the ground one. Aimed at giving a better insight of whether or not the exploitation of abstract spaces can be used for solving complex planning problems, comparisons have been made between instances of the hierarchical planner and their non hierarchical counterparts. To improve the significance of the results, three different planners have been selected and used while performing experiments. To facilitate the setting of experimental environments, a novel semi-automatic technique, used to generate abstraction hierarchies starting from ground-level domain descriptions, is also described.
