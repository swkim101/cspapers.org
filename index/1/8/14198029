One of the recent applications of computer technologies is to supply a hard-copy dictionary or encyclopedia on magnetic or optical disks for on-line use [11,16,17]. The major purpose of using a dictionary in daily work will be twofold [10]; one is to find the senses of the words, and the other to look up the spellings of the words. When a dictionary is available on-line*, additional dictionary uses such as easy updating and excerpting are expected [18]. Updating a dictionary, which is inherently a complex task, will be improved by using a powerful editor. Also customized or user-specific dictionaries will be compiled.
