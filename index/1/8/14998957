In this paper, we describe the PROTest II (PROlog Test Environment, Version 2) system to test logic programs in an interactive support environment. Logic programs are augmented with declarative information about the types and modes of the arguments of a predicate. Modes correspond to in, out, and in-out parameters. With this information PROTest II statically checks the types of Prolog programs, generates test cases, executes Prolog programs, and produces reports summarizing results including information about new test coverage metrics. Thus, PROTest II enables both static analysis and dynamic testing uniformly using a Prolog-based test language DTL/1. The strength of PROTest II stems from its idea of defining coverage in real logic programming terms, rather than adapting imperative programming ideas.
