Increased enrollments in computer science programs presents a new challenge of quickly accommodating higher enrollment in computer science introductory courses. Because peer teaching scales with enrollment size, it is a promising solution for supporting computer science students in this setting. However, pedagogical and logistical challenges can arise when implementing a large peer teaching program. To study these challenges, we developed a transparent online tool, My Digital Hand, for tracking one-to-one peer teaching interactions. We deployed the tool across three universities in large CS2 computer science courses. The data gathered confirms the pedagogical and logistical challenges that exist at scale and gives insight into ways we might address them. Using this information, we developed the second iteration of My Digital Hand to better support peer teaching. This paper presents the modified tool for use by the computer science education community.
