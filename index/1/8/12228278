It has been claimed that production systems have several advantages over other representational schemes. These include the potential for general self-augmentation (i.e., learning of new behavior) and the ability to function in complex environments. The production system language, OPS, was implemented to test these claims. In this paper we explore some of the issues that bear on the design of production system languages and try to show the adequacy of OPS for its intended purpose.
