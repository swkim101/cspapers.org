An extended transaction model, called the Adaptive Transaction Model, is proposed for Real-Time Database Management System (RTDBMS) applications where partial and/or approximate results are utilized. The Adaptive Transaction Model is a nested transaction model with optional and required subtransactions. Adaptive Transactions (ATs) have time constraints to support real-time database applications. Optional subtransactions can be eliminated during execution if time (or the scheduling policy) does not permit for completion, thereby reporting partial results. A risk-based transaction load control mechanism determines each transactionâ€™s probability of completion within its deadline as well as the overall system load.
