Scientists use a variety of visualization techniques to help understand computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets, but the interfaces to these techniques are generally two-dimensional and therefore are separated from the 3D view. Both rapid interactive exploration of datasets and precise control over the parameters and placement of visualization techniques are required to understand complex phenomena contained in these datasets. In this paper, we present work in progress on a 3D user interface for exploratory visualization of these datasets.
