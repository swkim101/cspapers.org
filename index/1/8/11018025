Recently, a method to bound the steady-state availability using the failure distance concept has been proposed. In this paper we refine that method by introducing state space exploration techniques. In the methods proposed here, the state space is incrementally generated based on the contributions to the steady-state availability band of the states in the frontier of the currently generated state space. Several state space exploration algorithms are evaluated in terms of bounds quality and memory and CPU time requirements. The more efficient seems to be a waved algorithm which expands transition groups. We compare our new methods with the method based on the failure distance concept without state exploration and a method proposed by Souza e Silva and Ochoa which uses state space exploration but does not use the failure distance concept. Using typical examples we show that the methods proposed here can be significantly more efficient than any of the previous methods.
