It is often considered that high abandonment rate corresponds to poor IR system performance. However several studies suggested that there are so called good abandonments, i.e. situations when search engine result page (SERP) contains enough details to satisfy the user information need without necessity to click on search results. In those papers only editorial metrics of SERP were used, and one cannot be sure that situations marked as good abandonments by assessors actually imply user satisfaction. In present work we propose some real-world evidences for good abandonments by calculating correlation between editorial and click metrics.
