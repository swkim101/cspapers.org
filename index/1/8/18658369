For the selfconsistent solution of the three-dimensional semiconductor device equations large and sparse linear systems of equations have to be solved repeatedly. In order to obtain reliable results with modest demands M. Stiftinger, O. Heinreichsberger, and S. Selberherr on computer resources preconditioned iterative methods for the solution of the linear systems of equations are applied. Various iterative methods for the solution of the nonsymmetric discretized carrier continuity equations, e.g. conjugate gradients applied to the normal equations, a symmetrized conjugate gradient method, GMRES, and CGS, are compared. As preconditioners Jacobi and incomplete LU factorization methods have been investigated. For an efficient implementation on modern vector and vector-concurrent computers special coding techniques have to be applied in order to allow vectorization and/or parallelization of the recurrence relations in the preconditioners. Results obtained on a SIEMENS/Fujitsu VP200, a Cray-2, and on Minisupercomputers such as ALLIANT/FX40 and VAX 6260 are presented.
