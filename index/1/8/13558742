Mental state or workload of a person are very relevant when the person is executing delicate tasks such as piloting an aircraft, operating a crane because the high level of workload could prevent accomplishing the task and lead to disastrous results. Some frameworks have been developed to assess the workload and determine whether the person is capable of executing a new task. However, such methodologies are applied when the operator finished the task. Another feature that these methodologies share is that are based on paper and pencil tests. Therefore, human-friendly devices that could assess the workload in real time are in high demand. In this paper, we report a wearable device that can correlate physical eye behavior with the mental state for the workload assessment.
