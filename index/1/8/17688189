Informally, a permutation family is k-wise independent if any k distinct points are mapped to any k distinct points equally likely; a permutation family is k-rankwise independent if any k distinct points are mapped to any order equally likely; a permutation family is k-restricted rain-wise independent if any element in at most k distinct points is mapped to be the minimum among those images equally likely (note that n-restricted rain-wise independence is referred to simply as rain-wise independence). These permutation families have theoretical applications, e.g., derandomization, universal hashing, search engines, etc. In this paper, we precisely investigate the size of those permutation families and show that (1) for lower bounds, IlCll > n 1 and IlCll ___ (n/2) tk/4J for families C of k-restricted rain-wise and k-rankwise independent permutations on {0, 1, . . . , n 1}, respective!~,; (2) for upper bounds, IlCll ___ n c1+¢2/tg,))~ and IlCll -n °ok / ~"~) for families C of k-restricted rain-wise and k-rankwise independent permutations on {0, 1,... , n 1}, respectively; (3) for optimal upper bounds, IlCll = Icm(n, n 1 , . . . , 1) = e n-°(n) for families C of rain-wise independent permutations on {0, 1 , . . . , n 1}, which achieves the known lower bound. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n 1.1 B a c k g r o u n d a n d Mot iva t ion . The notion of k-wise independence has important theoretical applications, e.g., derandomization applications [11], universal hashing [13], signature schemes [10], etc., and it is also easy to generate k-wise independent random variables with small sample space and to construct a family of k-wise independent functions of small size (see [11]). From the practical and theoretical point of view, it is often convenient to consider k-wise independent permutation families rather than k-wise independent function families, however, we do not know much about how to construct those of smaller size.

Email: junQsw.cas.uec.ac.jp In this paper, we introduce the novel notion of "krankwise independence" that is slightly weaker than that of k-wise independence, and investigate the family size of k-rankwise independent permutations and related permutation families. For any integers i < j , let [i,j] = {i , i + 1 , . . . , j } and Sn be the set of all permutations on [0, n 1]. For a finite set A, we use HAll to denote the cardinality of the set A. DEFINITION 1.1. ([13]) We say that a fami lyC C Sn of permutations is k-wise independent if for any k distinct points x a , . . . , x k E [0,n 1] and any k distinct points y l , . . . , Yk E [0, n 1], {A / 1 Pr ~(xi) = Yi = ~ec n ( n 1 ) . . : i n k + 1)' i=1 when 7r is chosen uniformly at random from C. Recently, Broder, et.al. [4] defined the notion of k-restricted rain-wise independence that is weaker than that of the k-wise independence (the same notion was independently found by Mulmuley [9] in different contexts). Originally, the k-restricted min-wise independence is introduced to estimate the resemblance between documents [3] for detecting almost identical documents on the Web. Indeed, Broder, et.al. [4] showed that a family C C_ Sn of permutations precisely estimates the resemblance between two documents of size not greater than k iff C is k-restricted min-wise independent. DEFINITION 1.2. ([4]) We say that a family C C_ Sn of permutations is k-restricted rain-wise independent if for any X C_ [0,n 1] with 1 < IIXII <_ k and any x E X , 1 P~{min{~r(X)} = 7r(x)} = IlXll' when lr is chosen uniformly at random from C. In particular, we say that a family C C_ Sn of permutations is (exactly) rain-wise independent if C is n-restricted rainwise independent. Several variants of k-restricted min-wise independence are also defined by Broder, et.al. [4], e.g., krestricted rain-wise independence with biased distributions and e-approximately k-restricted min-wise independence. From the practical point of view, e-approximately (k-restricted) min-wise independence would suffice for estimating resemblance between documents [4]
