A resource allocation problem in a reconfigurable multicomputer architecture based on rectangular CC-banyan multistage interconnection network with arbitrary fanout and arbitrary number of levels is studied. Four commonly used problem structures such as ring, pipeline, broadcast and macropipeline are introduced and the mapping problem of these structures on the system model which is camparable to the resource allocation problem, is discussed. Analytic solutions to several mapping questions are presented and a new fault diagnosis method based on the solution to the problem of mapping the ring structure is given.
