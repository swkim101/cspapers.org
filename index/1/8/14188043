A decision support system for fault classification is presented. The fault classification scheme is developed to provide guidance in process improvement and fault-based testing. The research integrates results in fault classification, source code analysis, and fault-based testing research. Initial results indicate that existing change type and fault classification schemes are insufficient for this purpose. Development of sufficient schemes and their evaluation are discussed.
