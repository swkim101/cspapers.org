Machine learning and data mining can be effectively used to model, classify and discover interesting information for a wide variety of data including email. The Email Mining Toolkit, EMT, has been designed to provide a wide range of analyses for arbitrary email sources. Depending upon the task, one can usually achieve very high accuracy, but with some amount of false positive tradeoff. Generally false positives are prohibitively expensive in the real world. In the case of spam detection, for example, even if one email is misclassified, this may be unacceptable if it is a very important email. Much work has been done to improve specific algorithms for the task of detecting unwanted messages, but less work has been report on leveraging multiple algorithms and correlating models in this particular domain of email analysis.EMT has been updated with new correlation functions allowing the analyst to integrate a number of EMT's user behavior models available in the core technology. We present results of combining classifier outputs for improving both accuracy and reducing false positives for the problem of spam detection. We apply these methods to a very large email data set and show results of different combination methods on these corpora. We introduce a new method to compare multiple and combined classifiers, and show how it differs from past work. The method analyzes the relative gain and maximum possible accuracy that can be achieved for certain combinations of classifiers to automatically choose the best combination.
