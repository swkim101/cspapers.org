The Internet of Things (IoT), considered by many to be the next big revolution in computing, refers to the trend to include networking and computing in a wide range of devices, such as watches, appliances, health monitors, toys, etc. Including IoT applications early in the curriculum may serve multiple pedagogical purposes, such as demonstrating social relevance, (e.g., health monitoring applications) and motivating other CS topics (e.g. distributed systems, networking, OOP, event driven programming, computer organization, and databases). This workshop will introduce participants to basic terms and technologies behind IoT. Participants will then work through a hands-on, classroom-ready exercise to build a complete IoT solution. The embedded portion of this solution, based on the popular Arduino platform (hardware provided), will be targeted at students who have completed CS1. The completion of a mobile app that interacts with the embedded devices will require CS2 skills. Participants should have an interest in IoT or be interested in engaging assignments for both introductory and upper level students. Participants are asked to bring a laptop computer and a recent mobile device, with appropriate software tools installed. Links to these tools, as well as a list of compatible mobile devices, will be provided. Most Android and iOS devices made within the last three years are suitable.
