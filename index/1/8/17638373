The present paper addresses strategies of changing the reference trajectories of the future ZMP that are used for online repetitive walking pattern generation. Walking pattern generation operates with a cycle of 20 [ms], and the reference ZMP trajectory is adjusted according to the current actual motion status in order to maintain the current balance. Three different strategies are considered for adjusting the ZMP. The first strategy is to change the reference ZMP inside the sole area. The second strategy is to change the position of the next step, and the third strategy is to change the duration of the current step. The manner in which these changes affect the current balance and how to combine the three strategies are discussed. The proposed methods are implemented as part of an online walking control system with short cycle pattern generation and are evaluated using the HRP-2 full-sized humanoid robot.
