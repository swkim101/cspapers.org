Most cross-lingual sentiment classification (CLSC) research so far has been performed at sentence or document level. Aspect-level CLSC, which is more appropriate for many applications, presents the additional difficulty that we consider subsentential opinionated units which have to be mapped across languages. In this paper, we extend the possible cross-lingual sentiment analysis settings to aspect-level specific use cases. We propose a method, based on constrained SMT, to transfer opinionated units across languages by preserving their boundaries. We show that cross-language sentiment classifiers built with this method achieve comparable results to monolingual ones, and we compare different cross-lingual settings.
