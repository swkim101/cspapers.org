In many robotic processes such as milling and drilling, there are multiple solutions for robot poses, as the rotation around the tool axis remains as a degree of freedom (DoF) in positioning. Yet until now, this DoF causes additional efforts in CAM programming as it requires manual intervention. Instead, this DoF can be used to optimize the robot pose according to different criteria of the robot such as stiffness or avoidance of backlash effects. This paper presents different criteria for optimization of the robot pose in machining and describes the optimization of robot stiffness based on a novel method for its identification, which is in detail described on this paper. Furthermore, the potential of the automatic resolution of the DoF is outlined enabling staff without robot knowledge to define reasonable robot paths.
