Energy Harvesting Active Networked Tags (EnHANTs) will be a new class of devices in the domain between RFIDs and sensor networks. Small, flexible, and energetically self-reliant, EnHANTs will be attached to objects that are traditionally not networked, such as books, furniture, toys, produce, and clothing. More information about the EnHANTs project is available at http://enhants.ee.columbia.edu. In this demo we present a small network of EnHANT prototypes. The current EnHANT prototypes are integrated with novel custom in-house-developed energy harvesting and communications hardware, namely organic solar cells and ultra-wide-band impulse radio (UWB-IR) transceivers. The demo showcases prototypes communicating using the novel UWB-IR transceivers and adapting their communications and networking parameters to the available environmental energy harvested by the organic solar cells.
