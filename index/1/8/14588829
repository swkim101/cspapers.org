We present the first near optimal approximation schemes for the 
maximum weighted (uncapacitated or capacitated) $b$--matching 
problems for non-bipartite graphs that run in time (near) linear in 
the number of edges. For any $\delta>3/\sqrt{n}$ the algorithm 
produces a $(1-\delta)$ approximation in $O(m \poly(\delta^{-1},\log 
n))$ time. We provide fractional solutions for the standard linear 
programming formulations for these problems and subsequently also 
provide (near) linear time approximation schemes 
for rounding the fractional solutions. 
Through these problems as a vehicle, we also present several ideas 
in the context of solving linear programs approximately using fast 
primal-dual algorithms. First, even though the dual of these 
problems have exponentially many variables and an efficient exact 
computation of dual weights is infeasible, we show that we can 
efficiently compute and use a sparse approximation of the dual 
weights using a combination of (i) adding perturbation to the 
constraints of the polytope and (ii) amplification followed by 
thresholding of the dual weights. Second, we show that 
approximation algorithms can be used to reduce the width of the 
formulation, and faster convergence.
