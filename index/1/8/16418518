While many colleges offer specialized security courses and tracks for students in computing majors, there are few offerings in information security for the non-computing majors. Information security is becoming increasingly critical in many fields, yet most computer literacy courses insufficiently address the security challenges faced by our graduates. This paper discusses the development and impact of a set of modules designed to integrate security into computer literacy across two universities and several community colleges in the state of Maryland. Results from our comparative analyses based on pre- and post- test analysis show significant improvements in post-test results.
