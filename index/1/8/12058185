One of the main benefits of multicast communication is the overall reduction of network load. To quantify this reduction, when compared to traditional unicast, experimental studies by Chuang and Sirbu indicated the so called <i>power law</i> which asserts that the ratio <i>R</i>(<i>n</i>) of the average number of links in a multicast delivery tree connecting <i>n</i> sites to the average number of links in a unicast path is Θ(<i>n</i><sup>0.8</sup>). Our goal is to explain theoretically this behavior. Claiming that the essence of the phenomenon lies in the geometry of the internet and its modeling assumptions, we introduce the model of <i>self-similar</i> trees with similarity factor 0 ≤ θ < 1. Under this assumption, we analyze <i>R</i>(<i>n</i>) and prove that it is Θ(<i>n</i><sup>1-θ</sup>). We also discuss some experimental results of real networks that confirm the power law and show that these networks have the self similar profile. In particular, we find experimentally that the power law holds with θ<inf>exp</inf> ≈ 0.12. Our theoretical findings are established by analytical techniques of the precise analysis of algorithms such as Mellin transform and complex asymptotics.
