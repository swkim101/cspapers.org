This paper primarily discusses the problem of the initial projects to be used in introducing students to a programming language. Examples are given of projects used for time-shared BASIC. Because of the expense, CAI was not considered practical for use in the introductory courses, even though the TUTOR series of courses (to learn BASIC) was available.
