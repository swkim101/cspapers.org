In this paper, we present haptic teleoperation of underactuated unmanned aerial vehicles by providing a multidimensional generalization of the virtual slave concept. The proposed control architecture is composed of high-level and low-level controllers. The high-level controller commands the vehicle to accomplish specific tasks and renders both the state and the environment of the vehicle to the operator through haptic feedback. The low-level controller interprets the command signals from the operator, regulates the dynamics of the vehicle and feeds back its state to the high-level loop. Passivity of the teleoperation loop is always ensured independently of the choice of implementation of the low-level controller and the configuration of the flying hardware by a passivity-enforcing supervisor, which associates every action of the slave with an energy expense that can only be made available from a multi-state energy tank. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated with simulations and experimental tests.
