The use of the cognitive capabilties of humans to help guide the autonomy of robotics platforms in what is typically called “supervised-autonomy” is becoming more commonplace in robotics research. The work discussed in this paper presents an approach to a human-in-the-loop mode of robot operation that integrates high level human cognition and commanding with the intelligence and processing power of autonomous systems. Our framework for a “Supervised Remote Robot with Guided Autonomy and Teleoperation” (SURROGATE) is demonstrated on a robotic platform consisting of a pan-tilt perception head, two 7-DOF arms connected by a single 7-DOF torso, mounted on a tracked-wheel base. We present an architecture that allows high-level supervisory commands and intents to be specified by a user that are then interpreted by the robotic system to perform whole body manipulation tasks autonomously. We use a concept of “behaviors” to chain together sequences of “actions” for the robot to perform which is then executed real time.
