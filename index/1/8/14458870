With a focus on commodity PC systems, Beowulf clusters traditionally lack the cutting edge network architectures, memory subsystems, and processor technologies found in their more expensive supercomputer counterparts. What Beowulf clusters lack in technology, they more than make up for with their significant cost advantage over traditional supercomputers. This paper presents the cost implications of an architectural extension that adds reconfigurable computing to the network interface of Beowulf clusters. A quantitative idea of cost-effectiveness is formulated to evaluate computing technologies. Here, cost-effectiveness is considered in the context of two applications: the 2D Fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) and integer sorting.
