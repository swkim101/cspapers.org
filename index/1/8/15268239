We have proposed a novel method to provide human tactile sensation using surface acoustic wave (SAW). A pulse modulated driving voltage excites temporal distribution of standing SAW. The distribution generates friction shift on the surface of a SAW substrate. When the surface with burst SAW is explored, the friction shift can be perceived as tactile sensation at mechanoreceptors in the finger skin. For real reproduction of tactile sensation, the burst frequency was controlled according to measured rubbing motion. We discussed the control parameters and their arrangement. Required parameters and their tuning for the tactile display were investigated.
