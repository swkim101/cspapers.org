We study the simultaneous detection of multiple structures in the presence of overwhelming number of outliers in a large population of points. Our approach reduces the problem to sampling an extremely sparse subset of the original population of data in one grab, followed by an unsupervised clustering of the population based on a set of instantiated models from this sparse subset. We show that the problem can be modeled using a multivariate hypergeometric distribution, and derive accurate mathematical bounds to determine a tight approximation to the sample size, leading thus to a sparse sampling strategy. We evaluate the method thoroughly in terms of accuracy, its behavior against varying input parameters, and comparison against existing methods, including the state of the art. The key features of the proposed approach are: (i) sparseness of the sampled set, where the level of sparseness is independent of the population size and the distribution of data, (ii) robustness in the presence of overwhelming number of outliers, and (iii) unsupervised detection of all model instances, i.e. without requiring any prior knowledge of the number of embedded structures. To demonstrate the generic nature of the proposed method, we show experimental results on different computer vision problems, such as detection of physical structures e.g. lines, planes, etc., as well as more abstract structures such as fundamental matrices, and homographies in multi-body structure from motion.
