This paper describes the VHSIC Program and seeks to delineate the challenges for design automation which are vital to the Program's success. More than one-half of the VHSIC Program will focus on design architecture, software, and test. Because of the extreme importance of advanced militarized integrated circuits to our defense posture, alternatives to controlling the premature export of circuits, equipment, and technical data will be briefly reviewed. Finally, the opportunity to synergistically solve VHSIC design problems while significantly reducing software costs is discussed.
