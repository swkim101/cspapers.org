In open systems, no global scheduler has knowledge of the complete resource requirements from all the applications. Each application has its own task group and can generate tasks on demand at run time. Regularity-based Resource Partition (RRP) model is an effective strategy to hierarchically allocate resource in such environments. However, when applying the RRP model to multi-resource environments, end-to-end tasks could experience unexpected delay and miss the deadlines. The tasks might arrive at non-resource-slice boundaries because the resource slice sizes of different physical resource may vary in such non-uniform environments. This paper extends the RRP model to non-uniform multi-resource open systems. It introduces a novel composite resource partition abstraction, identifies the feasible conditions for hierarchical regular composite resource partitioning and proposes an acyclic regular composite resource partition scheduling (ARCRPS) algorithm. Simulation results show that compared with the state-of-the-art approach, ARCRPS improves the acceptance ratio by 20% and 25% in uniform and non-uniform multi-resource environments, respectively. A multi-resource scheduling framework jointly considering the CPU and network resources is also designed and implemented to evaluate the feasibility of this theoretical model in practice.
