. Owing to widespread user mobility, limited radio resources, and changing network characteristics. supporting multimedia communications in a mobile intemetworking environment is a challenging problem. In this paper; we present an “adaptive reserved service” framework for use in integrated services networks to support mobile connections carrying multimedia traffic. Reserved bandwidth in the fixed network is dynamically adjusted based on resource availability in the wireless network. Integrated in the framework are an anticipatory handoff control mechanism which enables .fast hand08 and an adaptive link partitioning scheme which enhances hand08 success. An accompanying reservation protocol not only facilitates distributed control of mobile connections but also provides network feedback to mobile hosts,
