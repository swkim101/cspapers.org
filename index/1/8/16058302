In a recent paper we developed a new cryptanalytic technique based on impossible diierentials, and used it to attack the Skip-jack encryption algorithm reduced from 32 to 31 rounds. In this paper we describe the application of this technique to the block ciphers IDEA, Khufu and Khafre. In the case of IDEA, the new attacks have smaller complexities and cover more rounds than the best currently known attacks. This demonstrates the power of the new cryptanalytic technique, shows that it is applicable to a larger class of cryptosystems, and develops new technical tools for applying it in new situations.
