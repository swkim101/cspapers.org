An intelligent user interface (POISE) is described that provides facilities for defining and supporting higher-level user tasks. Although an object-based data model forms an important part of the POISE system, other types of knowledge such as task descriptions and tool descriptions are required. The management of instantiations of the task and object descriptions is a complex process because POISE both predicts user actions and allows multiple, competing interpretations of user actions. In this paper, we describe how the knowledge base (including the object data model) is defined and used by the intelligent interface. We also describe an implementation of the knowledge base in a frame-based representation language.
