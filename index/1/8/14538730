Publish/subscribe is emerging as a very flexible communication paradigm that is applicable to environments demanding scalable and evolvable architectures. Although considered for workflow, electronic commerce, mobile systems, and others, security issues have long been neglected in publish/subscribe systems. Recent advances address this issue, but only on a low, technical level. In this paper, we analyze the trust relationships between producers, consumers, and the notification infrastructure. We devise groups of trust to model and implement security constraints both on the application and the system level. The concept of scopes helps to localize and implement security policies as an aspect of structured publish/subscribe systems.
