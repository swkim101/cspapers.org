We conducted an Artiﬁcial Language Learning experiment to examine the production behavior of language learners in a dynamic communicative setting. Participants were exposed to a miniature language with two optional formal devices and were then asked to use the acquired language to transfer information in a cooperative game. The results showed that language learners optimize their use of the optional formal devices to transfer information efﬁciently and that they avoid the production of ambiguous information. These re-sults could be used within the context of a language model such that the model can more accurately reﬂect the production behavior of human language learners.
