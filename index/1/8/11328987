Solutions to the duplicate database update problem are considered, and a formal validation technique using the theory of L systems is developed and applied to the problem. The paper shows some particular solutions but is primarily concerned with general properties of the problem, convenient representational techniques, and formal proof procedures which are general enough to apply to this and to a number of other problems in parallel processing and synchronization.
