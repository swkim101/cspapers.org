This paper presents a passivity based compliance stabilizer for humanoid robots. The proposed stabilizer is an admittance controller that uses the force/torque sensing in feet to actively regulate the compliance for the position controlled system. The low stiffness provided by the stabilizer permits compliant interaction with external forces, and the active damping control guarantees the passivity by dissipating the excessive energy delivered by disturbances. Both the theoretical work and simulation validations are presented. The effectiveness of the stabilizer is demonstrated by the simulations of a simplified cart-table model and the multi-body model of a humanoid under impulsive/periodic force perturbations during standing and walking in place. Simulation data show the quantitative evaluation of the stabilization effect by comparing the responses of body attitude, center of mass, center of pressure without and with the stabilizer.
