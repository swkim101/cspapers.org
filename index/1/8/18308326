A new lunar exploration mission including a lander and rovers is under studying in Japan. The main mission for lunar robotics exploration is to demonstrate the technologies for lunar or planetary surface exploration. They will cover pin-point landing technology, reliable landing scheme with obstacle avoidance, landing mechanism on rough terrain, exploration rover and tele-science technology. Lunar geologic survey will be also performed to investigate the underground materials. The working group has been conducting the feasibility study of advanced technologies for lunar robotics exploration. In the rover mission, a robotic manipulator plays an important role as scientific observation tools for geological exploration. This paper proposes a light-weight manipulator with low-power consumption function. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed design, a manipulator was developed. This paper describes a proposed smart manipulator system. This paper also presents the environment test results on Ultra-Sonic Motor. The performance of the developed smart manipulator is discussed.
