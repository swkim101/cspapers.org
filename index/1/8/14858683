Mechatronic systems are embedded software systems with hard real-time requirements. Predictability is of paramount importance for these systems. Thus, their design has to take the worst-case into account and the maximal required resources are usually allocated upfront by each process. This is safe, but usually results in a rather poor resource utilization. If in contrast resource-aware agents, which are able to allocate and free resources in a controllable safe manner, instead of thumb processes are present, then a resource manager will coordinate their safe dynamic resource allocation at run time. But given such a resource manager, how can we transform thumb processes into smart resource-aware agents? Starting with mechatronic components that describe their reconfiguration by means of statecharts, we present how to automatically synthesize the additional information and code, which enables a process to become a resource-aware agent.
