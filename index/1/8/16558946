A B S T R A C T User interfaces for color selection are based upon art underlying color model. There is widespread belief, and some evidence, that color models produce significant differences in human performance. We performed a colormatching experiment using an interface with high levels of feedback. With this interface, we observed no differences in speed or accuracy between the RGB and HSV color models, but found that increasing feedback improved accuracy of matching. We suggest that feedback may be an important factor in usability of a color selection interface.
