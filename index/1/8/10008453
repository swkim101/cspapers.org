Understanding query ambiguity in web search remains an important open problem. In this paper we reexamine query ambiguity by analyzing the result clickthrough data. Previously proposed clickthrough-based metrics of query ambiguity tend to conflate informational and ambiguous queries. To distinguish between these query classes, we introduce novel metrics based on the entropy of the click distributions of individual searchers. Our experiments over a clickthrough log of commercial search engine demonstrate the benefits of our approach for distinguishing informational from truly ambiguous queries.
