Automated consistency checking of UML models becomes necessary as models grow in size and complexity. Because the UML metamodel does not enforce model consistency, there are no guidelines as how to approach the consistency problem. Current solutions are partial and tools are mostly of academic nature. The translation of the metamodel and the user designed model into Description Logics has proved to be useful in detecting a large set of inconsistencies. We present MCC, a UML model consistency checker, built as a plug-in for Poseidon for UML, and relying on Racer as a reasoning engine. We propose a usable and scalable solution, interoperable with a known modeling tool.
