The integrated Data Model integrates concepts from three information disciplines: database systems, artificial intelligence, and programming languages. Key concepts are those of abstract type (allowing multiple implementations), object (possibly having multiple types), and relation (definable by logical formulas). This paper provides a brief overview of the model from a database perspective.
