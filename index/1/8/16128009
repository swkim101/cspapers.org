In the distributed multi-sensor data fusion system composed of radar and infrared sensor, the track correlation is one of the key techniques and is also sophisticated because the types of the sensors are different and both of them don’t possess the consistent measurement space. This paper presents a radar-infrared sensor track correlation algorithm using the grey correlation analysis of grey system theory. In this algorithm, each track’s bearing information is considered as a discrete function of time, the grey correlation analysis for multi-target track’s bearing information is performed by using the B-mode correlation degree, the matrix of track-to-track’s grey correlation degree of the B-mode is calculated and the track correlation pairs are determined. Experimental results indicate that this algorithm can effectively accomplish track correlation for the multi-sensor data fusion system composed of radar and infrared sensor.
