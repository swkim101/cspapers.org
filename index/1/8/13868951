Child-robot interaction is an interdisciplinary research area that has been attracting growing interest, primarily focusing on edutainment applications. A crucial factor to the successful deployment and wide adoption of such applications remains the robust perception of the child's multimodal actions, when interacting with the robot in a natural and untethered fashion. Since robotic sensory and perception capabilities are platform-dependent and most often rather limited, we propose a multiple Kinect-based system to perceive the child-robot interaction scene that is robot-independent and suitable for indoors interaction scenarios. The audio-visual input from the Kinect sensors is fed into speech, gesture, and action recognition modules, appropriately developed in this paper to address the challenging nature of child-robot interaction. For this purpose, data from multiple children are collected and used for module training or adaptation. Further, information from the multiple sensors is fused to enhance module performance. The perception system is integrated in a modular multi-robot architecture demonstrating its flexibility and scalability with different robotic platforms. The whole system, called Multi3, is evaluated, both objectively at the module level and subjectively in its entirety, under appropriate child-robot interaction scenarios containing several carefully designed games between children and robots.
