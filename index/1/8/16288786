3D NAND has been proposed to provide a large capacity storage with low-cost consideration due to its high density memory architecture. However, 3D NAND needs to consume enormous time for garbage collection because of live-page copying overhead and long block erase time. To alleviate the impact of live-page copying on the performance of 3D NAND, a sub-block erase design has been designed. With sub-block erase design, this paper proposes a performance booster strategy to extremely boost the performance of garbage collection. As experimental results shows, the proposed strategy has a significant improvement on the average response time.
