This paper examines some of the problems and issues involved in designing a practical deductive inference processor to augment a data management system, as well as some of the benefits that can be expected from such an augmentation. A deductive processor design is presented that incorporates new techniques for selecting, from large collections of mostly irrelevant general assertions and specific facts, the small number needed for deriving an answer to a particular query.
