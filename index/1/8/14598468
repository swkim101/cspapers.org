An edge cover of a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex has at least an adjacent edge in it. We design a very simple deterministic fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for counting the number of edge covers for any graph. Previously, approximation algorithm is only known for 3 regular graphs and it is randomized [3]. Our main technique is correlation decay, which is a powerful tool to design FPTAS for counting problems. In order to get FPTAS for general graphs without degree bound, we make use of a stronger notion called computationally efficient correlation decay, which was introduced in [19].
