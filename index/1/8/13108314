Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is a progressive area that tries to fill the gap between problem definition and software development. There are many modeling languages proposed for use in MDE. A challenge is how to provide automatic analysis for these models without having to create new analyzers for each different language. In this research, we tackle this problem for a family of modeling languages using a semantically configurable model translation framework.
