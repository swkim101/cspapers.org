Wireless sensor networks research has, till date, made impressive advances in platforms and software services. Research in the area has moved on to consider an essential piece of sensor network technology---support for programming wireless sensor network applications and systems components at a suitably high level of abstraction. Two broad classes of programming models are currently being investigated by the community. One class focuses on providing higher-level abstractions for specifying a node's local behavior in a distributed computation. Examples of this approach include the recent work on node-local or region-based abstractions. By contrast, a second and less-explored class of research considers programming a sensor network in the large called macroprogramming.
