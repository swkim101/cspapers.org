Much of the research that has taken place over the past ten years has focused on finding the link between the scientific aspects of computer technology and the non-scientific aspects of design. In the academic environment, this has resulted in the treatment of computers and design as separate entities. Teaching according to this concept has made it difficult for architecture students to comprehend exactly what role the computer could play in the development of their own individual design process. The College of Environmental Design at the University of Oklahoma is somewhat unique among schools of architecture in that only recently has it begun to develop curriculum input related to the topic of computer aided design. After almost eight years of researching and teaching this topic, This unique situation has offered me the opportunity to take a fresh new look at how computer aided design should be taught.
