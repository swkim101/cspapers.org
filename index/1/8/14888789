In this paper, we introduce the main components comprising the action-perception loop of an overarching framework implementing artificial attention, designed to fulfil the requirements of social interaction (i.e., reciprocity, and awareness), with strong inspiration on current theories in functional neuroscience. We demonstrate the potential of our framework, by showing how it exhibits coherent behaviour without any inbuilt prior expectations regarding the experimental scenario. Current research in cognitive systems for social robots has suggested that automatic attention mechanisms are essential to social interaction. In fact, we hypothesise that enabling artificial cognitive systems with middleware implementing these mechanisms will empower robots to perform adaptively and with a higher degree of autonomy in complex and social environments. However, this type of assumption is yet to be convincingly and systematically put to the test. The ultimate goal will be to test our working hypothesis and the role of attention in adaptive, social robotics.
