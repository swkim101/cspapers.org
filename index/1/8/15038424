Standard object-oriented languages do not provide language support for modeling changing collections of interdependent objects. We propose that R++, an integration of the rule and object-oriented paradigms, provides a mechanism for easily implementing such models. R++ extends C++ by adding a new programming construct called the path-based rule. Such data-driven rules are restricted to follow pointers between objects, and are like "automatic methods" that are triggered by changes to monitored objects. Path-based rules encourage a more abstract level of programming, and unlike previous rule integrations, are not at odds with the object-oriented paradigm and offer performance advantages for natural applications.
