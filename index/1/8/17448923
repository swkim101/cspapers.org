Partial discharge(PD) gray intensity image is regarded as the research object in this paper, a new principle and method based on genetic programming is proposed to extract PD features aiming at PRPD mode, This article firstly introduces the PRPD mode and the method to get the three-dimensional spectrum and two-dimensional gray intensity image, then gray intensity images identification technology based on genetic programming is introduced, Furthermore, the paper presents software flow chart of search algorithm of gray intensity image recognition. Finally, the results of experiment are given. Compared with the original image recognition technology, this method provides an effective pathway for the better recognition in image information, Using this method, the storage requirement and the calculation involved may be reduced, the results show that it is effective.
