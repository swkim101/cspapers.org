Research on continual computation centers on developing precomputation policies that can effectively harness available resources to solve future challenges. We focus on integrating a consideration of offline and real-time resources in continual computation. We review precomputation policies for flexible procedures and present strategies that account for the expected future real-time refinement of a result following precomputation. Finally, we address policies that consider the tradeoff between the efficiency of solving current and potential future challenges.
