Presents a versatile scheduling model and an efficient control synthesis methodology which enables architectural (high-level) design/synthesis systems to seamlessly support a broad range of architectural design applications from datapath-dominated digital signal processing (DSP) to commodity ICs such as microprocessors/microcontrollers and control-dominated peripherals, utilizing multiphase clocking schemes, multiple threading, data-dependent delays, pipelining, and combinations of the above. The work presented in this paper is an enabling technology for high-level synthesis to go beyond traditional datapath-dominated DSP applications and to start becoming a viable and cost-effective design methodology for commodity ICs.
