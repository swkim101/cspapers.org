Analysis of multidimensional data is challenging. Topological invariants can be used to summarize essential features of such data sets. In this work, we propose to compute the Betti numbers from a generative model based on a simplicial complex learnt from the data. The algorithm called a Generative Simplicial Complex can extract topological features from multidimensional datasets with non-trivial underlying topological structure, and from a real data set. We compare it to the Witness Complex, a geometric technique based on nearest neighbors.
