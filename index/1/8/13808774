Knowledge base completion (KBC) involves in discovering missing facts. However, knowledge changes over time. Some facts need to be removed from knowledge base (KB) to keep knowledge base integrity (KBI) while new facts are inserted or old facts are deleted. This paper proposes a path-based learning model to learn the dependency of dynamic relations automatically. In this way, we can eliminate the conflicting facts and keep KB clean. That would be a significant benefit for KBC and other tasks using KB.
