A Sequence OLAP (S-OLAP) system provides a platform on which pattern-based aggregate (PBA) queries on a sequence database are evaluated. In its simplest form, a PBA query consists of a pattern template T and an aggregate function F. A pattern template is a sequence of variables, each is defined over a domain. For example, the template T = (X,Y ,Y ,X) consists of two variables X and Y . Each variable is instantiated with all possible values in its corresponding domain to derive all possible patterns of the template. Sequences are grouped based on the patterns they possess. The answer to a PBA query is a sequence cuboid (s-cuboid), which is a multidimensional array of cells. Each cell is associated with a pattern instantiated from the query's pattern template. The value of each s-cuboid cell is obtained by applying the aggregate function F to the set of data sequences that belong to that cell. Since a pattern template can involve many variables and can be arbitrarily long, the induced s-cuboid for a PBA query can be huge. For most analytical tasks, however, only iceberg cells with very large aggregate values are of interest. This paper proposes an efficient approach to identify and evaluate iceberg cells of s-cuboids. Experimental results show that our algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches.
