We present the design of a systems laboratory intended for advanced undergraduates and graduate students. The laboratory provides an environment in which students are given complete (root) control of systems with essentially unrestricted access to the Internet. This is achieved without jeopardizing the security of the departmental network of which the laboratory is a part. Students in the laboratory are also given a secure environment in which to do their work. Such a laboratory is most valuable in advanced courses in operating systems and networks in which students implement and evaluate algorithms and policies subjected to real workloads. It is also valuable as a facility for research on systems and network topics, providing an open, yet safe, environment in which to work.
