In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to simultaneously name faces and discover scenes in TV shows. We follow the multi-modal idea of utilizing script to assist video content understanding, but without using timestamp (provided by script-subtitles alignment) as the connection. Instead, the temporal relation between faces in the video and names in the script is investigated in our approach, and an global optimal video-script alignment is inferred according to the character correspondence. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) we propose a generative model, named TVParser, to depict the temporal character correspondence between video and script, from which face-name relationship can be automatically learned as a model parameter, and meanwhile, video scene structure can be effectively inferred as a hidden state sequence; (2) we find fast algorithms to accelerate both model parameter learning and state inference, resulting in an efficient and global optimal alignment. We conduct extensive comparative experiments on popular TV series and report comparable and even superior performance over existing methods.
