In a variety of modern mining applications, data are commonly viewed as infinite time ordered data streams rather as finite data sets stored on disk. This view challenges fundamental assumptions commonly made in the context of several data mining algorithms.In this paper, we study the problem of identifying correlations between multiple data streams. In particular, we propose algorithms capable of capturing correlations between multiple continuous data streams in a highly efficient and accurate manner. Our algorithms and techniques are applicable in the case of both synchronous and asynchronous data streaming environments. We capture correlations between multiple streams using the well known technique of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Correlations between data items, and the SVD technique in particular, have been repeatedly utilized in an off-line (non stream) data mining problems, for example forecasting, approximate query answering, and data reduction.We propose a methodology based on a combination of dimensionality reduction and sampling to make the SVD technique suitable for a data stream context. Our techniques are approximate, trading accuracy with performance, and we analytically quantify this tradeoff. We present a through experimental evaluation, using both real and synthetic data sets, from a prototype implementation of our technique, investigating the impact of various parameters in the accuracy of the overall computation. Our results indicate, that correlations between multiple data streams can be identified very efficiently and accurately. The algorithms proposed herein, are presented as generic tools, with a multitude of applications on data stream mining problems.
