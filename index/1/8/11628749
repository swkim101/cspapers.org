In the past years wearable computing devices, such as head-mounted displays, and ubiquitous computing increasingly gained importance. Head-mounted displays are comprised of a front-facing camera and a little screen in front of the user's eye. They provide their users with a seamless extension of their perceptual abilities in an unobtrusive and user-friendly manner. The Ubic-framework combines these new devices with mathematically sound digital cryptographic primitives and resource-friendly computer vision techniques to provide users with novel security and privacy guarantees in their everyday life. In our hands-on demo we show how Ubic allows users to read encrypted and verify digitally signed physical documents. In addition, we present an identification scheme, which is secure against real-world attacks, such as skimming and shoulder-surfing, but remains user friendly and easily deployable in current infrastructures. The Ubic-framework first appeared at ESORICS 2014.
