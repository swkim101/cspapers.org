The goal of my research is to understand speech input in a continuous manner by treating the input stream as fragmental utterances. This allows us to use various approaches to predict what comes downstream. Possible interpretations are trimmed by such predictions which in turn also allow us to complete information not readily available in the fragmental utterance. Semantic frames can encode all possible arguments for domain actions. As utterances are processed continuously, appropriate frames can be activated so that fragment interpretations can fill, correct or extend frames under consideration. In turn, feedback can be provided to the parser as the frames are manipulated possibly based on the completeness of the semantic frame construction.
