But these networks are usually isolated from each other. Mapping common users across these social networks will benefit many applications. Methods based on username comparison perform well on parts of users, however they can not work in the following situations: (a) users choose different usernames in different networks; (b) a unique username corresponds to different individuals. In this paper, we propose to utilize social structures to improve the mapping performance. Specifically, a novel subspace learning algorithm, Manifold Alignment on Hypergraph (MAH), is proposed. Different from traditional semi-supervised manifold alignment methods, we use hypergraph to model high-order relations here. For a target user in one network, the proposed algorithm ranks all users in the other network by their possibilities of being the corresponding user. Moreover, methods based on username comparison can be incorporated into our algorithm easily to further boost the mapping accuracy. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in mapping users across networks.
