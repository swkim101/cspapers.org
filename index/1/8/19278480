We describe a technique for determining the thresholds for the appearance of cores in random structures. We use it to determine (i) the threshold for the pure literal rule to find a satisfying assignment for a random instance of <i>r</i>-SAT, <i>r</i> ≥ 3, and (ii) the threshold for the appearance of a <i>k</i>-core in a random <i>r</i>-uniform hypergraph for all <i>r, k</i> ≥ 2, <i>r</i> + <i>k</i> > 4.
