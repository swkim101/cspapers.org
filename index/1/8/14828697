Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) which contain heterogeneous nodes and monitor multiple phenomena present a unique set of challenges in regards to efficient management of reactive behavior. The ECA (on Event if Condition then Action) paradigm from Active Databases offers a solution via event-based synchronization which provides reduced energy consumption compared to continuous monitoring. In our demo, we show how to utilize this approach via compilation of system-level ECA triggers to mote-specific trigger code. We also demonstrate the practicality of the approach by constructing a heterogeneous WSN of TelosB/SunSPOT motes and using our tools to implement reactive behaviors based on temperature/luminance data.
