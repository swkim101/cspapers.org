Requirement-based automated test case generation is a model-based technique for generating test suites related to individual requirements. The technique supports test generation from EFSM (Extended Finite State Machine) system models. Several requirement-based selective test generation techniques were proposed. These techniques may significantly reduce a number of test cases with respect to a requirement under test as opposed to a complete system testing. However, the number of test cases may still be very large especially for large systems. In this paper, we present an approach of reduction of requirement based test suites using EFSM dependence analysis. Different types of dependencies are identified between elements of the EFSM system model. These dependencies capture potential interactions between elements of the model and are used to determine parts of the model that affect a requirement under test. This information is used to reduce the test suite by identifying repetitive tests, i.e., tests that exhibit the same pattern of interactions with respect to the requirement under test. Our initial experience shows that this approach may significantly reduce the size of selective test suites.
