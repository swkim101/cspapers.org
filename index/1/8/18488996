Indoor monitoring system for robot and human is an important issue in robotics research. In this study, we propose an indoor monitoring system based on wireless and pyroelectric infrared (WPIR) sensory fusion system. Pyroelectric infrared (PIR) system alone for localization provides less accurate information of human location and suffers from multiple targets localization. Furthermore, radio frequency (RF) localization system alone is also constrained by its limited accuracy. We develop a sensor network based localization method called WPIR inference algorithm. This algorithm determine the fused position from both PIR localization system and radio frequency signal localization system which utilizes received signal strength (RSS) model. We have developed and experimentally demonstrated a WPIR sensory fusion system which can be applied in localizing targets, such as human and robot. With the proper localization mechanism in the indoor environment, the provision of appropriate services for people can be realized with less expensive cost.
