Despite the broad and substantial impact of the computer on the Western World in recent years, the practical effect on the format of the typical college course has been nil. Even most Computer Science faculty continue to use the lecture model for most courses, although some courses do have a hands-on computing component, and some instructors bring the computer into the classroom for demonstration purposes. Outside of Computer Science programs, and courses that directly involve computer skills such as computer based graphics arts courses or computer-aided design, the use of computers has been minimal. In this paper I will discuss the use of computer-based class discussion.
