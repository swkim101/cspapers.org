This paper evaluates the bit error rate (BER) performance of underlay relay cognitive networks with decode-and-forward (DF) relays in arbitrary number of hops over Rayleigh fading with channel estimation errors. In order to facilitate the performance evaluation analytically we derive a novel exact closed-form representation for the corresponding BER which is validated through extensive comparisons with results from Monte-Carlo simulations. The proposed expression involved well known elementary and special functions which render its computational realization rather simple and straightforward. As a result, the need for laborious, energy exhaustive and time-consuming computer simulations can be ultimately omitted. Numerous results illustrate that the performance of underlay relay cognitive networks is, as expected, significantly degraded by channel estimation errors and that is highly dependent upon of both the network topology and the number of hops.
