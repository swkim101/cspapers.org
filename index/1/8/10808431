Firms often focus on just matching and beating their rivals on attributes commonly agreed as important by customers and industry players. From companies’ point of view, every player belongs to some well-defined strategic group. Within every strategic group, strategies tend to converge along the same basic dimensions of competition and the value is created using similar methods and value chains. Companies’ new product development (NPD) processes reflect on ways of competing. Typically, firms have only one NPD process, which favors incremental improvements to existing products and for fixed market context. This paper sketches new approach to create value by combining design, marketing, engineering and strategic perspectives early in the NPD process. It is grounded on several principles. Firstly, instead of just seeking incremental improvements to existing products, customers and market contexts, new ideas should also be looked from broader arenas; from new market contexts, by creating new market space, and by changing how value is created to the customers (value chain and market structures), changing the value itself that is offered (new dimensions or combinations) as well as changing to whom the value is created (new customer groups). Secondly, new ideas should be divided according to uncertainty level they are facing. Thirdly, different uncertainty levels require different development process models. Checkpoints and requirements cannot be the same when new offering are varying significantly and they are targeting at different things. And fourthly, in order to design new value chains, value offerings, strategic positions or new customer groups, key developer groups – strategist, engineers, marketers and designers should be able to collaborate early and often enough to discover and utilize these different new ideas.
