This paper analyzes potential optical architectures for AI applications (such as knowledge-based systems). Our goal was to investigate architectures most suitable for implementation completely in optics. While optical computing appears to hold much promise because of its inherent parallelism and speed, constructing a symbolic processor or even a general purpose computer in optics requires examining many issues never before addressed. This paper presents these issues and discusses those architectures which appear most feasible in optics. We take into account fundamental physical limitations as well as the state-of-the-art optical device research. We conclude that, unlike in electronics, large-grained parallelism is not suitable for implementation in optics. We also find that functional languages, rather than logic languages, are better candidates for optics. Finally, we show that implementing an optical symbolic processor warrants the need for a real, or at least an emulated, addressable memory in optics.
