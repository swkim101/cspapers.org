The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is a compensatory eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head turns. Its magnitude, or gain, can be modified by visual experience during head movements. Possible learning mechanisms for this adaptation have been explored in a model of the oculomotor system based on anatomical and physiological constraints. The local correlational learning rules in our model reproduce the adaptation and behavior of the VOR under certain parameter conditions. From these conditions, predictions for the time course of adaptation at the learning sites are made.
