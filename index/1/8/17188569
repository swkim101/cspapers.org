In this paper, context is modeled by vector space bases and its evolution is modeled by linear transformations from one base to another. Each document or query can be associated to a distinct base, which corresponds to one context. Also, algorithms are proposed to discover contexts from document, query or groups or them. Linear algebra can thus by employed in a mathematical framework to process context, its evolution and application.
