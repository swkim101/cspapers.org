Recent research on skyline queries has attracted much interest in the database and data mining community. Given a database, an object belongs to the skyline if it cannot be dominated with respect to the given attributes by any other database object. Current methods have only considered so-called min/max attributes like price and quality which a user wants to minimize or maximize. However, objects can also have spatial attributes like x, y coordinates which can be used to represent relevant constraints on the query results. In this paper, we introduce novel skyline query types taking into account not only min/max attributes but also spatial attributes and the relationships between these different attribute types. Such queries support a micro-economic approach to decision making, considering not only the quality but also the cost of solutions. We investigate two alternative approaches for efficient query processing, a symmetrical one based on off-the-shelf index structures, and an asymmetrical one based on index structures with special purpose extensions. Our experimental evaluation using a real dataset and various synthetic datasets demonstrates that the new query types are indeed meaningful and the proposed algorithms are efficient and scalable.
