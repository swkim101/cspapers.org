Given an unweighted undirected or directed graph with <i>n</i> vertices, <i>m</i> edges and edge connectivity <i>c</i>, we present a new deterministic algorithm for edge splitting. Our algorithm splits-off any specified subset <i>S</i> of vertices satisfying standard conditions (even degree for the undirected case and in-degree ≥ out-degree for the directed case) while maintaining connectivity <i>c</i> for vertices outside <i>S</i> in Õ(<i>m</i>+<i>nc</i><sup>2</sup>) time for an undirected graph and Õ(<i>mc</i>) time for a directed graph. This improves the current best deterministic time bounds due to Gabow [8], who splits-off a <i>single</i> vertex in Õ(<i>nc</i><sup>2</sup>+<i>m</i>) time for an undirected graph and Õ(<i>mc</i>) time for a directed graph. Further, for appropriate ranges of <i>n</i>, <i>c</i>, |<i>S</i>| it improves the current best randomized bounds due to Benczúr and Karger [2], who split-off a single vertex in an undirected graph in Õ(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) Monte Carlo time.
 We give two applications of our edge splitting algorithms. Our first application is a sub-quadratic (in <i>n</i>) algorithm to construct Edmonds' arborescences. A classical result of Edmonds [5] shows that an unweighted directed graph with <i>c</i> edge-disjoint paths from any particular vertex <i>r</i> to every other vertex has exactly <i>c</i> edge-disjoint arborescences rooted at <i>r.</i> For a <i>c</i> edge connected unweighted undirected graph, the same theorem holds on the digraph obtained by replacing each undirected edge by two directed edges, one in each direction. The current fastest construction of these arborescences by Gabow [7] takes <i>Õ</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup><i>c</i><sup>2</sup>) time. Our algorithm takes Õ(<i>nc</i><sup>3</sup>+<i>m</i>) time for the undirected case and Õ(<i>nc</i><sup>4</sup>+<i>mc</i>) time for the directed case. The second application of our splitting algorithm is a new Steiner edge connectivity algorithm for undirected graphs which matches the best known bound of Õ(<i>nc</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>m</i>) time due to Bhalgat et al [3]. Finally, our algorithm can also be viewed as an alternative proof for existential edge splitting theorems due to Lovász [9] and Mader [11].
