A fuzzy string matching approach is proposed to solve the pattern recognition problems in this paper. The edit cost is presented as a fuzzy number. The string matching problem with fuzzy edit cost was then equivalent to a shortest path problem with fuzzy weights. By ranking the fuzzy numbers, the object is classified as the reference object that has the minimum fuzzy distance. Some testing objects have been used to show the proposed method can improve the recognition rates.
