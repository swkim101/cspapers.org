As technology advances, interconnection wires are placed in closer proximity and circuits operate at higher frequencies. Consequently, reduction of crosstalks between interconnection wires becomes an important consideration in VLSI design. In this paper, we study the gridded channel routing problem with the objective of satisfying crosstalk constraints for the nets. We propose a new approach which utilizes existing channel routing algorithms and improves upon the routing results by permuting the routing tracks. A novel mixed integer linear programming (ILP) formulation and effective procedures for reducing the number of variables and constraints in the mixed ILP formulation are then presented. The experimental results are encouraging.
