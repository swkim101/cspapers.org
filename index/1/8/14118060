Nomenclator is an architecture for providing efficient descriptive (attribute-based) naming in a large internet environment. As a test of the basic design, we have built a Nomenclator prototype that uses X.500 as its underlying data repository. X.500 SEARCH queries that previously took several minutes, can, in many cases, be answered in a matter of seconds. Our system improves descriptive query performance by trimming branches of the X.500 directory tree from the search. These tree-trimming techniques are part of an active catalog that constrains the search space as needed during query processing. The active catalog provides information about the data distribution (meta-data) to constrain query processing on demand. Nomenclator caches both data (responses to queries) and meta-data (data distribution information, tree-trimming techniques, data access techniques) to speed future queries. Nomenclator relieves users of the need to understand the structure of the name space to locate objects quickly in a large, structured name environment. Nomenclator is a meta-level service that will eventually incorporate other name services in addition to X.500. Its techniques for improving performance should be generally applicable to other naming systems. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Research supported in part by an AT&T Ph.D. Scholarship, National Science Foundation grants CCR8703373 and CCR-8815928, Office of Naval Research grant N00014-89-J-1222, and a Digital Equipment Corporation External Research Grant.
