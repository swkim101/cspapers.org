Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) is one of the key issues to boost the performance of future generation processors. Data dependences may become one of the main bottlenecks that limit the performance of such future architectures due to the serialization that they introduce in the execution of programs. Data value speculation is a novel mechanism that may avoid such serialization by predicting the values that flow among dependent instructions. This work presents a study of the limits of the performance potential of data value speculation to boost ILP. Both realistic and probabilistic value predictors are considered in this paper. The interaction with some other critical features of the microarchitecture is researched: instruction window size, branch prediction accuracy and instruction latency. Results show that data value speculation has a significant potential to boost ILP. However, for a relatively small instruction window, like the one that can currently be built with the best branch predictors, the achieved speedup is moderate. The speedup provided by data value speculation is also dependent on the criticality of the correctly predicted instructions. Finally, it is shown that the speedup that data value speculation may achieve in superscalar processors, in the way that it has been used so far, can be approximated by a linear function of the prediction accuracy.
