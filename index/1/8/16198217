In city sensing there are many methods for capturing people's movements and city crowdedness. Each method has advantages and disadvantages. This paper argues that geographical phenomenon like spatial segregation can have a major influence on the results in fixed sensing therefore a structured location choice is needed. Mobile positioning as a new technology data collection method opens up great possibilities in city sensing.
