The calculation of building thermal loads using the computer has been an accepted practice for several years. A substantial amount of research and theoretical investigation has been expended in attempts to accurately quantify a building's thermal behavior. A number of existing simulation packages acceptably model this behavior.1,2,3,4,5,6
 The advantages of simulation are obvious, not only for the predictive information with respect to operating costs or fuel consumption, but as a potential aid for preliminary design. The influence and tradeoffs of a large number of design variables such as siting, orientation, window area, thermal resistivity, surface/volume ratios, and cost can all be examined at an early stage in the design process.
