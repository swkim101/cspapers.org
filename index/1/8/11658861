Previous approaches for automated essay scoring (AES) learn a rating model by minimizing either the classification, regression, or pairwise classification loss, depending on the learning algorithm used. In this paper, we argue that the current AES systems can be further improved by taking into account the agreement between human and machine raters. To this end, we propose a rankbased approach that utilizes listwise learning to rank algorithms for learning a rating model, where the agreement between the human and machine raters is directly incorporated into the loss function. Various linguistic and statistical features are utilized to facilitate the learning algorithms. Experiments on the publicly available English essay dataset, Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP), show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, and achieves performance comparable to professional human raters, which suggests the effectiveness of our proposed method for automated essay scoring.
