Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are fostering pervasive healthcare applications, where people are remotely monitored, without the full time assistance of professional care-givers. A key enabling element is the possibility to locate people in indoor environments, especially in emergency situations. Framed within the WSN4QoL project, this paper proposes the use of a ray tracing model for network planning, to support efficient people localization and performance analysis. Preliminary results show accurate radio coverage estimations, with a minimal calibration effort.
