It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the WWW 2018 Workshops. This year's workshops of WWW 2018 feature a number of co-located workshops that are intended to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners in Web technologies to discuss and exchange positions on current and emergent Web topics. We received forty proposals from all around the world covering a broad range of topics. We evaluated them regarding relevance, quality, and novelty selecting eighteen full-day workshops and ten half-day workshops. We also took into account the coverage of the different areas related to WWW as well as the potential audience, to schedule them in two consecutive days with the minimal audience interest overlap.
