We introduce the Kinect as a tool for capturing gas flows around occluders using objects of different aerodynamic properties. Previous approaches have been invasive or require elaborate setups including large printed sheets of complex noise patterns and neat lighting. Our method is easier to set up while still producing good results. We show that three Kinects are sufficient to qualitatively reconstruct nonstationary time varying gas flows in the presence of occluders.
