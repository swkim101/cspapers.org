Among syntax-based translation models, the tree-based approach, which takes as input a parse tree of the source sentence, is a promising direction being faster and simpler than its string-based counterpart. However, current tree-based systems suffer from a major drawback: they only use the 1-best parse to direct the translation, which potentially introduces translation mistakes due to parsing errors. We propose a forest-based approach that translates a packed forest of exponentially many parses, which encodes many more alternatives than standard n-best lists. Large-scale experiments show an absolute improvement of 1.7 BLEU points over the 1-best baseline. This result is also 0.8 points higher than decoding with 30-best parses, and takes even less time.
