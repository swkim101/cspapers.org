Real-world systems are comprised of interdependent components creating integrated systems. These systems are developed by multidisciplinary teams. The goal of this project is the development of a comprehensive undergraduate course in robotics that encompasses various fields that are integral to robotic systems: Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. A main pedagogical goal of the course is to teach group dynamics and the skills necessary for interaction with people in different disciplines in multidisciplinary teams. Descriptions of the course and the hands-on lab assignments are presented along with course assessment.
