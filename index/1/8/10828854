Small robots have the potential to access confined spaces where humans cannot go. However, the mobility of wheeled and tracked systems is severely limited in cluttered environments. Snake robots using biologically inspired gaits for locomotion can provide better access in many situations, but are slow and can easily snag. This paper introduces an alternative approach to snake robot locomotion, in which the entire surface of the robot provides continuous propulsive force to significantly improve speed and mobility in many environments.
