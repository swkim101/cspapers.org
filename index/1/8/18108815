In the first part of the paper, we extend Karmarkar's interior point method to give an algorithm for Convex Quadratic Programming which requires O(Na'~7(logL)(logN)L) arithmetic operations. At each iteration, Karmarkar's method locally minimizes the linear (convex) numerator of a transformed objective function in the transformed domain. However, in the case of Convex Quadratic Programming the numerator of the transformed objective function is not necessarily convex. We give a method that, at each iteration, locally optimizes the original objective function in the original domain itself. As a consequence we also obtain a monotonic decrease in the objective function. In the second part, we show how to solve the linear program describing the multicommodity flow problem, with s commodities, in O(sSSv2"Se L) arithmetic operations. In each problem arithmetic operations are performed to a precision of O(L) bits where L is bounded by the number of bits in the input. 1. Convex Quadratic Programming 1.
