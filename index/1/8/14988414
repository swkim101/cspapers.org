Existing sensor network deployments for wildlife tracking (e.g. ZebraNet [1]) have concentrated on monitoring animal behaviour above-ground. However, a wide variety of animals create underground tunnels for shelter and protection whilst the animal is asleep. The extent and internal architecture of the underground structure varies considerably amongst species. For example, badgers excavate wide ranging underground tunnel systems which a number of animals inhabit in a community [6]. In addition, their tunnel structure is something which is often only determined by the destructive extreme of excavation [6]. As fossorial animals spend a large proportion of their lifetimes underground, this means that zoologists only have a partial view of their behaviour and habits. There is thus a need for a system which can localize animals whilst they are underground, in a non-invasive and automatic way.
