This paper addresses the problem of mining named entity translations from comparable corpora, specifically, mining English and Chinese named entity translation. We first observe that existing approaches use one or more of the following named entity similarity metrics: entity, entity context, and relationship. Inspired by this observation, in this paper, we propose a new holistic approach, by (1) combining all similarity types used and (2) additionally considering relationship context similarity between pairs of named entities, a missing quadrant in the taxonomy of similarity metrics. We abstract the named entity translation problem as the matching of two named entity graphs extracted from the comparable corpora. Specifically, named entity graphs are first constructed from comparable corpora to extract relationship between named entities. Entity similarity and entity context similarity are then calculated from every pair of bilingual named entities. A reinforcing method is utilized to reflect relationship similarity and relationship context similarity between named entities. According to our experimental results, our holistic graph-based approach significantly outperforms previous approaches.
