While nondeterminism is widely beleived to be more powerful than determinism in various contexts (the most famous being the conjecture that NP strictly contains P), no proof of the added power of nondeterminism is available for any significant issue. The weaker conjecture (than NP strictly contains P) that there is a language accepted by a nondeterministic linear time bounded multitape Turing Machine that cannot be accepted by a deterministic linear time bounded multi-tape TM still seems quite hard (Paul 1982). The aim of this paper is to show how the existance of the polynomial-time hierarchy of Meyer and Stockmeyer(1972) and the related concept of alternation (Chandra, Kozen and Stockmeyer(1981)) can be exploited to prove the power of nondeterminism over determinism in some contexts. It is hoped that this approach may be useful in proving stronger results.
