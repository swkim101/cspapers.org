Property measurements together with the circumstances of the experiments in which they have been obtained are often stored in databases or knowledge bases, so-called measurement bases. Suppose a user is interested in a measurement that is not in the base, that is, no experiment matching the hypothetical experimental description provided by the user is found. This paper presents a method that gives a prediction of the desired value on the basis of other measurements stored in the measurement base obtained in similar experiments. The approach combines techniques for automated model construction, semi-quantitative simulation and comparative analysis.
