Robots are useful for search and detection missions for trapped victims after disasters due to their abilities enter places where human rescuers cannot go without risking their own lives. We have experienced and found much knowledge about rescue robots while participating in the RoboCup Rescue Competitions. In this paper we introduce examples of "effective multiple robot cooperative activities" and "a study of the number of robots and operators in a multiple robot team" from our experiences in these competitions.
