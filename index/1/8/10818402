The concept of varying window size in a working set dispatcher to control working set size and number of page faults is examined. A space-time cost equation is developed and used to compare fixed window size to variable window size for different types of secondary storage based on the simulated execution of real programs. A general approach is indicated for studying the relative merit of the two dispatching algorithms and their interaction with different hardware configurations.
