Semantic relatedness is a very important factor for the coreference resolution task. To obtain this semantic information, corpusbased approaches commonly leverage patterns that can express a specific semantic relation. The patterns, however, are designed manually and thus are not necessarily the most effective ones in terms of accuracy and breadth. To deal with this problem, in this paper we propose an approach that can automatically find the effective patterns for coreference resolution. We explore how to automatically discover and evaluate patterns, and how to exploit the patterns to obtain the semantic relatedness information. The evaluation on ACE data set shows that the pattern based semantic information is helpful for coreference resolution.
