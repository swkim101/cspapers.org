Our goal is to find an approximate shortest path for a point robot moving in a planar subdivision with <i>n</i> vertices. Let ρ ≥ 1 be a real number. Distances in each face of this subdivision are measured by a convex distance function whose unit disk is contained in a concentric unit Euclidean disk, and contains a concentric Euclidean disk with radius 1/ρ. Different convex distance functions may be used for different faces, and obstacles are allowed. These convex distance functions may be asymmetric. For all ε ∈ (0, 1), and for any two points <i>v<inf>s</inf></i> and <i>v<inf>d</inf></i>, we give an algorithm that finds a path from <i>v<inf>s</inf></i> to <i>v<inf>d</inf></i> whose cost is at most (1 + ε) times the minimum cost. Our algorithm runs in <i>O</i> (ρ<sub>2</sub>logρ/ε<sup>2</sup>n<sup>3</sup> log (ρn/ε)) time. This bound does not depend on any other parameters; in particular, it does not depend on the minimum angle in the subdivision. We give applications to two special cases that have been considered before: the weighted region problem and motion planning in the presence of uniform flows. For the weighted region problem with weights in [1, ρ] ∪ {∞}, the time bound of our algorithm improves to <i>O</i> (ρ<sub>2</sub>logρ/εn<sup>3</sup> log (ρn/ε)).
