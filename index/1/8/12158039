For real-time tasks, cache behavior must be constrained via cache locking or predicted by WCET analysis. Since the former gives up energy efficiency for predictability, this paper proposes a novel code optimization that reduces the miss rate of unlocked instruction caches and, provenly, does not increase the WCET. We optimized the 37 programs from the MÃ¤lardalen WCET benchmark for 36 cache configurations and two technologies. By exploiting software prefetching on top of on-demand fetching, we reduced the memory's contribution to the energy consumption (by 11.2%), to the average case execution time (by 10.2%), and to the WCET (by 17.4%).
