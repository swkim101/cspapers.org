This paper discusses an approach to information system design. It discusses specific factors which should be considered and the steps which should be followed during the phases dealing with study of the situation and analysis of requirements, and external design. For illustration of this disciplined approach, the paper provides examples of organizations such as a medical/dental office, a pharmacy, a retail store, and a repair shop. Details of typical requirements are then derived for these example organizations, followed by a proposal for an external design configuration.
