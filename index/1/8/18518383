In this paper we address the problem of retrieving images from large image databases, giving a partial description of the image content. This approach allows a limited automatic analysis for image belonging to a domain described in advance to the system using a formalism based on fuzzy sets. The image query processing is based on special access structures generated from the image analysis process.
