Cloud storage services such as Dropbox [1] and Google Drive [2] are becoming more and more popular. On the one hand, they provide users with mobility, scalability, and convenience. However, privacy issues arise when the storage becomes not fully controlled by users. Although modern encryption schemes are effective at protecting content of data, there are two drawbacks of the encryption-before-outsourcing approach: First, one kind of sensitive information, Access Pattern of the data is left unprotected. Moreover, encryption usually makes the data difficult to use. In this paper, we propose AIS (Access Indistinguishable Storage), the first client-side system that can partially conceal access pattern of the cloud storage in constant time. Besides data content, AIS can conceal information about the number of initial files, and length of each initial file. When it comes to the access phase after initiation, AIS can effectively conceal the behavior (read or write) and target file of the current access. Moreover, the existence and length of each file will remain confidential as long as there is no access after initiation. One application of AIS is SSE (Searchable Symmetric Encryption), which makes the encrypted data searchable. Based on AIS, we propose SBA (SSE Built on AIS). To the best of our knowledge, SBA is safer than any other SSE systems of the same complexity, and SBA is the first to conceal whether current keyword was queried before, the first to conceal whether current operation is an addition or deletion, and the first to support direct modification of files.
