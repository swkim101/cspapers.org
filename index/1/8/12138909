Most present-day imaging devices are equipped with CMOS sensors. Motion blur is a common artifact in handheld cameras. Because CMOS sensors mostly employ a rolling shutter (RS), the motion deblurring problem takes on a new dimension. Although few works have recently addressed this problem, they suffer from many constraints including heavy computational cost, need for precise sensor information, and inability to deal with wide-angle systems (which most cell-phone and drone cameras are) and irregular camera trajectory. In this work, we propose a model for RS blind motion deblurring that mitigates these issues significantly. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods reveal that our approach not only exhibits significant computational gains and unconstrained functionality but also leads to improved deblurring performance.
