This paper describes an entry-level programming assignment that can be used to help students learn the value of diversity through computer programming. The assignment was given as part of a preliminary experiment to establish the impact of a student programming assignment on student attitudes toward cultural diversity. The results provide suggestive evidence that students learn to value diversity via the given programming assignment.
