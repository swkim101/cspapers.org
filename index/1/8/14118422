In [1], we claimed that eigenfunctions for a graph can be used to construct graph separators to within a constant factor of the optimum. It turns out that additional assumptions on the graph are needed to guarantee this. In particular, it is enough if the gaps between consecutive eigenvtdues are bounded away from zero. The key fact is the following: A function @ defined on the vertex set of G is said to be a 6-eigenfunction if II(L â€“ ~)~11 S r5A[[@l[ where L denotes the normalized Laplacian of G rmd A = (@,L@)/11~112. (For a k-regular graph, C is equal to the identity matrix minus 1/k times the adjacency matrix of the graph.) We prove that there exists a ti-eigenfunction which gives edge-cuts approximating the optimal separator within a factor of 100/6. The proof involves using several types of flows and their relations to the eigenfunctions. If 6-eigenfucntions are close to eigenfunctions,
