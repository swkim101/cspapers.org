Pneumatic Artificial Muscle (PAM) actuators have been used as exoskeletons because of their inherited compliance and high power-weight ratio. However, creating accurate models remains difficult mainly due to the compliance issue; the model can be changed by the force applied by the user. Therefore, both user and robot actions need to be considered for sufficient excitation of PAMs that are equipped in exoskeleton robots, unlike typical rigid actuators that can only be sufficiently excited by robot actions. In this paper, we propose a user-robot collaborative excitation approach for PAM model identification as an active learning framework for sequentially collecting data by deriving and executing optimal user and robot actions at each step with Gaussian processes. The optimal actions, which are executed by the robot, are displayed on a monitor that enables the user to execute them. We conducted experiments using a powered elbow exoskeleton with a PAM actuator. Experimental results show that our method can more efficiently identify the PAM model than a standard model identification method that does not use any data acquired through user-robot collaboration.
