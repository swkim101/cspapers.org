3D face recognition has lately been attracting ever increasing attention. In this paper we review the full spectrum of 3D face processing technology, from sensing to recognition. The review covers 3D face modelling, 3D to 3D and 3D to 2D registration, 3D based recognition and 3D assisted 2D based recognition. The fusion of 2D and 3D modalities is also addressed. The paper complements other reviews in the face biometrics area by focusing on the sensor technology, and by detailing the efforts in 3D face modelling and 3D assisted 2D face matching.
