This paper describes a principled approach towards creating an IT-support environment for knowledge workers. Starting in the analysis phase our approach paves the way for putting an intelligent assistant to work within a typical business process environment. Thereby, this support intelligence is centred around the interdependencies between documents providing the background knowledge and business processes.
