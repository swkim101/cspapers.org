The paper deals with design of controllers for time delay systems. The method is developed for stable, unstable and integrating time delay systems in conjunction with the approximation of the time delay term. The 2DOF control system configuration is considered. To derive of controllers, the polynomial approach and the pole assignment method are applied. The procedure is proposed for two choices of the characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop. The resulting controller obtained via polynomial Diophantine equations is stable and proper. The simulation results document a usability of the proposed method providing stable control responses of a good quality also for a higher ratio between the time delay and the time constant of the controlled system
