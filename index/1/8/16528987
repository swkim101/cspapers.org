This paper describes a model-based reasoning approach to network monitoring that combines the strengths of object oriented design and rule-based inference. In this approach, the structure of the network equipment is implemented in an object model with diagnostically important relations ("partof ' , "standby", "depends-on") linking pieces of the equipment. Alarm processing is expressed in data driven rules that monitor the state of the model, and are triggered as each incoming alarm message is attached to the object representing the alarming device. This approach has been used to implement the Knowledge Base of ANSWER-4E, an operations system for monitoring the 4ESS switching system in the AT&T communication network. We have implemented this paradigm in a language that is a rule based extension to C++. We present the merits of this approach and demonstrate how this paradigm can be extended for diagnosis of highly complex systems.
