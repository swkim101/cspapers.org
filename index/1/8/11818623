In this paper, we introduce the problem of automatic formula revision for Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) motion planning specifications. Namely, if a specification cannot be satisfied on a particular environment, our framework returns information to the user regarding (i) why the specification cannot be satisfied and (ii) how the specification can be modified so it can become satisfiable. This work contributes towards rendering temporal logic motion planning frameworks more user friendly by providing feedback to the user when the LTL planning phase fails.
