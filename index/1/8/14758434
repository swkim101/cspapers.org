In this demo, we showcase the first software defined radio (SDR) implementation that runs on today's smartphones. Using the SDR, the smartphones are shown to talk to real IEEE 802.15.4 devices such as sensor motes or Phillips Hue (TM) lightbulbs that otherwise they cannot natively communicate with. Furthermore, we make the SDR available as downloadable software ("app") on Google app store, so that anyone may freely download, use, and purge on his or her smartphone, independently of OS upgrades. Detaching SDR from OS allows almost immediate deployment of wireless rotocols, and only on the phones that do need them. By enabling smartphones to speak non-native protocols in this manner, smartphone vendors will be able to support a wide range of wireless protocols without investing separate hardware and real estate in their devices. A promising application area for this concept could be Internet of Things (IoT), where protocols are diverse, typically low-speed, and not well supported by today's smartphones. Therefore, we believe that the smartphones with SDR will become a strong enabler or facilitator of many interesting applications in the IoT environment. We also believe that the concept of wireless protocol as a smartphone app will accelerate wireless protocol design-test-deployment cycle, catalyzing wireless protocol evolutions on smartphones.
