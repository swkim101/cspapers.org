We present a new systematic method of structuring information using mental models. This method can be used both to evaluate the efficiency of an information structure and to build user-centered information structures. In this paper we present the method using Boston tourist attractions as an example domain. We describe several interfaces that take advantage of our mental models with an activation spreading network. Multidimensional Scaling and Trajectory Mapping are used to build our mental models. Because of the robustness of the technique, it is easy to compare individual difference in mental models and to customize interfaces for individual models.
