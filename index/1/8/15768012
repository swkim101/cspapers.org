Discourse parsing is a challenging task and plays a critical role in discourse analysis. In this paper, we focus on labeling full argument spans of discourse connectives in the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB). Previous studies cast this task as a linear tagging or subtree extraction problem. In this paper, we propose a novel constituent-based approach to argument labeling, which integrates the advantages of both linear tagging and subtree extraction. In particular, the proposed approach unifies intra- and intersentence cases by treating the immediately preceding sentence as a special constituent. Besides, a joint inference mechanism is introduced to incorporate global information across arguments into our constituent-based approach via integer linear programming. Evaluation on PDTB shows significant performance improvements of our constituent-based approach over the best state-of-the-art system. It also shows the effectiveness of our joint inference mechanism in modeling global information across arguments.
