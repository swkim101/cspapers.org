We construct multi-prover proof systems for NP which use only a constant number of provers to simultaneously achieve low error, low randomness and low answer size. As a consequence, we obtain asymptotic improvements to approximation hardness results for a wide range of optimization problems including minimum set cover, dominating set, maximum clique, chromatic number, and quartic programming; and constant factor improvements on the hardness results for MAXSNP problems. In particular, we show that approximating minimum set cover within any constant is NP-complete; approximating minimum set cover within Θ(log n) implies NP ⊆ DTIME(n ); approximating the maximum of a quartic program within any constant is NP-hard; approximating maximum clique within n implies NP ⊆ BPP; approximating chromatic number within n implies NP ⊆ BPP; and approximating MAX3SAT within 113/112 is NP-complete. ∗Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Mail Code 0114, University of California at San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093.
