Hand gesture-based input systems have been in active research, yet most of them focus only on single character recognition. We propose KooSHO: an environment for Japanese input based on aerial hand gestures. The system provides an integrated experience of character input, Kana-Kanji conversion, and search result visualization. To achieve faster input, users only have to input consonant, which is then converted directly to Kanji sequences by direct consonant decoding. The system also shows suggestions to complete the user input. The comparison with voice recognition and a screen keyboard showed that KooSHO can be a more practical solution compared to the existing system.
