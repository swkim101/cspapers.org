We present a case study of an eXperimental integrated interactive System, XS-1, being implemented on small computers. The primary goal of this project is to provide experimental support for design principles that have emerged from a critique of the behavior of today's interactive systems, and from our earlier implementations. These design principles apply at the user's level and at the system designer's level. The user must have a model of the system that allows him at all times to obtain information about his current data environment and his current command environment; he must be able to obtain such information by means of universal commands that are always active, regardless of the application program he is executing. These requirements at the user level have stringent implications at the system design level, such as: a common representation for data of all types, a file system that handles small and large sets of data in a uniform way, a front-end dialog processor shared by all application programs, and screen layout conventions.
