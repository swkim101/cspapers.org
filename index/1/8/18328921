We present an algorithm which compensates for the mismatches between characteristics of real-world problems and assumptions of independent component analysis algorithm. To provide additional information to the ICA network, we incorporate top-down selective attention. An MLP classifier is added to the separated signal channel and the error of the classifier is backpropagated to the ICA network. This backpropagation process results in estimation of expected ICA output signal for the top-down attention. Then, the unmixing matrix is retrained according to a new cost function representing the backpropagated error as well as independence. It modifies the density of recovered signals to the density appropriate for classification. For noisy speech signal recorded in real environments, the algorithm improved the recognition performance and showed robustness against parametric changes.
