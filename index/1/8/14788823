This paper describes a protection system that supports the confinement of access as required by non-discretionary access control models such as the Bell and LaPadula lattice model. The approach is to use capability-based protection at the lowest level for implementing confined domains, in support of access control lists for expressing security policies outside the security kernel. The implementation of such a system in the context of hardware support for capabilities is discussed.
