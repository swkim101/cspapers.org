During the development of physical computing devices, physical object models and programs for microcontrollers are usually created with separate tools with distinct files. As a result, it is difficult to track the changes in hardware and software without discrepancy. Moreover, the software cannot directly access hardware metrics. Designing hardware interface cannot benefit from the source code information either. This demonstration proposes a browser-based IDE named f3.js that enables development of both as a single JavaScript code base. The demonstration allows audiences to play with the f3.js IDE and showcases example applications such as laser-cut interfaces generated from the same code but with different parameters. Programmers can experience the full feature and designers can interact with preset projects with a mouse or touch to customize laser-cut interfaces. More information is available at http://f3js.org.
