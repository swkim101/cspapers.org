We explore in this paper the problem of dynamic data and channel allocations with the number of communication channels and the number of data items given. It is noted that the combined use of broadcast and on-demand channels can utilize the bandwidth effectively for data dissemination in a mobile computing environment. We first derive the an-alytical models of the expected delays when the data are requested through the broadcast and on-demand channels. Then, we transform this problem into to a guided search problem. In light of the theoretical properties derived, we devise an algorithm based on binary interpolation search, referred to as algorithm BIS, to obtain solutions of high quality efficiently. In essence, algorithm BIS is guided to explore the solution space with higher likelihood to be the optimal first, thereby leading to an efficient and effective search. It is shown by our simulation results that the solution obtained by algorithm BIS is of very high quality and is in fact very close to the optimal one. Sensitivity analysis on several parameters, including the number of data items and the number of communication channels, is conducted.
