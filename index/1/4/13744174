Attacks in cyber-physical systems (CPS) which manipulate sensor

readings can cause enormous physical damage if undetected.

Detection of attacks on sensors 

is crucial to mitigate this issue.

We study supervised regression as a means to detect anomalous sensor

readings, where each sensor's measurement is predicted as a function

of other sensors.

We show that several common learning approaches in this context

are still vulnerable to stealthy attacks, which carefully

modify readings of compromised sensors to cause desired damage while

remaining undetected.

Next, we model the interaction between the CPS defender and attacker

as a Stackelberg game in which the defender chooses detection

thresholds, while the attacker deploys a stealthy attack in response.

We present a heuristic algorithm for finding an approximately optimal threshold for

the defender in this game, and show that it increases system

resilience to attacks without significantly increasing the false alarm rate.
