This paper reports about experiences in managing the transformation from internal development and maintenance of software engineering tools towards an external one. We describe three different interorganizational cooperation forms which differ in the distribution of development responsibilities between client and vendor â€“ and which support the distributed design of three different classes of software products. An important finding was that even for software engineering tools which were extremely important for project success a carefully designed relationship model enables a successful distributed development.
