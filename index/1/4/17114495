Approximate Value Iteration (AVI) is an method for solving a Markov Decision Problem by making successive calls to a supervised learning (SL) algorithm. Sequence of value representations Vn are processed iteratively by Vn+1 = ATVn where T is the Bellman operator and A an approximation operator. Bounds on the error between the performance of the policies induced by the algorithm and the optimal policy are given as a function of weighted Lp-norms (p ≥ 1) of the approximation errors. The results extend usual analysis in L∞-norm, and allow to relate the performance of AVI to the approximation power (usually expressed in Lp-norm, for p = 1 or 2) of the SL algorithm. We illustrate the tightness of these bounds on an optimal replacement problem.
