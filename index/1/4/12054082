In previous research in automatic verb classification, syntactic features have proved the most useful features, although manual classifications rely heavily on semantic features. We show, in contrast with previous work, that considerable additional improvement can be obtained by using semantic features in automatic classification: verb selectional preferences acquired from corpus data using a fully unsupervised method. We report these promising results using a new framework for verb clustering which incorporates a recent subcategorization acquisition system, rich syntactic-semantic feature sets, and a variation of spectral clustering which performs particularly well in high dimensional feature space.
