A central process in any learning experience is the incorporation of a new fact into an existing theory. Despite the abundance of papers on learning, no one has yet defined rigorously what it means to be "new". This paper attempts to fill that gap by first stating, and then formalizing several intuitive ideas about novelty, focusing on what it means for a statement to be a new fact about some concept. The report also includes a brief discussion of how this result might be applied and outlines many remaining research areas.
