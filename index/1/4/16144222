The application of the traditional data base models in the important areas of document retrieval and office information systems has not yet yielded great evidence of success. Here we present an alternative model based on array theory. This model appears to be better suited toward other types of information system,while at the same time, it is still applicable to conventional data base operations. An outline of the model is presented, a description of a suitable query language is given and some implementation issues are discussed.
