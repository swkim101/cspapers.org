Recent growing needs for real time data analytics have increased importance of streaming model selection. Real-world streaming observations are often obtained by dynamically-changing or heterogeneous data sources, and learning machines must identify the complexities of the data generation processes on the fly without prior knowledge. This paper proposes online FAB (OFAB) inference as a general framework for streaming model selection of latent variable models. The key idea in OFAB inference is degeneration, i.e. it intentionally considers a "redundant" latent space anddynamically derives a "non-redundant" latent sub-space using a FAB-unique shrinkage mechanism on demand. By integrating the idea of stochastic variational inference, OFAB automatically and dynamically selects the best dimensionality of latent variables in a streaming and Bayesian principled manner. Empirical results on two applications, density estimation and abnormal detection, show that online FAB (OFAB) outperformed the state-of-the-art online inference methods.
