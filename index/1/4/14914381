The Hughes Data Flow Multiprocessor (HDFM) is a proposed high performance, f au l t to lerant , high level language programmable processor targeted for embedded signal and d• t • processing appl icat ions. Based on the data f low pr inc ip le , the HDFM can exp lo i t the inherent paral lel ism in appl icat ions without e x p l i c i t programmer ident i f i ca t ion of independent tasks, thus freeing the programmer from the often d i f f i c u l t job of creating paral le l tasks and assigning these to d i f fe ren t processors. The d • t • f low archi tecture consists of many processing elements (PEs) connected by • three dimensional bussed-cube packet routing network. The PEs are designed for VLSI implementation to provide large throughput, realt ime processing. The modular, extensible nature of the computer allows for • wide number of PEs to meet a range of throughput and r e l i a b i l i t y requirements. Simulation resul ts have domonstrated high performance operation and high level language programmability.
