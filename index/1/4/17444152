Invocations are widely used by many web applications, but have been found to be a common source of errors. This paper presents a new technique that can statically verify that an invocation's set of argument names, types, and request method match the constraints of a target interface. An empirical evaluation of the technique shows that it is successful at identifying previously unknown errors in web applications.
