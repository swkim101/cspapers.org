We propose a query-by-example geographic object search method for users that do not know well about the place they are in. Geographic objects, such as restaurants, are often retrieved using an attribute-based or keyword query. These queries, however, are difficult to use for users that have little knowledge on the place where they want to search. The proposed query-by-example method allows users to query by selecting examples in familiar places for retrieving objects in unfamiliar places. One of the challenges is to predict an effective distance metric, which varies for individuals. Another challenge is to calculate the distance between objects in heterogeneous domains considering the feature gap between them, for example, restaurants in Japan and China. Our proposed method is used to robustly estimate the distance metric by amplifying the difference between selected and non-selected examples. By using the distance metric, each object in a familiar domain is evenly assigned to one in an unfamiliar domain to eliminate the difference between those domains. We developed a restaurant search using data obtained from a Japanese restaurant Web guide to evaluate our method.
