Existing sensor network simulators are not appropriate for indoor sensor network systems. We present RealSSim, the sensor network simulator especially developed for indoor sensor networks. RealSSim considers the structure of buildings and the quality of construction materials for accurate radio propagation analysis. It also supports an attractive visualization of the level as commercial products. In our demonstration, we show the whole process of simulation for two indoor sensor network systems.
