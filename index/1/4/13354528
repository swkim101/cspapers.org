Traditional works in sentiment analysis do not incorporate author preferences during sentiment classification of reviews. In this work, we show that the inclusion of author preferences in sentiment rating prediction of reviews improves the correlation with ground ratings, over a generic author independent rating prediction model. The overall sentiment rating prediction for a review has been shown to improve by capturing facet level rating. We show that this can be further developed by considering author preferences in predicting the facet level ratings, and hence the overall review rating. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate author preferences in rating prediction.
