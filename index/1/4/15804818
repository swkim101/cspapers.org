The DESIGN project combines a set of new approaches to software engineering for distributed applications. Distributed applications may thereby consist of a large, varying number of interacting processes. Specific problems encountered with the development of such distributed applications are not suitably reflected by known programming languages and software engineering environments. The DESIGN system in its current version integrates consistent approaches specifically suited for distributed application development. These approaches pertain to the areas `language support`, `performance prediction/rapid prototyping`, and `project support environment`. Most parts of the DESIGN system have been implemented and successfully applied to first sample distributed applications.
