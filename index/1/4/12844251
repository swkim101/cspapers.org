This full-day tutorial presents a comprehensive introduction to entity linking and retrieval. Part I provides a detailed overview of entity linking: identifying and disambiguating entity occurrences in unstructured text. Part II focuses on entity retrieval, by first considering scenarios where explicit representations of entities are available, and then moving to a setting where evidence needs to be collected and aggregated from multiple documents or even collections, thereby combining techniques from both entity linking and entity retrieval. Part III concludes the tutorial with an overview and hands-on comparative analysis of applications and publicly available toolkits and web services.
