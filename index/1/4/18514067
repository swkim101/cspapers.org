We called for more research on the AI problems that emerge when attempting to integrate acting with planning. To provide a basis for such research, it will be important to have a formalization of acting that can be useful in practice. This is needed in the same way that a formal account of planning was necessary for research on planning. We describe some first steps toward developing such a formalization, and invite readers to carry out research along this line.
