Given a graph G and a parameter k, the Chordal Vertex Deletion (CVD) problem asks whether there exists a subset U⊆ V(G) of size at most k that hits all induced cycles of size at least 4. The existence of a polynomial kernel for CVD was a well-known open problem in the field of Parameterized Complexity. Recently, Jansen and Pilipczuk resolved this question affirmatively by designing a polynomial kernel for CVD of size O (k161 log58k) and asked whether one can design a kernel of size O (k10) [Jansen an Pilipczuk, SODA 2017]. While we do not completely resolve this question, we design a significantly smaller kernel of size O (k12 log10k), inspired by the O (k2) -size kernel for Feedback Vertex Set [Thomassé, TALG 2010]. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of the independence degree of a vertex, which is our main conceptual contribution.
