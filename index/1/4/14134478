Due to increased demand for higher performance and better energy efficiency, MPSoCs are deploying heterogeneous architectures with architecturally differentiated core types. However, the traditional Linux-based operating system is unable to exploit this heterogeneity since existing kernel load balancing and scheduling approaches lack support for aggressively heterogeneous architectural configurations (e.g. beyond two core types). In this paper we present SmartBalance: a sensing-driven closed-loop load balancer for aggressively heterogeneous MPSoCs that performs load balancing using a sense-predict-balance paradigm. SmartBalance can efficiently manage the chip resources while opportunistically exploiting the workload variations and performance-power trade-offs of different core types. When compared to the standard vanilla Linux kernel load balancer, our per-thread and per-core performance-power-aware scheme shows an improvement in energy efficiency (throughput/Watt) of over 50% for benchmarks from the PARSEC benchmark suite executing on a heterogeneous MPSoC with 4 different core types and over 20% w.r.t. state-of-the-art ARM's global task scheduling (GTS) scheme for octa-core big.Little architecture.
