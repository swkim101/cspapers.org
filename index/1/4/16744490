As the study of structured computer programming languages gains prominence within the academic community, more questions are being raised about course sequences, appropriate background of the student, and the overall structure of the computer science curriculum. One of the major concerns is the level of mathematics background required for successful performance in introductory level computer language classes. Another major concern of computer science educators is that of determining the appropriate sequence and prerequisite relationships between the various lower level computer science courses. This study addresses both of theses issues. Specifically, the study investigates:
