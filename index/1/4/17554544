We have successfully produced mono-dispersed micro-gas bubbles for less than around 10 μm diameter by micro-bubble knife which produce micro-bubble in an electrically induced ultrasonic field. The discharged output power and conductive area of micro-electrode in micro-bubble knife which cuts the cell by micro-bubble were controlled by glass shell insulation around the copper micro-wire. A small space which is called “bubble reservoir” between the wire and glass tip contributes to stabilize the electric discharge and directional bubble generation. The directionally dispensed bubbles can be used for processing of soft materials such as biological cells. For the present study the cell membrane has successfully processed with a few μm order resolution.
