We propose a method to rate the credibility of news articles using three clues: (1) commonality of the contents of articles among different news publishers; (2) numerical agreement versus contradiction of numerical values reported in the articles; and (3) objectivity based on subjective speculative phrases and news sources. We tested this method on news stories taken from seven different news sites on the Web. The average agreement between the system-produced "credibility" and the manual judgments of three human assessors on the 52 sample articles was 69.1%. The limitations of the current approach and future directions are discussed.
