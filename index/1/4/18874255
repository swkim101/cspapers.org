In the context of a capability-based protection system, the term “transfer” is used (here) to refer to the situation where a user receives information when he does not initially have a direct “right” to it. Two transfer methods are identified: <italic>de jure</italic> transfer refers to the case when the user acquires the direct authority to read the information; <italic>de facto</italic> transfer refers to the case when the user acquires the information (usually in the form of a copy and with the assistance of others), without necessarily being able to get the direct authority to read the information. The Take-Grant Protection Model, which already models <italic>de jure</italic> transfers, is extended with four rewriting rules to model <italic>de facto</italic> transfer. The configurations under which <italic>de facto</italic> transfer can arise are characterized. Considerable motivational discussion is included.
