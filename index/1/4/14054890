Online ecommerce has been booming for a decade. For instance, as the largest online C2C marketplace (eBay), millions of new items are listed daily. Due to the overwhelming number of items, the process of finding the right items to buy is sometimes daunting. In order to address this problem, this paper describes the idea of predicting the probability that a newly listed item will be sold successfully. And adjust the item exposure chances proportional according to their conversion possibility. Hence, by ranking higher items that users are likely to buy, the chance that users make the purchases could be increased as well as their user satisfaction. For catalog products that have been listed repeatedly, this probability can be measured empirically. However, on C2C sites like eBay, lots of items are not product-based. They are unique, and from different sellers. Therefore, in order to predict whether a new listing will be sold, we collect a large scale item set as the training data, and a set of features were used to model the average buyer shopping decision on C2C sites. Experimental results verified our system's feasibility and effectiveness.
