As the volume of data and computational requirements of modern information retrieval systems continue to expand, it is inevitable that parallel systems will be necessary to meet these demands. In this research, we provide a conceptual model of a reconfigurable parallel information retrieval system in a multicomputer environment. We develop strategies for scheduling queries in such systems, provide simulation results for implementing these strategies under various different theoretical situations, and present an analytical model of the system behavior.
