Leader election is an important problem in distributed computing, and it is applied in many scientific fields such as communication network [1,2,3,4,5], centralized mutual exclusion algorithm [6,7], centralized control IPC, Berkeley algorithm, etc. Synchronization between processes often requires one process acting as a coordinator. The coordinator might not remain the same, because it might get crashed. Bully election algorithm is one of the classic methods which is used to determine the process with highest priority number as the coordinator. In this paper, we will discuss the drawbacks of Garcia_Molina's Bully algorithm and then we will present an optimized method for the Bully algorithm called modified bully algorithm. Our analytical simulation shows that, our algorithm is more efficient rather than the Bully algorithm with fewer message passing and fewer stages.
