A formal approach to deal with several types of grids in the context of multigrid algorithms is presented. The approach serves as a framework for describing the definition and manipulation of grids as well as the specification of typical grid algorithms. Furthermore, it is useful to define the transformation of high-level grid algorithms into parallel programs. The proposed method is used within the Suspense specification and transformation system to handle simple and staggered logically rectangular grids.
