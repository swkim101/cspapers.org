Transactional memory (TM) has emerged as a parallel programming paradigm for multi-core processors yet there is no standardized set of metrics with which to describe their behavior. In this work, we propose a set of transaction-oriented workload characteristics that can accurately capture the behavior of transactional memory programs. We apply principle component analysis and clustering algorithms to analyze the proposed transactional workload characteristics and show that these characteristics are architecturally independent
