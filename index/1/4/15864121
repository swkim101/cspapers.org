Smartphone users are facing serious threat of privacy leakage. This privacy leakage is caused not only by malicious applications (apps), but also by the most popular apps in one's pocket. In this poster, we present our study on the issues of information leakage caused by the most widely used apps in Chinese app markets. Our goal is to find what information is exposed by each popular app, and then to focus on the following three questions in order to explore the influence of this kind of information leakage: (1) to what extent can the information leaked by an app be used to characterize the user's behaviors? (2) to what extent can the information leaked by a number of apps in the same smartphone be used to characterize the user's behaviors' and (3) whether the leaked information from a number of smartphones can be integrated to predict the social behaviors' Preliminary experimental results on the top 50 popular apps in Chinese app markets show the serious situation of this kind of information leakage.
