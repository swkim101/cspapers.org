This paper is part of an investigation into efficient ways of implementing variable-length lists (see Brown [1]). Storage and access optimality are discussed from an information-theoretic viewpoint; in particular, we develop the notions of Kraft storage and Kraft access (see Elias [4]). Our attention here is restricted to the implementation of questions of the form: “What is the ith element in the list?” We derive consequences of achieving Kraft storage and/or Kraft access and then examine some common implementation schemes. In this abstract we shall give only an informal discussion of some basic concepts and results.
