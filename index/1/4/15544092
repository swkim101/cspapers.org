Over the last few years, visual people detection has made impressive progress. The paper gives an overview of some of the most successful techniques for people detection and also summarizes a recent quantitative comparison of several state-of-the-art methods. As a proof-of-concept we show that the combination of visual and laser-based people detection can result in a significant increase in performance. We also briefly discuss future research directions for visual people detection.
