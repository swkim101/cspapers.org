Efficient enumeration of minimal correction subsets (MCSes), defined as sets of constraints whose removal from the system restores feasibility, is a central task in such domains. In this work, we propose a novel approach to speeding up MCS enumeration over conjunctive normal form propositional formulas by caching of so-called premise sets (PSes) seen during the enumeration process. Contrasting to earlier work, we move from caching unsatisfiable cores to caching PSes and propose a more effective way of implementing the cache. The proposed techniques noticeably improves on the performance of state-of-the-art MCS enumeration algorithms in practice.
