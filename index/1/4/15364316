In the multi-armed bandit problem, an online algorithm must choose from a set of strategies in a sequence of n trials so as to minimize the total cost of the chosen strategies. While nearly tight upper and lower bounds are known in the case when the strategy set is finite, much less is known when there is an infinite strategy set. Here we consider the case when the set of strategies is a subset of ℝd, and the cost functions are continuous. In the d = 1 case, we improve on the best-known upper and lower bounds, closing the gap to a sublogarithmic factor. We also consider the case where d > 1 and the cost functions are convex, adapting a recent online convex optimization algorithm of Zinkevich to the sparser feedback model of the multi-armed bandit problem.
