Stream architecture is a novel microprocessor architecture with wide application potential. But as for whether it can be used efficiently in scientific computing, many issues await further study. This paper first gives the design and implementation of a 64-bit stream processor, FT64 (Fei Teng 64), for scientific computing. The carrying out of 64-bit extension design and scientific computing oriented optimization are described in such aspects as instruction set architecture, stream controller, micro controller, ALU cluster, memory hierarchy and interconnection interface here. Second, two kinds of communications as message passing and stream communications are put forward. An interconnection based on the communications is designed for FT64-based high performance computers. Third, a novel stream programming language, SF95 (Stream FORTRAN95), and its compiler, SF95Compiler (Stream FORTRAN95 Compiler), are developed to facilitate the development of scientific applications. Finally, nine typical scientific application kernels are tested and the results show the efficiency of stream architecture for scientific computing.
