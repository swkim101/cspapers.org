In this paper, we propose to direct the visual image of a videoconferencing system. Pictures of current videoconferencing systems are often boring. We thought presentation of pictures on TV and in movies should be studied to improve videoconferencing. For this purpose, we investigated several debate programs on TV. We classified all the shots into eight classes, and then determined the duration of each shot and the transition probabilities among the classes in order to describe the structure of TV programs. From this, rules to control pictures have been obtained. After that, we made a twopoint multi-party videoconferencing system that utilizes the rules. The system includes automated control of changes in camera focus.
