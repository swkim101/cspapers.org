This research investigates how humans distinguish different people with identical names on the web to improve web people search. We asked subjects to classify 20 pages of web people-search results for each of 20 person names and analyzed their decision processes through questionnaire, protocol analysis, and interview. We found that keywords, vocations, works (for a real person, works are those made by the individual and, for a fictional person, works are those in which the individual appears), facial images, and the names of related people are important for distinguishing individuals. We proposed a model for distinguishing individuals and a knowledge-structure model based on the experiment's results.
