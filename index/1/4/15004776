In this paper, we propose a class of queueing network models, and a method for their approximate solution, for computer networks with bursty traffic and finite buffer space. The model is open, implying no population limit except for buffer size limits and therefore no window-type flow control mechanism. Each node of the computer network is represented as a finite-length queue with exponential service and an arrival process which is initially bulk Poisson, but becomes less and less clustered from hop to hop. Elaborations are possible to account for varying mean packet sizes and certain buffer pooling schemes, although these involve further approximation. The approximations of the method were validated against several simulations, with reasonable agreement, and certainly with much less error than is obtained by modeling a bursty traffic source as Poisson.
