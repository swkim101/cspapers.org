Computer science (CS) is a relatively new discipline in the educational system. The expansion of computer use in modem societies led to the appew ante and rapid expansion of CS departments in many educational iustitutiona to meet the growing demand for computer professionals. The need for guidelines to govern the creation of the new CS progmma was Wwnt. %verd attempts to design models for CS graduate and undergraduate curricula were undertaken by computer professional societies and inte~ ested individuals [3,S,6,7,8,10,11,1$,1440,24. These models were meant to be general and to offer a reasonabledegree&freedom for the institutions choosing to adopt them. The mere existence of these models works to limit the common mistakea in CS curricula development snch as overplaying the role of programming courses, the bias towards topics relating to the expertiss of program designers, and the imbalance between the various components of a program. Many (n pro r worMwide are baaed on the suggestedmodels 1,22,4. However, it is our belief that these models were directed mainly to industrial, English-speaking countries and very little discussion is given to the moditkationa these models must undergo before adoption in developing and/or non-English speaking nations. This is especially regrettable since it is this group d departments that need more guidance in tailoring their programs to achkve the intended goals.
