This paper investigates the integration of multiple time-of-flight (ToF) depth sensors for object reconstruction. The advantage of such a sensor network is in the increased viewing coverage and addressing the problem of object self-occlusion. However, in utilizing a network of depth sensors, calibration and interference between the sensors can be one of the key challenges of their effective utilization. In comparison with infrared depth sensors, integration of time-of-flight sensors offer some new challenges. This paper presents experimental studies of practical factors that can affect such integration and proposes a guideline which can be used to avoid interferences. Using the proposed set-up, the paper also presents a method which can be used for reconstructing objects in such a sensor network.
