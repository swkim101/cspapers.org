We define the concept of polynomial uniform convergence of relative frequencies to probabilities in the distribution-dependent context. Let Xn = {0,1}n, let Pn be a probability distribution on Xn and let Fn ⊂ 2Xn be a family of events. The family {(Xn, Pn, Fn)}n≥1 has the property of polynomial uniform convergence if the probability that the maximum difference (over Fn) between the relative frequency and the probability of an event exceed a given positive e be at most δ (0 0 such that M(n, t) = O(n/tβ). Applications to distribution-dependent PAC learning are discussed.
