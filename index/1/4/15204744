A simulation relation between programs is defined which is quasi-ordering. Mutual simulation is then an equivalence relation, and by dividing out by it we abstract from a program such details as how the sequencing is controlled and how data is represented. The equivalence classes are approxiamtions to the algorithms which are realized, or expressed, by their member programs. A technique is given and illustrated for proving simulation and equivalence of programs; there is an analogy with Floyd''s technique for proving correctness of programs. Finally, necessary and sufficient conditions for simulation are given.
