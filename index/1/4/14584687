Tree diagrams can be fruitfully employed in elementary courses to illustrate recursion, explain its implementation, and motivate its applications in algorithm design. At the same time, tree diagrams can lead to guidelines to help the student decide when recursion is a good method, and when it should be avoided. This paper discusses these methods and, as an example, develops an algorithm for generating permutations.
