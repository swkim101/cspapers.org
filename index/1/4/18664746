A protocol that models the data transfer functions of TCP has been formally specified and mechanically verified. This work represents a significant application of deductive verification techniques to protocol analysis. The formal methods are based on a concurrent process model and its associated proof techniques. Mechanical theorem proving is used as an integral part of the methodology. Both formal and informal specifications of the protocol are presented as well as a high level overview of the proof.
