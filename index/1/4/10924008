Concurrent programming is becoming more important due to the growing dominance of multi-core processors and the prevalence of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). To prepare students for the concurrent future, instructors have begun to address concurrency earlier in their curricula. Unfortunately, test-driven development, which enables students and practitioners to quickly develop reliable single-threaded programs, is not as effective in the domain of concurrent programming. This paper describes how ConcJUnit can simplify the task of writing unit tests for multi-threaded programs, and provides examples that can be used to introduce students to concurrent programming.
