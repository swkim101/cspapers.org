Users of information retrieval systems often input queries containing terms that do not match the terms used to index the majority of the relevant documents [l]. This problem of vocabulary mismatch can be effectively alleviated through a strategy known as “term suggestion” [2], an interactive process that allows users to peruse and select terms from those “suggested” by the system. However, to be able to suggest query terms, the system has to extract keywords from the document database, which leads to the problem of keyword extraction.
