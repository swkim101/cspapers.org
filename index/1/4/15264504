Past register allocators have applied heuristics to allocate registers at the local, global, and interprocedural levels. This paper presents a polynomial time interprocedural register allocator that models the cost of allocating registers to procedures and spilling registers across calls. To find the minimum cost allocation, our allocator maps solutions from a dual network flow problem that can be solved in polynomial time. Experiments show that our interprocedural register allocator can yield significant improvements in execution time.
