Open information extraction (Open IE) was presented as an unrestricted variant of traditional information extraction. It has been gaining substantial attention, manifested by a large number of automatic Open IE extractors and downstream applications. In spite of this broad attention, the Open IE task deﬁnition has been lacking – there are no formal guidelines and no large scale gold standard annotation. Subsequently, the various implementations of Open IE resorted to small scale post-hoc evaluations, inhibiting an objective and re-producible cross-system comparison. In this work, we develop a methodology that leverages the recent QA-SRL annotation to create a ﬁrst independent and large scale Open IE annotation, 1 and use it to automatically compare the most prominent Open IE systems.
