The growing popularity of IEEE 802.11 has made wireless LAN a potential candidate technology for providing high speed wireless access services. Also, by supporting Mobile IP, wireless LAN can meet demands for expanded wireless access coverage while maintaining continuous connectivity from one wireless LAN to another. In the Mobile IP procedure, mobile node movement can be detected from advertisements of foreign agents that differ from the previously received advertisement and the new "care-of" address is registered with the home agent. However, user packets are not forwarded to the new foreign agent until registration is completed and this interruption may degrade the quality of service especially in real-time applications such as audio and video or may lower the TCP throughput due to retransmission timeout. To tackle these issues, we propose a new low latency handoff method, where access points used in a wireless LAN environment and a dedicated MAC bridge are jointly used to alleviate packet loss without altering the Mobile IP specifications. In this paper, we present the design architecture of the proposed method and evaluate its performance in an actual network environment to verify the effectiveness of our approach.
