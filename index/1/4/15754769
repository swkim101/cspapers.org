In this paper we describe a tool developed as part of the assessment process used at our university. The tool allows the automatic determination of the degree to which individual students meet the learning objectives that indicate how well students meet both course objectives and program directives. We also describe a portion of our assessment process that helps us perform the difficult step of "closing the loop" to make sure that the results of our data analysis are used to insure continuous program improvement.
