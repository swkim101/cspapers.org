A system has been developed at The Boeing Company for the automation of electrical-electronic computer layout and interconnection on printed circuit cards.
 The system, called AUTOCARD, uses the computer and a numerically controlled drafting machine to generate actual size interconnection drawings which facilitate the concept of etching masks. This paper covers the growth and state of development of AUTOCARD.
