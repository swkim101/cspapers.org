After several years of using videodisc systems as a topic in a Current Directions course for seniors, a sophomore-level Multimedia course (D250) was added in the fall of 1995. The course includes hands-on experience with multimedia development and multimedia presentation software. In its first five years (fourteen sections averaging twenty students), D250 has been successful on two fronts. First, it has proven feasible, albeit challenging, to offer this somewhat technology-intensive course on a shoestring budget. Second, in addition to the Information System majors who are required to take D250, a diverse group of non-majors are taking the course as an elective. Guided in part by the advice presented, a similar course could be implemented by other schools.
