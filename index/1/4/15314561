The approach presented is intended to help solve design problems above the logical level. It is based on the use of a special class of PETRI nets to model system components and data flows. Instead of describing an already existing design the functions to be implemented are introduced by a specification program. This serves as a basis for algorithms generating a controlled system structure which exactly performs the functions specified. So, no further verification is necessary. It is finally shown how to interpret the generated control structure.
