For more than two decades, researchers have proposed and developed methods of providing propulsion at the tip of the colonoscope so that it can pull itself through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Most of these methods simulate the way animals move, e.g. earthworm, snake, etc. Other means such as mechanically and through natural peristalsis were also proposed for propelling endoscope. This paper reviews the various locomotion techniques associated with robotic colonoscopy.
