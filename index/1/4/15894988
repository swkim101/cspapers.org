Marine robots are an increasingly attractive means for observing and monitoring in the ocean, but underwater acoustic communication (“acomms”) remains a major challenge, especially for real-time control. Packet loss occurs widely, bit rates are low, and there are significant delays. We consider here strategies for feedback control with acomms links in either the sensor-controller channel, or the controller-actuator channel. On the controller-actuator side we implement sparse packetized predictive control (S-PPC), which simultaneously addresses packet-loss and the data rate limit. For the sensor-controller channel we study a modified information filter (MIF) in a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control scheme. Field experiments were carried out with both approaches, regulating crosstrack error in a robotic kayak using acomms. Outcomes with both the S-PPC and MIF LQG confirm that good performance is achievable.
