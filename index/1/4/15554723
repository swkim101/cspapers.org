Inspired by Hill and Hollans original work [7], we have beendeveloping a theory of interaction history and building tools toapply this theory to navigation in a complex information space. Wehave built a series of tools - map, paths, annota- tions andsignposts - based on a physical-world navigation metaphor. Thesetools have been in use for over a year. Our user study involved acontrolled browse task and showed that users were able to get thesame amount of work done with significantly less effort.
