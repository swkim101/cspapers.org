A multimicrocomputer system is described, stressing mainly software and hardware architectures, which has been constructed mainly for image creation. This system is distinctive mainly in that (i) 64 unit computers are interconnected with a root computer, each of equal performance, such that a number of unit computers constitute a pipelined computer and such pipelined computers work in parallel, all controlled by the root computer, and (ii) an intercomputer memory swapping unit is introduced, which is to be linked with a pair of unit computers to transfer a great amount of data at a time from one to the other through the use of a bus exchange switch.
