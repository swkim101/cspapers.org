We propose and explore a novel alternative framework to study the complexity of counting problems, called Holant Problems. Compared to counting Constrained Satisfaction Problems (CSP), it is a refinement with a more explicit role for the function constraints. Both graph homomorphism and CSP can be viewed as special cases of Holant Problems. We prove complexity dichotomy theorems in this framework. Because the framework is more stringent, previous dichotomy theorems for CSP problems no longer apply. Indeed, we discover surprising tractable subclasses of counting problems, which could not have been easily specified in the CSP framework. The main technical tool we use and develop is holographic reductions. Another technical tool used in combination with holographic reductions is polynomial interpolations. The study of Holant Problems led us to discover and prove a complexity dichotomy theorem for the most general form of Boolean CSP where every constraint function takes values in the complex number field {C}.
