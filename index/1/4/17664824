Constraint-Based Test data generation (CBT) exploits constraint satisfaction techniques to generate test data able to kill a given mutant or to reach a selected branch in a program. When pointer variables are present in the program, aliasing problems may arise and may lead to the failure of current CBT approaches. In our work, we propose an overall CBT method that exploits the results of an intraprocedural points-to analysis and provides two specific constraint combinators for automatically generating test data able to reach a selected branch. Our approach correctly handles multi-levels stack-directed pointers that are mainly used in real-time control systems. The method has been fully implemented in the test data generation tool INKA and first experiences in applying it to a variety of existing programs tend to show the interest of the approach.
