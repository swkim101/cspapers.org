We present a technique for high-dynamic range stereo for outdoor mobile robot applications. Stereo pairs are captured at a number of different exposures (exposure bracketing), and combined by projecting the 3D points into a common coordinate frame, and building a 3D occupancy map. We present experimental results for static scenes with constant and dynamic lighting as well as outdoor operation with variable and high contrast lighting conditions.
