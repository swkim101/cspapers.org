Object tracking applications are gaining popularity and will soon utilize energy harvesting low-power wireless nodes where power is mostly consumed for neighbor discovery. Such applications require the design and experimentation with low-power neighbor discovery protocols. We demonstrate the Panda protocol [4, 5] implementation using commercial off-the-shelf energy harvesting devices, based on the TI eZ430-RF2500-SEH prototype. The prototypes harvest indoor light energy to perform power-aware neighbor discovery, while maintaining a power budget. A custom-designed online monitoring system interactively demonstrates the network dynamics, including the energy storage levels of the devices, the neighbor discovery events, and aggregate discovery statistics.
