Algorithm animation system design has focused primarily on providing advanced graphical capabilities. However, a fundamental mismatch exists between the needs of instructors and the features of existing algorithm animation systems. This mismatch has reduced the rate of adoption of algorithm animation tools. We describe a system, SKA (Support Kit for Animation), whose design is based on an examination of the tasks performed in the process of discussing algorithms and data structures. SKA attempts to support and enhance time-consuming instructional tasks such as tracing and data structure diagram manipulation, while requiring minimal preparation or authoring time.
