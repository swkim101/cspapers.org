where the j t h access is to the ij th item in symmetric order (the i0th item is the item originally at the root of the tree). In other words, the amortized cost of an access is 0 (1 + log d), where the current access is at distance d from the previous access (distance being measured in terms of the number of items straddled by the two successive accesses); in addition, there is an additive O(n) initialization cost. In this paper, the following bound is shown:
