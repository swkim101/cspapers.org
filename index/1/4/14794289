The need to find parking contributes to road congestion and leads to unnecessary fuel consumption. Of all emerging parking systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based systems have demonstrated the feasibility of real-time delivery of parking availability using magnetic sensors. However, existing magnetic-based methods are prone to false positives caused by electromagnetic fields emitted from surrounding electric facilities. In this study, we conducted a 3-month data collection in a parking area. We identified the need to introduce learning and collaboration into the design of our detection algorithm which recognizes learned patterns associated with car arrivals or departures, and to filter out unreliable events based on spatial and temporal features.
