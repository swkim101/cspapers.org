This paper reports on our NSF grant (CDA-9414309) from the Education Innovation program in the CISE directorate. We not only present the current status of grant activities as we near completion, but we also present a "how to" approach for those faculty from teaching-oriented schools who want to submit a proposal in the area of educational computing. We discuss both our successes and our failures and we give advice on how to avoid the pitfalls we have encountered. Most important, throughout the paper, we give advice on how to obtain funding in the first place.
