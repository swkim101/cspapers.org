A new method of reusing a subset of an M-QAM signal constellation is presented for Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation systems with Iterative Decoding (BICM-ID). In addition to the remapping of high-energy signals to low-energy signals in order to save the average signal energy as a shaping technique known so far, a new scheme of remapping low-energy signals to high-energy signals is proposed in order to gain the equivalent distance when decoding bits, often called the Squared Euclidean Weights (SEW). Numerical analysis and simulation results show that the partial reuse of the signals in the BICM-ID system with 16QAM can improve the system performance in terms of lowering the bit error rate in the error floor region.
