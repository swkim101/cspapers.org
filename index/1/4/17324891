Practitioners and researchers in health services and public health routinely estimate population health indicators from a range of data sources. These indicators are used in many settings to describe health status, monitor quality of care, and evaluate the effect of interventions. The data and knowledge necessary to calculate indicators, however, are scattered across different health settings, resulting in inconsistent and fragmented indicators and an inefficient use of population health information in research and practice. The Population Health Record (PopHR) described in this paper is an informatics platform for semi-automated integration of disparate data to enable measurement and monitoring of population health status and determinants. The research and development to build the PopHR uses AI methods to perform many tasks, including calculation of indicators and interaction with users.
