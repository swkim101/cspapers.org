The relational algebra of the relational model of databases is unable to express certain relations or operations of interest (for instance, the transitive closure of a relation), as Aho and Ullman have noted [AU]. They and others have suggested various extensions to the relational algebra or alternate query languages with more computational power (Chandra and Rare1 [CH], Codd [Co]). 'The ' ultimate goal of such proposals is to incorporate more of the computation necessary for constructing practical databases directly into the database management system itself thus leaving less to be done externally in a host language. In another paper we have proposed computed B relations as a way to extend the standard relational theory of databases so that it includes more computational power [MW]. In that paper we present the definitions and theorems necessary to the develop-
