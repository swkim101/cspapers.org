There are two significantly different approaches that can be used for measuring the performance of time-sharing systems. The "stimulus" approach which conceptualizes the system as a "black box" containing a limited number of known functions, involves applying a controlled set of stimuli to the black box in order to activate its functions, and then observing the results. In the "analytic" approach, probes are inserted into the system to allow the recording of any level of the system's behavior. Both approaches are being developed for, and have been used to measure, System Development Corporation's ADEPT time-sharing system.
