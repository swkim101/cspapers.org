Achieving timing-closure has become one of the hardest tasks in logic synthesis due to the required stringent timing constraints in very large circuit designs. In this paper, we propose a novel synthesis paradigm to achieve timing-closure called Timing-Aware CUt Enumeration (TACUE). In TACUE, optimization is conducted through three aspects: (1) a new divide-and-conquer strategy is proposed that generates multiple sub-cuts on the critical parts of the circuit; (2) two cut enumeration strategies are proposed; (3) an efficient parallel synthesis framework is offered to reduce computation time. Experiments on large and difficult industrial benchmarks show the promise of the proposed method.
