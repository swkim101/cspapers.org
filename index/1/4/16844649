Previous approaches to service selection are mainly based on capturing and exchanging the ratings of consumers to providers. However, ratings reflect tastes of the raters. Therefore, service selection using ratings may mislead the consumers having a taste different than that of the raters. We propose to use experiences instead of the ratings. Experiences are the representation of what is requested by a consumer and what is received at the end. Unlike ratings, experiences do not reflect the opinion of the others, but the actual story between consumers and providers concerning a service demand. Using experiences, the consumer models the services of a provider for a specific service demand and selects the provider that is expected to satisfy the consumer the most. Our simulations show that proposed approach significantly increases the overall satisfaction of the service consumers.
