This paper presents an approach to implementation of dialogue management modules for dialogue systems. The implementation method is divided into two distinct, but correlated, steps; Conceptual design and Framework customisation. Conceptual design and framework customisation are two mutually dependent sides of the same phenomena, where the former is an on-paper activity that results in a design document and the latter results in the actual program code. The method is iterative and conforms with software development methods, such as, extreme programming, scenario-based design and reusable object-oriented software development. In the paper, this is further elaborated and how it relates to dialogue systems development.
