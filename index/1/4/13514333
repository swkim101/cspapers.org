Abstract : Distributed systems are multi-processor information processing systems which do not rely on the central shared memory for communication. This paper presents ideas and techniques in modelling distributed systems and its application to Artificial Intelligence. In section 2 and 3, we discuss a model of distributed systems and its specification and verification techniques. We introduce a simple example of air line reservation systems in Section 4 and illustrate our specification and verification techniques for this example in the subsequent sections. Then we discuss our further work. (Author)
