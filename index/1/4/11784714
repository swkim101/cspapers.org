This paper introduces a novel interface for digitally-augmentedcooperative play. We present the concept of the athletic-tangibleinterface, a new class of interaction which uses tangible objectsand full-body motion in physical spaces with digital augmentation.We detail the implementation of PingPongPlus, a reactive ping-pongtable, which features a novel sound-based ball tracking technology.The game is augmented and transformed with dynamic graphics andsound, determined by the position of impact, and the rhythm andstyle of play. A variety of different modes of play and initialexperiences with PingPongPlus are also described.
