This paper explores Chinese semantic role labeling (SRL) for nominal predicates. Besides those widely used features in verbal SRL, various nominal SRL-specific features are first included. Then, we improve the performance of nominal SRL by integrating useful features derived from a state-of-the-art verbal SRL system. Finally, we address the issue of automatic predicate recognition, which is essential for a nominal SRL system. Evaluation on Chinese NomBank shows that our research in integrating various features derived from verbal SRL significantly improves the performance. It also shows that our nominal SRL system much outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.
