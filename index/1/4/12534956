CIBOL (CIrcuit BOard Layout) is an application program that uses a computer graphics facility to aid in the design of low density discrete component printed wiring boards. There are three distinct program phases: creating the board outline, positioning the components, and routing the interconnections. A light pen and scope display are used interactively during the three program phases. The program directly generates manufacturing information on auxiliary peripherals in the form of parts lists, component layouts, drilling lists and artmasters. The use of the program has resulted in considerable savings in the cost of producing printed wiring board designs and reduction in the turnaround time from design inception to completion.
