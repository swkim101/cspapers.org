In this paper we describe an approach for service discovery supported by semantic annotations. We propose a metamodel representation of both the WSDL documents and the associated semantic annotations. Based on this metamodel, effective service discovery is achieved by a Datalog engine implementing flexible matchmaking techniques that allow both exact and partial matches among search results. The metamodel is supported by a storage system that ensures scalability of the entire process. Finally we illustrate experiments on a public dataset of semantic service descriptions.
