Browse with either web directories or social bookmarks is an important complementation to search by keywords in web information retrieval. To improve users' browse experiences and facilitate the web directory construction, in this paper, we propose a novel browse system called Social Web Directory (SWD for short) by integrating web directories and social bookmarks. In SWD, (1) web pages are automatically categorized to a hierarchical structure to be retrieved efficiently, and (2) the popular web pages, hottest tags, and expert users in each category are ranked to help users find information more conveniently. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our SWD system.
