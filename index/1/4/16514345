Kala is an untyped persistent store for practical object-based systems, such as OODBMS, OMS, and object-oriented languages with persistence. Baskets are dynamic groupings of immutable data elements managed by Kala. Baskets synthesize transaction, configuration management, and access control semantics, and thus offer a platform for implementing arbitrary such models. In this article we introduce Kala baskets, their design motivations and goals. We then explain Kalaâ€™s basket mechanism in some detail. Finally, we offer a few examples of how baskets are used to implement features of arbitrary transaction, configuration, and access models.
