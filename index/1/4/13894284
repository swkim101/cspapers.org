For any AND-OR formula of size N, there exists a bounded-error N1/2+o(1)-time quantum algorithm, based on a discrete-time quantum walk, that evaluates this formula on a black-box input. Balanced, or "approximately balanced," formulas can be evaluated in O(radicN) queries, which is optimal. It follows that the (2-o(1))th power of the quantum query complexity is a lower bound on the formula size, almost solving in the positive an open problem posed by Laplante, Lee and Szegedy.
