We consider a voice/data integrated local area communication system. Due to the high suitability of CSMA/CD protocols for data communication and the existence of real time voice delay constraints we consider a hybrid TDM/CSMA/CD protocol. This model fundamentally differs from the very well documented voice/data integrated systems in point to point networks in which both voice and data users are assigned fixed duration time slots for transmission. The TDM/CSMA/CD integrated system performance is analysed and basic performance tradeoffs in the system design are manifested.
