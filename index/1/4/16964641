This paper explores the relationships among reactivity, heuristic reasoning, and search. It describes a hybrid, hierarchical reasoner that first has the opportunity to react correctly. If no ready reaction is computed, the reasoner activates a set of reactive triggers for time-limited search procedures. If they too fail to produce a response, the reasoner resorts to collaboration among a set of heuristic rationales. In a series of experiments, this hybrid reasoner is shown to be effective and efficient. The data also show how each of the three processes (correct reactions, time-limited search with reactive trigger, and heuristic rationales) plays an important role in problem solving. Reactivity is demonstrably enhanced by brief, knowledge-based, intelligent searches to generate solution fragments.
