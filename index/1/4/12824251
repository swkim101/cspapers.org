Mobile manipulators and humanoid robots should have the ability to use objects in their environments. Previous work has shown significant advantages to robots that can remove objects that interfere with their goal. We propose the next step. Just like the fictional character `MacGyver,' robots should construct simple machines and tools from arbitrary objects. This video presents our progress in developing and validating `MacGyver' skills in a simulated rescue mission.
