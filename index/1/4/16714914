The field of robotics is currently undergoing a change toward creation of robots that can naturally interact with humans. For achieving this, interactive robots must be endowed with natural interfaces that can sense and respond in real-time. Vision can provide handy information for this purpose by detecting and tracking human limbs to analyze gestures, actions and even emotions. However, real-time processing of visual information is a challenging bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, namely "self-organized contours", that can distinctly accelerate contour initialization, which is the slowest phase in visual tracking. Although the proposed method is general-purpose, it allows immediate initialization of active contours due to its similarity with snake structure. The proposed method is inspired from group behavior in insects and animals, particularly fishes.
