In this paper, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier has been used to detect a face in an authentication application. A face candidate is first allocated from the input frame and then normalized to 200Ã—200 pixels images. The textureness of candidates is then measured by the combination of BDIP and BVLC moments and classified into face and non-face ones by a SVM classifier which is known as efficient classification tool. In SVM learning, a DB of 2500 faces and 2500 non-faces has been created under different light conditions and face expressions. The experiments showed that the effectiveness of the used features for SVM based classification issue in the face-detection system.
