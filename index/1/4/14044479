Since pi and pz are supposed constants we can We consider the following problem which arises in the computation of electrostatic fields. We are given two convex disjoint simplicies S1 and Sz in 3-space, of volume respectively VI and V2, with a uniform charge density respectively pr and ~2. We want to compute the electrostatic force LIZ acting on the two simplicies. We describe a Monte Carlo method that computes an approximation p{‘:, of @iz such that, with probability 1 6, the absolute approximation error is ]]E’1z I’;,11 5 epi Vlp2V2, for any e > 0. The approximation is computed in time O(eP2 log 6-l) in the real-RAM model. We do not make use of any additional assumption, in particular, on the minimum distance between the two objects. The method is very simple, practical, and easy to extend to non-convex polyhedra. This result is obtained using a new interpretation of the electrostatic field, based on integral geometry, which eliminates the singularities present in traditional definitions of the electrostatic force and electrostatic potential. A singularity-free expression of the electrostatic force, beside its elegance, has the beneficial effect of making the derived algorithms more robust against numerical errors.
