A central algorithm in production systems is the pattern match among rule predicates and current data. Systems like OPS5 and its various derivatives use the RETE algorithm for this function. This paper describes and analyses several augmentations of the basic RETE algorithm that are incorporated into an experimental production system, YES/OPS, which achieve significant improvement in efficiency and rule clarity.
