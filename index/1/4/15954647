We describe a technique for specifying operational profiles for modules. The technique is more general than those of the current literature and allows more accurate specification of module usage. We also outline an algorithm for automatically generating random test cases from any such operational profile specification for a module, such that the test cases correspond to a random sampling of the module's input in actual operation. Operational-based statistical estimations, such as operational reliability, may be more meaningful when our specification method and generation algorithm are used, because our method permits more precise specifications than do other methods in the current literature.
