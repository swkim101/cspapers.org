Knowledge graphs have become a fundamental asset for search engines. A fair amount of user queries seek information on problem-solving tasks such as building a fence or repairing a bicycle. However, knowledge graphs completely lack this kind of how-to knowledge. This paper presents a method for automatically constructing a formal knowledge base on tasks and task-solving steps, by tapping the contents of online communities such as WikiHow. We employ Open-IE techniques to extract noisy candidates for tasks, steps and the required tools and other items. For cleaning and properly organizing this data, we devise embedding-based clustering techniques. The resulting knowledge base, HowToKB, includes a hierarchical taxonomy of disambiguated tasks, temporal orders of sub-tasks, and attributes for involved items. A comprehensive evaluation of HowToKB shows high accuracy. As an extrinsic use case, we evaluate automatically searching related YouTube videos for HowToKB tasks.
