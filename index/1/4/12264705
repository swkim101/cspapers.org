The CEN directive takes effect on January 1, 1993,and allows European employers five years to make sure that all computer products in use comply with the appropriate standards.

All software products marketed within the EEC will need to comply with these standards, regardless of where the software products were developed. This panel will discuss these standards and how they will influence the work of the CHI community. The session will focus on a standard devoted to Menus (ISO 9241-14), a component common to most user interfaces, This particular document falls under the CEN directive, has already passed the fit vote of the 1S0 member nations, and is considered well on its way to becoming art official CEN requirement,
