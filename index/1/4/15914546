This paper presents a formal relationship for probability Ken Satoh Generation Computer Technology Minato-ku, Tokyo 108, Japan [emailÂ protected] for probability theory and a class of nonmonotomc reasoning which we call daxy nonmonotonic reusoning. In lazy nonmonotonic reasoning, nonmonotonicity emerges only when new added knowledge is contradictory to the previous belief. In this paper, we consider nonmonotonic reasoning in terms of consequence relation. A consequence relation is a binary relation over formulas which expresses that a formula is derivable from another formula under inference rules of a considered system. A consequence relation which has lazy nonmonotonicity is called a rutionad consequence relation studied by Lehmann and Magidor (1988). 
 
We provide a probabilistic semantics which characterizes a rational consequence relation exactly. Then, we show a relationship between propositional circumscription and consequence relation, and apply this semantics to a consequence relation defined by propositional circumscription which has lazy nonmonotonicity.
