A system is described that integrates vision and tactile sensing in a robotics environment to perform object recognition tasks. It uses multiple sensor systems (active touch and passive stereo vision) to compute three dimensional primitives that can be matched against a model data base of complex curved surface objects containing holes and cavities. The low level sensing elements provide local surface and feature matches which are constrained by relational criteria embedded in the models. Once a model has been invoked, a verification procedure establishes confidence measures for a correct recognition. The three dimen* sional nature of the sensed data makes the matching process more robust as does the system's ability to sense visually occluded areas with touch. The model is hierarchic in nature and allows matching at different levels to provide support or inhibition for recognition.
