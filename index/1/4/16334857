Most phishing pages try to convince users that they are legitimate sites by imitating visual signals like logos from the websites they are targeting. Visual similarity detection methods look for these imitations between the screen-shots of the suspect pages and an image database of the most targeted websites. Existing approaches, however, are either too slow for real-time use or not robust to manipulation. In this work, we design a multi-phase framework for visual similarity detection. The first phase of the framework should rule out the bulk of websites quickly, but without introducing false negatives and with resistance to attacker manipulations. Later phases can use more heavyweight operations to decide whether or not to warn the user about possible phishing. In this abstract, we focus on the first phase. In experiments, our proposed method rules out more than half of the test cases with zero false negatives with less than 5 ms of processing time per page.
