Exertion interfaces are physically demanding, enabling the introduction of exercise to the traditionally sedentary gaming community. When linked with suitable software they may also be used for rehabilitation, promoting a higher level of effort than more traditional rehabilitation techniques. However, exertion interfaces, and treadmill interfaces in particular, are associated with complex perceptual changes and stimulate a physical response which may not always be what is expected or desirable. It is suggested that systematic analysis of the interplay of conscious perception and subconscious response in exertion interaction will better inform the development of these interfaces, enabling their full potential to be realised.
