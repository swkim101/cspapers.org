The paper proposes a simple diagram for data transmission on the frequency of 2.4GHz based on the Manchester code. Unlike the classical methods, the receiver usually performs some feedback loops to stabilize the gain to control the sampling at exact position (timing) of the symbol or to synchronize and track frequency. The proposed diagram only uses a cut-off signal to detect data directly without any feedback loops. Although it is simple, the proposed diagram still obtains high stable operation and wide input dynamic range. The experiment was tested by transmitting a 64kbit image file through an embedded FPGA system. Due to the use of Manchester code, then the cost of the proposed method depends only on the bandwidth. Furthermore, the proposed diagram is more suitable for indoor transmission applications and transmitting high-speed data by using Ultra Wide Band (UWB) pulses.
