Formal software developments need tool support to ensure the strict consistency of the complete design chain and thereby to help software engineers in their work. This paper evaluates one of these tools, the B theorem prnver. It first gives a short overview of the tool and reports on its experimental evaluation. It then describes the application of B to control VDM developments and illustrates this by means of excerpts from a case study. This work results in a formal description of the logical framework of VDM and opens perspectives for the re-use of software developments.
