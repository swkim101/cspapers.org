Location information about mobile devices can reveal movement patterns of people wearing them. We present a cross-technology approach to track Wi-Fi enabled smartphones using a ZigBee sensor network. Implementing such a system on resource constrained low-power sensor nodes requires means to efficiently process signal strength measurements. We propose a new method to recognize Wi-Fi probe requests on devices that are unable to decode Wi-Fi packets. Initial experiments on a testbed show that it is possible to localize unmodified phones within a building using signal strength measurements.
