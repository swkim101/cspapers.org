Process oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL) is an active, student-centered approach to teaching/learning [6]. In a POGIL classroom, students work in small teams on inquiry-based activities that guide students to discover concepts. These activities are designed to align with the learning cycle [8] and include elements that are designed to additionally develop process skills (e.g., team work, conflict resolution, written and oral communication, etc.). The role of the instructor in a POGIL classroom is to facilitate student discovery, rather than to deliver lecture. The POGIL approach was developed and refined within the physical sciences and its success in general and organic chemistry courses has been documented in a variety of university contexts. In particular, POGIL classes contain fewer failing grades and withdrawals [9] and result in a high degree of mastery [5] than traditional classes. Because of its success, the approach has begun to be adopted by the computer science community and has generated increasing interest and activity at SIGCSE ([4], [3], [7], [2]). Though the POGIL approach is well-documented, there is no single way to implement a POGIL classroom. The purpose of this panel is to examine the varying challenges to adopting POGIL in different institutional contexts and to explore how POGIL has been implemented in a wide variety of computer science classrooms. In addition to giving a brief overview of the POGIL approach, panel members will
