Energy consumption is an important concern at data centers, where storage systems consume a significant fraction of the total energy. A recent study proposed power-aware storage cache management to provide more opportunities for the underlying disk power management scheme to save energy. However, the on-line algorithm proposed in that study requires cumbersome parameter tuning for each workload and is therefore difficult to apply to real systems.This paper presents a new power-aware on-line algorithm called PB-LRU (Partition-Based LRU) that requires little parameter tuning. Our results with both real system and synthetic workloads show that PB-LRU without any parameter tuning provides similar or even better performance and energy savings than the previous power-aware algorithm with the best parameter setting for each workload.
