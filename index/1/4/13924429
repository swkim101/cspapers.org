Case-based analysis is a bottom-up methodology for ethical reasoning. In a teaching environment, it can be a useful alternative to top-down methods, such as Kantianism, utilitarianism, rights-based theories, and virtue ethics. We describe a methodology for case-based analysis and illustrate the methodology by evaluating three test cases in the areas of Internet etiquette, intellectual property, and privacy, respectively. We summarize the strengths and weaknesses of using the case-based approach in a classroom setting.
