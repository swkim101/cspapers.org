Based on this framework, we propose Predictive State Representation with Random Fourier Features (RFF-PSR). A key property in RFF-PSRs is that the state estimate is represented by a conditional distribution of future observations given future actions. RFFPSRs combine this representation with moment-matching, kernel embedding, and local optimization to achieve a method that enjoys several favorable qualities: It can represent controlled environments which can be affected by actions, it has an efficient and theoretically justified learning algorithm, it uses a non-parametric representation that has expressive power to represent continuous non-linear dynamics. We provide a detailed formulation, a theoretical analysis and an experimental evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.
