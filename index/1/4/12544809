Natural language processing research increasingly relies on the output of a variety of syntactic and semantic analytics. Yet integrating output from multiple analytics into a single framework can be time consuming and slow research progress. We present a CONCRETE Chinese NLP Pipeline: an NLP stack built using a series of open source systems integrated based on the CONCRETE data schema. Our pipeline includes data ingest, word segmentation, part of speech tagging, parsing, named entity recognition, relation extraction and cross document coreference resolution. Additionally, we integrate a tool for visualizing these annotations as well as allowing for the manual annotation of new data. We release our pipeline to the research community to facilitate work on Chinese language tasks that require rich linguistic annotations.
