Search engines, portals and topic-centered web sites are all 
attempts to create more or less personalized web-services. 
However, no single service can in general fulfill all needs 
of a particular user, so users have to search and maintain 
personal profiles at several locations. We propose an architecture where each person has his own information 
management environment where all personalization is 
made locally. Information is exchanged with other’s if it’s 
of mutual interest that the information is published or received. We assume that users are self-interested, but that 
there is some overlap in their interests. 
Our recent work has focused on decentralized dissemination of information, specifically what we call decentralized recommender systems. We are investigating the behavior of such systems and have also done some preliminary work on the users’ information environment.
