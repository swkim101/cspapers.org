Current Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology involves two types of physical devices: tags and reader. The reader combines in a single physical device transmission (to the tags) and reception (from the tags) functions. In this paper we discuss an alternative approach, where receive functions are performed by a separate device called "RFID listener". This allows distributed tag-sensing schemes where one transmitter coexists with multiple listeners. We discuss pros and cons of both approaches and present our implementation of a passive RFID listener on GNU Radio. Our implementation is a basis for experimenting with future distributed listener-based systems, but it can be also used as a cheap and flexible protocol analyzer for currently available commercial RFID readers.
