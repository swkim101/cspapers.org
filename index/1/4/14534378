This paper presents Faces, an application built to enable effective people search in the enterprise. We take advantage of the popularity Faces has gained within a globally distributed enterprise to provide an extensive analysis of how and why people search is used within the organization. Our study is primarily based on an analysis of the Faces query log over a period of more than four months, with over a million queries and tens of thousands of users. The analysis results are presented across four dimensions: queries, users, clicks, and actions, and lay the foundation for further advancement and research on the topic.
