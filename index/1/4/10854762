This paper presents an approach for control of constrained multibody systems based on a projected inverse-dynamics control scheme. The main advantage of the controller is that it works for constrained systems, which have joints with no actuator (passive joints), e.g. parallel manipulators. Also the controller minimizes actuation force, while it does not require the constraint equations be linearly independent. Therefore, the controller can cope with redundant constraint or singular configuration. It follows with development of a complementary controller for control of constraint force.
