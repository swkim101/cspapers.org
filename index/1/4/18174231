In this paper, a microscopic 3D image is reconstructed for a micro-manipulation system. The 3D image reconstruction is based on a binocular stereo vision system. We propose a new method called "support value" to solve correspondence problems. Geometric constraints are added to reduce the ambiguities in stereo matching. Left/right consistency check is used to increase the confidence for matching results. Post-processing helps remove the outliers and make original dense disparity map smooth and reliable. The three-dimensional characteristics can be reconstructed by perspective projection. Finally, the 3D image reconstruction algorithm is successfully applied to a micro manipulation system for cell image reconstruction by a simpler and more friendly way.
