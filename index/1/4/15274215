This paper constitutes part of a general investigation into abstract computability on finitely generated free algebras (term algebras). The general idea is to determine an abstract computational process appropriate for computing on term algebras, the effectiveness of which should be apparent from the inductive structure of that domain, without reference to computability on the natural numbers (say, via coding).
