A stereo vision system which consists of a stereo viewer and a processing system with viewing control mechanisms is presented. The stereo viewer is an adapter which, attached to a single camera, provides it with a stereo image by means of a set of four mirrors. Since the system can control the angle of mirrors, it can adjust them to operate during zooming, panning, and focusing in stereo viewing. The vision system uses a high-speed block matching processor to provide the essential functionality needed for motion tracking and stereo matching. With this system visual searching and stereo tracking can be implemented in real time. The authors analyze the optical structure of the stereo viewer, describe the vision and control system, and present some experimental examples of its use.
