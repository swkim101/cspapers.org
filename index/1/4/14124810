Irregular array accesses are array accesses whose array subscripts do not have closed-form expressions in terms of loop indices. Traditional array analysis and loop transformation techniques cannot handle irregular array accesses. In this paper, we study two kinds of simple and common cases of irregular array accesses: single-indexed access and indirect array access. We present techniques to analyze these two cases at compile-time, and we provide experimental results showing the effectiveness of these techniques in finding more implicit loop parallelism at compile-time and improved speedups.
