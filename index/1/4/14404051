This paper presents a novel technique for empty category (EC) detection using distributed word representations. A joint model is learned from the labeled data to map both the distributed representations of the contexts of ECs and EC types to a low dimensional space. In the testing phase, the context of possible EC positions will be projected into the same space for empty category detection. Experiments on Chinese Treebank prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. We improve the precision by about 6 points on a subset of Chinese Treebank, which is a new state-ofthe-art performance on CTB.
