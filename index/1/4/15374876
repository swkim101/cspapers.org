This paper presents what we believe to be a novel application of production systems to the modeling of complex human-computer interaction. Within the limits of this paper we will briefly describe a production system and discuss its use to model human-computer interaction. We will also mention some existing research supporting its plausibility as a modeling technique. We describe a relatively complex task requiring human-computer interaction that provided experimental data to test the applicability of production systems to this problem area. The completion of this task by individuals was modeled using a set of psychologically plausible productions. The results of this process indicated that a production system may be a powerful empirical and theoretical technique for studying the human factors associated with computer systems.
