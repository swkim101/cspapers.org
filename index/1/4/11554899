The grasping control problem for a hyperredundant manipulator is presented. The dynamic model is derived by using Lagrange equations developed for infinite dimensional systems. The algorithms for the position and force control are proposed. The arm fluid pressure control is inferred and the conditions that ensure the stability of the motion are discussed. Numerical simulations are presented.
