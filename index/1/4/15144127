We have developed a system for remedial reading instruction that uses visually controlled auditory prompting to help the user with recognition and pronunciation of words. Our underlying hypothesis is that the relatively unobtrusive assistance rendered by such a system will be more effective than previous computer aided approaches. We present a description of the design and implementation of our system and discuss a controlled study that we undertook to evaluate the usability of the Reading Assistant.
