We describe a novel tool developed to support architectural design of distributed real-time control systems. The approach enables the co-simulation of functionality (from discrete-time control to logic) together with the controlled continuous-time processes and the behaviour of the computer system. In particular modelling and simulation of distributed computer control systems is supported allowing analysis of timing and control system robustness. An emphasised feature of the tool is its multidisciplinary and integrated approach that combines the views of control and computer engineering into one view at an appropriate level of abstraction. The use of the models and the tool is illustrated through examples and the usefulness of the approach for architectural design is discussed together with avenues for further work. The current models and the tool are designed with the modelling and analysis of fault-tolerant systems in mind. Improved support in this direction is the subject of ongoing work.
