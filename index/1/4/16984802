Recognizing social interests plays an important role of aiding human-computer interaction and human collaborative works. The recognition of social interest could be of great help to determine the smoothness of the interaction, which could be an indicator for group work performance and relationship. From socio-psychological theories, social engagement is the observable form of inner social interest, and represented as patterns of turn-taking and speech emotion during a face-to-face conversation. With these two kinds of features, a multi-layer learning structure is proposed to model the continuous trend of engagement. The level of engagement is classified into “high” and “low” two levels according to human-annotated score. In the result of assessing two-level engagemet, the highest accuracy of our model can reach 79.1%.
