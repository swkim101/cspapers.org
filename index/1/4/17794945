In our previous work, several system elements for space teleoperation were introduced: a Singularity Consistent (SC) teleoperation system, a mixed force and motion commands based space teleoperation system, and a 6-DOF haptic interface (Y. Tsumaki and M. Uchiyama, 1997; Y. Tsumaki et al., 1998). We introduce an advanced space teleoperation system which includes all the above elements. As a result, the system realizes safety against the singularities and excessive force, with good perception for the operator. In addition, to verify the effectiveness of this system, we conducted experiments through the Internet between DLR in Germany and Tohoku University in Japan in January 1999.
