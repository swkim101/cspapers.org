We present an efficient dynamic programming algorithm for synchronous parsing of sentence pairs from a parallel corpus with a given word alignment. Unless there is a large proportion of words without a correspondence in the other language, the worstcase complexity is significantly reduced over standard synchronous parsing. The theoretical complexity results are corroborated by a quantitative experimental evaluation.
