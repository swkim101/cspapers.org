A new program in undergraduate education at the National Science Foundation is the Course, Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) program. CCLI has two tracks that are of particular interest to CS faculty members. They are the Educational Materials Development (EMD) and the Adaptation and Implementation (A&I) tracks. The focus of the EMD track is to develop, test and implement new materials or practices for national dissemination. The focus of the A&I track is to adapt and implement existing innovative materials or practices within a particular institution.
Both of these tracks offer opportunities for funding for CS faculty concerned about improving the quality of CS undergraduate education. Projects can encompass a broad range of activities, from individual courses and laboratories through comprehensive projects that impact entire curricula or programs across multiple departments or institutions. Funding can be requested for all items normally supported by NSF, such as equipment and personnel. The next CCLI program deadline date is June 7, 2000, making the seminar very timely for people interested in developing a proposal.
