The Electronic Design Automation community is also becoming embroiled in patent and intellectual property related issues. More than 600 patents, issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, are directly relevant to Electronic Design Automation. On the one hand, inventors not only of hardware but also of software want to see their creations protected. On the other hand, software developers feel that software patents are a burden that will stifle creativity and make it impossible for individuals and small companies to be a key factor in developing new software products. Others familiar with the problem point out that initially many patents were issued for already existing matter and that these patents are therefore invalid.
