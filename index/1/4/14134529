Modern enterprise applications have to satisfy increasingly stringent Quality-of-Service requirements. To ensure that a system meets its performance requirements, the ability to predict its performance under different configurations and workloads is essential. Architecture-level performance models describe performance-relevant aspects of software architectures and execution environments allowing to evaluate different usage profiles as well as system deployment and configuration options. However, building performance models manually requires a lot of time and effort. In this paper, we present a novel automated method for the extraction of architecture-level performance models of distributed component-based systems, based on monitoring data collected at run-time. The method is validated in a case study with the industry-standard SPECjEnterprise2010 Enterprise Java benchmark, a representative software system executed in a realistic environment. The obtained performance predictions match the measurements on the real system within an error margin of mostly 10â€“20 percent.
