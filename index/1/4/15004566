In system-family approaches, product configuration is the activity of selecting the features desired for a software product. Although this process is typically collaborative this aspect has long been neglected. On the other hand, enabling collaborative product configuration brings new and challenging problems such as the proper coordination of configuration decisions.

Some aspects of the framework can be customized to accommodate specific collaboration goals.
