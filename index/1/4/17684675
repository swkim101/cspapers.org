The Bay Area Packet Radio Network has been integrated into an existing architecture for network interconnection: it can be used to provide radio communications for directly connected hosts, or as an alternative packet transport mechanism to carry traffic between two local networks. The radio link is operational, and can support regular internetwork communications at rates ranging from 12 to 20 kilobits/second, with the current Packet Radio equipment.
 Use of the Radionet required only the writing of a network specific driver for the standard communications software package. The driver is responsible for controlling the interface to the Radionet, performing fragmentation and reassembly of large packets, routing within the Radionet, and similar tasks.
