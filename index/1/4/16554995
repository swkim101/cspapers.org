Bursty application I/O patterns, together with transfer limited storage devices, combine to create a major I/O bottleneck on parallel systems. This paper explores the use of time series models to forecast application I/O request times, then prefetching I/O requests during computation intervals to hide I/O latency. Experimental results with I/O intensive scientific codes show performance improvements compared to standard UNIX prefetching strategies.
