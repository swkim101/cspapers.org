We present Mirage, a non body contact technique to infer the amount and type of body motion, gesture, and activity. This approach involves passive measurement of static electric field of the environment flowing through sense electrode. This sensing method leverages electric field distortion by the presence of an intruder (e.g. human body). Mirage sensor has simple analog circuitry, supports ultra-low power operation, and requires no instrumentation to the user. We illustrate the utility of Mirage with a demonstration of real-time interactive applications including activity monitoring and games which allow the users to interact with a computer using body motion.
