A severe potential security problem in utilization of Unicode on the Web is identified, which is resulted from the fact that there are many similar characters in the Universal Character Set (UCS). The foundation of our solution relies on evaluating the similarity of characters in UCS. We develop a solution based on the renowned Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method to establish such a Unicode Similarity List (UC-SimList).
