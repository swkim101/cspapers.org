We present Texas Instruments' implementation of IEEE 802.15.4e protocols (CSL and TSCH) in a multi-hop mesh. At the MAC layer, we discuss techniques which reduce radio duty-cycle in our CSL implementation. Further, we propose RPL adaptation, to operate the network in 2 phases, one with small DIO timer and another with large DIO timer to minimize the impact of RPL broadcasts. Our demo shows 10x reduction in radio power consumption resulting from careful implementation of our MAC and Routing layer techniques using TelosB motes running Contiki OS.
