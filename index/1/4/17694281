We introduce the relative rank differential statistic which is a non-parametric approach to document and dialog analysis based on word frequency rank-statistics. We also present a simple method to establish semantic saliency in dialog, documents, and dialog segments using these word frequency rank statistics. Applications of our technique include the dynamic tracking of topic and semantic evolution in a dialog, topic detection, automatic generation of document tags, and new story or event detection in conversational speech and text. Our approach benefits from the robustness, simplicity and efficiency of non-parametric and rank based approaches and consistently outperformed term-frequency and TF-IDF cosine distance approaches in several experiments conducted.
