Logic locking is a technique that has been proposed to thwart IC counterfeiting and overproduction by untrusted foundry. Recently, the security of logic locking is threatened by a new attack called SAT attack, which can effectively decipher the correct key of most logic locking techniques. In this paper, we propose a new technique called delay locking to enhance the security of existing logic locking techniques. For delay locking, the key into a locked circuit not only determines its functionality, but also its timing profile. A functionality-correct but timing-incorrect key will result in timing violations and thus making the circuit malfunction.
