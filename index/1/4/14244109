With the effects of global warming, some epidemic diseases via mosquito (e.g. mosquito-borne diseases) become more serious, such as dengue fever and zika virus. It is reported that the epidemic disease may cause many challenges to the hospital management due to the unexpected burst with uncertain reasons. Furthermore, the imperfect cares during the propagation of epidemic diseases, such as dengue fever (so far the appropriate treatment is not well established), may lead to the increasing mortality rate which should be avoided. In this paper, a novel paradigm for optimizing the placement of medical resource is proposed in pursuit of reducing the overloading cases in hospitals during the epidemic outbreak in the urban area. In this paper we explore the first paper to explore two important issues, including the strategy to evaluate the service quality and the solution to dynamically dispatch the medical resource, along with the spatial variation of epidemic outbreak. As validated in our experimental results in real data of dengue outbreak happening in Tainan (2015), we present the feasibility of our framework to deploy a dynamic placement strategy for medical resource assignment.
