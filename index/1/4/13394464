An idea of considering an autonomous mobile robot as a virtual local network system is proposed in developing a remote fault diagnosis system of a mobile robot. Within the developed diagnosis system, a mobile robot is taken as one of the management objects of the network management system for autonomous mobile robots, and the simple network management protocol, which is widely used in network management system, is applied and adapted to the developed system as the communication protocol for exchanging diagnosis information. Moreover, by taking advantage of active moving and sensing ability of autonomous mobile robots, an effective fault inference method is also discussed.
