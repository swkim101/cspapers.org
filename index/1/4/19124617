However, HFR is still a challenging problem due to great discrepancies between cross-modality images. This paper proposes an asymmetric joint learning (AJL) approach to handle this issue. The proposed method transforms the cross-modality differences mutually by incorporating the synthesized images into the learning process which provides more discriminative information. Although the aggregated data would augment the scale of intra-classes, it also reduces the diversity (i.e. discriminative information) for inter-classes. Then, we develop the AJL model to balance this dilemma. Finally, we could obtain the similarity score between two heterogeneous face images through the log-likelihood ratio. Extensive experiments on viewed sketch database, forensic sketch database and near infrared image database illustrate that the proposed AJL-HFR method achieve superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.
