We propose an online compensation scheme for rollover prevention of mobile manipulators based on the invariance control framework, and that makes use of recursively computed analytic gradients of the zero-moment point (ZMP) function. Our controller relaxes many of the assumptions made in existing approaches, and enhances robustness as well as effectiveness through the use of exact gradient information. Several case studies demonstrate the improved performance of our controller over existing rollover prevention schemes.
