This paper presents an algorithm that can recognize and localize objects given a model of their contours using only ultrasonic range data. The algorithm exploits a physical model of the ultrasonic beam and combines several readings to extract outline object segments from the environment. It then detects patterns of outline segments that correspond to predefined models of object contours, performing both object recognition and localization. The algorithm is robust since it can account for noise and inaccurate readings as well as efficient since it uses a relaxation technique that can incorporate new data incrementally without recalculating from scratch.<<ETX>>
