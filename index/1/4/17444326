In radiation therapy, prior to each treatment fraction, the patient must be aligned to computed tomography (CT) data. Patient setup verification systems based on range imaging (RI) can accurately verify the patient position and adjust the treatment table at a fine scale, but require an initial manual setup using lasers and skin markers. We propose a novel markerless solution that enables a fully-automatic initial coarse patient setup. The table transformation that brings template and reference data in congruence is estimated from point correspondences based on matching local surface descriptors. Inherently, this point-based registration approach is capable of coping with gross initial misalignments and partial matching. Facing the challenge of multi-modal surface registration (RI/CT), we have adapted state-of-the-art descriptors to achieve invariance to mesh resolution and robustness to variations in topology. In a case study on real data from a low-cost RI device (Microsoft Kinect), the performance of different descriptors is evaluated on anthropomorphic phantoms. Furthermore, we have investigated the system's resilience to deformations for mono-modal RI/RI registration of data from healthy volunteers. Under gross initial misalignments, our method resulted in an average angular error of 1.5Â° and an average translational error of 13.4 mm in RI/CT registration. This coarse patient setup provides a feasible initialization for subsequent refinement with verification systems.
