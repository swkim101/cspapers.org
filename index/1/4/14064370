If a fixed exponentially decreasing probability distribution function is used to model every object's lifetime, then the age of an object gives no information about its future life expectancy. This radioactive decay model implies there can be no rational basis for deciding which live objects should be promoted to another generation. Yet there remains a rational basis for deciding how many objects to promote, when to collect garbage, and which generations to collect.Analysis of the model leads to a new kind of generational garbage collector whose effectiveness does not depend upon heuristics that predict which objects will live longer than others.This result provides insight into the computational advantages of generational garbage collection, with implications for the management of objects whose life expectancies are difficult to predict.
