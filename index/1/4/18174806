The content-based retrieval of Western music has received increasing attention recently. Most of this research deals with monophonic music. Polyphonic music is more common, but much more difficult to represent [3]. Music information retrieval systems must extract viable features before they can define similarity measures. We summarize and categorize features that have been used for polyphonic retrieval with the aim of laying standardized groundwork for future research on feature extraction. Comparisons with and extensions to monophonic approaches are given and a new feature is proposed. We do not consider music in audio form. The lowest-level representation with which we are concerned is the event: the pitch, onset, and duration of every note in a source is known. In monophonic music, no new note begins until the current note has finished sounding. Sources are restricted to one-dimensional note sequences. Homophonic music adds another dimension; notes with different pitches may be played simultaneously, but they must still start and finish at the same time. Polyphonic music adds yet another complication. A note may begin before a previous note finishes.
