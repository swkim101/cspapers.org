Despite its substantial coverage, NomBank does not account for all within-sentence arguments and ignores extra-sentential arguments altogether. These arguments, which we call implicit, are important to semantic processing, and their recovery could potentially benefit many NLP applications. We present a study of implicit arguments for a select group of frequent nominal predicates. We show that implicit arguments are pervasive for these predicates, adding 65% to the coverage of NomBank. We demonstrate the feasibility of recovering implicit arguments with a supervised classification model. Our results and analyses provide a baseline for future work on this emerging task.
