Lifschitz introduced a logic of minimal belief and negation as failure, called MBNF, in order to provide a theory of epistemic queries to non monotonic databases. We present a feasible subsystem of MBNF which can be translated into a logic built on first order logic and negation as failure, called FONF. We give a semantics for FONF along with an extended connection calculus. In particular, we demonstrate that the obtained system is still more expressive than other approaches.
