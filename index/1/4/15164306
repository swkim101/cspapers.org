The Program Dependence Web (PDW) is a program representation that can be directly interpreted using control-, data-, or demand-driven models of execution. A PDW combines a single-assignment version of the program with explicit operators that manage the flow of data values. The PDW can be viewed as an augmented Program Dependence Graph. Translation to the PDW representation provides the basis for projects to compile Fortran onto dynamic dataflow architectures and simulators. A second application of the PDW is the construction of various compositional semantics for program dependence graphs.
