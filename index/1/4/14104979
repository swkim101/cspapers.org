An interactive computer system was made easier to learn for non-programmers by modifying the on-line HELP and error messages of a system designed primarily for programmers. The modifications included supplementing the existing HELP command with a HELP key, making the content of HELP and error messages more concrete, responding to command synonyms, and more. The systems were evaluated in a between-groups experiment in which office workers with no programming experience were asked to perform a typical office task using one of the unfamiliar interactive computer systems. The results of the experiment supported the inclusion of the modifications. Non-programmers using the modified system completed the computer task in less time, with greater accuracy, and with better resulting attitudes than those who used the system designed primarily for programmers.
