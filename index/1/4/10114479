Dependence graphs can be used as a vehicle for formulating and implementing compiler optimizations. This paper defines such graphs and discusses two kinds of transformations. The first are simple rewriting transformations that remove dependence arcs. The second are abstraction transformations that deal more globally with a dependence graph. These transformations have been implemented and applied to several different types of high-speed architectures.
