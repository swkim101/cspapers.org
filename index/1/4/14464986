The multi-core revolution presents both opportunities and challenges for real-time systems. Parallel computing can yield significant speedup for individual tasks (enabling shorter deadlines, or more computation within the same deadline), but unless managed carefully may add complexity and overhead that could potentially wreck real-time performance. There is little experience to date with the design and implementation of realtime systems that allow parallel tasks, yet the state of the art cannot progress without the construction of such systems. In this work we describe the design and implementation of a scheduler and runtime dispatcher for a new concurrency platform, RT-OpenMP, whose goal is the execution of real-time workloads with intra-task parallelism.
