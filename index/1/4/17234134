The purpose of Conditional Causal Logic (CCL) is to constitute a formal theory of the process by which the representation of the world emerges in a cognitive system. CCL is presented as a two-level language; this article concerns the first, called the E-language. This E-language is a formal theory for the determination process by which a cognitive system constructs its objective knowledge. The internal dynamics of this construction do not belong to the world of the a E-language, but to the E-language which constitutes the second level of CCL. This e-language is still being developed and it will only be referred to briefly in this article. The (T-language in itself offers some original features such as the notions of identity and distinction by determination and also a type of negation, functional negation, which has no equivalent in other models of conventional logic or nonstandard logic. In conclusion, some words will be said about design of a connexionist system founded on this theory of E-language.
