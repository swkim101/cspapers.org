In this paper a perceptual model of the interaction with pliable surface is presented. The aim of this work is to evaluate those human factors most relevant to surface contact task in a bilateral teleoperation system characterized by a low stiffness environment. Three psychophysical experiments are conducted using an high performance haptic device and a virtual environment. In the first experiment we measure the capability of the human hand in terms of absolute force detection. The second experiment takes into account the time required by the neuro-muscular-skeletal system to stabilize the hand displacement in the presence of an external force. In the third one, a task of surface detection is involved to measures the smallest penetration depth that can be used to reliably perceive the contact surface. These perceptual factors are evaluated to build a perceptual model of a surface detection task. Results show the effectiveness of our model, which can be useful in applications where it is crucial to be aware of the interplay among perceptual factors.
