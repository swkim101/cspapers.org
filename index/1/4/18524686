This paper describes a software system, ITDS, which supplies a chip or module tester with test data. There are two major components to the system: an interactive data entry system, ITLG; and a generator of environmental test data, SPEC/GEN. By "conversing" with its user, ITLG creates a technology library from a document of circuit specifications. The user does not need to be familiar with the tester. ITLG will guide the user by showing him how to enter the necessary data, by auditing his response and by informing him of the accuracy of his response. The SPEC/GEN system uses the technology library from ITLG to create a data set of final test values. These values are the result of calculations that consider the technology, tester, and the I/O electrical characteristics of the part number to be tested. This paper also shows how data set for final test is automatically created.
