This paper introduces the Open-Loop Intermittent Feedback Optimal pre-dictive (OLIFO) controller as an alternative to human movement control models based on system inverse control. OLIFO has the advantages of being applicable to any system, not requiring a desired system trajectory and handling naturally systems with time delays and constraints. Moreover, it shares important functional characteristics with the human movement control system. Its behaviour is illustrated through the control of a six muscles human arm model. Comparable performances obtained with the OLIFO controller and actual subjects suggest the plausibility of this scheme.
