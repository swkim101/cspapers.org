Patch clamping is an electrophysiological technique that permits the measurement of ion channel activity in many different kinds of cells. Placement of the patch clamp electrodes using micromanipulators is a time consuming and complicated task due to the lack of depth perception of microscope optics and the constrained physical environment. In order to simplify this process, a software platform has been created that permits the user to easily perform not only single electrode recordings but multiple ones. The software platform provides capabilities for automatic positioning of micropipettes in specified locations on the image plane, autofocusing on selected objects, detecting visible micropipettes using image processing techniques, haptic-enabled master slave control of micromanipulators for accurate positioning of electrodes while generating virtual forces to prevent collision between micropipettes, as well as several other novel features which help the user to perform patch clamping more efficiently. The system does not require any changes in the hardware, and uses a fully software-based approach.
