A neural net system called "Conposit" is described. Conposit performs rule-based manipulation of very short term, complex symbolic data structures. This paper concentrates on a simulated version of Conposit that embodies core aspects of Johnson-Laird's mental model theory of syllogistic reasoning. This Conposit version is not intended to be a psychological theory, but rather to act as a test and demonstration of the power and flexibility of Conposit's unusual connectionist techniques for encoding the structure of data.
