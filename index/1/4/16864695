Computer science (CS) education initiatives often use measures of interest to assess outcomes. Although appropriate for initiatives meant to encourage future participation, these measures do not always align with the complex nature of interest as described by the learning sciences literature or recognize the reality that school-related initiatives aimed at student engagement in CS will not produce individual interest in every student. In this paper, we present a review of the interest literature, and data from a survey with evidence of validity of over 1,500 students in various CS courses in New York City. By using Latent Class Analysis (LCA), we identify five different statistically significant subgroups of CS students: Enthusiasts, Engaged, Bookish, Idlers, and Disinterested. Our findings suggest that while some students enjoy CS in class and feel the teacher is pedagogically effective, they may not develop the individual interest characterized by seeking additional learning opportunities outside of class.
