We study the orienteering problem with time window (OPTW), which is essentially a game in which users accumulate scores by getting to some geolocations during certain time periods [3]. Solving OPTW gives the optimal path for each user to maximize his/her score. OPTW can be leveraged to enhance many mobile applications (apps). For example, an app may solve OPTW problems to guide a user who is waiting for his/her train to nearby shops without missing the train. Another app may solve OPTW problems to adaptively compose a customized tour plan for an unfamiliar city or a theme park. Furthermore, a mobile crowdsourcing app may solve OPTW problems to compute the best detour paths for smartphone users, who have some time to spare and wouldnâ€™t mind to perform some tasks for small rewards [2]. While all these apps can provide better user experiences by solving OPTW problems, existing OPTW algorithm gives optimal solution at the expense of high computational overhead [3], and may not be suitable for real-time systems and resource-constrained smartphones. This abstract aims to develop a scalable OPTW algorithm that allows users to tradeoff complexity and optimality. With the proposed algorithm, a user may opt to small (large) approximation gap with longer (shorter) running time, where the gap is controllable.
