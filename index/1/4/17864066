The viability of providing adaptive user interfaces has been demonstrated ([3], [5]). Such systems identify differences between users in order to provide purposeful change at the user interface. Thus, adaptive systems have objectives, as indicated by the term 'purposeful.' The research reported here takes an important step forward by demonstrating that adaptive systems can be built that regulate their own behaviour by assessing whether their adaptations are being successful in meeting these objectives.
