We study the backbone and the backdoors of propositional satisfiability problems. We make a number of theoretical, algorithmic and experimental contributions. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that backbones are hard even to approximate. From an algorithmic perspective, we present a number of different procedures for computing backdoors. From an empirical perspective. we study the correlation between being in the backbone and in a backdoor. Experiments show that there tends to be very little overlap between backbones and backdoors. We also study problem hardness for the Davis Putnam procedure. Problem hardness appears to be correlated with the size of strong backdoors, and weakly correlated with the size of the backbone, but does not appear to be correlated to the size of weak backdoors nor their number. Finally, to isolate the effect of backdoors, we look at problems with no backbone.
