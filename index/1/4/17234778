We develop a compositional proof-system for the partial correctness of concurrent constraint programs. Soundness and (relative) completeness of the system are proved with respect to a denotational semantics based on the notion of strongest postcondition. The strongest postcondition semantics provides a justification of the declarative nature of concurrent constraint programs, since it allows to view programs as theories in the specification logic.
