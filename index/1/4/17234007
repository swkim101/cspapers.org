The Open University of Israel (OUI) is a distance learning university. Our CS1 course is taught through video-taped lectures that cover the study material. In addition, students may participate in face-to-face group meetings in study centers located all over the country and taught by tutors. There is a special group called Ofek, in which the tutor is located in a studio and the lesson is broadcast over the internet. Students enrolled in this group participate from their home PCs. The taped Ofek sessions as well as the lectures are stored on the course website, and students can watch them whenever convenient. We conducted a study to investigate students' viewing habits and the relationship between viewing and the success rate in the course.
