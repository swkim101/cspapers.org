The indoor location market is growing rapidly. However, fine-grained and up-to-date indoor maps are rarely available, and the existing indoor localization and navigation services mostly require extra infrastructures to provide accurate locations. In this demonstration we show iMoon, an indoor navigation system that provides indoor mapping, localization and navigation services using photos and sensor data collected from widely available mobile devices. The demonstration leverages a cohesive suite of computer vision, mobile sensing, and wireless networking techniques.
