By emulsion polymerization of vinyl acetate, methylacrylate, acrylic acid, monoolefinically unsaturated sulfoalkyl esters or amides and vinyl sulfonate and partial saponification of the resultant copolymer emulsion, an aqueous solution of a copolymer is obtained which greatly delays the polymerization of styrene in aqueous media.
