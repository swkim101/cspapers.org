We develop two novel techniques, FHMT and HWMT, for streaming authenticated data structures to achieve the streaming verifiable computation. By leveraging the computing capability of fully homomorphic encryption, FHMT shifts almost all of the computation tasks to the server, reaching nearly no overhead for the client. HWMT strikes the performance balance between the client and server via the proposed tree decomposition technique over the Merkle tree. We also report our research attempt, SAMT, to construct a more efficient data structure for extremely resource-limited clients without the heavy computation burden on the server.
