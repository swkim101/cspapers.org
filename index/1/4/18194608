We present a fast and effective placement algorithm which takes advantage of inherent scarcity in the connectivity specification. It solves repeatedly sparse linear equations by the SOR (Successive Over-Relaxation) method in a top-down hierarchy. The algorithm has been implemented; for a triple-metal-layer 100K sea-of-gates design with 26,000 instances, it takes 50 minutes on a VAX 8650 and yields excellent results.
