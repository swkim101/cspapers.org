There are a wide variety of ways to present information at the front of a classroom. These include chalk on a blackboard, markers on a whiteboard, pens on transparencies, and computer projection systems. While computer-based presentation systems provide many opportunities both in and out of the classroom, there may also be many limitations. In-class spontaneity and dynamic exposition might be restricted. Class preparation time might increase dramatically when compared to the amount required to prepare handwritten materials. Certain presentation techniques may no longer be available. This paper will introduce a computer-based presentation system modeled on handwritten transparencies. It will then discuss how it addresses the above issues as well as how it can be used in and out of the classroom. These will be explored in the context of its use while teaching an undergraduate discrete mathematics course.
