The subject of integrated programming environments for scientific computing has become very popular over the last few years. Environments such as Rn [CCHK87] are being constructed to help coordinate the disjoint activities of editing, debugging, and performance tuning typically seen in the program development cycle. One key aspect of an integrated development setting is the library of user interface tools which are available to the environment builders. Projects such as Andrew [MSCH86] have begun to construct reusable user interface libraries for client applications. This paper describes the interface tool kit for the Faust project being conducted at the University of Illinois. Faust is targeted at building a coherent development environment for scientific applications through the use of a library of portable user interface utilities.
