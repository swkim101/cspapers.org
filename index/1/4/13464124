In this paper, we propose a framework to apply the indexing techniques of formal language processing in multi-metric route classification and cost evaluation for WSNs. Specifically, we present an easy to compute, dynamic routing lexicon and a corresponding lexicographical algorithm for path selection in case of availability of multiple paths. The cost evaluation of paths and path selection in case of availability of multiple paths is simple and particularly appealing for devices having low power and limited computational capabilities and other impairments. The proposed lexical approach has the potential to be applied over a myriad of WSNs. The benefits of our lexicographical approach over the existing weighted sum approach are particularly asserted. However, the proposed algorithm makes rigid decisions based on the preferred metric regardless of costs incurred by other metrics; we therefore present at the end a plausible criterion to remove this rigidity in path selection.
