The AT&T CRISP Microprocessor is a high performance general purpose 32-bit processor. It has been implemented as a single CMOS chip containing 172,163 transistors in a 1.75~t CMOS technology and runs at a clock frequency of 16 MHz. 1 The CRISP Microprocessor achieves performance through traditional techniques, such as pipelining, and from several new techniques not before found in microprocessor designs. This paper focuses on a detailed description of hardware architecture, including the pipeline structure and details of the architectural innovations. A brief introduction to the instruction-set and major features are given for background.
