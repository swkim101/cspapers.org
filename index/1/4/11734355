When equipped with kernel functions, online learning algorithms are susceptible to the "curse of kernelization" that causes unbounded growth in the model size. To address this issue, we present a family of budgeted online learning algorithms for multi-class classification which have constant space and time complexity per update. Our approach is based on the multi-class version of the popular Pegasos algorithm. It keeps the number of support vectors bounded during learning through budget maintenance. By treating the budget maintenance as a source of the gradient error, we prove that the gap between the budgeted Pegasos and the optimal solution directly depends on the average model degradation due to budget maintenance. To minimize the model degradation, we study greedy multi-class budget maintenance methods based on removal, projection, and merging of support vectors. Empirical results show that the proposed budgeted online algorithms achieve accuracy comparable to non-budget multi-class kernelized Pegasos while being extremely computationally efficient.
