Combinatorial graphs, often conveyed as node-link diagrams, figure prominently in Computer Science and other Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Unfortunately, they are most often inaccessible to blind students and professionals. This paper introduces GSK, a self-contained Graph SKetching tool that allows blind and sighted people to easily create, edit, and share graphs in real-time using interaction mechanisms (mouse, keyboard, monitor, screen reader) that are standard for them. GSK was successfully used by a blind Computer Science student and his sighted instructors to create and access graphs specific to his automata theory and operating systems courses. Our hope is that GSK will enable more blind STEM students and professionals to actively participate in their disciplines by providing them and their sighted colleagues with a cross-collaboration tool that allows them to share graphs just as easily as they share text and word processing documents.
