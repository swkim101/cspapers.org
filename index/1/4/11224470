In cellular modeling a given structure is broken up into a collection of substructures called “cells.” Gross topology is then determined from the inter-cellular relation ships while only the essential intra cellular details are retained as parameters.
 Applying this method in printed circuit wiring programs results in dramatic savings in storage requirements and running times over conventional programs which consider each coordinate in their model. Storage requirements are reduced since only the inter-cellular wire routes are stored, Running time is shorter because one can determine when a wire is unroutable without computing the fine details of the routing. However, once the wiring is determined on the gross level, a significant problem remains—the overall routings must be transformed into specific coordinates with in each cell.
 The purpose of this paper is not to describe these programs, since they follow easily from the modeling technique, but rather to describe the ideas and concepts behind them.
