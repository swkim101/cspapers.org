This paper compares two approaches to meeting the data handling requirements of Intermedia, a hypermedia system developed at the Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship at Brown University. Intermedia, though written using an object-oriented programming language, relies on a traditional relational database management system for data storage and retrieval. We examine the ramifications of replacing the relational database with an object-oriented database. We begin by describing the important characteristics each database system. We then describe Intermedia and give an overview of its architecture and its data handling requirements. We explain why and how we used a relational database management system and the problems that we encountered with this system. We then present the design of an object-oriented database schema for Intermedia and compare the relational and object-oriented database management system approaches.
