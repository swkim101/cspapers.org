 
 Modern technical devices are often too complex for many users to be able to use them to their full extent. Based on planning technology, we are able to provide advanced user assistance for operating technical devices. We present a system that assists a human user in setting up a complex home theater consisting of several HiFi devices. For a human user, the task is rather challenging due to a large number of different ports of the devices and the variety of available cables. The system supports the user by giving detailed instructions how to assemble the theater. Its performance is based on advanced user-centered planning capabilities including the generation, repair, and explanation of plans.
