Autonomous valve turning is an extremely challenging task for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). To resolve this challenge, this paper proposes a set of different computational techniques integrated in a three-layer hierarchical scheme. Each layer realizes specific subtasks to improve the persistent autonomy of the system. In the first layer, the robot acquires the motor skills of approaching and grasping the valve by kinesthetic teaching. A Reactive Fuzzy Decision Maker (RFDM) is devised in the second layer which reacts to the relative movement between the valve and the AUV, and alters the robot's movement accordingly. Apprenticeship learning method, implemented in the third layer, performs tuning of the RFDM based on expert knowledge. Although the long-term goal is to perform the valve turning task on a real AUV, as a first step the proposed approach is tested in a laboratory environment.
