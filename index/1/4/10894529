Their underlying data representation follows specific manufacturer specifications that have possibly incomplete descriptions (in ontology) alignments. This paper addresses the problem of determining accurate and complete matching of ontologies given some common descriptions and their pre-determined high level alignments. In this context the problem of ontology matching consists of automatically determining all matching given the latter alignments, and manually verifying the matching results. Especially for applications where it is crucial that ontologies are matched correctly the latter can turn into a very time-consuming task for the user. This paper tackles this challenge and addresses the problem of computing the minimum number of user inputs needed to verify all matchings. We show how to represent this problem as a reasoning problem over a bipartite graph and how to encode it over pseudo Boolean constraints. Experiments show that our approach can be successfully applied to real-world data sets.
