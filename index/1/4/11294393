This poster presents a tool for providing novice students with a context in which to develop the ability to identify problems and patterns for their solutions by using video scenarios. A video scenario is a short film (typically 2-7 minutes) which has an extemporaneous feel. Each video depicts individuals facing a particular problem that can be helped through a computing solution. A selection of video scenarios is presented which is specifically designed to cultivate the problem identification and solution formulation skills of novice programmers by focusing on problems which can be solved using basic computing constructs. The videos can be used in a wide variety of settings and are suitable for use at the middle school, high school and college levels.
