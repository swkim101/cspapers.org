The aim of web pages visualization is to present in a very informative and interactive way a set of web documents to the user in order to let him or her navigate through these documents. In the web context, this may correspond to several user's tasks: displaying the results of a search engine, or visualizing a graph of pages such as a hypertext or a surf map. In addition to web pages visualization, web pages clustering also greatly improves the amount of information presented to the user by highlighting the similarities between the documents [6]. In this paper we explore the use of a cellular automata (CA) to generate such maps of web pages.
