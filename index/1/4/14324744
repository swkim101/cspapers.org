This paper presents the design and implementation of special hardware for effective use of the method of superimposed codes. It is shown that the method of superimposed codes is particularly well suited to easy design and implementation of fast and modular hardware. The implementation has shown that a performance gain of two orders of magnitude over conventional software implementations is obtained by using the special hardware. This makes the method of superimposed codes extremely attractive for data base system requiring partial match retrieval. We also demonstrate that the associative memory design is easily adaptable to large scale integration which would make such an approach very cost effective and lead to even further gains in performance.
