Full autonomy remains a challenge for miniature robotic platforms due to mass and size requirements of on-board power and control electronics. This paper presents a solution to these challenges with a 2.3g autonomous legged robot. An off-the-shelf optical mouse sensor is adapted for use on the Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot (HAMR) by reducing the sensor weight by 36% and achieving a position error below 11% when suspended 3mm above a cardstock surface. The position data is combined with data from a gyroscope for feedback control of both position and orientation. A microcontroller processes the sensor data and commands a controlled gait to HAMR that is powered by a battery, a boost converter and high voltage drive electronics. Solar cells are used as an alternative source providing enough power for autonomous operation of the robot. The resulting deviation for a controlled straight-line walk using both sensors to minimize lateral deviation and angular error is only 4.6%, compared to an error of 31% in an uncontrolled, straight-line walk.
