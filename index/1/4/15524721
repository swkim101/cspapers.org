Efficient content distribution in large networks comprising datacenters, end hosts, and distributed in-network caches is a difficult problem. Existing systems rely on mechanisms and metrics that fail to effectively utilize all available sources of bandwidth in the network. This paper presents a novel metric, called the Content Propagation Metric (CPM), for quantitatively evaluating the marginal benefit of available bandwidth to competing consumers, enabling efficient utilization of the bandwidth resource. The metric is simple to implement, imposes only a modest overhead, and can be retrofitted easily into existing content distribution systems. We have designed and implemented a high-performance content distribution system, called V-Formation, based on the CPM. The CPM guides V-Formation toward a global allocation of bandwidth that maximizes the aggregate download bandwidth of consumers. Results from a PlanetLab deployment and extensive simulations show that V-Formation achieves high aggregate bandwidth and that the CPM enables hosts to converge quickly on a stable allocation of resources in a wide range of deployment scenarios.
