We study the problem of sampling from a large genetic mapping population in which all individuals have identical pedigrees. We show that samples obtained from large populations , selected on the basis of limited genetic data, are better suited for use in high-density mapping experiments than random samples of the same size. We model the problem of choosing a mapping sample as a discrete stochastic optimization problem, related to existing clustering problems, and study various heuristics for the problem, including some randomized rounding algorithms. Experiments on both simulated data and ten data sets from biological populations show that these heuristics perform very well in practice despite the problem being NP-hard to approximate to within any constant. Our proposals offer the possibility of higher resolution, less expensive genetic maps. 1 Introduction A genetic map is a statement about the linear ordering and relative positions of genetic loci in the genome of a particular organism. In the last two decades, extensive genetic maps have been developed for a wide variety of organisms. Such maps have many important applications in human and veterinary medicine, plant and animal breeding, and in various aspects of basic biological research [18]. Constructing a very high-density whole-genome map may require determining the location of tens of thousands of markers, cost millions of dollars, and take
