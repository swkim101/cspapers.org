A model of motion detection is presented. The model contains three stages. The first stage is unoriented and is selective for contrast polarities. The next two stages work in parallel. A phase insensitive stage pools across different contrast polarities through a spatiotemporal filter and thus can detect first and second order motion. A phase sensitive stage keeps contrast polarities separate, each of which is filtered through a spatiotemporal filter, and thus only first order motion can be detected. Differential phase sensitivity can therefore account for the detection of first and second order motion. Phase insensitive detectors correspond to cortical complex cells, and phase sensitive detectors to simple cells.
