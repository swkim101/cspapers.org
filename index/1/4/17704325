The robot technology (RT), along with rapid growth of information technology (IT), are being developed as the next generation of future technology. Current robots require advanced technology, such as soft computing, human-friendly interface, interaction technique, speech recognition, object recognition etc. unlike the industrial robots of the past. Most recently, cellular phone (CP) has been one of the most important technologies in the IT field, and it is situated in a position of great importance industrially and economically. To produce the best CP in the world, a new technological concept and its advanced implementation technique is required, due to the extreme level of competition in the world market. Therefore, this paper develops new technological concepts such as the robotic cellular phone (RCP) in which a synergy effect can be generated by merging RT and IT. RCP, CP having personal robot services, will be an intermediate hi-tech personal machine between one CP a person and one robot a person generations. RCP infra consists of RCP/sup Mobility/, RCP/sup Interaction/, RCP/sup Integration/ technologies. For RCP/sup Mobility/, human-friendly motion automation and personal service with walking and arming ability are developed. RCP/sup Interaction/ ability is achieved by modeling an emotion-generating engine and RCP/sup Integration/ that in miniature integrates the robotic modules into CP is developed with application service programs. By joining intelligent algorithms and CP communication network with the three base modules, a RCP system is constructed. This paper presents the definition, the basic theory and experiment results of the RCP sub-technologies. We confirm a good performance of the RCP through the results.
