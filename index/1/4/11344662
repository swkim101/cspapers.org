A common limitation of many information retrieval (IR) models is that relevance scores are solely based on exact (i.e., syntactic) matching of words in queries and documents under the simple Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation. This not only leads to the well-known vocabulary mismatch problem, but also does not allow semantically related words to contribute to the relevance score. Recent advances in word embedding have shown that semantic representations for words can be efficiently learned by distributional models. A natural generalization is then to represent both queries and documents as Bag-of-Word-Embeddings (BoWE), which provides a better foundation for semantic matching than BoW. Based on this representation, we introduce a novel retrieval model by viewing the matching between queries and documents as a non-linear word transportation (NWT) problem. With this formulation, we define the capacity and profit of a transportation model designed for the IR task. We show that this transportation problem can be efficiently solved via pruning and indexing strategies. Experimental results on several representative benchmark datasets show that our model can outperform many state-of-the-art retrieval models as well as recently introduced word embedding-based models. We also conducted extensive experiments to analyze the effect of different settings on our semantic matching model.
