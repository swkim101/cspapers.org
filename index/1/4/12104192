While website domain typosquatting is highly annoying for legitimate domain operators, research has found that it relatively rarely presents a great risk to individual users. However, any application (e.g., email, ftp,...) relying on the domain name system for name resolution is equally vulnerable to domain typosquatting, and consequences may be more dire than with website typosquatting. This paper presents the first in-depth measurement study of email typosquatting. Working in concert with our IRB, we registered 76 typosquatting domain names to study a wide variety of user mistakes, while minimizing the amount of personal information exposed to us. In the span of over seven months, we received millions of emails at our registered domains. While most of these emails are spam, we infer, from our measurements, that every year, three of our domains should receive approximately 3,585 "legitimate" emails meant for somebody else. Worse, we find, by examining a small sample of all emails, that these emails may contain sensitive information (e.g., visa documents or medical records). We then project from our measurements that 1,211 typosquatting domains registered by unknown entities receive in the vicinity of 800,000 emails a year. Furthermore, we find that millions of registered typosquatting domains have MX records pointing to only a handful of mail servers. However, a second experiment in which we send "honey emails" to typosquatting domains only shows very limited evidence of attempts at credential theft (despite some emails being read), meaning that the threat, for now, appears to remain theoretical.
