This paper contains a description of the use of a digital computer technique which is designed to solve any of the following problems:
 a) Ascertain a point estimate of the reliability of a system given only the logic flow diagrams describing the component configuration within the system and point estimates or failure rates on the components.
 b) Ascertain an interval estimate of the reliability of a system given only the logic flow diagrams describing the component configuration within the system and the test data on the components in varying amounts and types.
 c) Determine the minimum confidence level to which all apportioned component reliabilities need be demonstrated in order to meet a system reliability and confidence specification.
 The technique is general in that it is designed to handle configurations containing parallel, standby, series, or logical networks or any combination thereof. It is unique in that no equations need be written to construct the mathematical model describing the component configuration within the system. All that is necessary to run the program is to write a relatively simple pseudo-program, how the components are connected, as input along with either test data, point estimate, or failure rate specifications, or any combinations thereof on the components (where appropriate).
