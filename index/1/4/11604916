The execution of long-horizon tasks under uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in robotics. Recent approaches have made headway on these tasks with an integration of task and motion planning. In this paper, we present Interfaced Belief Space Planning (IBSP): a modular approach to task and motion planning in belief space. We use a task-independent interface layer to combine an off-the-shelf classical planner with motion planning and inference. We determinize the problem under the maximum likelihood observation assumption to obtain a deterministic representation where successful plans generate goal-directed observations. We leverage properties of maximum likelihood observation determinizations to obtain a simple representation of (optimistic) belief space dynamics that is well-suited to planning. Our interface is implemented with standard belief state queries, requiring only the ability to sample, compute unnormalized likelihoods, and compute maximum likelihood states. Our contribution is a novel algorithm for task and motion planning in belief space that has minimal dependence on the details of the inference engine used. IBSP can work with a broad class of black box state estimators, with zero changes to the algorithm. We validate our approach in simulated tasks for the PR2 that account for continuous state, different types of initial state distributions, and negative observations.
