Tokenization is a fundamental preprocessing step in Information Retrieval systems in which text is turned into index terms. This paper quantifies and compares the influence of various simple tokenization techniques on document retrieval effectiveness in two domains: biomedicine and news. As expected, biomedical retrieval is more sensitive to small changes in the tokenization method. The tokenization strategy can make the difference between a mediocre and well performing IR system, especially in the biomedical domain.
