We study a novel architecture for syntactic SMT. In contrast to the dominant approach in the literature, the system does not rely on translation rules, but treat translation as an unconstrained target sentence generation task, using soft features to capture lexical and syntactic correspondences between the source and target languages. Target syntax features and bilingual translation features are trained consistently in a discriminative model. Experiments using the IWSLT 2010 dataset show that the system achieves BLEU comparable to the state-of-the-art syntactic SMT systems.
