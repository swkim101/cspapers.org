In this paper we present an approach to representing and managing temporally-flexible behaviors in the Situation Calculus based on a model of time and concurrent situations. We define a new hybrid framework combining temporal constraint reasoning and reasoning about actions. We show that the Constraint Based Interval Planning approach can be imported into the Situation Calculus by defining a temporal and concurrent extension of the basic action theory. Finally, we provide a version of the Golog interpreter suitable for managing flexible plans on multiple timelines.
