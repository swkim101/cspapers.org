This paper studies the problem of leveraging computationally intensive classification algorithms for large scale text categorization problems. We propose a hierarchical approach which decomposes the classification problem into a coarse level task and a fine level task. A simple yet scalable classifier is applied to perform the coarse level classification while a more sophisticated model is used to separate classes at the fine level. However, instead of relying on a human-defined hierarchy to decompose the problem, we we use a graph algorithm to discover automatically groups of highly similar classes. As an illustrative example, we apply our approach to real-world industrial data from eBay, a major e-commerce site where the goal is to classify live items into a large taxonomy of categories. In such industrial setting, classification is very challenging due to the number of classes, the amount of training data, the size of the feature space and the real-world requirements on the response time. We demonstrate through extensive experimental evaluation that (1) the proposed hierarchical approach is superior to flat models, and (2) the data-driven extraction of latent groups works significantly better than the existing human-defined hierarchy.
