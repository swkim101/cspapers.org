Control of robot locomotion profits from the use of pre-planned trajectories. This paper presents a way to generalize globally optimal and dynamically consistent trajectories for cyclic bipedal walking. A small task-space consisting of stride-length and step time is mapped to spline parameters which fully define the optimal joint space motion. The paper presents the impact of different machine learning algorithms for velocity and torque optimal trajectories with respect to optimality and feasibility. To demonstrate the usefulness of the trajectories, a control approach is presented that allows general walking including transitions between points in the task-space.
