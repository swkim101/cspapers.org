Combustion process is at the root of most energy production systems. The understanding of combustion is fundamental to exploit efficiently the available natural resources and to reduce pollutant emissions. The giant leaps performed in computer science over the past two decades render possible the use of computer simulation to better understand combustion in real industrial configurations. This presentation discusses and illustrates the application of high performance computing for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Specific attention is addressed to the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach for industrial energy production configurations: ranging from aeronautical gas turbine engines including helicopters and commercial airliners, piston engines and stationary gas turbine engines used in large scale electricity production systems.
