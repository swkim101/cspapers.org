Recent advances in pedestrian detection are attained by transferring the learned features of Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) to pedestrians. This ConvNet is typically pre-trained with massive general object categories (e.g. ImageNet). Although these features are able to handle variations such as poses, viewpoints, and lightings, they may fail when pedestrian images with complex occlusions are present. Occlusion handling is one of the most important problem in pedestrian detection. Unlike previous deep models that directly learned a single detector for pedestrian detection, we propose DeepParts, which consists of extensive part detectors. DeepParts has several appealing properties. First, DeepParts can be trained on weakly labeled data, i.e. only pedestrian bounding boxes without part annotations are provided. Second, DeepParts is able to handle low IoU positive proposals that shift away from ground truth. Third, each part detector in DeepParts is a strong detector that can detect pedestrian by observing only a part of a proposal. Extensive experiments in Caltech dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepParts, which yields a new state-of-the-art miss rate of 11:89%, outperforming the second best method by 10%.
