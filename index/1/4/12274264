This paper describes an interactive software development tool(ISDT),which supports the detailed system design and the manufacture phase in the business application system development. The ISDT is based on Standardized Technology and Engineering for Programming Support (STEPS), experience gained is complied, and new program development support techniques are adopted. The ISDT user will be able to design programs interactively while sitting at a display terminal. ISDT manages specifications stored in a database and automatically generates COBOL programs and documents as required.
 This paper discusses business application program characteristics at first. Then it is shown how the development support system should be handled. Next, ISDT functions are explained with plenty of figures.
