The resulting optimized query performs 1o-1.5% better thant heoriginal whcncvaluated on t,het,est set. \Ve discuss the constant, tension het,ween describing what a relevant, document should contain, a,n(l ciescribing what the known relevant cfocnrnents do contain. 1 Irltrmdllction In the tvi>ical information retrieval environrnent, irrclrrd-ing both ad-hoc interactive retrieval and document, filtering based on long-term information needs, an original query is submitted to a system which then returns documents for inspection. (Isers then look at those retrieved documents and submit a new query based upon their original need and the returned documents. Relevance feedback is the process of automatically altering an existing query using information supplied by users abont tllerclcvance ofj)reviously retrieved documents. Relevance feedback has been an importalit research topic forwell over 15years[Ide71, Roc71, I{J76, S1390]. Irrcreaserf attention has been paid to relevance feedback in the past sever <al j-e,ars due to both t,fle in<le <ased acceptance of ~t,a-tistictrl inforrnatiou retrieval systems whith can easily use relevance feedback, and the effects of the TRf?(" ! confert=nces [Har9:l, Har94, Har95].
