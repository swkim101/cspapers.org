In this paper, we propose a grouping scheme that classifies applications into groups for individual users by utilizing their geometrical information on a tabletop system. The proposed scheme investigates the geometrical information of each application, such as its position on the display and its rotational information, and then groups the applications of each individual user by utilizing a classifier with the geometrical information. We evaluate the proposed scheme with lab experiments, and the results show that, on average, 95.6% of applications are well classified into their users.
