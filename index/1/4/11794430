A database management system architecture is described that facilitates the implementation of data management extensions for relational database systems. The architecture defines two classes of data management extensions alternative ways of storing relations called relation “storage methods”, and access paths, integrity constraints, or triggers which are “attachments” to relations. Generic sets of operations are defined for storage methods and attachments, and these operations must be provided in order to add a new storage method or attachment type to the system. The data management extension architecture also provides common services for coordination of storage method and attachment execution. This article describes the data management extension architecture along with some implementation issues and techniques.
