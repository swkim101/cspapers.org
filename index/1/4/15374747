Actuators with adjustable transmission ratios are required in a variety of robotics and automation applications, spanning from human assistive devices and mobile robots to general manipulators. Most existing self-adjustable actuators are bulky and mechanically complex, which often makes their implementation challenging. In this work, we propose a novel passively-adjustable transmission mechanism based on a twisted string actuator. Twisted string actuator is a light, cheap, and mechanically simple actuator, in which twisted strings contract as a result of twisting and therefore act as a translational gear. If one introduces a physical offset between the twisted strings, this changes a ratio between the speed and output force provided by actuator. This work introduces a kinematical model of such actuator for the configuration when a physical offset between the strings is present. In order to experimentally verify the proposed mathematical model, we designed and manufactured a twisted string actuator with variable offsets between the strings. Additionally, in this paper we also propose an idea for passively adjustable gear, controlled by twisted string actuator according to the proposed kinematical model. The main advantages of the proposed passively adjustable gear are its light weight, compliancy and mechanical simplicity, which make it attractive for implementaion in various areas of haptics, teleoperation, wearable and lightweight robotics.
