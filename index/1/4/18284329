Performance measurement and analysis of the behavior of a computer network usually requires the application of multiple software and hardware tools. The location, functionality, data requirements, and other properties of the tools often reflect the distribution of equipment in the network. We describe how we have attempted to organize a collection of tools into a single system that spans a broad subset of the measurement and analysis activities that occur in a complex network of heterogenous computers. The tools are implemented on a pair of dedicated midicomputers. A database management system is used to couple the data collection and analysis tools into a system highly insulated from evolutionary changes in the composition and topology of the network.
