Result diversification is a topic of great value for enhancing user experience in many fields, such as web search and recommender systems. Many existing methods generate a diversified result in a sequential manner, but they work well only if the preceding choices are optimal or close to the optimal solution. Moreover, a manually tuned parameter (say,λ) is often required to trade off relevance and diversity. This makes it difficult to know whether the failures are caused by the optimization criterion or the setting of λ. In context of web search, we formulate the result diversification task as a 0-1 multiple subtopic knapsack problem (MSKP), where a subset of documents are optimally chosen like filling up multiple subtopic knapsacks. This formulation yields no trade-off parameters to be specified beforehand. Solving the 0-1 MSKP is NP-hard, we treat the optimization of 0-1 MSKP using a graphical model over latent binary variables as a maximum posterior inference problem, and tackle it with the max-sum belief propagation algorithm. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed 0-1 MSKP model, we conduct a series of experiments on two TREC diversity collections. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods significantly, not only in terms of standard diversity metrics (α-nDCG, nERRIA and subtopic recall), but also in terms of efficiency.
