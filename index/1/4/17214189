Advances made in sequencing technology have resulted in the sequencing of thousands of genomes. Novel analysis tools are needed to process these data and extract useful information. Such tools could aid in personalized medicine. As an example, we could identify the causes for a disease by comparing the genomes of people who have the disease and those who do not have this disease. Given that human variability happens due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we could focus our attention on these SNPs. Investigations that try to understand human variability using SNPs fall under genome-wide association study (GWAS). A crucial step in GWAS is the identification of the correlation between genotypes (SNPs) and phenotypes (i.e., characteristics such as the presence of a disease). This step can be modeled as the k-locus problem (where k is any integer). A number of algorithms have been proposed in the literature for this problem when k = 2. In this paper we present an algorithm for solving the 2-locus problem that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the previous best known algorithms.
