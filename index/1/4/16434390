This paper deals with visual servoing from three points. Using the geometric properties of the spherical projection of points, a new decoupled set of six visual features is proposed. The main originality lies in the use of the distances between spherical projection of points to define three features that are invariant to camera rotations. The three other features present a linear link with respect to camera rotations. In comparison with the classical perspective coordinates of points, the new decoupled set does not present more singularities. In addition, using the new set in its non-singular domain, a classical control law is proven to be ideal for rotational motions. These theoretical results as well as the robustness to errors of the new decoupled control scheme are illustrated through simulation results.
