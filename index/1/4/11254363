In this demonstration, we will show how smartphones can be used as a platform for monitoring environmental change, particularly with respect to birdlife. We have researched and implemented a platform using Microsoft smartphones for remotely monitoring birds. The platform comprises smart-phones running a custom application for recording bird song. The application manages sensors in an autonomic fashion to ensure that they operate reliably for long periods of time in a power efficient manner.
