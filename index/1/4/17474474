M3 is intended for research into unconventional special purpose stored program elements of computer systems (for example, a distributed computer Bus Interface Unit). The principal requirements for such a machine are flexibility and modularity. M3 consists of an application independent Kernel Machine to which application-dependent Functional Modules are attached. The Kernel Machine is vertically microprogrammed; it includes highly capable microinstruction sequencing logic which facilitates structured microprogramming. The Functional Modules contain the operand registers and the operators (e.g., adders, shifters, etc.) needed by the specific application. The operators may be invoked not only by the Kernel Machine but also by one another; control may be passed among operators in a sequential or hierarchical fashion; operators may execute concurrently with each other and with the Kernel Machine; operators may be re-entrant or recursive; operators may activate themselves, or cause microcode interrupt routines to be executed in the Kernel Machine.
