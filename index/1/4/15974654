Games development brings fun into the software engineering curriculum, but it is a practical activity that educators cannot teach in traditional lecture-based environments. Including pedagogical aspects of problem-based, cooperative, blended and experiential learning is necessary to achieve a high learning experience. In this paper we describe and evaluate a block course in which we ask students with almost no mobile application development experience to create games in just two weeks. We offer the course in two different modes, for beginners who learn games development, and for tutors who help us in the organization of the course and in the teaching activities. Apart from games development and game design, students learn modeling, design patterns and software configuration management. They practice soft skills in team work, present their games to their classmates using Pecha Kucha and publish their games into the App Store. Our evaluations show that students appreciate the great learning experience.
