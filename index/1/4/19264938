In this paper, we analyze the performance of two-way amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying with best relay selection scheme in the presence of hardware impairment at the relays. We first obtain the tractable closed-form expression of the statistical characteristics for the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To reveal significant insights into the system performance, we also computed the asymptotic symbol error probability (SEP), which is shown extremely tight in the high SNR regime and low hardware impairments level. Our analysis enables us to evaluate the impact of non-ideal hardware on the performance of two-way relaying networks and to highlight as a benchmark for system designers.
