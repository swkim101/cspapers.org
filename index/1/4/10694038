Over the past decade, white space networking has garnered significant effort and attention from media, industry, regulators, and academics world-wide. Together, these entities have helped push white space in to a unique position of potentially changing how we access the spectrum (more efficiently) forever. Now, building white space networks with full-featured and fully certified equipment is critical in moving forward and retaining the spectrum and position that we have put ourselves in. In our demonstration, we will exhibit a fully embedded and FCC-certified white space networking platform that is available and capable of building out TV white space networks. Additionally, we provide an interactive display with data taken from our commercial deployments that further show its capabilities of supporting various applications. Using the many available channels at the conference location, we will demonstrate some of these capabilities (e.g., ability to penetrate in-door environments), as well as future capabilities (e.g., novel functionality built on the platform). With an open-API (across all layers), the platform is conducive to studying current capabilities and novel research.
