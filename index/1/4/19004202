We present CoSimRank, a graph-theoretic similarity measure that is efficient because it can compute a single node similarity without having to compute the similarities of the entire graph. We present equivalent formalizations that show CoSimRankâ€™s close relationship to Personalized PageRank and SimRank and also show how we can take advantage of fast matrix multiplication algorithms to compute CoSimRank. Another advantage of CoSimRank is that it can be flexibly extended from basic node-node similarity to several other graph-theoretic similarity measures. In an experimental evaluation on the tasks of synonym extraction and bilingual lexicon extraction, CoSimRank is faster or more accurate than previous approaches.
