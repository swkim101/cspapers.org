Generalizes ALAP (as late as possible) bounds for the exact scheduling problem on a pre-defined data path. Conventional bounds are inapplicable because of the possible requirement of re-computing operands for minimal schedule length. Efficient techniques are presented for constructing the new bounds which are sensitive to point-to-point delays via transitive memory units. An efficient operand mapping bound is also described. Based on these two bounds, time improvement factors of 50 have demonstrated in exact scheduling results.
