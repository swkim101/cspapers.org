The recently introduced k-support norm has been successfully applied to sparse prediction problems with correlated features. This norm however lacks any explicit structural constraints commonly found in machine learning and image processing. We address this problem by incorporating a total variation penalty in the k-support framework. We introduce the (k, s) support total variation norm as the tightest convex relaxation of the intersection of a set of discrete sparsity and total variation penalties. We show that this norm leads to an intractable combinatorial graph optimization problem, which we prove to be NP-hard. We then introduce a tractable relaxation with approximation guarantees. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this penalty on classification in the low-sample regime, M/EEG neuroimaging analysis, and background subtracted image recovery.
