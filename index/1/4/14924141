LinkedIn search is deeply personalized - for the same queries, different searchers expect completely different results. This paper presents our approach to achieving this by mining various data sources available in LinkedIn to infer searchers' intents (such as hiring, job seeking, etc.), as well as extending the concept of homophily to capture the searcher-result similarities on many aspects. Then, learning-to-rank is applied to combine these signals with standard search features.
