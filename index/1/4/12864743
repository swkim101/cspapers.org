We present an efficient algorithm for the following problem: Given a collection <i>T</i> = {Δ<inf>1</inf>.....,Δ<inf><i>n</i></inf>} of <i>n</i> triangles in the plane, such that there exists a subset <i>S ⊂ T</i> (unknown to us), of ∪<inf>Δ ∈ S</inf> Δ = ∪<inf>Δ<inf>Δ∈T</inf></inf>Δ <i>n</i> triangles, such that ζ « construct efficiently the union of the triangles in <i>T.</i> We show that this problem can be solved in subquadratic time. In our solution, we use the approximate Disjoint-Cover (DC) algorithm, presented as a heuristics in [9]. We present a detailed implementation of this method, which combines a variety of techniques related to range-searching in two dimensions. We provide a rigorous analysis of its performance in the above setting, showing that it does indeed run in subquadratic time (for a reasonable range of ζ).
