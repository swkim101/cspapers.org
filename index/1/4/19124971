A large portion of existing social recommendation models are based on the tractable assumption that users consider the same factors to make decisions in both recommender systems and social networks. However, this assumption is not in concert with real-world situations, since users usually show different preferences in different scenarios. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit the differences between user preference in recommender systems and that in social networks, with the aim to further improve the social recommendation. In particular, we assume that the user preferences in different scenarios are results of different linear combinations from a more underlying user preference space. Based on this assumption, we propose a novel social recommendation framework, called social recommendation with an essential preferences space (SREPS), which simultaneously models the structural information in the social network, the rating and the consumption information in the recommender system under the capture of essential preference space. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SREPS model compared with seven state-of-the-art social recommendation methods.
