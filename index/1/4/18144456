Suppose <i>m</i> balls are sequentially thrown into <i>n</i> bins where each ball goes into a random bin. It is well-known that the gap between the load of the most loaded bin and the average is Θ (√mlog <i>n</i>/<i>n</i>), for large <i>m</i>. If each ball goes to the lesser loaded of two random bins, this gap dramatically reduces to Θ (log log <i>n</i>) independent of <i>m</i>. Consider now the following "(1 + β)-choice" process for some parameter β ∈ (0, 1): each ball goes to a random bin with probability (1 - β) and the lesser loaded of two random bins with probability β. <i>How does the gap for such a process behave?</i> Suppose that the weight of each ball was drawn from a geometric distribution. <i>How is the gap (now defined in terms of weight) affected?</i>
 In this work, we develop general techniques for analyzing such balls-into-bins processes. Specifically, we show that for the (1 + β)-choice process above, the gap is Θ(log <i>n</i>/β), irrespective of <i>m</i>. Moreover the gap stays at Θ(log <i>n</i>/β) in the weighted case for a large class of weight distributions. No non-trivial explicit bounds were previously known in the weighted case, even for the 2-choice paradigm.
