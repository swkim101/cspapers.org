Recently, neural networks have achieved great success on sentiment classification due to their ability to alleviate feature engineering. However, one of the remaining challenges is to model long texts in document-level sentiment classification under a recurrent architecture because of the deficiency of the memory unit. To address this problem, we present a Cached Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (CLSTM) to capture the overall semantic information in long texts. CLSTM introduces a cache mechanism, which divides memory into several groups with different forgetting rates and thus enables the network to keep sentiment information better within a recurrent unit. The proposed CLSTM outperforms the state-of-the-art models on three publicly available document-level sentiment analysis datasets.
