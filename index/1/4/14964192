Standard LSI Design Automation systems are database management systems that aid the circuit designer by organizing the collection of submodules that comprise a chip. This type of file system usually does not aid in the actual computation of silicon layout, and can hinder a designer with program constraints that have little or nothing to do with silicon constraints. The Bristle Block system is an attempt to create a silicon compiler that will perform the majority of the implementation computation while placing a minimum set of constraints on the designer. The goal of the Bristle Block system is to produce an entire LSI mask set from a single page, high level description of the integrated circuit.
