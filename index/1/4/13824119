Split manufacturing of integrated circuits eliminates vulnerabilities introduced by an untrusted foundry by manufacturing only a part of design at an untrusted high-end foundry and the remaining part at a trusted low-end foundry. Most researchers have focused on attack and defenses for hierarchical designs and/or use a relatively high-end trusted foundry, leading to high cost. We propose an attack and defense for split manufacturing for industry-standard/relevant flattened designs. Our attack uses network-flow model and outperforms previous attacks. We also develop a defense technique using placement perturbation, while considering overhead. The effectiveness of our techniques is demonstrated on benchmark circuits.
