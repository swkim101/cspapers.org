We introduce a novel compositional language model that works on PredicateArgument Structures (PASs). Our model jointly learns word representations and their composition functions using bagof-words and dependency-based contexts. Unlike previous word-sequencebased models, our PAS-based model composes arguments into predicates by using the category information from the PAS. This enables our model to capture longrange dependencies between words and to better handle constructs such as verbobject and subject-verb-object relations. We verify this experimentally using two phrase similarity datasets and achieve results comparable to or higher than the previous best results. Our system achieves these results without the need for pretrained word vectors and using a much smaller training corpus; despite this, for the subject-verb-object dataset our model improves upon the state of the art by as much as âˆ¼10% in relative performance.
