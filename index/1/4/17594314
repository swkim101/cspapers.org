This paper presents a new portable exoskeleton design for superior limbs by the CEA-LIST laboratories. The first model described here (4 axis) is designed to apply forces in 3 directions The first application is foreseen as an assistance device to enable a disabled person to carry an object such as a teapot or water bottle. It is designed as a base for more complete systems. A partial realization of it is presented for the first time. The high potential of the actuators used both in terms of back drivability and force capacity, allows hybrid force-position control laws making it possible to cover a broad range of applications: rehabilitation, assistance, force feedback master arm for telerobotics, sport training, and a virtual reality workbench.
