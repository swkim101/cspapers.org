This paper presents instance-based state identification, an approach to reinforcement learning and hidden state that builds disambiguating amounts of short-term memory on-line, and also learns with an order of magnitude fewer training steps than several previous approaches. Inspired by a key similarity between learning with hidden state and learning in continuous geometrical spaces, this approach uses instance-based (or "memory-based") learning, a method that has worked well in continuous spaces.
