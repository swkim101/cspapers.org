Several routing problems such as VLSI river routing and single-layer routing can be formulated as a problem of finding a Steiner forest in a planar (grid) graph. Given an unweighted planar graph G together with nets of terminals, our problem is to find a Steiner forest, i.e., vertex-disjoint trees, each of which interconnects all the terminals of a net. This paper gives an efficient algorithm to solve the problem for the case all terminals lie on two face boundaries of G. Also obtained is an algorithm for finding a maximum number of internally vertexdisjoint paths connecting two specified vertices in a planar graph G. Both run in 0( nlog n) time if G has n vertices.
