We are developing robots for inspection of the under floor of houses. The developed robot system is reported in this paper. The mobile robot platform is based on a crawer type robot developed for rescue purposes. As sensors, a pan-tilt-zoom camera, top-view camera and SOKUIKI sensor are used. We constructed a test field and verified the performance of the robot.
