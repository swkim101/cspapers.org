The authors present a control system for a pair of powered prostheses that leverages communication between the devices in order to enhance awareness and improve stability for the user. The control system is implemented on a pair of powered knee and ankle prostheses previously developed by the authors and tested on a healthy subject using able body adapters. The healthy subject also walked on a pair of passive prostheses, with both cases being monitored through motion capture. The kinematic data from the powered system closely match those seen in healthy subjects and show a marked improvement over the passive devices.
