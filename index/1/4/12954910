This paper contributes to mobile crowdsourcing applications by developing a privacy preserving framework that enables users to contribute content to the community while controlling their privacy exposure. One fundamental challenge in such applications is how to preserve user privacy, as participants may end up revealing a great deal of user-identified, geo-located data, which can easily unfold user trajectories or sensitive locations (e.g., user's home or work location). In this paper we develop PROMPT, a highly efficient privacy preserving framework that runs locally on mobile devices. PROMPT relies on a novel geometric approximation approach to preserve user privacy, by evaluating the privacy exposure of users before sharing their geo-located data. Our detailed experimental evaluation using real-world datasets illustrates that our approach is effective, practical and has low overhead on smartphones.
