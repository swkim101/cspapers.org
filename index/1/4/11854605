This work demonstrates fast motion planning for robot locomotion that is optimized for terrain with complex dynamics, specifically, rapid penetration of granular media. Gait planning is critical for many legged locomotion control approaches, but they typically assume rigid ground contact. We aim to extend these planning methods to include terrain dynamics we see in the natural world, like sand and dirt, which can both deform and fluidize. Using an added-mass description of collective grain motion, we formulated a model of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic terrain effects that is both principled and representable with closed-form dynamics. As a result, we present a model and fast optimization formulation which solves accurate motion plans on granular media with tractable solving times (6.4-3.8 seconds). For validation, we optimized open-loop motor trajectories for a testbed jumping robot to jump to a target apex height from a bed a loosely packed poppy seeds, a model granular medium. While jumps optimized for rigid ground were anemic on granular media, terrain-aware trajectories hit within 6% of their target. This demonstrates the potential for robot locomotion which meets practical task demands, all while being aware of the terrain beneath it.
