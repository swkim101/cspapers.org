Many pattern recognition tasks, including estimation, classification, and the finding of similar objects, make use of linear models. The fundamental operation in such tasks is the computation of the dot product between a query vector and a large database of instance vectors. Often we are interested primarily in those instance vectors which have high dot products with the query. We present a random sampling based algorithm that enables us to identify, for any given query vector, those instance vectors which have large dot products, while avoiding explicit computation of all dot products. We provide experimental results that demonstrate considerable speedups for text retrieval tasks. Our approximate matrix multiplication algorithm is applicable to products of k â‰¥ 2 matrices and is of independent interest. Our theoretical and experimental analysis demonstrates that in many scenarios, our method dominates standard matrix multiplication.
