We present the utilization of the educational SOLO taxonomy for assessing algorithmic features of introductory programming. The SOLO taxonomy was recently studied by CS research educators, with respect to code reading and code writing. Most of the studies focused on code reading. In this paper we offer a framework of SOLO utilization for assessing basic algorithmic design features of code writing. Our novelty stems from focusing on: selection, flexible manipulation, and composition of basic design patterns, as well as on capitalization on unfolded task characteristics. We specify SOLO levels with respect to algorithmic design, and relate to common errors. We display our findings of applying the suggested framework in an ordered study with CS1 students.
