This paper describes a way of neural hardware implementation with the analog-digital mixed mode neural chip. The full custom neural VLSI of Universally Reconstructible Artificial Neural network (URAN) is used to implement Korean speech recognition system. A multi-layer perceptron with linear neurons is trained successfully under the limited accuracy in computations. The network with a large frame input layer is tested to recognize spoken korean words at a forward retrieval. Multichip hardware module is suggested with eight chips or more for the extended performance and capacity.
