By leveraging location data in online social networks, Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) can support diverse human activities such as tourism. Different applications aim to aid tourists and provide better experience in their travels by matching co-located users based on what they have in common. However, users with little in common but with potential to help each other given the context and place could not be matched. In this paper we introduce traMSNet, a LBSN that implements a matching algorithm considering homophily, as well as users complementary skills in a touristic location. Our idea is validated with a survey that asked potential travelers about their needs when looking for a travel partner. Moreover, we present a matching algorithm that is evaluated it with real tourists. The evaluation shows that considering complementarity when matching individuals is preferred by users. Therefore, by only considering similarities, important issues are left aside.
