We explore the applicability of machine translation evaluation (MTE) methods to a very different problem: answer ranking in community Question Answering. In particular, we adopt a pairwise neural network (NN) architecture, which incorporates MTE features, as well as rich syntactic and semantic embeddings, and which efficiently models complex non-linear interactions. The evaluation results show state-of-the-art performance, with sizeable contribution from both the MTE features and from the pairwise NN architecture.
