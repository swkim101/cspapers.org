The disclosure of this specification illustrates a GAP FILLER, designed to be easily and quickly removed from the gap between poured concrete sections, after the concrete sets. The individual plastic-foam slats, held together and attached to each other, are packaged in a watertight polyethylene bag, and are positioned against an existng concrete wall, ready to receive the second concrete pour. The zip-out filler will form the expansion joint between the two concrete pours. Removal of the filler is easily accomplished because of the inter-connected slats.
