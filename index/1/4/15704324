A neural network model of motion segmentation by visual cortex is described. The model clarifies how preprocessing of motion signals by a Motion Oriented Contrast Filter (MOC Filter) is joined to long-range cooperative motion mechanisms in a motion Cooperative Competitive Loop (CC Loop) to control phenomena such as as induced motion, motion capture, and motion aftereffects. The total model system is a motion Boundary Contour System (BCS) that is computed in parallel with a static BCS before both systems cooperate to generate a boundary representation for three dimensional visual form perception. The present investigations clarify how the static BCS can be modified for use in motion segmentation problems, notably for analyzing how ambiguous local movements (the aperture problem) on a complex moving shape are suppressed and actively reorganized into a coherent global motion signal.
