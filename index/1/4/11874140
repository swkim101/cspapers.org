As the largest online marketplace, eBay strives to promote its inventory throughout the Web via different types of online advertisement. Contextually relevant links to eBay assets on third party sites is one example of such advertisement avenues. Keyword extraction is the task at the core of any contextual advertisement system. In this paper, we explore a machine learning approach to this problem. The proposed solution uses linear and logistic regression models learnt from human labeled data, combined with document, text and eBay specific features. In addition, we propose a solution to identify the prevalent category of eBay items in order to solve the problem of keyword ambiguity.
