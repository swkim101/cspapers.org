Visual summarization is a attractive new scheme to summarize web pages, which can help achieve a more friendly user experience in search and re-finding tasks by allowing users quickly get the idea of what the web page is about and helping users recall the visited web page. In this paper, we perform a careful study on the recently proposed visual summarization approaches, including the thumbnail of the web page snapshot, the internal image in the web page which is representative of the content in the page, and the visual snippet which is a synthesized image based on the internal image, the title, and the logo found in the web page. Moreover, since the internal image based summarization approach hardly works when the representative internal images are unavailable, we propose a new strategy, which retrieves the representative image from the external to summarize the web page. The experimental results suggest that the various summarization approaches have respective advantages on different types of web pages. While internal images and thumbnails can provide a reliable summarization on web pages with dominant images and web pages with simple structure respectively, the external images are regarded as a useful information to complement the internal images and are demonstrated very useful in helping users understanding new web pages . The visual snippet performs well on the re-finding tasks since it incorporates the title and logo which are advantageous on identifying the visited web pages.
