In this paper, we first analyze the identifiability of POE based Adjoint error approach. By carefully examining the linear dependence between calibration Jacobian columns, it is proved that joint offsets and Adjoint errors cannot be identified simultaneously, and the maximum dimension of identifiable parameters is 4r + 2t + 6. Some more scenarios are considered to augment the Adjoint error approach. To satisfy the constraints on joint relations, constrained method and projection method are proposed. Moreover, we present the identifiability of reduction ratios and joint pitches. Simulations of a 6 Degree-of-Freedom robot and a SCARA robot are given to illustrate and compare our methods. It shows that the constrained method can handle such situations effectively and yields better results.
