This article describes the development of a free test collection for Chinese text categorization. A novel retrieval-based approach was developed to detect duplicates and label inconsistency in this corpus and in Reuters-21578 for comparison. The method was able to detect certain types of similar and/or duplicated documents that were overlooked by an alternative repetition-based method [1]. Experiments showed that effectiveness was not affected by the confusing documents.
