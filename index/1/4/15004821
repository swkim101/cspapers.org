This paper describes an object recognition algorithm both on a sequential machine and on a single instruction multiple data (SIMD) parallel processor such as the MIT connection machine. The problem, in the way it is presently formulated on a sequential machine, is essentially a propagation of constraints through a tree of possibilities in an attempt to prune the tree to a small number of leaves. The tree can become excessively large, however, and so implementations on massively parallel machines are sought in order to speed up the problem. Two fast parallel algorithms are described here, a static algorithm and a dynamic algorithm. The static algorithm reformulates the problem by assigning every leaf in the completely expanded unpruned tree to a separate processor in the connection machine. Then pruning is done in nearly constant time by broadcasting constraints to the entire SIMD array. This parallel version is shown to run three to four orders of magnitude faster than the sequential version. For large recognition problems which would exceed the capacity of the machine, a dynamic algorithm is described which performs a series of loading and pruning steps, dynamically allocating and deallocating processors through the use of the connection machine's global router communications mechanism.
