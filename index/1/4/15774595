Blumenthal* Department of Computer Science University of Illinois Urbana, Illinois 61801 Rapid increases in processor performance over the past decade have outstripped performance improvements in input /output devices, increasing the import ante of input /output performance to overall system performance. Further, experience has shown that the performance of parallel input /output systems is particularly sensitive to data placement and data management policies, making good choices critical. To explore this vast design space, we have developed a user-level library, the Portable Parallel File System ( PP.FS), which supports rapid experimentation and exploration. The PPFS includes a rich application interface, allowing the application to advertise access patterns, control caching and prefet thing, and even control data placement. PPFS is both extensible and portable, making possible a wide range of experiments on a broad variety of platforms and configurations. Our initial experiments, based on simple benchmarks and two application programs, show that tailoring policies to input/output access patterns yields significant performance benefits, often improving performance by nearly an order of magnitude.
