Self-adaptive software is a closed-loop system aims at altering itself in response to changes at runtime. Such a system, normally, requires monitoring, detecting (analyzing), deciding (planning), and acting (effecting) processes to fulfill adaptation requirements. This research mainly focuses on developing a quality-driven framework to facilitate realizing the deciding process. The framework is required to capture goals of adaptation, utility information, and domain characteristics in a knowledge-base.
