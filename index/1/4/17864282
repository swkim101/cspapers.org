This paper describes a first system1 for generating programmed systems for computer aided fabric design. Two aspects of the system are explored. First the design strategy which led to the construction of a mechanism to provide for a variety of design tools is explained. The hierarchical structure of the system as well as the nature of its modules are detailed. Second the facilities available in the system are presented. The designing systems produced by this higher level system incorporate features of our previous systems such as display and modification of the design on a graphic unit. In addition three new functions are available in the system. The first is a tool which allows the artist to introduce his design concepts directly into the system in a manner that is most natural to him. The second new facility provides the point paper designer with a means of tracing a design into the system on an electronic tablet and simultaneously viewing it gridded, according to a specified gauge, on the screen. The third function assists the point paper designer develop his design into repeat by reinspecting the elements of his gridded design whether it was traced or optically scanned. As a result of this reinspection, areas of the design are now identified and may be enlarged, reduced, moved or erased from the design.
