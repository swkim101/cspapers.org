The development of interactive, display oriented systems for the manipulation of online information has traditionally been an extremely difficult and prohibitively expensive effort. This paper describes an approach based on the concept of interaction oriented specification and execution of applications and state networks. The general approach is described and then illustrated with a current display application development product.
