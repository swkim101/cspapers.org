In this demo, we present the realization and evaluation of a wireless hardware prototype of the previously proposed RFID authentication protocol 'Ff'. The motivation has been to get as close as possible to the (expensive) construction of a wafer and to analyze and demonstrate Ff's real-world feasibility and functional correctness in the field. Besides showing Ff's feasibility, our objective is to show implications of embedding authentication into an industry RFID communication standard. Apart from the documentation at hand, the demonstrator comprises the Ff RFID tag and reader prototypes and a standard EPC tag and reader. The hardware is connected to a laptop controlling the hardware and simulating attacks against authentication.
