College and university professors serve as role models and leaders. Unfortunately, in computing fields, only a small fraction of the professorate is women and/or members of minority racial groups. To address this issue, the current research assessed the role of research experiences for undergraduate students (REUs) on underrepresented students' interest in pursuing a career as a computing professor. We found that REUs utilizing a set of specific practices are linked with underrepresented students' interest in becoming a computing professor. On the other hand, no specific REU practice was associated with majority students' (i.e., White and Asian men's) level of interest in becoming a professor. Thus, this research not only identifies aspects of REUs that may be especially important for increasing diversity in the professorate but also highlights that REUs may serve different purposes for underrepresented versus majority students.
