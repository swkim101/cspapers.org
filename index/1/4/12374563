Nowadays web portals contain large amount of information that is meant for various visitors or groups of visitors. To effectively navigate within the content the website needs to "know" its users in order to provide personalized content to them. We propose a method for automatic estimation of the user's interest in a web page he visits. This estimation is used for the recommendation of web portal pages (through presenting adaptive links) that the user might like. We conducted series of experiments in the domain of our faculty web portal to evaluate proposed approach.
