Exploiting document structure can solve the usability problem when browsing web pages designed for PCs with non-PC terminals. For example, by exploiting headings among document structure and showing them selectively within a display, users can easily grasp a page's overview. In this paper, as a basic part of document structure analysis, we propose a heading analysis method for web pages considering various presentation. Results of evaluation experiments confirmed that our proposed method could extract many headings that could not be extracted by using HTML element names.
