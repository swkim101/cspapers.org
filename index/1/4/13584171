The demand for flexible industrial robotic solutions that are able to accomplish tasks at different locations in a factory is growing more and more. When deploying mobile robots in a factory environment, the predictability and reproducibility of their behaviors become important and are often requested. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use motion planning scheme that can take into account user preferences for robot navigation. The preferences are extracted implicitly from the previous experiences or from demonstrations and are automatically considered in the subsequent planning steps. This leads to reproducible and thus better to predict navigation behaviors of the robot, without requiring experts to hard-coding control strategies or cost functions within a planner. Our system has been implemented and evaluated on a simulated KUKA mobile robot in different environments.
