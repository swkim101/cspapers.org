We show that 0,1<sup>d</sup> endowed with edit distance embeds into <i>l</i><inf>1</inf> with distortion 2<sup>O</sup>(âˆšlog <i>d</i>log log <i>d</i>). We further show efficient implementations of the embedding that yield solutions to various computational problems involving edit distance. These include sketching, communication complexity, nearest neighbor search. For all these problems, we improve upon previous bounds.
