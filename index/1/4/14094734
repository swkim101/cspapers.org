Great strides have been made to increase the energy efficiency of hardware, data center facilities, and network infrastructure. However, in any computer system, it is software that directs much of the activity of the hardware. Moreover, multicore processors have become ubiquitous, mainly because their multiple benefits, especially enhanced performance for multi-threaded and compute-intensive applications. Nonetheless, there are few studies addressing the topic of restructuring multicore applications to consume less energy and even fewer that leverage developer expertise to achieve that goal. In this thesis we present a brief background study for refactoring multicore applications in order to improve both performance and energy consumption. The idea consists in proposing a catalog of refactorings targeting some languages of the JVM platform.
