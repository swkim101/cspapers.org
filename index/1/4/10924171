In this work, a low-power, low-error divider design is proposed that can achieve significant power and area savings, while introducing insignificant inaccuracies to the output. The design of our divider is highly scalable, offering a wide range of power and inaccuracy trade-offs based on the application requirements. Furthermore, the proposed divider has a lower delay compared to the accurate design, enabling its use on the critical path. We theoretically analyze the error of our design as a function of its configuration, and we thoroughly evaluate the error and power characteristics of our divider in a standalone case and demonstrate that the proposed design can achieve up to 70% in power savings, while introducing an mean average absolute error of only 3.08%. We also implement three image-processing applications in hardware using our divider and conclude that use of the proposed divider will not perceptibly impact their quality-of-service while achieving power benefits of up to 75%.
