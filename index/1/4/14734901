The ability to remotely measure heart rate from videos without requiring any special setup is beneficial to many applications. In recent years, a number of papers on heart rate (HR) measurement from videos have been proposed. However, these methods typically require the human subject to be stationary and for the illumination to be controlled. For methods that do take into account motion and illumination changes, strong assumptions are still made about the environment (e.g. background can be used for illumination rectification). In this paper, we propose an HR measurement method that is robust to motion, illumination changes, and does not require use of an environment's background. We present conditions under which cardiac activity extraction from local regions of the face can be treated as a linear Blind Source Separation problem and propose a simple but robust algorithm for selecting good local regions. The independent HR estimates from multiple local regions are then combined in a majority voting scheme that robustly recovers the HR. We validate our algorithm on a large database of challenging videos.
