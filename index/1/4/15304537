We present an algorithm for generating open-loop trajectories that solve the problem of rearrangement planning under uncertainty. We frame this as a selection problem where the goal is to choose the most robust trajectory from a finite set of candidates. We generate each candidate using a kinodynamic state space planner and evaluate it using noisy rollouts. Our key insight is we can formalize the selection problem as the “best arm” variant of the multi-armed bandit problem. We use the successive rejects algorithm to efficiently allocate rollouts between candidate trajectories given a rollout budget. We show that the successive rejects algorithm identifies the best candidate using fewer rollouts than a baseline algorithm in simulation. We also show that selecting a good candidate increases the likelihood of successful execution on a real robot.
