We present a novel approach for the online learning of hand gestures in swarm robotic (multi-robot) systems. We address the problem of online feature learning by proposing Convolutional Max-Pooling (CMP), a simple feed-forward two-layer network derived from the deep hierarchical Max-Pooling Convolutional Neural Network (MPCNN). To learn and classify gestures in an online and incremental fashion, we employ a 2nd order online learning method, namely the Soft-Confidence Weighted (SCW) learning scheme. In order for all robots to collectively take part in the learning and recognition task and obtain a swarm-level classification, we build a distributed consensus by fusing the individual decision opinions of robots together with the individual weights generated from multiple classifiers. Accuracy, robustness, and scalability of obtained solutions have been verified through emulation experiments performed on a large data set of real data acquired by a networked swarm of robots.
