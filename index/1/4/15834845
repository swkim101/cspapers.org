The classification-tree method (CTM) is a black box technique developed by Grochtmann and Grimm, which helps software testers construct test cases systematically from functional specifications. Later, some extension work has been done on CTM by Chen et al., with a view to improving the effectiveness of the method. This extension results in their integrated classification-tree methodology (ICTM). In this paper, we describe and discuss a prototype system ADDICT that is based on ICTM.
