Processing web interaction data is known to be cumbersome and time-consuming. State-of-the-art web tracking systems usually allow replaying user interactions in the form of mouse tracks, a video-like visualization scheme, to engage practitioners in the analysis process. However, traditional online video inspection has not explored the full capabilities of hypermedia and interactive techniques. In this paper, we introduce a web-based tracking tool that generates interactive visualizations from users' activity. The system unobtrusively collects browser events derived from normal usage, offering a unified framework to inspect interaction data in several ways. We compare our approach to related work in the research community as well as in commercial systems, and describe how ours fits in a real-world scenario. This research shows that there is a wide range of applications where the proposed tool can assist the WWW community.
