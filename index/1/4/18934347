Cybernomorphic leverage techniques have been extracted from the Air Force Weapons Laboratory HULL system and generalized to provide a new management system called SAIL for producing, updating and maintaining software and data files. SAIL is being used on CDC6600, CDC7600, IBM 360/85 and HIS6080 computers at twelve installations. The system provides a totally new level of centralized software development and maintenance control, while simultaneously decentralizing user applications, providing user controlled task specialization, and realizing transportability between dissimilar machines. Cybernomorphic techniques offer an evolutionary approach to economy in software by encouraging maximum reutilization of existing code without duplication or arbitrary management restraints, and enhancing the benefits realized from modularity and structured programming. The techniques offer economy in hardware resource utilization by producing code which is optimized at execution time for the task. Although the first strategic planning application of the SAIL techniques is only in the preliminary test and evaluation phase, the approach already promises new opportunities for improved effectiveness and economy in mission support applications software.
