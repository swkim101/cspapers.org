High precision parameter manipulation tasks typically require adjustment of the scale of manipulation in addition to the parameter itself. This paper introduces the notion of Zoom Sliding, or Zliding, for fluid integrated manipulation of scale (zooming) via pressure input while parameter manipulation within that scale is achieved via x-y cursor movement (sliding). We also present the Zlider (Figure 1), a widget that instantiates the Zliding concept. We experimentally evaluate three different input techniques for use with the Zlider in conjunction with a stylus for x-y cursor positioning, in a high accuracy zoom and select task. Our results marginally favor the stylus with integrated isometric pressure sensing tip over bimanual techniques which separate zooming and sliding controls over the two hands. We discuss the implications of our results and present further designs that make use of Zliding.
