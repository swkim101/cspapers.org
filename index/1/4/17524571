We present a new type of display actuation that is able to control both display geometry and stiffness properties using a filler material and air flow control technique. The display consists of a flat, flexible layer of cells on the surface and chamber filled with particles under it. Display geometries can be changed by transporting an amount of particles between display cells and the particle chamber using pressured air and vacuum to control the air flows. This system also allow for variable stiffness using vacuum technique to harden the particles inside chamber. In this paper, we present the design and control technique of this new type actuator and also possible interaction on a single actuator display. We also propose a low-cost, effective way to control an array of actuators where the air flow line and particle line are arranged in a multiplexed grid configuration.
