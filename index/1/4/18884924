This paper presents a new approach for estimating physical properties of deformable models from experimental measurements. In contrast to most previous work, we introduce a new method based on particle filters which identifies the different stiffness properties for spring-based models. This approach addresses some important limitations encountered with gradient descent techniques which often converge towards ill solutions or remain fixed in local minima conditions.
