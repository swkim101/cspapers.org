Recently, micro-nano robots intended for application to various fields are developed. However, motors which are robot's power are not yet practical. In this paper, to realize the motor which can be applied to micro-nano robot's power source, we established bio-motor by using surface swarming of Vibrio alginolyticus. First, we succeeded in driving the micro gear in the closed micro channel. Next, to transmit power of rotational movement, we fabricated the open micro channel, and succeeded in driving the gear in the open micro channel similarly. In addition, we revealed that ratchet type gear rotated faster than other type. Finally, we assembled the micro gear with shaft. Therefore, it became possible transmitting the power from rotational movement to outside. Thus, we achieved to construct base of bio-motor.
