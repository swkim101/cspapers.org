By default, we attempt to define practical areas of technological endeavor as “applications.” For example, the applied psychology of human-computer interaction has characteristically been defined in terms of the methods and concepts basic psychology can provide. This has not worked well. An alternative approach is to begin from a characterization of current practice, to take seriously the requirements of the domain of endeavor, and to define areas of “science” and “application” as possible and appropriate in that context.
