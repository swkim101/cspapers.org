There has been considerable interest in a one-semester course in software engineering [Bullard88, Carver87, Gibbs87]. Faculty members of departments of computer science are introducing courses that involve team projects, in an effort to provide students some experience with large programs. However, software professionals are still concerned that most computer science graduates have little understanding of what is involved in the development of large, complex systems. Too often, code alone is regarded as the primary product without proper consideration of the necessary standards and procedures of the controlling disciplines. This paper describes a course that shifted the emphasis from coding by having students perform supporting activities and maintenance on a large Ada project.
