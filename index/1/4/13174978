This paper proposes a modiﬁcation to the notion of PATH as used in ISOspace, in order to both simplify the semantics of the MOVELINK tag as well as improve its coherence as a link structure, as deﬁned in Bunt et al. (2016). This follows a suggestion by Lee (2016), where a reformulation of MOVELINK is proposed, in effect restoring an earlier proposal by Pustejovsky et al. (2010), where a motion is a relation between a MOVER and an EVENT PATH . This simpliﬁes the speciﬁcation in ISOspace, maintains a coherent abstract syntax
