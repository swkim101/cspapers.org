It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the WWW 2018 3rd International Workshop on Linked Data and Distributed Ledgers (LD-DL). We envision the workshop as a forum for researchers and practitioners from Distributed Ledgers and Linked Data to come together to discuss common challenges; propose solutions to shortcomings of existing architectures; and identify synergies for joint initiatives. The ultimate goal is the creation of a Web of Interoperable Ledgers. We received 6 submissions from all around the world. We evaluated them regarding relevance, quality, and novelty, selecting 3 short papers and 1 long paper (66% acceptance rate) --ScienceMiles - Digital currency for researchers--Can Blockchains and Linked Data Advance Taxation? --A distributed database with explicit semantics and chained RDF graphs--When trust saves energy: A Reference Framework for Proof of Trust (PoT) Blockchains. We hope that you will find the tutorial program interesting, providing you with a valuable opportunity to learn and share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.
