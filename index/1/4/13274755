A multi-instruction-multi-data stream computer architecture is presented which is aimed at supporting highly concurrent general-purpose computation. The proposed machine is organised as a set of autonomous resources, each having direct access to a common intercommunication medium which is implemented as a rotating ring. The machine language is based on a generalised concept of control which provides an alternative to the data flow organisation for highly concurrent programming.
 The progress of a concurrent computation is characterised by the flow of packets of work through resources via the ring. This information flow is organised in such a way as to optimise concurrent operation of the resources and to simplify allocation and intercommunication. Initial simulation results are presented to show the feasibility of the architecture.
