In this paper, a visible light communications (VLC) system prototype using organic light emitting diode (OLED) with dimming support was realized and tested. Frequency response and driving range of OLED were measured and discussed. Considering practical applications of OLED, variable pulse position modulation (VPPM) signal was used to support data transmission under dimming condition. Our prototype was able to transmit up to 85 kbps data rate using an OLED with only 7 kHz 3 dB modulation bandwidth. For the target BER=10-3 with FEC, the luminous flux could be varied within 5-8 lm.
