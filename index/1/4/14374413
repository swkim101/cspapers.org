Obesity and its associated health consequences such as high blood pressure and cardiac disease affect a significant proportion of the world's population. At the same time, the popularity of location-based services (LBS) and recommender systems is continually increasing with improvements in mobile technology. We observe that the health domain lacks a suggestion system that focuses on healthy lifestyle choices. We introduce the mobile application FitYou, which dynamically generates recommendations according to the user's current location and health condition as a real-time LBS. It utilizes preferences determined from user history and health information from a biometric profile. The system was developed upon a top performing contextual suggestion system in both TREC 2012 and 2013 Contextual Suggestion Tracks.
