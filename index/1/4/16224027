The use of storage hierarchies in the implementation of a paging system is investigated. Alternative approaches for managing a paging storage hierarchy are described and two are selected for further study - staging and migration. Characteristic behaviour is determined for each of these approaches and a series of simulation experiments is conducted (using program reference strings as data) for the purpose of comparing them. The results clearly show migration to be a superior approach from the point of view of both cost and performance. Conclusions are drawn on the effectiveness of each approach in practice.
