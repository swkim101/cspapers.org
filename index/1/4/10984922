The task of searching and grasping objects in cluttered scenes, typical of robotic applications in domestic environments requires fast object detection and segmentation. Attentional mechanisms provide a means to detect and prioritize processing of objects of interest. In this work, we combine a saliency operator based on symmetry with a segmentation method based on clustering locally planar surface patches, both operating on 2.5D point clouds (RGB-D images) as input data to yield a novel approach to table-top scene segmentation. Evaluation on indoor table-top scenes containing man-made objects clustered in piles and dumped in a box show that our approach to selection of attention points significantly improves performance of state-of-the-art attention-based segmentation methods.
