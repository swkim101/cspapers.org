Unfortunately, the sensing devices which are available for mobile robots often fail in a variety of circumstances. This is especially true of the less expensive devices such as ultrasonic and infrared range sensors. Combining data from several sensors and from a pre-stored model of the domain provides a way to enhance the reliability of a perception system. Such combination may be accomplished by integrating range measurements into a geometric model of the local environment.
