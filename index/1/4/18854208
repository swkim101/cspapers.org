We study the problem of detecting outlier pairs of strongly correlated variables among a collection of n variables with otherwise weak pairwise correlations. After normalization, this task amounts to the geometric task where we are given as input a set of n vectors with unit Euclidean norm and dimension d, and for some constants 0<τ < ρ < 1, we are asked to find all the outlier pairs of vectors whose inner product is at least ρ in absolute value, subject to the promise that all but at most q pairs of vectors have inner product at most τ in absolute value. Improving on an algorithm of Valiant [FOCS 2012; J. ACM 2015], we present a randomized algorithm that for Boolean inputs ({ −1,1}-valued data normalized to unit Euclidean length) runs in time Õ((nmax,{ 1−γ +M(Δ γ ,γ),M(1−γ ,2 Δ γ)}+qdn2γ), where 0<γ < 1 is a constant tradeoff parameter and M(μ, ν) is the exponent to multiply an ⌊ nμ ⌋ × ⌊ nν ⌋ matrix with an ⌊ nν ⌋ × ⌊ nμ ⌋ matrix and Δ =1/(1−logτ ρ). As corollaries we obtain randomized algorithms that run in time Õ( (n2/ω 3−logτ ρ + qdn2/(1−logτ ρ)3=logττ ρ) and in time õ( (n4 / 2+α (1−logτ ρ)+qdn2/α (1−logτ ρ)2+α (1−logτ ρ)>), where 2≤ ω <2.38 is the exponent for square matrix multiplication and 0.3<α ≤ 1 is the exponent for rectangular matrix multiplication. The notation Õ(ṡ) hides polylogarithmic factors in n and d whose degree may depend on ρ and τ. We present further corollaries for the light bulb problem and for learning sparse Boolean functions.
