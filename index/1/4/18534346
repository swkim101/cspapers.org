Recently Hext and Roberts have attempted to refine Domolki's parsing algorithm to include limited context checking. This paper links their effort to Lynch's overlap resolvable grammars, which are here extended to include &egr;-rules. Both Lynch's and Hext and Roberts' versions of the algorithm are modified, the former with a considerable time improvement and the latter using the full power of overlap resolvability. Results are also proposed on removing 1-productions from overlap resolvable grammars for such parsers, answering a question of Lynch. Both new formulations of the algorithm can be efficiently implemented: the former being particularly suited for fixed word length machines, and the latter for newer array processing systems. An extension of these algorithms to parse DeRemer's SLR(1) class of grammars is demonstrated.
