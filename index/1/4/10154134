“....automation creates roles for people, which is to say depth of involvement in their work and human association that our preceding mechanical technology had destroyed.”
 There are many terms used for the computer application to the aid of design and production, none of which truly state the case. We are concerned here with a system that will implement the ideas behind these terms. The tools used for this implementation are the computers and a large amount of software. This combination is ideally suited for the long, tedious, and dull tasks. The user, who is a human being is capable of working easily with abstractions. It is the combination of man and the machine which produces a system to perform our task. Thus it becomes clear that the engineer should be designing systems to design products, and not designing products.
