This paper presents a symbolic and recursive calculation of the dynamic model of flexible parallel robots. In order to reduce the computational time, it is necessary to minimize the number of operators in the symbolic expression of the model. Some algorithms have been proposed for the rigid case, for parallel robots with lumped springs or for serial robots with distributed flexibilities, but to the best of our knowledge, nothing has been developed for parallel robots with distributed flexibilities. This paper aims at filling this gap. In order to minimize the number of operations, the Newton- Euler principle is used and combined with the principle of virtual powers. The Jacobian matrices defining the kinematic constraints are computed using recursive calculations that decrease the number of operators. The proposed algorithm is used to compute the elastodynamic model of a planar parallel robot. The obtained results, compared with those obtained with commercial softwares, show the validity of the proposed algorithm.
