People have been relying on Google Maps, MapQuest, or other similar services to find desired locations on maps, browse surrounding businesses, get driving directions, etc.. Navigation by clicking and dragging the mouse to browse maps at multiple levels of resolution is one of the most attractive features in Web-based map exploration. Most database systems, though with some graphical user interfaces, are still lack of data-content browsing-based interfaces. Motivated by Google Maps, we develop DataScope, a Web-based data content visualization system, for people to view the desired data easily, interactively, and at multi-resolution.
