Hierarchical phrase-based models are attractive because they provide a consistent framework within which to characterize both local and long-distance reorderings, but they also make it difficult to distinguish many implausible reorderings from those that are linguistically plausible. Rather than appealing to annotation-driven syntactic modeling, we address this problem by observing the influential role of function words in determining syntactic structure, and introducing soft constraints on function word relationships as part of a standard log-linear hierarchical phrase-based model. Experimentation on Chinese-English and Arabic-English translation demonstrates that the approach yields significant gains in performance.
