We present a communication protocol called Choco, which efficiently supports various traffic demands with end-to-end reliability in multi-hop Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). To achieve this, Choco uses fine-grained scheduling based on the insight that acknowledgements (ACKs) between ends can be delivered with little overhead using concurrent transmission. Specifically, the slot assignment is dynamically scheduled up to several times a second according to traffic loads and packet losses. We show that Choco achieves higher efficiency and reliability than ORPL+BF, which is a state-of-the-art collection protocol, for periodic traffic environments. Also, we show that in a networked imaging application, which generates burst traffic, Choco can successfully collect 5 VGA images with high efficiency from 5 nodes in approximately 168~s in an average 4.0~hop network.
