This paper gives a 3/2 approximation algorithm for the smallest 3-edge connected spanning subgraph of an undirected multigraph. The previous best algorithm of Khuller and Raghavachari [8] has approximation ratio 5/3. The algorithm of Cheriyan and Thurimella [3] achieves ratio 3/2 for simple graphs. Our approach is based on the relationship between an ear decomposition of a 2-edge connected graph and 3-edge connected components, enabling us to achieve running time O(mÎ±(m,n)).
