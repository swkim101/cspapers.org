Vehicular wireless communication for real-time or emergent events notification is an important issue in VANETs. In this article we construct an integrated architecture for the implementation of dynamic routing/navigation application in VANET environment using iWCUÂ®- a WAVE/DSRC device developed by ITRI1 of Taiwan. The Dynamic navigation field test in VENET using a WAVE/DSRC On-board-Unit(OBU) and a WAVE/DSRC Road-Side-Unit(RSU) as the network node is examined. OBU provides dynamic navigation service for driver when receiving the real-time traffic information from RSU. The loopback detection method is adopted to detect re-broadcasting packets when a forward request in real-time needed in this study. As result, real-time packets transmission for dynamic navigation application with high mobility situations are delivered efficiently in testing results. (1 Industrial Technology Research Institute)
