We study directed network design problems with orientation constraints. An orien- tation constraint on a pair of nodes u and v states that a feasible solution may include at most one of the arcs (u, v) and (v, u). Such constraints arise naturally in many network design problems, since link or edge resources such as fiber can be used to support traffic in one of two possible directions only. Our first result is that the directed network design problem with orientation constraints can be solved in polynomial time in the case where the requirement function f is positively intersect- ing supermodular. (The case where there are no orientation constraints follows from the work of Frank (Acta Sci. Math. (Szeged), 41 (1979), pp. 63-76).) The second main result of the paper is a 4-approximation algorithm for the minimum cost strongly edge-connected subgraph problem with orientation constraints. Our algorithm shows that the problem of enforcing orientation constraints can be reduced to the minimum cost 2-edge-connected subgraph problem on undirected graphs. Finally, we study the problem for general crossing supermodular functions and show the following bicriteria approximation result. Let k denote the maximum requirement of any set under the given requirement function f . We give a2 k-approximation algorithm to construct a solution that satisfies a slightly weaker requirement function, namely, f � (S) = max{f (S) − 1, 0}.
