Many machine-learning (either supervised or unsupervised) techniques assume that data present themselves in an attribute-value form. But this formalism is largely insufficient to account for many applications. Therefore, much of the ongoing research now focuses on first-order learning systems. But complex formalisms lead to high computational complexities. On the other hand, most of the currently installed databases have been designed according to a formalism known as entity-relationship, and usually implemented on a relational database management system. This formalism is far less complex than first-order logic, but much more expressive than attribute-value lists. In that context, the database schema defines an abstraction space, and learning must occur at each level of abstraction. This paper describes a clustering system able to discover useful groupings in structured databases. It is based in the COBWEB algorithm, to which it adds the ability to cluster structured objects.
