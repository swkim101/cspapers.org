Research on robot-assisted laparoscopic SPA (Single Port Access) surgery and N.O.T.E.S (Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery) have thrived in the past a few years. A configuration similarity between these surgical robotic slaves is that two robotic arms are extended from the same access port (either a laparoscope or an endoscope) for surgical interventions. However, upon designing such a surgical robotic slave, the structure of the extended robotic arms has not been explored thoroughly based on evaluation of their distal dexterity. This paper presents a simulation-based comparison among three different structures which could be used to form these extended robotic arms. Results presented in this paper could serve as a design reference for surgical robotic slaves which use a single access port and continuum mechanisms.
