<i>A line transversal</i> of a family <i>S</i> of <i>n</i> pairwise disjoint convex objects is a straight line meeting all members of <i>S. A geometric permutation</i> of <i>S</i> is the pair of orders in which members of <i>S</i> are met by a line transversal, one order being the reverse of the other.In this note we consider a long-standing open problem in transversal theory, namely that of determining the largest number of geometric permutations that a family of <i>n</i> pairwise disjoint convex objects in R<sup><i>d</i></sup> can admit. We settle a restricted variant of this problem. Specifically, we show that the maximum number of those geometric permutations to a family of <i>n</i> > 2 pairwise disjoint convex objects that are induced by lines passing through any fixed point is between <i>K</i>(<i>n</i> - 1, <i>d</i> - 1) and <i>K</i>(<i>n,d</i> - 1), where <i>K</i>(<i>n,d</i>) = Σ<sup>d</sup><inf>i=0</inf> (<i>n</i>-1/<i>i</i>) = Θ(<i>n</i><sup><i>d</i></sup>) is the number of pairs of antipodal cells in a simple arrangement of <i>n</i> great (<i>d</i> - 1)-spheres in a <i>d</i>-sphere. By a similar argument, we show that the maximum number of connected components of the space of all lines transversal through a fixed point to a family of <i>n</i> > 2 possibly intersecting convex objects is <i>K</i>(<i>n, d</i> - 1). Finally, we refute a conjecture of Sharir and Smorodinsky on the number of neighbor pairs in geometric permutations and offer an alternative conjecture which may be a first step towards solving the aforementioned general problem of bounding the number of geometric permutations.
