We present a formal framework for treating both incomplete information in the initial database and possible failures during an agent's execution of a course of actions. These two aspects of uncertainty are formalized by two different notions of probability. We introduce also a concept of expected probability, which is obtained by combining the two previous notions. Expected probability accounts for the probability of a sentence on the hypothesis that the sequence of actions needed to make it true might have failed. Expected probability leads to the possibility of comparing courses of actions and verifying which is more safe.
