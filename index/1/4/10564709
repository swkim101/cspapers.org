We show that the problem of constructing a perfect matching in a graph is in the complexity class Random NC; i.e., the problem is solvable in polylog time by a randomized parallel algorithm using a polynomial-bounded number of processors. We also show that several related problems lie in Random NC. These include:(i)Constructing a perfect matching of maximum weight in a graph whose edge weights are given in unary notation;(ii)Constructing a maximum-cardinality matching;(iii)Constructing a matching covering a set of vertices of maximum weight in a graph whose vertex weights are given in binary;(iv)Constructing a maximums-t flow in a directed graph whose edge weights are given in unary.
