In this research, we built a 3D human anatomy learning system â€” 3D-Health Care (3D-HC) for mobile learning. This system enables learners to study the content of human organs and how to take care the patient. We evaluate the perception of user on the proposed 3D-HC system. After using this system, the participants filled in the questionnaires for analysis of the experimental results. Participants were twenty-eight students in a college. The results explained that learners had positive attitude towards 3D-HC. Most of participants perceived that 3D-HC had increased their interest and motivation for learning.
