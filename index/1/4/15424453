In this paper, we analyze gender dynamics in the undergraduate Computer Science program at Stanford University through a quantitative analysis of 7209 academic transcripts and 536 survey responses. We examine previously studied effects as well as present new findings. We also introduce Fisher's Noncentral Hypergeometric Distribution as a model for estimating the impact of program changes on underrepresented populations and explain why it is a more robust measure than changes in the percentage of minority participants.
