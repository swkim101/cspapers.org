The study of garbage collection for a logic programming language machine has exhibited fundamental differences with the more popular functional programming garbage collection. These differences yield behaviours that cannot be observed with classical models. We give two new models, (one is determistic and the other stochastic) which take into account these behaviours. We argue that the stochastic model is also suitable for more classical garbage collector, and that it overcomes deterministic models for the study of the real-time property for parallel garbage collector. Finally, we argue that the methodology used to build and solve the stochastic model can be applied to the stochastic modeling of other systems.
