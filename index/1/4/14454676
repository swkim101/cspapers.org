visual cues are used by humans to recover 3D information from 2D images. One such cue is the distortion of textures due to the projection of the 3D world onto a 2D image plane. Many algorithms have been developed to recover shape from texture in computer vision systems. This paper is a literature review that aims to give an overview of the different approaches to the problem through five technical papers that have influenced the field over the last three decades.
