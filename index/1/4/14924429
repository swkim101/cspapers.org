The Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem is one of the basics in the study of locality in distributed graph algorithms. This paper presents a very simple randomized algorithm for this problem providing a near-optimal local complexity, which incidentally, when combined with some known techniques, also leads to a near-optimal global complexity. Classical MIS algorithms of Luby [STOC'85] and Alon, Babai and Itai [JALG'86] provide the global complexity guarantee that, with high probability1, all nodes terminate after O(log n) rounds. In contrast, our initial focus is on the local complexity, and our main contribution is to provide a very simple algorithm guaranteeing that each particular node v terminates after O(log deg(v) + log 1/e) rounds, with probability at least 1 -- e. The degree-dependency in this bound is optimal, due to a lower bound of Kuhn, Moscibroda, and Wattenhofer [PODC'04]. Interestingly, this local complexity smoothly transitions to a global complexity: by adding techniques of Barenboim, Elkin, Pettie, and Schneider [FOCS'12; arXiv: 1202.1983v3], we2 get an MIS algorithm with a high probability global complexity of O(log Δ) + 2O([EQUATION]), where Δ denotes the maximum degree. This improves over the O(log2 Δ) + 2O([EQUATION]) result of Barenboim et al., and gets close to the Ω(min{log Δ, [EQUATION]}) lower bound of Kuhn et al. Corollaries include improved algorithms for MIS in graphs of upper-bounded arboricity, or lower-bounded girth, for Ruling Sets, for MIS in the Local Computation Algorithms (LCA) model, and a faster distributed algorithm for the Lovasz Local Lemma.
