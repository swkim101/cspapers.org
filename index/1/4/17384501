Many types of multimedia can be used to accommodate information for pervasive communication. Messages may be injected into them by information hiding techniques and extracted for various purposes. Such multimedia with messages embedded are called message-rich multimedia. A new method for creating message-rich videos is proposed in this study for people to exchange messages by display-and-imaging operations. A message is firstly embedded in a given video by a technique of injecting peak values into the DFT spectrum of each video frame. The resulting message-rich video, when displayed on a TV or monitor, is then recorded with a smart-phone camera as another video. The message in the recorded video is finally extracted for visual inspection. This way of message transmission can be used for covert communication, secret message exchanges, etc. Good experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed method.
