With aggressive CMOS technology scaling, Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) has emerged as one of the major system lifetime reliability threats, which gradually increases PMOS transistor threshold voltage and hence results in increased circuit delay. NBTI-induced performance degradation depends heavily on time-varying parameters such as temperature, duty cycle and supply voltage. Previous analytical models for NBTI effects, however, cannot cover all these parameters, causing overly optimistic or overly pessimistic analysis. In this work, we propose a comprehensive NBTI analytical model that explicitly takes supply voltage, duty cycle and temperature variations into consideration. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated against cycle-accurate simulation for NBTI effects. In addition, based on the proposed model, we present an efficient simulation framework for system lifetime prediction by running representative workloads only. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed solution.
