STELLA (Satellite Transmission Experiment Linking Laboratories) is a European wide-band data transmission experiment. STELLA makes use of the European Orbital Test Satellite (OTS) which provides a 2 Mb/s broadcast data transmission channel. The first phase of the STELLA project (STELLA/I) is summarized. The more important design characteristics of an improved version (STELLA/II) of STELLA/I are emphasized. Collaboration between STELLA/II and UNIVERSE projects in the framework of COST-11Bis is then outlined.
