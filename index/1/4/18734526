The general architecture of a monitor that enforces inclusion dependencies and referential integrity is described. The monitor traces the operations a user submits in a session and can either modify an operation or propagate it, depending on additional information the database designer provided at design time. Propagation is implemented by executing new operations when the session terminates, using summary data collected during normal processing.
