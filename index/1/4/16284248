In this work, we explore the use of error-correcting output codes (ECOC) to enhance the performance of centroid text classifier. The framework is to decompose one multi-class problem into multiple binary problems and then learn the individual binary classification problems by centroid classifier. However, this kind of decomposition incurs considerable bias for centroid classifier, which results in noticeable degradation of performance. To address this issue, we use Model-Refinement to adjust this so-called bias.
