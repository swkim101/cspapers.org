This paper describes an improvement in the performance of Transfer-Driven Machine Translation (TDMT) by the use of extralinguistic information. In evaluating what constitutes natural speech, particular attention was paid to word usage that depended on the extra-linguistic information from the context, situation, environment and so on. We discuss what types of extra-linguistic information a spoken-language translation system requires to create naturally communicative dialogs. We then propose a method of improving the precision of translation by utilizing this extralinguistic information. Preliminary experimentation showing performance improvements in TDMT makes us believe that the proposed scheme can improve the performance of dialog MT.
