Traditional paper-and-pencil tests have always been a heavy burden for teachers. In recent years, computer technology has been widely applied to the education field, which makes quite an impact on traditional teaching activities. Teachers have to take more advantages of new technology in both tools and methodology to achieve a more effective assessment. In this paper, a web-based Chinese math word problem test system is proposed. The system is based on an automatic item generation (AIG) mechanism, which employs object-oriented technology to dynamically generate items that require little human review prior to administration. The teacher can organize a test by specifying the number of problems and their types. Students can take a test online within the valid period. Every student has different, but similar test items of the same difficulty levels, which brings the assessment more fairness and improves security. Moreover, students can use the system as a practice tool anytime and anywhere for learning purpose.
