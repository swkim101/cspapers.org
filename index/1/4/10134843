Silicon interposers enable the integration of multiple stacks of in-package memory to provide higher bandwidth or lower energy for memory accesses. Once the interposer has been paid for, there are new opportunities to exploit the interposer. Recent work considers using the routing resources of the interposer to improve the network-on-chip's (NoC) capabilities. In this work, we exploit the interposer to "disintegrate" a multi-core CPU chip into smaller chips that individually and collectively cost less to manufacture than a single large chip. However, this fragments the overall NoC, which decreases performance as core-to-core messages between chips must now route through the interposer. We study the performance-cost trade-offs of interposer based, multi-chip, multi-core systems and propose new interposer NoC organizations to mitigate the performance challenges while preserving the cost benefits.
