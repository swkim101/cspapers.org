In this poster, we present TrustDraw, a transparent security extension for the cloud which combines Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) and Trusted Computing (TC). TrustDraw provides secure storage of critical data like keys or passwords and allows to temporarily insert this data into a running virtual machine (VM) if required. TrustDraw improves security by allowing access to the critical data only if certain previously defined conditions are met. This way, the stealing of critical data by bypassing access permissions based on successfully executed attacks can be mitigated. TrustDraw runs isolated and transparent. No software modifications are required on a target VM. We evaluated an implementation of TrustDraw in a realistic scenario in which it only caused an acceptable run-time delay.
