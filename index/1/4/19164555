In this method, a ε-dragging technique is introduced to the Rescaled Linear Square Regression in order to enlarge the distances between different classes. An iterative method is proposed to simultaneously learn the regression coefficients, ε-draggings matrix and predicting the unknown class labels. Experimental results show the superiority of DSSFS.
