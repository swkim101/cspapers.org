In this work, we develop a general solution to a broad class of grasping and manipulation problems that we term as C-SLAM for contact simultaneous localization and modeling, where the robots need to accurately track the motions of the contacted bodies and the locations of contacts, while simultaneously estimating important system parameters, such as body dimensions, masses and friction coefficients between contacting surfaces. Our solution framework is based on a dynamic Bayesian inference framework, and hence, we refer to it as Dynamic Bayesian C-SLAM (DBC-SLAM). DBC-SLAM combines an NCP-based dynamic model with the dynamic Bayesian network, and incorporates model parameter estimation as an intrinsic part of the overall inference procedure. We show two preliminary “proof-of-concept” examples that demonstrate the use of DBC-SLAM in robotic contact tasks.
