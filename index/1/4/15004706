High product volume, diverse packaging configurations, and high-speed functional operation make memory circuit testing a difficult manufacturing problem. One solution to this problem is provided by the computer-controlled test system described here. Modular design of hardware, microprogram, and programming subsystems has met production requirements for speed, quality, and repair of assembly defects.
