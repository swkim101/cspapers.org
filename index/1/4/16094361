The majority of naturally sounding musical performance has musical expression (fluctuation in tempo, volume, etc.). Musical expression is affected by various factors, such as the performer, performative style, mood, and so forth. However, in past research on the computerized generation of musical expression, these factors are treated as being less significant, or almost ignored. Hence, the majority of past approaches find it relatively hard to generate multiple performance for a given piece of music with varying musical expression. 
 
In this paper, we propose a case-based approach to the generation of expressively modulated performance. This method enables the generation of varying musical expression for a single piece of music. We have implemented the proposed case-based method in a musical performance system, and, we also describe the system architecture and experiments performed on the system.
