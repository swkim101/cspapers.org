This paper presents a simple method to generate a gait trajectory of a compass type biped walking model. The method relies on the symmetric characteristics in the dynamics of the model. The motion generated by this method resembles that of passive dynamic walking phenomenon, as the motion consists of a phase of a ballistic leg swing and a foot collision taking place one after another. The two differs in the point that the method is constructed against a level surface, while passive dynamic walking occurs on a shallow slope. We constructed a compass type biped robot to experimentally confirm the effectiveness of our method. Preliminary results that partially validate our method are shown.
