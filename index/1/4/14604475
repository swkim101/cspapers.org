The previous approaches of extending logic programming for handling complex objects introduced new LP notions but without changing the underlying set manipulations. As a result, they were insufficient for handling nested relations and could not consistently maintain the canonical semantics of logic programming. In order to remedy this problem we propose to develop algebraic tools at set manipulation level, such as partial inclusion and ungrouping, for providing a canonical formal framework of nested relation based knowledge representation.
