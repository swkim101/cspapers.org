This paper describes Ms. Malaprop, a program (currently being designed) which will answer questions about simple stories dealing with painting, where stories, questions and answers will be expressed in semantic representation rather than English in order to allow concentration on the inferential problems involved in language comprehension. The common sense knowledge needed to accomplish the task is provided by the frame representation of "mundane" painting found in Charniak (1976b). The present paper, after reviewing this representation, goes on to describe how it is used by Ms. Malaprop. Some specific questions of matching, correcting false conclusions, and search, will be discussed.
