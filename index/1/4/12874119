Beam search is a fast and empirically effective method for translation decoding, but it lacks formal guarantees about search error. We develop a new decoding algorithm that combines the speed of beam search with the optimal certificate property of Lagrangian relaxation, and apply it to phrase- and syntax-based translation decoding. The new method is efficient, utilizes standard MT algorithms, and returns an exact solution on the majority of translation examples in our test data. The algorithm is 3.5 times faster than an optimized incremental constraint-based decoder for phrase-based translation and 4 times faster for syntax-based translation.
