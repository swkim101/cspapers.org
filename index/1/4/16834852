The increasing use of mobile devices and the dissemination of wireless networks have stimulated mobile and ubiquitous computing research. In this context, education is being considered one of the main application areas. This paper proposes the use of mobile and ubiquitous computing to support and improve learning in a new kind of academic structure called Undergraduate Course of Reference (nicknamed GRefe). The GRefe was proposed in Unisinos, a university located in south of Brazil. Currently, there are four GRefes. These courses are organized in Learning Programs and Learning Projects. They use a practical and multidisciplinary approach to stimulate the learning. We proposed the use of mobile and ubiquitous computing technology to articulate and improve the academic activities of a specific GRefe called Computer Engineering. We believe that GRefe organization simplified and stimulated the use of these technologies in a learning environment.
