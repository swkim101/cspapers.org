This short paper proposes that bringing real-world experience through field studies of work and other environments where systems are used is a means of bridging the gap between software engineering and HCI. We argue that all disciplines involved in systems development can benefit from field studies and observations of users at work and at home and we briefly discuss a range of techniques that we have developed to facilitate these field studies.
