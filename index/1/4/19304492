Design automation techniques are gaining universal usage throughout industry. The tailoring of design automation systems to a specific hardware technology generally results in their early obsolescence. GENDA, a GENeralized Design Automation system currently used within Philco, represents a successful attempt to cope with changing packaging techniques and the lead time normally involved in development of design automation functions.

 The following paragraphs detail and illustrate the operational GENDA design automation system and the design philosophy behind it.
