The recently introduced EP-model citeeptr proposes a declarative executable model for engineering object-based systems which achieves executability through a hybrid approach that annotates model elements with Java code snippets. Current modeling tools are not appropriate for this hybrid approach which requires graphical model editing, code generation and tight IDE integration to provide an effective modeling environment. DEMOS citedemostool is an Eclipse-based tool which supports editing and executing EP models with rule-based background code generation, and which provides immediate feedback on the syntactic validity of both model elements and user-supplied code snippets. The tool, which features an AOM-based architecture that renders it adaptable to different metamodels, enables EP-models to be used as first-class artifacts in the software engineering process.
