A novel control scheme based on wave variables for controlling the teleoperation system over the time-varying delayed communication is proposed. Regarding to the symmetric wave teleoperation control layout, the control is achieved by adjusting the wave variables based on the difference between the desired and the fictitious position, which is obtained from integrating the non-distorted wave variables. The resulting wave is then applied to the master/slave robots controlled with local PD controller. By this control scheme, the system is stable and the position difference of the master and slave is proven to converge to zero in the free motion case if the time delay is continuously differentiable. In addition, the slave-environment interaction force is reflected to the operator precisely when the static contact is made during steady time delay. This control scheme can readily be extended to the implementation of the teleoperation system in full task space SO(3) × ℝ3.
