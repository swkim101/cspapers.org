Within the process of the production of a film or tv program a significant amount of metadata is created and - most times - lost again. As a consequence most of this valuable information has to be costly recreated in subsequent steps of media production, distribution, and archival. On the other hand, there is no commonly used metadata exchange format throughout all steps of the media value chain. Furthermore, technical systems and software applications used in the media production process often have proprietary interfaces for data exchange. In the course of the D-Werft project funded by the German government, metadata exchange through all steps of the media value chain is to be fostered by the application of Linked Data principles. Starting with the idea for a script, metadata from existing systems and applications will be mapped to ontologies to be reused in subsequent production steps. Also for distribution and archival, metadata collected during the production process is a valuable asset to be reused for semantic and exploratory search as well as for intelligent movie recommendation and customized advertising.
