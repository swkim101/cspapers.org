We prove the first nontrivial sample complexity lower bound in this model by showing that order of &/A2 + d/A examples are necessary for PAC learning any target class of {O, 1}-valued functions of VC dimension d, where e is the desired accuracy and q = &/(1 + e) – A the malicious noise rate (it is well known that any nontrivial target class cannot be PAC learned with accuracy E and malicio-us noise rate q > &/(1 + &), this irrespective to sample complexity.) This result cannot be significantly improved in general. In fact, we show a learning algorithm for the same noise model that. for each d. learns the class of all subsets of d elements using a number of examples of the same order as that proven necessary by our lower bound (disregarding logarithmic factors). In contrast, we show that to learn any target class of VC-dimension d in the presence of a high malicious noise rate ~ (i.e. A = o(s)), the popular strategy choosing any hypothesis that minimizes disagreements on the sample needs fl(de/A2 ) examples. This implies that, for high noise rate and for any target class of VC-dimension large enough, there are distributions over the target domain where the minimum disagreement strategy is outperformed by our algorithm.
