This paper examines the application of reinforcement learning to a wireless communication problem. The problem requires that channel utility be maximized while simultaneously minimizing battery usage. We present a solution to this multi-criteria problem that is able to significantly reduce power consumption. The solution uses a variable discount factor to capture the effects of battery usage.
