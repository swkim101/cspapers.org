In this extended abstract we discuss how social communication during human-robot task collaboration can be used to improve user task performance and guide decisionmaking. Our approach integrates recognition of a person’s intentional role-driven behavior with planning of the robot’s verbal feedback using a Markov decision process representation of the task environment. Using this type of model allows for the robot to track user performance on a task overtime, provide contextual verbal feedback, and adjust the presentation of feedback overtime according to observed changes in the user’s activity. The approach will be evaluated in an assistive meal preparation task with older adults, in which an autonomous robot provides verbal guidance in addition to directly assisting the user by performing parts of the task.
