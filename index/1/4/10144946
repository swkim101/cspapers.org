A b s t r a c t . I t is well-known tha t the computation of the pe rmanen t of 0-1 matrices, which is the same as comput ing the number of matchings in bipar t i te graph, is #P-comple t e . However the complexity of comput ing a good approximat ion of the number of matchings, is an open question and it is the leading candidate for a problem for which one solution can be found in polynomial time, but for which even approximat ing the number of solutions is hard. In this paper we present a fully polynomial (e, 6) -approximat ion scheme for the permanent of 0-1 matr ices where at least half of the entries in every row and every column are l ' s . The novel a lgori thm uses a Markov chain tha t converges to the uniform distr ibution on the space of perfect matchings for any given graph. We show tha t it converges in polynomial t ime (in terms of the variat ion distance) for all dense enough graphs. Based on this chain we construct a sampling scheme tha t allows us to approximate the permanent of dense 0-1 matrices in polynomial time. Finally we show tha t the exact computation of the pe rmanen t of such matrices is still ~ P complete. 1.

In other words al though finding a perfect matching is easy and finding a Hamil tonian circuit is hard, counting perfect matchings and counting Hamiltonian circuits is equally hard. The number of perfect matchings in a bipar t i te graph G(Vx,V2, E) where ]VI [= IV2[ = n and E c VI × V2 is the same as comput ing the permanent of a square 0-1 ma t r ix M = (m~d) of size n where 1, E; m~,y = O, otherwise, and the permanent of M, p e r ( M ) is defined by p e r ( M ) = Z H m~,~(0' l<_i_<n where ¢r ranges over all the permuta t ions of the set (1, . . . , n). The permanent function has a long and noble history~ it was introduced by Cauchy in 1812 in its celebrated memoir on de terminants and almost simultaneously by Binet. (See [Minc78] for detailed history.) I t has impor tan t applications in statistical physics and chemistry and plays a central role in many enumerat ion and linear algebra problems. Despite many efforts, the fastest known algori thm for the exact computa t ion of the permanent requires O(n2 n) operations. (It is based on Ryser 's formula [Ryser63]. See [NW75] for implementation.) Some of the difficulty seems to reside in the fact tha t a l though the permanent is closely related to the determinant , it lacks the symmetr ies of the
