Authentication is an all-embracing mechanism in today's (digital) society. While current systems require users to provide much personal data and offer many attack vectors due to using a username/passwords combination, systems that allow for minimizing the data released during authentication exist. Implementing such data-minimizing authentication reduces the number of attack vectors, enables enterprises to reduce the risk associated with possession of sensitive user data, and realizes better privacy for users. Our prototype demonstrates the use of data-minimizing authentication using the scenario of accessing a teenage chat room in a privacy-preserving way. The prototype allows a user to retrieve credentials, which may be seen as the digital equivalent of the plastic cards we carry in our wallets today. It also implements a service provider who requires authentication with respect to a service-specific policy. The prototype determines whether and how the user can fulfill the policy with her credentials, which typically results in various options. A graphical user interface then allows the user to select one of these options. Based on the user's input, the prototype generates an Identity Mixer proof that shows fulfillment of the service provider's policy without revealing unnecessary information. Finally, this proof is sent to the service provider for verification. Our prototype is the first implementation of such far-reaching data-minimizing authentication, where we provide the building blocks of our implementation as open-source software.
