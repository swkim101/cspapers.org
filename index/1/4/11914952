Temporal information retrieval has been a topic of great interest in recent years. Despite the efforts that have been conducted so far, most popular search engines remain underdeveloped when it comes to explicitly considering the use of temporal information in their search process. In this paper we present GTE-Rank, an online searching tool that takes time into account when ranking time-sensitive query web search results. GTE-Rank is defined as a linear combination of topical and temporal scores to reflect the relevance of any web page both in topical and temporal dimensions. The resulting system can be explored graphically through a search interface made available for research purposes.
