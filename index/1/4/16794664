Conventionally, a cable driven parallel mechanism (CDPM) pose is obtained through the forward kinematics from measurements of the cable lengths. However, this estimation method can be limiting for some applications requiring more precision. This paper proposes to use cable angle position sensors in addition to cable length measurements in order to improve the accuracy of such mechanisms. The robot pose is first obtained individually by the cable length measurements and the cable angle position measurements. A data fusion scheme combining these two types of measurements is then proposed in order to improve the CPDM accuracy. Finally, simulations and experiments are presented in order to assess the benefits of using cable angle position sensors on the CDPM.
