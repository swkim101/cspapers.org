The problem of monotonicity testing over the hypergrid and its special case, the hypercube, is a classic question in property testing. We are given query access to f:[k]<sup>n</sup> -> R (for some ordered range R). The hypergrid/cube has a natural partial order given by coordinate-wise ordering, denoted by prec. A function is <i>monotone</i> if for all pairs x prec y, f(x) ≤ f(y). The distance to monotonicity, ε<sub>f</sub>, is the minimum fraction of values of f that need to be changed to make f monotone. For k=2 (the boolean hypercube), the usual tester is the <i>edge tester</i>, which checks monotonicity on adjacent pairs of domain points. It is known that the edge tester using O(ε<sup>-1</sup>n log|R|) samples can distinguish a monotone function from one where ε<sub>f</sub> > ε. On the other hand, the best lower bound for monotonicity testing over general R is Ω(n). We resolve this long standing open problem and prove that O(n/ε) samples suffice for the edge tester. For hypergrids, known testers require O(ε<sup>-1</sup>n log k log |R|) samples, while the best known (non-adaptive) lower bound is Ω(ε<sup>-1</sup> n log k). We give a (non-adaptive) monotonicity tester for hypergrids running in O(ε<sup>{-1} n log k)</sup> time.
 Our techniques lead to optimal property testers (with the same running time) for the natural <i>Lipschitz property</i> on hypercubes and hypergrids. (A <i>c</i>-Lipschitz function is one where |f(<i>x</i>) - f(<i>y</i>)| ≤ <i>c</i>||<i>x-y</i>||<sub>1</sub>.) In fact, we give a general unified proof for <i>O</i>(ε<sup>-1</sup><i>n</i>log <i>k</i>)-query testers for a class of "bounded-derivative" properties, a class containing both monotonicity and Lipschitz.
