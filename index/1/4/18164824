There exists a widely held belief that the full potential of LSI technology will be realized by arrays of logic circuits. A novel machine architecture is proposed that consists of a uniform array of identical cells with the property that the array executes a high-level programming language directly. Some of the more important features of such machines are their inherent abilities to sustain concurrent processes and to maintain efficient information storage. A detailed simulation of a language machine in its architectural style is presented.
