Multisensory response enhancement (MRE) is the augmentation of the response of a neuron to sensory input of one modality by simultaneous input from another modality. The maximum likelihood (ML) model presented here modifies the Bayesian model for MRE (Anastasio et al.) by incorporating a decision strategy to maximize the number of correct decisions. Thus the ML model can also deal with the important tasks of stimulus discrimination and identification in the presence of incongruent visual and auditory cues. It accounts for the inverse effectiveness observed in neurophysiological recording data, and it predicts a functional relation between uni- and bimodal levels of discriminability that is testable both in neurophysiological and behavioral experiments.
