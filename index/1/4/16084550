The Trellis programming environment supports programming in Trellis/Owl, an object-based language with multiple inheritance and compile-time type-checking. Trellis is composed of a number of integrated tools that share a common programming environment database. It is a highly interactive, easy-to-use programming environment, providing various programming aids, incremental compilation, and good debugging support. Trellis is both integrated and open-ended.
Trellis was specifically designed to support the object-oriented programming methodology. Thus it provides tools to manage the use of types and inheritance. Trellis takes advantage of the strong-typing features of the Trellis/Owl language to provide more support for the programmer by keeping track of cross-references and inconsistencies in code.
