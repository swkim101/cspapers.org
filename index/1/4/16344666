A model for learning systems is presented, and representative AI, pattern recognition, and control systems are discussed in terms of its framework. The model details the functional components felt to be essential for any learning system, independent of the techniques used for its construction, and the specific environment in which it operates. These components are Performance element, instance selector, critic, earning element, blackboard, and world model. Consideration of learning system design leads naturally to the concept of a layered system, each layer operating at a different level of abstraction.
