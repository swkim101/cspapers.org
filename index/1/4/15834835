In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel content-driven crowd discovery algorithm that can efficiently identify newly-formed communities of users from the real-time web. Short-lived crowds reflect the real-time interests of their constituents and provide a foundation for user-focused web monitoring. Three of the salient features of the algorithm are its: (i) prefix-tree based locality-sensitive hashing approach for discovering crowds from high-volume rapidly-evolving social media; (ii) efficient user profile updating for incorporating new user activities and fading older ones; and (iii) key dimension identification, so that crowd detection can be focused on the most active portions of the real-time web. Through extensive experimental study, we find significantly more efficient crowd discovery as compared to both a k-means clustering-based approach and a MapReduce-based implementation, while maintaining high-quality crowds as compared to an offline approach. Additionally, we find that expert crowds tend to be "stickier" and last longer in comparison to crowds of typical users.
