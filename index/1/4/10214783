Within the R&D organizational structure of the Ericsson Group, Ericsson Lab Italy assumes the shape of Global Product Centre with specific technological development responsibility. Though co-ordinated at Group level, Ericsson Lab Italy performs a main role in the activity of identification, definition, and development of new products. Studies and projects are carried out independently, under the general co-ordination of Ericsson Corporate, in the areas of its own responsibility or in co-operation with the R&D centres of other countries.
