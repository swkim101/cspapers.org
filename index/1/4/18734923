Software flaws are a root cause of many of today's information security vulnerabilities. Current curricula emphasis on traditional information security issues does not address this root cause. We propose educating students on secure programming techniques through interactive tool support in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We believe this approach can complement other curricula efforts by teaching and providing continuous reinforcement of practices throughout programming tasks. In this paper, we evaluate our prototype tool, ASIDE, which provides instant security warnings, detailed explanations of vulnerabilities, and code generation. We report the results of an observational study on 20 students from an advanced Web programming course. The results provide early evidence that our tool could potentially help students learn about and practice secure programming in the context of their programming assignments.
