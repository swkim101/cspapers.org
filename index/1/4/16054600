In this paper, we briefly describe an interactive roulette game enabled over a wireless sensor network platform. It basically consists in a train speeding in one way (the spinning roulette) and in a message hopping along some deployed sensors in the other way (the wheeling ball). This demonstration aims at illustrating in an interactive manner the high radio channel randomness in dense wireless sensor networks, as well as its impact on the communication protocols.
