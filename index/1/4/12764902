Brick and Mortar stores have been facing unrelenting competition from online retailers. An enhanced shopping experience is often perceived as a decisive factor in regaining market share, aiming at novel multi-channel online and offline sales strategies. Technologies aimed at this goal, promote interaction, personalization and reaction measurement based on Internet of Things and networked display technologies.

This paper proposes an integrated approach for cost-effective development of innovative in-shop-experience applications leveraging the Internet of Things, HTML5 and Pervasive Display Networks.
