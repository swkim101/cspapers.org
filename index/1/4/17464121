Early speech retrieval experiments focused on news broadcasts, for which adequate Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) accuracy could be obtained. Like newspapers, news broadcasts are a manually selected and arranged set of stories. Evaluation designs reflected that, using known story boundaries as a basis for evaluation. Substantial advances in ASR accuracy now make it possible to build search systems for some types of spontaneous conversational speech, but present evaluation designs continue to rely on known topic boundaries that are no longer well matched to the nature of the materials. We propose a new class of measures for speech retrieval based on manual annotation of points at which a user with specific topical interests would wish replay to begin.
