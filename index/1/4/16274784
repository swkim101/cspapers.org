The 4th workshop on Context Systems Design, Evaluation and Optimization (CoSDEO2013) was organised in conjunction with Ubicomp 2013 in Zurich. This year, the theme of the workshop was on 'Device-Free Radio-Based Recognition'. We discuss recent advances in this field, introduce the workshop and summarise the contributions of the accepted submissions. From the submissions, we observe that the field is evolving from the recognition of locations of subjects to the recognition of activities from subjects. At the same time, the systems presented have grown more complex compared to recent years. Authors consider multiple subjects simultaneously, multiple frequencies and multiple antennas or receive devices.
