This paper introduces aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) as a powerful, model-based design technique to assess the security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Particularly in safety-critical CPS such as automotive control systems, the protection against malicious design and interaction faults is paramount to guaranteeing correctness and reliable operation. Essentially, attack models are associated with the CPS in an aspect-oriented manner to evaluate the system under attack. This modeling technique requires minimal changes to the model of the CPS. Using application-specific metrics, the designer can gain insights into the behavior of the CPS under attack.
