Top-k recommendation seeks to deliver a personalized recommendation list of k items to a user. The dual objectives are (1) accuracy in identifying the items a user is likely to prefer, and (2) efficiency in constructing the recommendation list in real time. One direction towards retrieval efficiency is to formulate retrieval as approximate k nearest neighbor (kNN) search aided by indexing schemes, such as locality-sensitive hashing, spatial trees, and inverted index. These schemes, applied on the output representations of recommendation algorithms, speed up the retrieval process by automatically discarding a large number of potentially irrelevant items when given a user query vector. However, many previous recommendation algorithms produce representations that may not necessarily align well with the structural properties of these indexing schemes, eventually resulting in a significant loss of accuracy post-indexing. In this paper, we introduce Indexable Bayesian Personalized Ranking (IBPR) that learns from ordinal preference to produce representation that is inherently compatible with the aforesaid indices. Experiments on publicly available datasets show superior performance of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art methods on top-k recommendation retrieval task, achieving significant speedup while maintaining high accuracy.
