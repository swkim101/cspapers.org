This paper proposes the design of a vision-guided control law for microrobotic-assisted biomedical applications. More precisely, the developed control law is to servo an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system in real-time to carry out repetitive optical biopsy tasks. The OCT images are simultaneously used to perform the optical biopsy and to control the sample holder (microrobotic work-flow). Instead of extracting visual features from the OCT images, the vision-based controller uses the concept of frequency domain information to compute relative motion between two successive OCT B-scan (cross-section) images. Therefore, the visual controller is designed to minimize the error between current and desired images by controlling the microrobotic platform. The proposed approach was experimentally validated, demonstrating more than satisfactory results especially in terms of accuracy, convergence, and robustness.
