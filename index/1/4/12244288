In response to the lack of diversity in computing fields and associated lack of access to computing courses, an NSF-funded computing intervention was developed and implemented within the SMASH Academy for underrepresented high school students. Previous research indicated short-term impact of the intervention on computing interest and knowledge. This pilot data explores the longitudinal impact of this intervention and whether it influences the pursuit of computing majors in college. Using data from students who participated in SMASH in high school and are currently pursuing computing majors in college, descriptive comparative data suggest there has been a longitudinal increase in pursuit of computing associated with the intervention. This poster will also provide qualitative data and narratives to further explore whether students attribute their choice of major to the intervention, and therefore, whether these increases can be attributed to the intervention. In addition, this poster will also contain open questions to engage and stimulate the audience in discussion about ideas for additional analyses or variables to explore to examine longitudinal impact.
