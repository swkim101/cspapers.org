Computing the minimum distance between two models in a virtual scene is a fundamental operation useful in simulation, path planning, haptics, and modeling. In an environment with heterogeneous model representations, distance functions can be difficult to formulate and may require multiple specialized methods. In this paper, we demonstrate a generalized method for finding the distance between models with different representations and demonstrate it on a variety of models.
