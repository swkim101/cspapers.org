In contrast to machine models like Turing machines or random access machines, circuits are a rigid computational model. The internal information flow of a computation is fixed in advance, independent of the actual input. Therefore, in complexity theory only worst case complexity measures have been used to analyse this model. Concerning the circuit size this seems to be the best one can do. The delay between feeding the input bits into a circuit and being able to read off the output bits at the output gates is usually measured by the depth of the circuit. One might try to take advantage of favorable cases in which the output values are obtained much earlier. This will be the case when critical paths, e.g. paths between input and output gates of maximal length, have no influence on the final output. Inspired by recent successful attempts to develop a meaningful average case analysis for TM computations [Levi86, Gure91, BCGL92, ReSc93a], we follow the same goal for the circuit model. For this purpose, a new com-lexity measure for the internal delay is defined, called time. This may be given implicitly or explicitly, where in the latter case a gate has to signal that it is “ready”, e.g. has computed the desired result. Using a simple coding both models are shown to be equivalent. By doubling the number of gates any circuit with implicit timing can easily be transformed to an equivalent circuit with explicit time signals. Based on the notion of time, two average case measures for the circuit delay are defined. The analysis is not restricted to uniform distributions over the input space,
