YouTube4Two is an application that exploits the YouTube media library (through its API) to demonstrate a new style of social interaction. Two co-present people can share a video and act autonomously to navigate the related-video and comment lists, and search for videos. The novelty is that they can use their own smartphones connected via Internet to control the shared application. The application has been designed according to the responsive-web-design (RWD) principle to smoothly pass from desktop interface (controlled by mouse and keyboard) to smartphone interface (with touch control). YouTube4Two introduces the multi-device responsive Web design (MD-RWD) style that extends the RWD style by introducing the separation between displayed content (on a shared screen) and displayed control commands (on personal smartphones) to support shared control over an application.
