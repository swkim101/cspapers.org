This article is proposing a grasp recognition and grasp mapping method for a land mine clearance master-slave system. The system consists of a data glove and a powerful hydraulic hand. Because of the different structure of the master and slave hand a mapping from master grasp to slave grasp has to be implemented. The paper presents a grasp recognition method by neural network (NN) and a mapping method. The introduced mapping method allows the operator more intuitive grasping.
