One of the most attractive properties of the active chart parsing methodology (Kay 1980; Thompson and Ritchie 1983) is the distinction it makes possible between essential bookkeeping mechanisms, scheduling issues, and details of grammatical formalisms. MCHART is a framework within which active chart parsing systems can be constructed. It provides the essential bookkeeping mechanisms, and carefully structured interfaces for the specification of scheduling and grammatical formalism. The resulting flexibility makes it useful both for pedagogical purposes and for quick prototyping. The system is available in UCILISP, FranzLisp, and Interlisp versions, together with a simple lexicon facility, example parsers and detailed documentation.
