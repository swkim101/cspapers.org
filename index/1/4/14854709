One of current big challenges in computer science is
development of data management and retrieval techniques that
would keep pace with the evolution of contemporary data and
with the growing expectations on data processing. Various
digital images became a common part of both public and
enterprise data collections and there is a natural requirement
that the retrieval should consider more the actual visual
content of the image data. In our demonstration, we aim at the
task of retrieving images that are visually and semantically
similar to a given example image; the system should be able to
online evaluate k nearest neighbor queries within a collection
containing tens of millions of images. The applicability of
such a system would be, for instance, on stock photography
sites, in e-shops searching in product photos, or in
collections from a constrained Web image search.
