Special-purpose hardware accelerators for design automation tasks--l1A machines--are real, apparently practical, and comm.ercially available. The migration of DA tools from software to hardware is motivated by the promise of greatly reduced design times coupled with price/performance significantly better than conventional mainframes, minis, or workstations. Early debate on the merits of DA machines focussed on one issue: Can special-purpose DA engines compete with general-purpose computers? Given the recent popularity of simulation engines, and the imminent appearance of DA machines for other tasks, the question seems to have answered itself. What criteria justify mapping a DA tool into hardware? Clearly, design tasks which are on a critical path in the design schedule, which already employ the best known algorithms, which continue to demand more and more CPU resources as problem complexity increases--these are tasks for which DA hardware seems attractive. But there are also cases less clear.
