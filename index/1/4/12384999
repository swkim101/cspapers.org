Many colleges and universities are experiencing the need to offer an introductory computer science course that meets some but perhaps not all the guidelines suggested for a CS 1 course. This course frequently meets institutional general education requirements and must be more than a literacy course.We discuss the implementation of such a course at Hope College. We outline the goals of the course and some novel features of the implementation, including an emphasis on graphics. We give examples of our approach to laboratories. Finally we show how we utilize the World Wide Web as a substitute for a textbook and for course administration.
