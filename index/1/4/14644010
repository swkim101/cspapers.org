This paper presents a tactile sensing system capable of measuring three force components, three torque components and the position of the centroid of the forces applied to a surface linked to an array of force-torque sensors. The paper deals with the design, the calibration, and the testing of a specific configuration of this system, where the surface is connected to an array of piezoresistive MEMs silicon 3-axis force sensors. In this configuration, only the contact position and the force components are estimated. The tests have proven that this sensor satisfies most of the characteristics needed to achieve robotic dexterous manipulation.
