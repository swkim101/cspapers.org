The technology and processes associated with manufacturing have undergone a major change during the past decades. However, what has stayed the same is that availability of the production system and quality of the produced goods play a key role. Both aspects can only be met by adequate monitoring. Monitoring itself should be easily configurable and allow addition, removal and replacement of sensors without interruption of production. Sensors must at least partially be mobile, namely wireless. The research project Multifunk aims at development and prototypical implementation of software and hardware components for monitoring of industrial production processes using model-driven development, a service oriented architecture, network self-organization and wireless components. This paper presents current results achieved in design of the system architecture, implementation of an adequate transport protocol, compliance to standards as well as a prototypical use case.
