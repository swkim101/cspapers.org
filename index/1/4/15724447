Hayabusa spacecraft performed the final descents and touchdowns twice in November 2005. In final descent phase, terrain alignment maneuvers were accomplished to control both altitude and attitude with respect to the surface by using four beams Laser Range Finder onboard. Then Hayabusa spacecraft made dynamic touchdowns the surface of the asteroid by the sampler system to collect samples automatically. This paper presents the terrain alignment maneuver and touchdown scheme. This paper also describes the novel sample horn system and touchdown dynamics. Touchdown tests on the ground are presented. Then the flight results on descent and touchdown dynamics are shown and discussed.
