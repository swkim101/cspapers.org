In the future, vehicles are expected to act more and more autonomously. The transition towards highly automated and autonomous driving will push the safety requirements for in-vehicle networks. Such networks must support isolation between mixed-critical traffic (e.g. critical control and non-critical infotainment) and must be fail-operational. This paper will present new concepts and mechanisms to achieve these goals in Ethernet-based networks. It will cover advanced topics such as software defined networking (SDN) to implement isolation, fault recovery, and controlled degradation, e.g. to maintain (degraded) operation until the driver takes over or to reach a safe stop.
