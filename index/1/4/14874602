The world is unpredictable, and acting intelligently requires anticipating possible consequences of actions that are taken. Assuming that the actions and the world are deterministic, planning can be represented in the classical propositional logic. Introducing nondeterminism (but not probabilities) or several initial states increases the complexity of the planning problem and requires the use of quantified Boolean formulae (QBF). 
 
The currently leading logic-based approaches to conditional planning use explicitly or implicitly a QBF with the prefix ∃∀∃. We present formalizations of the planning problem as QBF which have an asymptotically optimal linear size and the optimal number of quantifier alternations in the prefix: ∃∀ and ∀∃. This is in accordance with the fact that the planning problem (under the restriction to polynomial size plans) is on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, not on the third.
