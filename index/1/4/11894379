We present a levelwise search algorithm for finding subspace clusters in high dimensional data satisfying various properties besides the commonly used minimum density property. A set of such properties are summarized and a user can choose any of these properties. A lattice is built with all the discovered clusters which enables further analysis and discovery of useful knowledge about the clusters and their inter-relationships.
