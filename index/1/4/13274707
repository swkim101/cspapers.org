We prove that the equivalence problem for probabilistic automata is solvable in time O((n1 + n2)4) , where RI and n2 are numbers of states of two given probabilistic automata. This result improves over the best previous upper-bound of coNP. This algorithm has some interesting applications to, for example, the covering and equivalence problems for uninitiated probabilistic automata, the equivalence and containment problems for unambiguous nondeterministic finite automata and the path equivalence problem for nondeterministic finite automata. Using the same technique, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for learning probabilistic automata. Our learning protocol is learning via queries.
