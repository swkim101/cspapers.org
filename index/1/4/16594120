This paper deals with the extraction of multiple models from noisy or outlier-contaminated data. We cast the multi-model fitting problem in terms of set coverage, deriving a simple and effective method that generalizes Ransac to multiple models and deals with intersecting structures and outliers in a straightforward and principled manner, while avoiding the typical shortcomings of sequential approaches and those of clustering. The method compares favorably against the state-of-the-art on simulated and publicly available real data-sets.
