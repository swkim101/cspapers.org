We present a resilient distributed protocol that enables a synchronous algorithm to run on an asynchronous network. The protocol is resilient in the sense that it can continue providing network synchronization in the presence of topological changes in the underlying communication network of a distributed system. These changes are caused by link/node failures and recoveries that occur while running the protocol. In general, the protocol is a useful tool in the design of resilient distributed algorithms as it isolates the algorithm from the characteristics of the communication network.
