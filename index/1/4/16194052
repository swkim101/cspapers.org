Simulations have been used in various areas, yielding good results, but their application to software evolution is still limited. Simulations of software evolution can help people understand the driving forces that shape software evolution, and predict future evolutionary paths. To move towards simulation of software evolution, this research tries to explore possible models to simulate software evolution, and the applicability of different data to parameterize the models. The simulations will both be based on fine-grained code changes obtained by comparing the abstract syntax trees of source code. The use of fine-grain code changes could reveal information about software evolution that is unavailable by other means.
