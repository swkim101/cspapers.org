By utilizing the unique network structure of n-partite heterogeneous graph, we attempt to address the problem of personalized recommendation in a two-layer ranking process with the help of reasonable measure of high and low order relationships and analyzing the representation of userâ€™s preference in the graph. The experiments show that this algorithm can outperform the traditional CF methods and achieve competitive performance compared with many model-based and graph-based recommendation methods, and have better scalability and flexibility.
