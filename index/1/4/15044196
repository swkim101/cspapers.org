Most time series comparison algorithms attempt to discover what the members of a set of time series have in common. We investigate a di erent problem, determining what distinguishes time series in that set from other time series obtained from the same source. In both cases the goal is to identify shared patterns, though in the latter case those patterns must be distinctive as well. An e cient incremental algorithm for identifying distinctive subsequences in multivariate, real-valued time series is described and evaluated with data from two very di erent sources: the response of a set of bandpass lters to human speech and the sensors of a mobile robot.
