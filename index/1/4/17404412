This paper compares six new queue service disciplines that can be implemented at the output queues of switches in a connection-oriented packet switched data network. â€˜Hrese are Vktual Clock, Fair Qtreueing, Delay-Earliest-Due-Date, Jitter-Earliest-Due-Date, Stop-and-Go and Hierarchical Round Robin. We describe their mechanisms, their similarities and differences, and some implementation strategies. In particular, we show why each discipline can or cannot provide bandwidth, delay and delay jitter guarantees. This leads to some interesting conclusions about the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
