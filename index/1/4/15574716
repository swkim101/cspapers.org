The female role models presented to young women are often unusual individuals who have overcome tremendous social and political obstacles to pursue outstanding careers in mathematics and science. We believe that young women presented with these exceptional role models may actually have their self-confidence undermined because they cannot readily identify with them. At the University of Wisconsin-Parkside (UW-Parkside), we are implementing a project that will employ our own upper-level female computer science (CS) students as half of our laboratory staff in a CS laboratory that is maintained and administrated by our CS students. In this laboratory, women will be as much in control as much as their male counterparts. This non-threatening environment, where women play a prominent role, will communicate to our beginning female students that these roles are realistic and obtainable by them in their college life and in the workplace. We plan to offer our introductory CS sequence to area high school students so that high school girls can benefit from this same experience.
