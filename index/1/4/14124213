A rumor is commonly defined as a statement whose true value is unverifiable. Rumors may spread misinformation (false information) or disinformation (deliberately false information) on a network of people. Identifying rumors is crucial in online social media where large amounts of information are easily spread across a large network by sources with unverified authority. In this paper, we address the problem of rumor detection in microblogs and explore the effectiveness of 3 categories of features: content-based, network-based, and microblog-specific memes for correctly identifying rumors. Moreover, we show how these features are also effective in identifying disinformers, users who endorse a rumor and further help it to spread. We perform our experiments on more than 10,000 manually annotated tweets collected from Twitter and show how our retrieval model achieves more than 0.95 in Mean Average Precision (MAP). Finally, we believe that our dataset is the first large-scale dataset on rumor detection. It can open new dimensions in analyzing online misinformation and other aspects of microblog conversations.
