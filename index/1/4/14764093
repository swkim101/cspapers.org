Recent study showed that native twig join algorithms and tree-aware relational framework significantly outperform tree-unaware approaches in evaluating structural relationships in XML twig queries. In this paper, we present an efficient strategy to evaluate high-selective twig queries containing only parent-child relationships in a tree-unaware relational environment. Our scheme is built on top of our S<scp>UCXENT</scp>++ system. We show that by exploiting the encoding scheme of S<scp>UCXENT</scp>++, we can devise efficient strategy for evaluating such twig queries. Extensive performance studies on various data sets and queries show that our approach performs better than a representative tree-unaware approach (G<scp>LOBAL</scp>-O<scp>RDER</scp>) and a state-of-the-art native twig join algorithm (TJF<scp>AST</scp>) on all benchmark queries with the highest observed gain factors being 243 and 95, respectively. Additionally, our approach reduces significantly the performance gap between tree-aware and tree-unaware approaches and even outperforms a tree-aware approach(M<scp>ONET</scp>DB/XQ<scp>UERY</scp>) for certain high-selective twig queries. We also report our insights to the plan choices a relational optimizer made during twig query evaluation by visually characterizing its behavior over the relational selectivity space.
