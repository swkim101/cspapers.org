Outlines key technologies in the approach of the author's research establishment to space robotics. Based on multisensory gripper technology, local on-board sensory feedback, and predictive graphic simulation (with emphasis on sensory simulation) a tele-sensor programming concept is introduced that allows sensor-based teleoperation in spite of large signal delays as well as sensor-based off-line programming following a "learning by showing" concept. A small multisensory robot based on these concepts has flown in space with a ten-day Space Shuttle mission. This robot technology experiment ROTEX was very successful and showed that, with these sensor-based concepts, even present-day space robots can perform different prototype tasks in a variety of operational modes, including automatic (reprogrammable) operation, and on-board teleoperation using human and/or machine intelligence.
