The main topic of this paper is multiple inheritance and conflict resolution methods in Object Oriented Programming. Our aim is to develop sound mechanisms easily understandable to any user. For this purpose, coherent behaviors of conflict resolution methods for multiple inheritance (such as supporting incrementality-monotonicity and stability under link subdivision) are introduced. We present interesting examples in which multiple inheritance known linearization algorithms (such as in CLOS [2] and LOOPS [19]) behave badly. Then we carefully study the conditions (on the inheritance graph) which assure good linearizations. We end with some suggestions for an incremental inheritance algorithm.
