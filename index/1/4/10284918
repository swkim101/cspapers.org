Publishers wish to sandbox third-party advertisements to protect themselves from malicious advertisements. One promising approach, used by ADsafe, Dojo Secure, and Jacaranda, sandboxes advertisements by statically verifying that their JavaScript conforms to a safe subset of the language. These systems blacklist known dangerous properties that would let advertisements escape the sandbox. Unfortunately, this approach does not prevent advertisements from accessing new methods added to the built-in prototype objects by the hosting page. In this paper, we show that onethird of the Alexa US Top 100 web sites would be exploitable by an ADsafe-verified advertisement. We propose an improved statically verified JavaScript subset that whitelists known-safe properties using namespaces. Our approach maintains the expressiveness and performance of static verification while improving security.
