Cross-view recognition that intends to classify samples between different views is an important problem in computer vision. The large discrepancy between different even heterogenous views make this problem quite challenging. To eliminate the complex (maybe even highly nonlinear) view discrepancy for favorable cross-view recognition, we propose a multi-view deep network (MvDN), which seeks for a non-linear discriminant and view-invariant representation shared between multiple views. Specifically, our proposed MvDN network consists of two sub-networks, view-specific sub-network attempting to remove view-specific variations and the following common sub-network attempting to obtain common representation shared by all views. As the objective of MvDN network, the Fisher loss, i.e. the Rayleigh quotient objective, is calculated from the samples of all views so as to guide the learning of the whole network. As a result, the representation from the topmost layers of the MvDN network is robust to view discrepancy, and also discriminative. The experiments of face recognition across pose and face recognition across feature type on three datasets with 13 and 2 views respectively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, especially compared to the typical linear ones.
