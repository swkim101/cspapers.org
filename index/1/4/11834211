Graphical models have been applied to various information retrieval and natural language processing tasks in the recent literature. In this paper, we apply a probabilistic graphical model for answer ranking in question answering. This model estimates the joint probability of correctness of all answer candidates, from which the probability of correctness of an individual candidate can be inferred. The joint prediction model can estimate both the correctness of individual answers as well as their correlations, which enables a list of accurate and comprehensive answers. This model was compared with a logistic regression model which directly estimates the probability of correctness of each individual answer candidate. An extensive set of empirical results based on TREC questions demonstrates the effectiveness of the joint model for answer ranking. Furthermore, we combine the joint model with the logistic regression model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of answer ranking.
