This demo presents Pattern-Miner, an integrated environment for pattern management and mining that deals with the whole lifecycle of patterns, from their generation (using data mining techniques) to their storage and querying, putting also emphasis on the comparison between patterns and meta-mining operations over the extracted patterns. Pattern comparison (comparing results of the data mining process) and meta-mining are high level pattern operations that can be applied in a variety of applications, from database change management to image comparison and retrieval.
