In this paper, an insect-inspired motion detector (Reichardt-model) is applied to visual servo control to ensure the stability of the system with high gain and time delay in its feedback. A Reichardt-based control scheme is compared with a conventional visual servoing approach. As a consequence of the specific velocity dependence of the Reichardt-model, the stability margin of the visual servo control is increased and high overall gains, thus, better performance are achievable. The response of the Reichardt-model in the experiment and the control performance of velocity control approach with the Reichardt-model in the closed loop are investigated. The velocity control model is tested on a 1-DOF linear motor module with different feedback gain and different time delay in the loop. The results of simulation and realtime experiments demonstrate the stabilizing character of the Reichardt-based approach.
