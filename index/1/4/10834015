In this paper a novel multi-modal tactile sensor is presented, featuring a matrix of capacitive pressure sensors, a microphone for acoustic measurements and proximity and ambient light sensor. The sensor is fully embedded and can be easily integrated at mechanical and electrical levels with industrial grippers. Tactile sensing design has been put on the same level of additional requirements, usually overlooked in tactile sensor research, such as the mechanical interface, cable harness and robustness against continuous and repetitive operations, just to name but a few. The performances of the different sensing modalities have been assessed in a test rig for tactile sensors. Experiments have been performed in order to show the capabilities of the sensor for implementing tactile based industrial gripper control and tactile based fabric classification.
