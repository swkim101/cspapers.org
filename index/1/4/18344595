Sentence Clustering is often used as a first step in Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) to find redundant information. All the same there is no gold standard available. This paper describes the creation of a gold standard for sentence clustering from DUC document sets. The procedure of building the gold standard and the guidelines which were given to six human judges are described. The most widely used and promising evaluation measures are presented and discussed.
