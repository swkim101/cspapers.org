The HCI community often operates under the assumption that interactivity enhances the user experience. In this study we are particularly interested in whether interactivity enhances an artistic experience by either promoting or constraining an audience's enjoyment and creative identity. The goal of the study was to test two research questions in an experimental context: 1.) How does interactive art impact user satisfaction, and 2.) How does interactive art shape the self-concept of the user as creative? Participants interacted with the system in the Interaction"(34 pairs) or"No Interaction (37 pairs) condition. Findings reveal that perceptions of interactivity correlate with user satisfaction, but do not influence user identity.
