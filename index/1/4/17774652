Regarding human-machine-interfaces, switches have not changed significantly despite the machines themselves evolving constantly. In this paper, we propose a new method of operability for devices by providing multiple switches dynamically, and users choose the switch that has the functionality that they want to use. Switch++ senses the mental model of the operating sensation of switches against the user's finger gestures and changes the shape of the switch and its affordances accordingly. We design the interface based on the raw data.
