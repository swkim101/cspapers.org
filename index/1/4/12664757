Keypads are commonly used to enter personal identification numbers (PIN) which are intended to authenticate a user based on what they know. A number of those keypads such as ATM inputs and door keypads provide an audio feedback to the user for each button pressed. Such audio feedback are observable from a modest distance. We are looking at quantifying the information leaking from delays between acoustic feedback pulses. Preliminary experiments suggest that by using a Hidden Markov Model, it might be possible to substantially narrow the search space. A subsequent brute force search on the reduced search space could be possible with- out triggering alerts, lockouts or other mechanisms design to thwart plain brute force attempts.
