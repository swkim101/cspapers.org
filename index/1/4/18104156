A core goal for autonomous systems such as that proposed here is automated collaboration in order to perform tasks or share information. The system is always distributed by default and frequently on a large-scale. It can be argued that robustness and economy demand the deployment of a tested autonomic supporting infrastructure whenever possible. Industrial systems middleware is generally modular and adaptive, however it can be demanding of bandwidth and indeed computational resources. Ideally we would like to map cleanly designed real-time resource constrained embedded systems onto autonomic smart-world supporting infrastructures. This paper is an attempt to investigate the peculiarities of node behaviour in such a network. _____________________________________________________________________________
