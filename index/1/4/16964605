Independent mobility is an important aspect of an individual's life and must sometimes be augmented by use of an assistive device such as a wheeled walker or cane following a fall, injury, or functional decline. Physical therapists perform functional gait assessments to gauge the probability of an individual experiencing a fall and often recommend use of a walker, cane, or walking stick to decrease fall risk. Our team has developed a clinical assessment tool centered on a standard walking cane embedded system that can enhance a therapist's observation-based gait assessment with use of additional objective and quantitative data. This system can be utilized to detect timing and speed of cane placement, angular acceleration of the cane, and amounts of weight borne on the cane. This system is designed to assist physical therapists at the basic level in collection of objective data during gait analysis, to facilitate appropriate assistive gait device prescription, to provide patients and therapists feedback during gait training, and to reduce wrist and shoulder injuries with cane usage. However, more importantly, using the plethora of objective data that can be obtained from this cane, automated gait analysis and gait pattern classification can be performed to understand a patient's walking performance.
