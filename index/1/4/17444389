We build on previous work [5] that demonstrated, in simple isolated experiments, how head and neck related events (e.g. swallowing, head motion) can be detected using an unobtrusive, textile capacitive sensor integrated in a collar like neckband. We have now developed a 2nd generation that allows long term recording in real life environments in conjunction with a low power Bluetooth enabled smart phone. It allows the system to move from the detection of individual swallows which is too unreliable for practical applications to an analysis of the statistical distribution of swallow frequency. Such an analysis allows the detection of "nutrition events" such as having lunch or breakfast. It also allows us to see the general level of activity and distinguish between just being absolutely quiet (no motion) and sleeping. The neckband can be useful in a variety of applications such as cognitive disease monitoring and elderly care.
