We consider the task of assigning categories (e.g., howto/cooking, sports/basketball, pet/dogs) to YouTube videos from video and text signals. We show that two complementary views on the data -- from the video and text perspectives -- complement each other and refine predictions. The contributions of the paper are threefold: (1) we show that a text-based classifier trained on imperfect predictions of the weakly supervised video content-based classifier is not redundant; (2) we demonstrate that a simple model which combines the predictions made by the two classifiers outperforms each of them taken independently; (3) we analyse such sources of text information as video title, description, user tags and viewers' comments and show that each of them provides valuable clues to the topic of the video.
