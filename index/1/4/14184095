This paper presents EsdRank, a new technique for improving ranking using external semi-structured data such as controlled vocabularies and knowledge bases. EsdRank treats vocabularies, terms and entities from external data, as objects connecting query and documents. Evidence used to link query to objects, and to rank documents are incorporated as features between query-object and object-document correspondingly. A latent listwise learning to rank algorithm, Latent-ListMLE, models the objects as latent space between query and documents, and learns how to handle all evidence in a unified procedure from document relevance judgments. EsdRank is tested in two scenarios: Using a knowledge base for web search, and using a controlled vocabulary for medical search. Experiments on TREC Web Track and OHSUMED data show significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.
