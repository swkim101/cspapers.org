The abstract machine model is the best one for solving the difficult problem of program transferring, but an evolution in the design of these machines is necessary. After a brief survey of the well-known abstract machines, this paper proposes the design of a more general one to implement portable operating systems. The complex problem of relating this abstract machine to existing computers is discussed and the paper explains how the top-down methodology is an inestimable means to reduce the machine dependence.
