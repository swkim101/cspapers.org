We report on our experience with the implementation of the Real-time Specification for Java (RTSJ) in the DARPA Program Composition for Embedded System (PCES) program. Within the scope of PCES, Purdue University and the Boeing Company collaborated on the development of Ovm, an open source implementation of the RTSJ virtual machine. Ovm was deployed on a ScanEagle Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and successfully flight tested during the PCES Capstone Demonstration.
