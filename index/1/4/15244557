Most of interprocess communications in transaction oriented distributed systems are based on client-server model, in which one process communicates with several processes simultaneously. Datagram service fits this type of communication rather than virtual circuit service. Transaction oriented distributed systems sometimes need to move large data such as a file or a part of database from a machine to other. The reliable delivery is fairly important since an error might cause retransmission of a whole data. In this paper, we propose the efficient mechanism for reliable datagram service, i) the concept of semi-virtual circuit and ii) the simple error detection and recovery algorithm based on our existing transport protocol, UDSTP. We describe implementation details supporting those facilities and performance results.
