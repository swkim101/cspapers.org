This paper addresses a central and critical issue in the development of computer software - its quality. The main thesis of the paper is that computer science faculty, in their design and implementation of curricula, do not devote sufficient attention to teaching their students how to develop high-quality software. As in industry, the most common and popular way of assuring the quality of programs is through software testing. In other words, quality is treated as an afterthought or as postscript in program development. The paper presents and discusses a quality model that can be used to incorporate a wide variety of quality assurance techniques within a curriculum. The model also presents a structured approach for introducing software testing into the educational environment. Finally, there is a discussion of how the model has been implemented using two current software process technologies, the PSP and the TSP.
