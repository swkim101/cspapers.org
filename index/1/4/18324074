This paper considers the motion planning problem that arises when a tethered robot descends and ascends steep obstacle-strewn terrain. This work is motivated by the Axel tethered robotic rover designed to provide access to extreme extra-planetary terrains. Motion planning for this type of rover is very different from traditional planning problems because the tether geometry under high loading must be considered during the planning process. Furthermore, only round-trip paths that avoid tether entanglement are viable solutions to the problem. We present an algorithm for tethered robot motion planning on steep terrain that reduces the likelihood that the tether will become entangled during descent and ascent of steep slopes. The algorithm builds upon the notion of the shortest homotopic tether path and its associated sleeve. We provide a simple example for purposes of illustration.
