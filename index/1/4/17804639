The realization of a prototype for a novel band-selective personal exposure assessment system is presented. The new system combines three features that are crucial for Non-Ionising-Radiation (NIR) monitoring, namely the measurement of power levels of selected near field sources, e.g. internal Wi-Fi module, field levels of far field sources and global position measurements. For this, it uses the features of a common smartphone by an additional software application and an external exposimeter module. The system can be either used for environmental monitoring of field levels or used in future epidemiological studies. Such an approach has the potential for huge NIR studies, featuring representative results with a higher measurement accuracy and an increased functionality compared to current systems.
