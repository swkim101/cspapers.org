Tiling is a crucial loop transformation for generating high performance code on modern architectures. Efficient generation of multi-level tiled code is essential for maximizing data reuse in systems with deep memory hierarchies. Tiled loops with parametric tile sizes (not compile-time constants) facilitate runtime feedback and dynamic optimizations used in iterative compilation and automatic tuning. Previous parametric multi-level tiling approaches have been restricted to perfectly nested loops, where all assignment statements are contained inside the innermost loop of a loop nest. Previous solutions to tiling for imperfect loop nests have only handled fixed tile sizes. In this paper, we present an approach to parametric multi-level tiling of imperfectly nested loops. The tiling technique generates loops that iterate over full rectangular tiles, making them amenable to compiler optimizations such as register tiling. Experimental results using a number of computational benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed tiling approach.
