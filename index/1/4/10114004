In the design and production of large missile and space systems, one of the largest tasks is the creating of drawings and the maintaining of drawings at any given revision level. The management teams of present aerospace systems are discovering that the job of up-dating drawings and at the same time creating new ones is consuming a disproportionate amount of time and money.
 The problem of maintaining drawings up to the most recent revisions can be solved with in an automatic change control system. This paper will discuss the following topics: a. The change control system requirements, b. The organization of drawing data into drawing files, c. The routines for realizing the change control requirements, d. The system incorporating these routines in their logical sequence.
