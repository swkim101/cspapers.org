Routing events impact multiple paths in the Internet, but current active topology mapping techniques monitor paths independently. Detecting a routing event on one Internet path does not trigger any measurements on other possibly-impacted paths. This approach leads to outdated and inconsistent routing information. We characterize routing events in the Internet and investigate probing strategies to efficiently identify paths impacted by a routing event. Our results indicate that targeted probing can help us quickly remap routing events and maintain more up-to-date and consistent topology maps.
