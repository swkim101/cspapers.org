A new method of locating partially visible two-dimensional objects has been designed. The method is applicable to complex industrial parts that may contain several occurrences of local features such as holes and corners. The matching process is robust, because it bases its decisions on groups of mutually consistent features, and it is relatively fast, because it concentrates on key features that are automatically selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of CAD type of models of the objects.
