Conical queries are a novel type of query with an increasing number of applications. Traditional index structures and retrieval mechanisms, in general, have been optimized for rectangular and circular queries, rather than conical queries. In this paper, we focus on conical queries which can be defined as a multi-dimensional cone in a multi-dimensional data space. We develop a model for expressing such queries and suggest efficient techniques for evaluating them. In particular, we explore the retrieval problem in the context of conical query processing and develop multi-disk allocation methods specifically for processing conical queries.
