The method for automatic selection of wireless interface on smart phones is presented. We consider the selection between WiFi and LTE / 3G radios to maximize the throughput of the data transmission and minimize the amount of energy used to scan and measure the throughput of the network. The proposed selection algorithm defines when to measure and how to estimate the network throughput to balance between the accuracy of the selection and the battery drain caused by the measurements. The link speed estimation method optimized for LTE and WiFi networks is also demonstrated
