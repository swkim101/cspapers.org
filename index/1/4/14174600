A model of a multidatabase system is defined in which each local DBMS uses the two-phase locking protocol Locks are released by a global transaction only after the transaction commits or aborts at each local site. Failures may occur during the processing of transactions. We design a fault tolerant transaction management algorithm and recovery procedures that retain global database consistency. We also show that our algorithms ensure freedom from global deadlocks of any kind.
