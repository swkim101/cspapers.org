The contribution deals with a self-tuning controllers library designed under MATLAB-Simulink environment. The library enables design and verification of two input-two output (TITO) discrete self-tuning controllers. It is a completely open system based on Simulink features. The controllers are implemented as encapsulated Simulink blocks and that enables their simple incorporation into existing Simulink schemes. Design of the TITO controllers that are included into the library is based on polynomial methods. The controllers are based on various configurations of the closed loop system. Several decoupling compensators are also applied. The main idea of self-tuning controllers is discussed. In this paper, several examples are also presented. The possibility of developing real-time applications using MATLAB real-time workshop is discussed
