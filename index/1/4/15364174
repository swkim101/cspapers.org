This paper is part of a comprehensive effort intended to apply modern software engineering and computer security concepts to the requirements specification and designof a family of Military Message Systems (MMS). Each family member is tailored to a particular application and thus may have features or restrictions not required of other family members. Several steps already taken in specifying the requirements of the familyare describedin Section2. The goal of this paper is to apply the security assertions proposed by Landwehr [1] to the MMS Intermediate Command Language [3]. This requires careful examination of the assertions and, if necessary, their modification so as to enable them to be applied to the ICL. In [3], several data types are associatated with the MMS family. For each data type, we identify policy decisions that must be made for each individual family member.
