This paper presents the semantic annotation process of a corpus of spoken conversation transcriptions recorded in the Paris transport authority call-centre. The semantic model used is a FrameNet model developed for the French language. The methodology proposed for the rapid annotation of this corpus is a semi-supervised process where syntactic dependency annotations are used in conjunction with a semantic lexicon in order to generate frame candidates for each turn of a conversation. This ﬁrst hypotheses generation is followed by a rule-based decision module in charge of ﬁltering and removing ambiguities in the frames generated. These rules are very speciﬁc, they don’t need to generalize to other examples as the ﬁnal goal of this study is limited to the annotation of this given corpus, on which a statistical frame parser will ﬁnally be trained. This paper describes this methodology and give examples of annotations obtained. A ﬁrst evaluation of the quality of the corpus obtained is also given on a small gold corpus manually labeled.
