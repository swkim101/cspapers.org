This paper demonstrates machine learning and data mining methods that can be developed and applied to analyzing large quantities of genomic information and gene expression data for characterizing and modeling gene expression regulation. In particular, there will be a discussion on some of the methods that have been developed for modeling gene expression regulation underlying abiotic stress (e.g., drought, low temperature and salinity) tolerance, for identifying gene responsive to particular environmental stress conditions, and for characterizing the functions of microRNA genes for stress regulation in model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
