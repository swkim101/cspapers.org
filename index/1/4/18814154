This paper addresses bird song analysis based on semi-automatic annotation. Research in animal behavior, especially with birds, would be aided by automated (or semiautomated) systems that can localize sounds, measure their timing, and identify their source. This is difficult to achieve in real environments where several birds may be singing from different locations and at the same time. Analysis of recordings from the wild has in the past typically required manual annotation. Such annotation is not always accurate or even consistent, as it may vary both within or between observers. Here we propose a system that uses automated methods from robot audition, including sound source detection, localization, separation and identification. In robot audition these technologies have typically been studied separately; combining them often leads to poor performance in real-time application from the wild. We suggest that integration is aided by placing a primary focus on spatial cues, then combining other features within a Bayesian framework. A second problem has been that supervised machine learning methods typically requires a pre-trained model that may require a large training set of annotated labels. We have employed a semi-automatic annotation approach that requires much less pre-annotation. Preliminary experiments with recordings of bird songs from the wild revealed that for identification accuracy our system outperformed a method based on conventional robot audition.
