We describe Hidden Semi-Markov Support Vector Machines (SHM SVMs), an extension of HM SVMs to semi-Markov chains. This allows us to predict segmentations of sequences based on segment-based features measuring properties such as the length of the segment. We propose a novel technique to partition the problem into sub-problems. The independently obtained partial solutions can then be recombined in an efficient way, which allows us to solve label sequence learning problems with several thousands of labeled sequences. We have tested our algorithm for predicting gene structures, an important problem in computational biology. Results on a well-known model organism illustrate the great potential of SHM SVMs in computational biology.
