This paper describes the results of an evaluation of vehicle power network modeling using Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI). FMI, developed by the Modelica Association, is a tool-independent standard for a model interface. This study compared simulation results between the vehicle power network model with Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) connected and the model without FMUs. Conversion adaptors were inserted to generate and connect each FMU because it was necessary to convert physical connections from acausal connections to causal inputs and outputs. Using FMI for Model Exchange, it was confirmed that the results for both simulations showed good matches, without any time delays although algebraic loops which would often occur in electrical circuit modeling were included. This method possesses significant potential to reduce the validation effort using models created by other departments or suppliers.
