Seizing and retaining student interest in programming is a difficult task. Many students find programming to be a dry and tedious task doable only by students gifted with strong analytical skills. Teaching introductory programming via creative writing begins by connecting the planning, organizing, and detailing of writing a story to the programming process. Creative concepts are taught first and then connected to an equivalent programming concept. Group-oriented activities using art, "Mad-Libs"", "Potato Heads"", and "Legos"" allow students to actively make the connections among the creative concepts, analytical concepts, and programming skills. Students work in pairs. Student pairings are assigned by matching a student with analytical tendencies with a student majoring in one of the humanities disciplines. The pairs apply the concepts and skills by creating stories, designing an animation, and implementing the animation using the Alice programming system. This research recognizes the creative nature of programming, invites students who would not consider studying programming to potentially identify an unrecognized talent, and attempts to develop a new approach for teaching introductory programming. This research and teaching is sponsored by a NSF Grant [11].
