Context-aware interaction is an important topic in ubiquitous computing field. One of the critical problems is how to match the user expectation and the system feedbacks on context. Context is always dependent on user activity. In order to understand user activity and related context information in a clear and structural way, a comprehensive user activity model and a context model are being built based on activity theory. A design method will be proposed and expected to direct the design process of mobile context-aware interaction. A mobile shopping assistant is going to be designed and evaluated as a case study to improve the design method of mobile context-aware interaction.
