Multi-channel optical networks, although common in telecommunication applications, have only recently found application in computer systems. Multi-channel optical networks offer the potential for high performance interconnects for both local computer networks and multiprocessor systems. In addition to providing high bandwidth, multichannel optical networks exhibit the capability for scalable broadcast. The absence of scalable broadcast in conventional networks has governed the choice of memory system configuration for many systems, and has in particular favored cache-coherent non-uniform memory access (CCNUMA) over cache-only memory access (COMA) architecture. Thk paper examines the choice of memory system architecture in the presence of high bandwidth and scalable broadcast. Using simulation, we compare the performance of CC-NUMA and COMA memory architectures in a multi-channel optical network multiprocessor system. Seven well-known parallel benchmarks are used in the study, Our results indicate that COMA consistently and significantly outperforms CC-NUMA in systems that support scalable broadcast, and confirm previous results, that in the absence of broadcast, CC-NUMA outperforms COMA for those applications exhibiting significant sharing.
