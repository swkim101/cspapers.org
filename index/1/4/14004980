This paper describes an ontology for inland water features built using formal concept analysis and supervaluation semantics. The first is used to generate a complete lattice of the water domain, whereas supervaluation semantics is used to model the variability of the concepts in terms of threshold parameters. We also present an algorithm for a mechanism of individuation and classification of water features, from snapshots of river networks, according to the proposed ontology.
