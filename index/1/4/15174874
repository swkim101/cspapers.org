Over the past couple of years, Netflix has significantly expanded its online streaming offerings, which now encompass multiple delivery platforms and thousands of titles available for instant view. This paper documents the design and development of an outage detection system for the online services provided by Netflix. Unlike other internal quality-control measures used at Netflix, this system uses only publicly available information: the tweets, or Twitter posts, that mention the word "Netflix," and has been developed and deployed externally, on servers independent of the Netflix infrastructure. This paper discussed the system and provides assessment of the accuracy of its real-time detection and alert mechanisms.
