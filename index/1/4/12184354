This video shows the investigation of a novel minimalistic, dynamic climbing robot which can climb up tubes of different shapes using a simple dc motor. The motor moves an eccentric mass in a constant velocity. The location of the eccentric mass relative to the contact point determines the stability and the direction of the climbing motion. We present the analysis of this mechanism, simulation and experimental results.
