This paper investigates the impact of layers of quizzing on student performance on subsequent tests and the final exam. The first layer of quizzes are on-line "pre-quizzes" designed to prepare students for follow-on classroom discussions. The second layer quizzes are short "post-quizzes" that are given during class time after discussing questions about the material covered by pre-quizzes. A study involving fifteen semesters of data and 348 students indicated that students performed better on tests and the final exam with this quizzing strategy compared to a more traditional homework based approach. These results agree with the body of research that indicates that testing enhances learning. Significantly, we found an 8 point pass rate increase on the Computer Systems I final exam and a 10 point pass rate increase on the Systems II final.
