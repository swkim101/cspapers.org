Lab activity is fundamental for the real understanding of several computer science topics such as operating systems. We have built our own hardware emulator after using software tools from other Universities for several years. MPS is a general-purpose computer system simulator based on MIPS R3000 processor. Together with the main processor, RAM, ROM, disks, tapes, printer and terminal interfaces are carefully emulated and fully configurable; non-volatile memory units may be retained between simulations.MPS features a full-fledged graphic user interface running under X Window, complete sources and documentation. Along with it we present TINA, an experimental project on operating system development, together with several other project proposals.
