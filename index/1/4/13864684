Cultural heritage (CH) resources are very heterogeneous since the information was collected from vast diversity of cultural sites and digitally recorded in different formats. With the progress of 3D technologies, photogrammetry techniques become the adopted solution for representing CH artifacts by turning photos from small finds, to entire landscapes, into accurate 3D models. To meet knowledge representation with cultural heritage photogrammetry, this paper proposes an ontology-profiling method for modeling a real case of archaeological amphorae. The ontological profile consists of all needed information to represent a CH resource including typology attributes, geo-spatial information and photogrammetry process. An example illustrating the applicability of this profiling method to the problem of CH resources conceptualization is presented. We also outline our perspectives for using ontologies in data-driven science, in particular on modeling a complete pipeline that manages both the photogrammetric process and the archaeological knowledge.
