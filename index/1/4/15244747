Geographical context is very important for images. Millions of images on the Web have been already assigned latitude and longitude information. Due to the rapid proliferation of such images with geographical context, it is still difficult to effectively search and browse them, since we do not have ways to decide their relevance. In this paper, we focus on the geographical relevance of images, which is defined as to what extent the main objects in an image match landmarks at the location where the image was taken. Recently, researchers have proposed to use game based approaches to label large scale data such as Web images. However, previous works have not shown the quality of collected game logs in detail and how the logs can improve existing applications. To answer these questions, we design and implement a Web-based and multi-player game to collect human knowledge while people are enjoying the game. Then we thoroughly analyze the game logs obtained during a three week study with 147 participants and propose methods to determine the image geographical relevance. In addition, we conduct an experiment to compare our methods with a commercial search engine. Experimental results show that our methods dramatically improve image search relevance. Furthermore, we show that we can derive geographically relevant objects and their salient portion in images, which is valuable for a number of applications such as image location recognition.
