Large amounts of data often require expensive and time-consuming analysis. Therefore, highly scalable and efficient techniques are necessary to process, analyze and discover useful information. Database sampling has proven to be a powerful method to surpass these limitations. Using only a sample of the original large database brings the benefit of obtaining useful information faster, at the potential expense of lower accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate \vfds, a novel fast database sampling system that maintains the referential integrity of the data. The system is developed over the open-source database management system, MySQL. We present various scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness of VFDS in approximate query answering, sample size, and execution time, on both real and synthetic databases.
