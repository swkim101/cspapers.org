This paper describes an automobile with artificial intelligence, which consists of a road pattern recognition unit and a problem solving unit. The vehicle is completely autonomous and can be driven without a human driver. The road pattern recognition unit involving a pair of TV cameras and a processing unit identifies obstacles in front of the vehicle and outputs data regarding to the locations of the obstacles. The problem solving unit is a microcomputer system and determines control optimal to the environment around the vehicle based on the data. The algorithm employed in it is a table-look-up method, in which the location of the optimal control is addressed in the table by key words generated from the data. The table was heuristically made by means of digital simulation. The vehicle was successfully driven under various road environments at the speed within 30 Km/h.
