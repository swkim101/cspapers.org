A distributed software system's deployment architecture can have a significant impact on the system's availability, which depends on various system parameters, such as network bandwidth, frequencies of software component interactions , and so on. Existing system deployment tools lack support for monitoring, visualizing, and analyzing different factors that influence availability. They also lack support for modifying a running system's deployment to improve its availability. In this paper, we present an approach for runt-ime assessment of relevant system parameters, their visual-ization, and estimation and effecting of deployment architectures for large-scale, highly distributed systems.
