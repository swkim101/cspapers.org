Standards bodies have begun the task of defining the ubiquitous Personal Communications System (PCS). Among its many attributes will be the provision for security, both for its user and for the service provider. Any viable security plan for PCS will need to address the classic dichotomy whereby the user wants an easy purchase and convenient use of his instrument, while the service provider wants to ensure that his access control prevents fraud. Two digital radiotelephone systems have already gone through the standards-setting process. GSM is currently operating in Europe, and worldwide sales are increasing. In the United States, U.S. Digital Cellular (USDC) has fielded early equipment after standards became approved.
