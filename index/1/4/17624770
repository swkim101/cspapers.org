Clustering graph data has gained much attention in recent years, as data represented as graphs is ubiquitous in today's applications. For many applications, besides the mere graph data also further information about the vertices of a graph is available, which can be represented as attribute vectors. Recently, combined clustering approaches were introduced, which consider graph information and attribute vectors simultaneously for clustering. The visualization of clustering results can help users to get a better understanding of the results. In this paper, we introduce the GC-Viz system, which is implemented as a plugin for the Gephi platform. GC-Viz allows the user to test the combined clustering methods GAMer and DB-CSC on their data and to visualize and explore the clustering results. Furthermore, GC-Viz enables the user to visually compare the results of different clustering algorithms on the same dataset.
