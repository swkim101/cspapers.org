Six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) trackers, which were mainly for professional computer applications, are now in demand by everyday consumer applications. With the requirements of consumer electronics in mind, we designed an optical 6-DOF tracker where a few photo-sensors can track the position and orientation of an LED cluster. The operating principle of the tracker is basically source localization by solving an inverse problem. We implemented a prototype system for a TV viewing environment, verified the feasibility of the operating principle, and evaluated the basic performance of the prototype system in terms of accuracy and speed. We also examined its application possibility to different environments, such as a tabletop computer, a tablet computer, and a mobile spatial interaction environment.
