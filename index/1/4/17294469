Previous researches, in the filed of XML databases, have been done to evaluate XML queries with AND-branches. However, as far as we know, very little work has examined the efficient processing of XML queries with NOT-predicates. Also these methods have to process all of the query nodes in the document when dealing with queries with NOT-branch. In this paper, with some modification in TJFast method, we propose a new manner for answering to various NOT-queries. This method processes nodes efficiently, in a way that in the ideal state, we obtain part of the answer after the process of each node, and we don't have any unreasonable processing of each node.
