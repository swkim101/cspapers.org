Many fundamental multi-processor coordination problems can be expressed aa counting problems: processes must, cooperate to assign successive values from a given range, such as addresses in memory or destinations on an interconnection network. Conventional solutions to these problems perform poorly because of synchronization bottlenecks and high memory contention. Motivated by observations on the behavior of sorting networks, we offer a completely new approach to solving such problems. We introduce a new class of networks called counting networks, i.e., networks that can be used to count. We give a counting network construction of depth Iogz n using n log2 n “gates, ” Based on this construction, we provide coordination algorithms that avoid the sequential bottlenecks inherent to former solutions, and have subst ant i all y lower contention. Finally, to show that counting networks are *Carnegie Mellon University. t D&taf Equipment Corporation, Cambridge Research Lab. i MIT Lab. for Computer Science.
