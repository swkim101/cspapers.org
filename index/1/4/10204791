In this paper, we present a solution to the rendezvous problem using a variant of the cyclic pursuit, in which agent i follows agent i +1 modulo Î· and in which agent i follows agent i-1 modulo n. With the variant of the cyclic pursuit, we aim to increase the convergence rate compared to the cyclic pursuit A generalized variant of the proposed strategy is also presented to guide mobile agents to rendezvous at a desired point We provide simulation results to illustrate the key theoretical results.
