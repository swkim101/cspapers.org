This paper describes an experimental work conducted in order to estimate the conditions of applicability of expected perception (EP) based on a scheme for robot sensorimotor coordination. The starting hypothesis is that predictions of incoming sensory data can improve sensorymotor coordination respect to pure feedback loops. This implies that the environment presents a level of predictability, as in realistic environments. An implementation of the EP-based scheme has been realized on a platform composed by the Dexter 8-d.o.f. robotic arm and a color camera, for executing a pushing task in a real-world environment. Its performance, where defined as a combination of the error in the trajectory following and the computational effort, has been compared with that of a feedback-based system executing the same task in the same environmental conditions. The results have been put in relation with the degree of environmental predictability, which was controlled in the experimental trials. The experimental results give support and useful insights for analyzing the applicability of the EP-based scheme.
