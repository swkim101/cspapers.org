Model-based troubleshooting relies on having a representation of devices that can provide pre­ dictions about their behavior based on the ob­ servations that the troubleshooter makes. For complex devices such as digital circuit boards, the cost of the prediction process is a ma­ jor obstacle to practical model-based trouble­ shooting. But increasing the efficiency of mak­ ing predictions usually means sacrificing pre­ cision — thereby sacrificing diagnostie resolu­ tion so it is important to have a represen­ tation that can provide predictions that are derived from cheap observations and that are yet precise enough so that device misbehaviors will be detectable. This paper presents an im­ plemented representation of board-scale digital circuits that emphasizes the importance of ap­ propriate temporal abstractions for coping with behavioral complexity.
