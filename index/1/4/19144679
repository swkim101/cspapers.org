Existing methods usually explore data self-representation strategy, which may hinder the clustering performance in insufficient or corrupted data scenarios. In real-world applications, we are easily accessible to a large amount of related labeled data. To this end, we propose a novel transferable subspace clustering approach by exploring useful information from relevant source data to enhance clustering performance in target temporal data. We manage to transform the original data into a shared low-dimensional and distinctive feature space by jointly seeking an effective domain-invariant projection. In this way, the well-labeled source knowledge can help obtain a more discriminative target representation. Moreover, a graph regularizer is designed to incorporate temporal information to preserve more sequence knowledge into the learned representation. Extensive experiments based on three human motion datasets illustrate that our approach is able to outperform state-of-the-art temporal data clustering methods.
