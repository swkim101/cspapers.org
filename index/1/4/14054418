There has always been a gap of perception between Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and their customers when considering the performance of network service. On one hand, ISPs invest to increase downstream speed of access network infrastructure. On the other hand, users cannot achieve perceived quality of experience (QoE). This paper addresses this problem by introducing a system, Conan, which enables content-aware flow scheduling to improve the QoE of users. Conan exploits to satisfy users' requirements in the access network (LAN), which is the performance bottleneck actually. By leveraging the technique of software defined networking (SDN), Conan are able to specify the expected network capacity for different applications. Automatic application identification is deployed at home gateway to improve the scalability, and flexible bandwidth allocation is realized at LAN for specified applications. Using video streaming service optimization as an example, we demonstrate that our system can automatically allocate bandwidth for video flows.
