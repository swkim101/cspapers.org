An augmented and/or tree representation of logic programs is presented as the basis for an advanced graphical tracing and debugging facility for Prolog. TPM can be run in slow-motion/close-up mode for novices or high-speed/long-distance mode for experts with no attendant conceptual change. Moreover, it deals correctly both with clause head matching and with the cut. The current implementation runs on Apollo workstations, and is written in Prolog.
