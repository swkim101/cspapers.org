Context-aware computing is a key paradigm of ubiquitous computing in which applications automatically adapt their operations to dynamic context data from multiple sources. Managing a number of distributed sources, a middleware that facilitates the development of context-aware applications must provide a uniform view of all these sources to the applications. Local schemas of context data from individual sources need to be matched into a set of global schemas in the middleware, upon which applications can issue context queries to acquire data. In this paper, we study this problem of schema matching for context-aware computing. We propose a multi-criteria algorithm to determine candidate attribute matches between two schemas. The algorithm adaptively adjusts the priorities of different criteria based on previous matching results to improve the efficiency and accuracy of succeeding operations. We further develop an algorithm to categorize a new local schema into one of the global schemas whenever possible via a shared attribute dictionary. Our results based on schemas from real-world websites demonstrate the good matching accuracy achieved by our algorithms.
