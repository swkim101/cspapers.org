We consider the case of heuristic search where the location of the goal may change during the course of the search. For example, the goal may be a target that is actively avoiding the problem solver. We present a moving target search algorithm (MTS) to solve this problem. We prove that if the average speed of the target is slower than that of the problem solver, then the problem solver is guaranteed to eventually reach the target. An implementation with randomly positioned obstacles confirms that the MTS algorithm is highly effective in various situations.
