With the rapid development of E-commerce, recent years have witnessed the booming of online advertising industry, which raises extensive concerns of both academic and business circles. Among all the issues, the task of Click-through rates (CTR) prediction plays a central role, as it may influence the ranking and pricing of online ads. To deal with this task, the Factorization Machines (FM) model is designed for better revealing proper combinations of basic features. However, the sparsity of ads transaction data, i.e., a large proportion of zero elements, may severely disturb the performance of FM models. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Sparse Factorization Machines (SFM) model, in which the Laplace distribution is introduced instead of traditional Gaussian distribution to model the parameters, as Laplace distribution could better fit the sparse data with higher ratio of zero elements. Along this line, it will be beneficial to select the most important features or conjunctions with the proposed SFM model. Furthermore, we develop a distributed implementation of our SFM model on Spark platform to support the prediction task on mass dataset in practice. Comprehensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets clearly validate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our SFM model compared with several state-of-the-art baselines, which also proves our assumption that Laplace distribution could be more suitable to describe the online ads transaction data.
