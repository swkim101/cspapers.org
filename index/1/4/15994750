Every deterministic context-free language can be accepted by a deterministic finite delay pda with jumps. Increasing the number of types or occurrences of jumps increases the family of languages accepted with finite delay. Hence the family of deterministic context-free language is a principal AFDL; there is a context-free language Lo such that every context-free language is an inverse gsm image of Lo or Lo - {e}. A similar result holds for quasirealtime Turing machine languages. Several languages are given such that deterministic and nondeterministic polynomial time acceptance are equivalent if and only if any one of them is deterministic polynomial time acceptable.
