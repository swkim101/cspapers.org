This paper is concerned with the data flow organization of computers and programs, which exhibits a good deal of inherent concurrencies in a computation by imposing no superfluous precedence constraints. In view of the popularity of parallel and distributed processing, this organization can be expected to play an increasingly prominent role in the design and development of computer systems. A schematic diagram called DF-graphs, suitable for modeling data flow computations at the machine language level, is introduced. To facilitate the storage of DF-graphs in computers, matrix equations which fully describe their structure and their dynamic behaviors are developed as an alternate representation. Also demonstrated is the feasibility of simulating the execution of computations specified by DF-graphs on a network of conventional mini- and microprocessors.
