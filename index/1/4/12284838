Exoskeletons offer an intuitive method for actuating multiple DOF of the body; this makes them attractive for applications where generation and coupling of artificial forces to the limbs is needed. Force feedback hand exoskeletons have been continuously considered for whole hand haptic interaction in virtual reality simulators, in teleoperation setups and for rehabilitation. In hand exoskeletons finger tracking, actuation and transmission systems must be embedded in confined spaces, matching at the same time the profound dexterity of the hand transparently and without causing a burden. Most of the design approaches for such systems have remained largely experimental due to hardware limitations, impacting heavily on important functional and ergonomic factors. This paper presents the design of a novel 3-digit hand exoskeleton, which addresses the issues of finger tracking and force feedback. It proposes a new approach for the application of the feedback force with a single attachment at the fingertip through a 6DoF kinematic chain. This kinematic linkage allows for unconstrained reach of the fingers within their full workspace and facilitates a sensor system for high resolution 6DOF tracking of the fingertips. At the same time the highly under-actuated mechanism permits application of a bidirectional feedback force at the fingertips. The hand exoskeleton fits an large range of hand sizes and requires no mechanical alignment between the linkage and the fingers, whatsoever. Preliminary results show the efficacy of this system as a tracking and force feedback device for the hand.
