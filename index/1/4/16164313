In this paper, we investigate training data reduction for the pointing gesture recognition with compressed sensing. The pointing gesture is one of activities during pointing and calling that is carried out by workers to keep occupational safety and correctness. Compressed sensing is used for gesture recognition and considered the impacts of the gesture duration difference among user. However, the different force among users may affect to the recognition. As a result of the experiment, F-measure is improved 0.18 compared with the DTW even only the data obtained from others is used. Moreover, we found that the user-dependency varies for each subject. Therefore, we tested to recognize the pointing gestures of all subjects by using the training data of only specific users. The test showed that the recognition model with training data from 4 specific subjects provided the same accuracy as the one from 11 subjects. This result suggested the feasibility of reduction for subjects who need to acquire the training data.
