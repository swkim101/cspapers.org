Engineering models of human performance permit some aspects of usability of interface designs to be predicted from an analysis of the task, and thus can replace to some extent expensive user testing data. The best developed such tools are GOMS models, which have been shown to be accurate and effective in predicting usability of the procedural aspects of interface designs. This paper describes a computer-based tool, GLEAN, that generates quantitative predictions from a supplied GOMS model and a set of benchmark tasks. GLEAN is demonstrated to reproduce the results of a case study of GOMS model application with considerable time savings over both manual modeling as well as empirical testing.
