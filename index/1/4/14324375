This paper outlines the design and implementation of a software package that supports a laboratorybased, hands-on introduction to parallel programming. More specifically, a language, Concurrent Distributed Pascal (CDP), is described which is an extension of Concurrent Pascal (CoPascal) to support several parallel models, including the distributed MIMD model, where several processors on a network can be used to simuhaneously execute parallel segments of a program. This software is proposed as an ideal support environment for laboratory experimentation, giving students handson experience with this form of pamlIe programming when specialized parallel hardware support is not available.
