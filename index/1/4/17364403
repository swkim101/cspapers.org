This paper presents the Pipeline Bus, a communication network for MIMD systems developed at the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany. It is based on a network switch for synchronously clocked data packets including the node interface and the handling of access control and routing which has been implemented in VLSI. Apart from describing the motivation for des!gning a special communication system, the concept and its implementation in the context of SUPRENUM are discussed. The results of performance measurements are presented.
