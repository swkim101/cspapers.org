This paper looks beyond the video games themselves to the application of AI techniques within the ecosystems that produce them. Electronic Arts (EA) must deal with AI at scale across many game studios as it develops many AAA games each year, and not a single, AI-based, flagship application. EA has adopted a horizontal scaling strategy in response to this challenge and built a platform for delivering AI artifacts anywhere within EA's software universe. By combining a data warehouse for player history, an Agent Store for capturing processes acquired through machine learning, and a recommendation engine as an action layer, EA has been delivering a wide range of AI solutions throughout the company during the last two years. These solutions, such as dynamic difficulty adjustment, in-game content and activity recommendations, matchmaking, and game balancing, have had major impact on engagement, revenue, and development resources within EA.
