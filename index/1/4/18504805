A data management facility has been designed to satisfy the specific needs of design automation, but the principles underlying it appear to be applicable to a variety of other situations. The system handles large amounts of engineering data related to computer systems design. These data are stored on direct-access devices and retained throughout the life of a computer system. Records representing the same information at different times in its history can be retained, as well as information reflecting different versions of the same computing system.
 The facility, which we call the data management system (DMS),1 provides multiple-indexing capabilities. Additional indexes can be added that allow data existing in the system to be retrieved in accordance with a theoretically unlimited variety of logical orderings.
