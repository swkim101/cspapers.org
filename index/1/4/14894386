We present an improvement on an algorithm for generating tables to drive a bottom-up tree pattern matcher. The improved algorithm has time and space requirements roughly comparable to those of LALR parser generators, and orders of magnitude better than those of the unimproved table-generating algorithm. This work may have application to interpreter construction, code generation, optimization and typechecking.
