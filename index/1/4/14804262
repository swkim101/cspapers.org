We present an O*(n3) randomized algorithm for estimating the volume of a well-rounded convex body given by a membership oracle, improving on the previous best complexity of O*(n4). The new algorithmic ingredient is an accelerated cooling schedule where the rate of cooling increases with the temperature. Previously, the known approach for potentially achieving such complexity relied on a positive resolution of the KLS hyperplane conjecture, a central open problem in convex geometry.
