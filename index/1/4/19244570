ISCOOL is an interactive educational platform that helps users develop their skills for objective text analysis and interpretation. The tools incorporated into ISCOOL bridge various disparate sources, including reference datasets for people, and organizations, as well as gazetteers, dictionaries and collections of historical facts. This data serves as the basis for educating learners about the processes of evaluating the implicit and implied content of written material, whilst also providing a wider context in which this information is accessed, interpreted and understood. In the course of gameplay, the user is prompted to choose images that best capture content of a read passage. The interactive features of the game simultaneously test the user's existing knowledge, and ability to critically analyse the text. Results can be saved and shared, allowing the players to continue to interact with the data through conversations with their peers, friends, and family members, and to disseminate information throughout their communities. Users will be able to draw connections between the information they encounter in ISCOOL, and their daily realities - participants are empowered, informed and educated.
