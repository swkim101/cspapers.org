Visual attention is the ability to dynamically restrict processing to a subset of the visual field. Researchers have long argued that such a mechanism is necessary to efficiently perform many intermediate level visual tasks. This paper describes VISIT, a novel neural network model of visual attention. The current system models the search for target objects in scenes containing multiple distractors. This is a natural task for people, it is studied extensively by psychologists, and it requires attention. The network's behavior closely matches the known psychophysical data on visual search and visual attention. VISIT also matches much of the physiological data on attention and provides a novel view of the functionality of a number of visual areas. This paper concentrates on the biological plausibility of the model and its relationship to the primary visual cortex, pulvinar, superior colliculus and posterior parietal areas.
