The highly percipient nature of human mind in avoiding sensory overload is a crucial factor which gives human vision an advantage over machine vision, the latter has otherwise powerful computational resources at its disposal given today's technology. This stresses the need to focus on methods which extract a concise representation of the environment inorder to approach a complex problem such as visual mapping. This article is an attempt of creating a mapping system, which proposes an architecture that combines task-specific and saliency driven approaches. The proposed method is implemented on a warehouse robot. The proposed solution provide a priority framework which enables an industrial robot to build a concise visual representation of the environment. The method is evaluated on data collected by a RGBD sensor mounted on a fork-lift robot and shows promise for addressing visual mapping problems in industrial environments.
