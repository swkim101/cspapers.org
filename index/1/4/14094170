A process for producing unsaturated methyl nonadienoate and methyl nonatrienoate monesters useful as precursors for pelargonic acid which comprises contacting, in a reaction inert medium, butadiene and methyl-2,4-pentadienoate in a molar ratio of 2:1 to 10:1 at a temperature of 40 DEG to 120 DEG C. under an inert atmosphere and in the presence of a catalytic amount of a homogeneous palladium (II) complex of the formula wherein R is alkyl, chloroalkyl, bromoalkyl or fluoroalkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or aryl having 6 to 12 carbon atoms; Q is phosphorous or arsenic and R' is alkyl, aminoalkyl or alkoxy having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or aryl or aryloxy having 6 to 12 carbon atoms. The foregoing precursors may subsequently be hydrogenated to methyl pelargonate (methyl nonanoate) and pelargonic acid may then be obtained by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of methyl pelargonate.
