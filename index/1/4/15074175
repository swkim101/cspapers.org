Some inherent difficuties are present for good exercise and practice in operating systems programming laboratory course. This paper gives a fairly manageable laboratory course plan for programming operating systems (OSs) and a teaching tool which is used in it. The plan enables a prototype operating system as a whole, including the nucleus and multiprogramming mechanism, to be written in high level language. The operating system can run a binary machine program as job program. It is realized through simulation in a common programming environment. Some drawbacks of the plan are discussed and solutions are also given.
