The increasing complexity of modern superscalar microprocessors makes the evaluation of new designs and techniques much more difficult. Fast and accurate methods for simulating program execution on realistic and hypothetical processor models are of great interest to many computer architects and compiler writers. There are many existing techniques, from profile based runtime estimation to complete cycle-level simulations. Many researchers choose to sacrifice the speed of profiling for the accuracy obtainable by cycle-level simulators. This paper presents a technique that provides accurate performance predictions, while avoiding the complexity associated with a complete processor emulator. The approach augments a fast in-order simulator with a time-stamping algorithm that provides a very good estimate of program running time. This algorithm achieves an average accuracy that is within 7.5% of a cycle-level out-of-order simulator in approximately 41% of the running time on the eight SPECInt95 integer benchmarks.
