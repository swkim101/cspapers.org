When interacting with social tagging systems, humans exercise complex processes of categorization that have been the topic of much research in cognitive science. In this paper we present a recommender approach for social tags derived from ALCOVE, a model of human category learning. The basic architecture is a simple three-layers connectionist model. The input layer encodes patterns of semantic features of a user-specific resource, such as latent topics elicited through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or available external categories. The hidden layer categorizes the resource by matching the encoded pattern against already learned exemplar patterns. The latter are composed of unique feature patterns and associated tag distributions. Finally, the output layer samples tags from the associated tag distributions to verbalize the preceding categorization process. We have evaluated this approach on a real-world folksonomy gathered from Wikipedia bookmarks in Delicious. In the experiment our approach outperformed LDA, a well-established algorithm. We attribute this to the fact that our approach processes semantic information (either latent topics or external categories) across the three different layers. With this paper, we demonstrate that a theoretically guided design of algorithms not only holds potential for improving existing recommendation mechanisms, but it also allows us to derive more generalizable insights about how human information interaction on the Web is determined by both semantic and verbal processes.
