Data mining social media has become a valuable resource for infectious disease surveillance. However, there are considerable risks associated with incorrectly predicting an epidemic. The large amount of social media data combined with the small amount of ground truth data and the general dynamics of infectious diseases present unique challenges when evaluating model performance. In this paper, we look at several methods that have been used to assess influenza prevalence using Twitter. We then validate them with tests that are designed to avoid and illustrate issues with the standard k-fold cross validation method. We also find that small modifications to the way that data are partitioned can have major effects on a model's reported performance.
