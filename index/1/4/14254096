Dataflow programming models are well-suited to program many-core streaming applications. However, many streaming applications have a dynamic behavior. To capture this behavior, parametric dataflow models have been introduced over the years. Still, such models do not allow the topology of the dataflow graph to change at runtime, a feature that is also required to program modern streaming applications. To overcome these restrictions, we propose a new model of computation, the Boolean Parametric Data Flow (BPDF) model which combines integer parameters (to express dynamic rates) and boolean parameters (to express the activation and deactivation of communication channels). High dynamism is provided by integer parameters which can change at each basic iteration and boolean parameters which can even change within the iteration. The major challenge with such dynamic models is to guarantee liveness and boundedness. We present static analyses which ensure statically the liveness and the boundedness of BDPF graphs. We also introduce a scheduling methodology to implement our model on highly parallel platforms and demonstrate our approach using a video decoder case study.
