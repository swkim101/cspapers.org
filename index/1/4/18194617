In this paper we present an approach to enhance existing maps with fine grained segmentation categories such as parking spots and sidewalk, as well as the number and location of road lanes. Towards this goal, we propose an efficient approach that is able to estimate these fine grained categories by doing joint inference over both, monocular aerial imagery, as well as ground images taken from a stereo camera pair mounted on top of a car. Important to this is reasoning about the alignment between the two types of imagery, as even when the measurements are taken with sophisticated GPS+IMU systems, this alignment is not sufficiently accurate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a new dataset which enhances KITTI [8] with aerial images taken with a camera mounted on an airplane and flying around the city of Karlsruhe, Germany.
