Logical Sensor Specification (LSS) has been introduced as a convenient means for specifying multi-sensor systems and their implementations. In this paper, we demonstrate how control issues can be handled in the content of LSS. In particular, the Logical Sensor Specification is extended to include a control mechanism which permits control information to (1) flow from more centralized processing to more peripheral processes, and (2) be generated locally in the logical sensor by means of a micro-expert system specific to the interface represented by the given logical sensor Examples are given including a proposed scheme for controlling the Utah/MIT dextrous hand.
