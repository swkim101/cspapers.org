Green computing is a catchall phrase that includes efforts to improve sustainability both within the IT industry and outside of it. The green IT movement seeks to reduce energy use, waste, and toxic substances by the IT industry. In many other industries, mobile and computing devices connected to the network enable sustainability through automation, virtualization, and reduced travel. Green computing is a topic of increasing importance within the IT industry. There are few green computing courses for undergraduates, and most are for advanced students. I present a "CS1 Lite" course centered on the theme of green computing. The course integrates programming activities with readings, discussion and online research. The first course module examined how the Internet and mobile networks enable sustainable practices, such as: the virtualization of goods and services, telecommuting and virtual meetings, and cloud computing. The second module examined the "Green IT" movement, including sustainability across the computer life cycle, and increasing energy efficiency, from individual computers up to data centers. The third module focused on "Smart Technology," where network-connected computing devices drive improvements. Topics included the smart energy grid, smart buildings, and applications in health care and agriculture. Throughout the course, programming assignments were tailored to problems relevant to the green computing topics. Students implemented simulations of green computing systems. Students exhibited increased interest and motivation for these projects, and learned naturally about data abstraction and computer networks.
