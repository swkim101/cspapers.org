2 SEMCOG Approach We argue that image retrieval based on either approach alone is not sufficient in terms of modeling and query specification flexibility y. We also argue that a visual query interface which is capability of visualizing target images is essential. SEMCOG[l] (SEMantics and COGnitionbased image retrieval) aims at integrating semautics and cognition-based approaches to give users a greater flexibility to pose queries. SEMCOG’S image matching is based on objects in the images rather than the whole images. In SEMCOG, a query “Retrieve all images in which there is a man to the right of a car and the man looks like this image” can be posed using combinations of semantics and visual expressions. The queries are posed in the way of specifying image objects and their layouts using a visual query interface, IFQ (In Frame Query), rather than complicated multimedia database query languages. The user’s query can be simplified as a mental model shown at the top of Figure 1. She then specifies her mental model using IFQ using combinations of visual examples or semantics. IFQ window shows a query “Retrieve
