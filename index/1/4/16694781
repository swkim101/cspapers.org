The present paper proposes the motion planning based on “the dynamics shaping” for a robotic arm to hit the target robustly toward the desired direction, of which the concept is to shape the robot dynamics appropriately in order to accomplish the desired motion. According to the linear system theory, the positional error of the end-point converges onto near the singular vector corresponding to its maximum singular value of the output controllability matrix of the robotic arm. Therefore, if we can control the direction of the singular vector by applying the dynamics shaping, we will be able to control the direction of the positional error of the end-effector caused by the disturbance. We propose a novel motion planning based on the dynamics shaping and verify numerically and experimentally that the robotic arm can robustly hit the target toward the desired direction with a simple open-loop control system even though the disturbance is applied.
