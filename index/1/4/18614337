The ERGO team investigated how software engineers manage the complexity of both the system and the task at hand, in particular during the preparation of work. The team found that prior analysis greatly enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of task completion, so much that it can be regarded as a prerequisite. In addition they found that preparation and planning of tasks is very difficult using traditional UNIX-shells. The team used Petri nets to brainstorm, design and communicate specifications for better solutions. The result was a set of well-defined requirements for redesigning user problem solving in UNIX and, in answer to these requirements, ERGO.
