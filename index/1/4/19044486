In today's complex, competitive, and regulated global economy, scientific and commercial organizations alike need to innovate quickly, speed time to results, improve product quality, and reduce risks for their communities and their shareholders. At the same time, organizations face very real limitations in terms of real estate, power, and cooling. Hot and crowded data centers are clogged with legacy servers that are now underpowered and overtaxed. In addition, disjointed additions to clusters and grids have resulted in a complex web of systems that are often difficult and expensive to manage.
