In this paper, we present five models for sentence realisation from a bag-of-words containing minimal syntactic information. It has a large variety of applications ranging from Machine Translation to Dialogue systems. Our models employ simple and efficient techniques based on n-gram Language modeling. 
 
We evaluated the models by comparing the synthesized sentences with reference sentences using the standard BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2001). We obtained higher results (BLEU score of 0.8156) when compared to the state-of-art results. In future, we plan to incorporate our sentence realiser in Machine Translation and observe its effect on the translation accuracies.
