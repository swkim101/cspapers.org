Systems able to find a song based on a sung, hummed, or whistled melody are called Query-By-Humming (QBH) systems. We propose an approach to improve search performance of a QBH system based on data collected from an online social music game, Karaoke Callout. Users of Karaoke Callout generate training data for the search engine, allowing both ongoing personalization of query processing as well as vetting of database keys. Personalization of search engine user models takes place through using sung examples generated in the course of play to optimize parameters of user models.
