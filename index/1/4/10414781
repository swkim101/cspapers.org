Over the years, a number of agile frameworks, such as Extreme Programming and Scrum, have evolved and matured. The underlying philosophy of Scrum recognizes that the customers often change their mind about the product they want and that the development challenges are unpredictable by their nature. Consequently, Scrum embraces the fact that the problem being solved cannot be fully understood or described from the start. Instead, Scrum focuses on maximizing the ability of the development team to quickly deliver in response to emerging requirements.
