Publish/subscribe is becoming increasingly popular as communication paradigm for loosely-coupled message exchange. It is used as a building block in major new software architectures and technology domains such as Enterprise Service Bus, Enterprise Application Integration, Service-Oriented Architecture and Event-Driven Architecture. The growing adoption of these technologies leads to a strong need for benchmarks and performance evaluation tools in this area. In this demonstration, we present jms2009-PS, a benchmark for publish/subscribe middleware based on the Java Message Service standard interface.
