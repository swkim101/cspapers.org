We formalize the interface between such local models as the influence agents can exert on one another; and we prove that this interface is sufficient for decoupling them. The resulting influence-based abstraction substantially generalizes previous work on exploiting weakly-coupled agent interaction structures. Therein lie several important contributions. First, our general formulation sheds new light on the theoretical relationships among previous approaches, and promotes future empirical comparisons that could come by extending them beyond the more specific problem contexts for which they were developed. More importantly, the influence-based approaches that we generalize have shown promising improvements in the scalability of planning for more restrictive models. Thus, our theoretical result here serves as the foundation for practical algorithms that we anticipate will bring similar improvements to more general planning contexts, and also into other domains such as approximate planning, decision-making in adversarial domains, and online learning.
