We significantly improve known time bounds for solving the minimum cut problem on undirected graphs. We use a "semiduality" between minimum cuts and maximum spanning tree packings combined with our previously developed random sampling techniques. We give a random- ized (Monte Carlo) algorithm that finds a minimum cut in an m-edge, n-vertex graph with high probability in O(m log 3 n) time. We also give a simpler randomized algorithm that finds all minimum cuts with high probability in O(n 2 log n) time. This variant has an optimal 51# parallelization. Both
