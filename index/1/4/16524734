We propose, in this paper, a novel class of probabilistic key pre-distribution schemes highly resilient against node capture. We introduce a new approach to enhance resilience by concealing keys through the use of a simple hash chaining mechanism. We provide analytical analysis which shows that our solution enhances the network resilience against node capture without introducing a new overhead comparatively to similar solutions in the literature.
