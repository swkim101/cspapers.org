In this demonstration, we present Ibex, a novel storage engine featuring hybrid, FPGA-accelerated query processing. In Ibex, an FPGA is inserted along the path between the storage devices and the database engine. The FPGA acts as an intelligent storage engine supporting query off-loading from the query engine. Apart from significant performance improvements for many common SQL queries, the demo will show how Ibex reduces data movement, CPU usage, and overall energy consumption in database appliances.
