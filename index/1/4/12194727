Web Page segmentation is a crucial step for many applications in Information Retrieval, such as text classification, de-duplication and full-text search. In this paper we describe a new approach to segment HTML pages, building on methods from Quantitative Linguistics and strategies borrowed from the area of Computer Vision. We utilize the notion of text-density as a measure to identify the individual text segments of a web page, reducing the problem to solving a 1D-partitioning task. The distribution of segment-level text density seems to follow a negative hypergeometric distribution, described by Frumkina's Law. Our extensive evaluation confirms the validity and quality of our approach and its applicability to the Web.
