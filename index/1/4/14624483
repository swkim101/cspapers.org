In this paper, we report on our experience in designing and deliv-ering two new software design courses in the Informatics major at UC Irvine. When the major was created in 2004, it explicitly con-tained slots for two software design courses to be created from the ground up. The authors led this effort, focusing one course on the topic of system design and one course on the topic of implementation design. We discuss the philosophy and pedagogy behind the courses, present key class activities, and reflect on having offered each course twice over the past two years.
