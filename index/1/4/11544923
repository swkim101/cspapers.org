It is difficult to serialize an RDF graph as a humanly readable RDF/XML document. This paper describes the approach taken in Jena 1.2, in which a design pattern of guarded procedures invoked using top down recursive descent is used. Each procedure corresponds to a grammar rule; the guard makes the choice about the applicability of the production. This approach is seen to correspond closely to the design of an LL(k) parser, and a theoretical justification of this correspondence is found in universal algebra.
