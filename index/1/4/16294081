In this paper the code generation for an open environment supporting heterogenous system design is discussed. The approach uses the CASE data interchange format CDIF as a separation layer between modeling tools and backend tools like analysis, simulation and code generation. In detail the structure of a software prototype for rapid prototyping purpose is presented including the dynamic generation of the modeling code for discrete and timeâ€“continuous domains as well as static components for the model execution. Furtheron, we present the results of several examples to get an impression of the execution time and the code size.
