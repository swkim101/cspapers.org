In our days the business, scientific and personal databases are growing in an exponential rate. However, what is truly valuable is the knowledge that can be extracted from the stored data. Knowledge Discovery in patent databases was traditionally based on manual analysis carried out from statistical experts. Nowadays the increasing interest of many actors have led to the development of new tools for discovering and exploiting information related to technological activities and innovation, "hidden" in patent databases. In this paper we present a system that combines efficient and innovative methodologies and tools for the analysis of patent data stored in international databases and the production of scientific and technological indicators.
