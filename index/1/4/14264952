We present a method for automatically acquiring knowledge for case alternation between the passive and active voices in Japanese. By leveraging several linguistic constraints on alternation patterns and lexical case frames obtained from a large Web corpus, our method aligns a case frame in the passive voice to a corresponding case frame in the active voice and finds an alignment between their cases. We then apply the acquired knowledge to a case alternation task and prove its usefulness.
