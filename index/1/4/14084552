Mobile microrobots are typically fabricated in a multi-step microfabrication process and then transported into an enclosed workspace for operation. This paper presents a new, 3D printing inspired method for in-situ fabrication of mobile magnetic microrobots with complex topology from a polymer filament on demand directly inside an enclosed operational environment. Through the use of a tip magnet on the filament, the target shape is formed by magnetic guidance from external electromagnetic coils which wirelessly project fields into the workspace as the filament is fed through a hot needle which is inserted into the workspace. A bending model and a shape planner are developed for predicting and controlling the fabrication process. Magnetically-active millimeter-scale robotic devices of different shapes and sizes are fabricated using polylactic acid (PLA) filament with diameter as small as 50 Î¼m. As a demonstration of the in-situ formation of a functional microrobotic device, a force-sensing microrobot with integrated sensing spring is fabricated inside an enclosed space, and then is used to measure the manipulation force during a pushing experiment by optical deformation measurement. We thus show the utility of the fabrication method for creating complex microrobot shapes remotely in enclosed environments for advanced microrobotic applications, with the potential for scaled down applications in healthcare and microfluidics.
