The final goal of this research is to develop a mobile system to collect 3D information and panoramic image in rubble to search human bodies and situation in the rubble. This system has abilities to collect and deliver information and cooperate with other robots etc. As a part of this project, multiple CMOS cameras are integrated in a sensor head, and software for generating panorama image and distance information is developed.
