For the localization of minimally invasive medical devices, such as capsule endoscopes in the human body, ultrasound combines good resolution, minimal adverse health effects, high speed, adequate frame rates, and low cost. In the case of capsule endoscopes, small onboard ultrasonic emitters with minimal power requirements have the potential to provide significantly enhanced localization. We demonstrate for the first time acoustic emission in the kHz range using a wireless emitter based on the actuation principle of the wireless resonant magnetic microactuator developed recently in our institute. Our experiments show good agreement with the theoretical model, and simulations show the potential for high resolution localization.
