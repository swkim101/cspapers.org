The overall goal of our research is to create a low-cost, home-based diagnostic and rehabilitation tool to assist the rapid functional recovery of people with upper limb (UL) dysfunction (due to muscular dystrophy and stroke)-the diagnostic aspect of which is discussed in this paper. Viewed in the broader context of robot-assisted neurorehabilitation, the proposed framework takes advantage of manipulation of an instrumented manipulandum along prescribed movement patterns to create a sensitive, quantitative, computer-based assessment/diagnostic tool. Specifically, in this paper, we discuss various aspects of an implementation using a COTS force-feedback driving wheel, interfaced to a PC to create a virtual driving environment (VDE). Coupled with the exercise/movement protocols (structured as driving exercises along paths of varying complexity), this results in creation of a low-cost, user-friendly and immersive personal-movement trainer that is well suited for deployment in patients' homes. Our initial analysis of data collected from 5 healthy subjects indicates that the tool has adequate sensitivity/resolution to distinguish even between healthy subjects and shows considerable promise for diagnosis in diseased population (which is currently underway).
