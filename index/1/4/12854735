In this demonstration we present SmartLab1, an exciting experimental testbed of approximately 40+ real Android Smartphones, plus emulated devices, deployed at the Department of Computer Science building at the University of Cyprus. SmartLab provides a public, permanent testbed for the development and testing of smartphone network applications via an intuitive web-based interface. Registered users can upload and install Android executables (APKs) on a number of Android smartphones, capture their output, reboot the devices, create concurrent interactive jobs using MonkeyRunner scripts, interact with the remote devices and many other exciting features. SmartLab aims to facilitate research in smartphone network programming environments, communication protocols, system design, and applications.
