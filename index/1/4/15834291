Storing and searching large labeled graphs is indeed becoming a key issue in the design of space/time efficient online platforms indexing modern social networks or knowledge graphs. But, as far as we know, all these results are limited to design compressed graph indexes which support basic access operations onto the link structure of the input graph, such as: given a node u, return the adjacency list of u. This paper takes inspiration from the Facebook Unicorn's platform and proposes some compressed-indexing schemes for large graphs whose nodes are labeled with strings of variable length - i.e., node's attributes such as user's (nick-)name - that support sophisticated search operations which involve both the linked structure of the graph and the string content of its nodes. An extensive experimental evaluation over real social networks will show the time and space efficiency of the proposed indexing schemes and their query processing algorithms.
