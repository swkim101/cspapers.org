Todayâ€™s networks are controlled at various organisational and functional layers by human managers. What seems more suitable for the future scenarios is a management solution based on static and/or mobile software entities, collecting network state information and having the ability to directly invoke effective changes to switch controllers, without the interaction of a human operator. In particular, this would enable more flexible interactions among distinct network providers improving the process of allocating a connection which spans several networks. This paper describes a software architecture which makes use of Distributed Artificial Intelligent techniques in order to support the QoS-based multi-domain routing process.
