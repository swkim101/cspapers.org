We discuss synthetic receptors for haptic sensing. These are based on magnetic field sensors (Hall effect structures) fabricated using standard CMOS technologies. These receptors, biased with a small permanent magnet can detect the presence of ferro or ferri-magnetic objects in the vicinity of the sensor. They can also detect the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field.
