The goal of one type of recommenders is to minimize the number of clicks users need to reach the information they are looking for. Recommenders typically estimate the probability that pages contain the user’s target information and provide the user with links to the most promising pages. In this paper we show that this greedy strategy can lead to recommendations that are suboptimal in terms of the number of clicks. We present a recommendation method which aims at gathering information about the user’s targets rather than guessing the target immediately. This method uses recommendations as questions and clicks on links as answers. Evaluation shows that this strategy leads to significantly shorter user sessions than the greedy strategy.
