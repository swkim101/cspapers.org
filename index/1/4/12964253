This paper presents the design principles, architecture, implementation and performance of our modular key management protocol (MKMP) and an IP secure tunnel protocol (IPST) which protects the secrecy and integrity of IP datagrams using cryptographic functions. To use the existing IP infrastructure, MKMP is built on top of UDP and the IPST protocol is built by encapsulating IP datagrams.
