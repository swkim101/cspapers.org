This paper proposes a new type of output coupling mechanisms using the harmonic drive. The mechanism uses the input surplus power through distributing it to the other outputs, which enables us to use the input power more effectively. The proposing mechanism has ability of speed reduction and non-backlash anew. We can keep the increase of torque loss and inertia to a minimum because we can put together output coupling mechanisms and reduction gears. We express in this paper about a compositional principle of this mechanism and experimental results. And we show the effectiveness of this mechanism.
