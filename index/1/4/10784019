This demonstration presents a novel form of mid-air tactile display, LaserStroke, that makes use of a laser irradiated on the elastic medium attached to the skin. LaserStroke extends a laser device with an orientation control platform and a magnetic tracker so that it can elicit tapping and stroking sensations to a user's palm from a distance. LaserStroke offers unique tactile experiences while a user freely moves his/her hand in midair.
