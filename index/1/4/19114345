An efficient method is proposed for assigning jobs to search servers in cluster-type system environments when search server performance levels diier. The assignment is done by estimating the search time for each query, based on factors such as the number of databases to be retrieved by the query and the performance of the servers. Search processing efficiency is improved by assigning time-consuming jobs to high-performance servers, regardless of the order of request arrival. Experimental results showed a 10 to 50% shortening of the overall response time.
