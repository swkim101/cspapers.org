The multiple observation times approach was proposed as a test generation approach for fault detection, and was shown to alleviate deficiencies of conventional test generators. In this work, the multiple observation times approach is applied to fault location. It is shown that the use of multiple observation times has the potential of significantly enhancing the resolution of a given test set. A definition of pass/fail diagnosis suitable for the multiple observation times approach is also given. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the approach and its advantages.
