In recent years, DRAM technology improvements have scaled at a much slower pace than processors. While server processor core counts grow from 33% to 50% on a yearly cadence, DDR4 memory channel bandwidth has grown at a slower rate, and memory latency has remained relatively flat for some time. Meanwhile, new computing paradigms have emerged, which involve analyzing massive volumes of data in real time and place pressure on the memory subsystem. The combination of these trends makes it important for computer architects to understand the sensitivity of the workload performance to memory bandwidth and latency. In this paper, we outline and validate a methodology for quick and quantitative performance estimation using a real-world workload.
