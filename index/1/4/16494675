The designer of a virtual memory system can obtain accurate estimates of the average memory requirements of programs running in the system by weighting the average allocation during execution intervals with the average allocation during page waiting intervals. We show how to combine the averages, how to use the measure to determine the size of primary memory while achieving system balance between memory and processor demands, and how to partially order the performance of paging algorithms.
