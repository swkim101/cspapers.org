This work presents an extension of the Dynamic Window Approach. The reactive collision avoidance algorithm is generalized to the case of omni-directional kinematics for any polygonal shaped, mobile robot. This paper includes a superior implementation to former realizations and has already been successfully tested with an omni-directional robot. The implementation is efficient and produces collision-free trajectories even in narrow and crowded environments.
