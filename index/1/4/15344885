In order to take into account the underlying multimodes structure information within the model, we propose a framework of probabilistic product kernels for tensorial data based on a generative model assumption. More specifically, it can be interpreted as mapping tensors to probability density function space and measuring similarity by an information divergence. Since tensor kernels enable us to model input tensor observations, the proposed tensor-variate GP is considered as both a generative and discriminative model. Furthermore, a fully variational Bayesian treatment for multiclass GP classification with multinomial probit likelihood is employed to estimate the hyperparameters and infer the predictive distributions. Simulation results on both synthetic data and a real world application of human action recognition in videos demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach for classification of multiway tensor data, especially in the case that the underlying structure information among multimodes is discriminative for the classification task.
