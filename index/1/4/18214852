In the CG community, many kinds of physical-based (impulse-based) approaches such as Mirtich's and Baraff's have been proposed for showing dynamic animation. However, because they generate and calibrate only an impulsive force, i.e., an area of force distribution, the impulsive forces are not always precisely calibrated. Moreover, since they do not deal with any exact impulse (force distribution), they cannot be applicable for dynamic animation with simultaneous contacts between bodies and for tactile feedback display between them. In order to overcome such drawbacks, we proposed a new approach to generate an arbitrary impulse (force distribution) artificially based on practical time, and tried for dynamic animation with single contact between plastic puck and wall in an air hockey game. In this paper, we extend our proposed approach for a human to strike a puck by a mallet and to feel their impulse by a haptic device such as PHANToM. Moreover, we investigate impulse precision by changing penetration depth between puck and mallet.
