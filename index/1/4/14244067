We investigate methods of generating additional bilingual phrase pairs for a phrase-based decoder by translating short sequences of source text. Because our translation task is more constrained, we can use a model that employs more linguistically rich features than a traditional decoder. We have implemented an example of this approach. Experimental results suggest that the phrase pairs produced by our method are useful to the decoder, and lead to improved sentence translations.
