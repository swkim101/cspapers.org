This paper reports on an interactive system for manipulating a tensor-product B-spline approximation to field data for applications in which contours are of interest. The features of the system are: an interpolation technique for approximating fields defined from scattered or gridded data by tensor-product B-splines, an interactive display providing control-vertex manipulation of the resulting B-spline approximation, and a contouring algorithm that is designed specifically for B-spline surfaces.
