We present XSeek, a keyword search engine that enables users to easily access XML data without the need of learning XPath or XQuery and studying possibly complex data schemas. XSeek addresses a challenge in XML keyword search that has been neglected in the literature: how to determine the desired return information, analogous to inferring a "return" clause in XQuery. To infer the search semantics, XSeek recognizes possible entities and attributes in the data, differentiates search predicates and return specifications in the keywords, and generates meaningful search results based on the analysis.
