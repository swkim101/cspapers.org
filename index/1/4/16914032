We discuss the modeling and control of mechatronic tilting systems. Mechatronic tilting systems are for example walking machines where the feet tilt over their edges. Tilting means that the mechanical system rolls passively (nonactuated) over one of its edges in contact with the ground. A mathematical model and a periodic trajectory planning method using a hybrid (discrete-continuous) dynamical systems approach are developed. The simple model system consists of an actuated arm, which is fixed on a base plate that can tilt over its edges. The planned trajectories are then used in simulation and proper control strategies are discussed.
