We present a new deterministic algorithm for the problem of constructing kth power nonresidues in finite fields Fpn , where p is prime and k is a prime divisor of pn−1. We prove under the assumption of the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERH), that for fixed n and p → ∞, our algorithm runs in polynomial time. Unlike other deterministic algorithms for this problem, this polynomial-time bound holds even if k is exponentially large. More generally, assuming the ERH, in time (n log p)O(n) we can construct a set of elements that generates the multiplicative group Fpn . An extended abstract of this paper appeared in Proc. 23rd Ann.
