We propose a model for Chinese poem generation based on recurrent neural networks which we argue is ideally suited to capturing poetic content and form. Our generator jointly performs content selection (“what to say”) and surface realization (“how to say”) by learning representations of individual characters, and their combinations into one or more lines as well as how these mutually reinforce and constrain each other. Poem lines are generated incrementally by taking into account the entire history of what has been generated so far rather than the limited horizon imposed by the previous line or lexical n-grams. Experimental results show that our model outperforms competitive Chinese poetry generation systems using both automatic and manual evaluation methods.
