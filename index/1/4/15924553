In order to accomplish cooperative tasks, multi-robot systems are required to communicate among each other. Thus, maintaining the connectivity of the communication graph is a fundamental issue. Connectivity maintenance has been extensively studied in the last few years, but generally considering only kinematic agents. In this paper we will introduce a control strategy that, exploiting a decentralized procedure for the estimation of the algebraic connectivity of the graph, ensures the connectivity maintenance for groups of Lagrangian systems. The control strategy is validated by means of analytical proofs and simulation results.
