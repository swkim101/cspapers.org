In this paper, we present a system, which could digitally stimulate the sense of taste (gustation) on human. The system utilizes electrical stimulation on human tongue to produce taste sensations. The initial experiments reveal that the method is viable and deserves further developments. This requires further analyses of the properties of electric pulses (current, frequency, and voltage) on tongue along with the stimulating material. The experimental results suggested that sourness, bitterness, and saltiness are the main sensations that could be evoked at present.
