Activity-centric collaboration environments help knowledge workers to manage the context of their shared work activities by providing a representation for an activity and its resources. Activity management systems provide more structure and organization than email to execute the shared activity but, as the number of shared activities increases, it becomes more and more difficult for users to focus on important activities that need their attention. This paper describes a personalized activity prioritization approach implemented on top of the Lotus Connections Activities management system. Our prototype implementation allows each user to view activities ordered by her/his predicted priorities. The predictions are made using a ranking Support Vector Machine model trained with the user's past interactions with the activities system. We describe the prioritization interface and the results of an offline experiment based on data from 13 users over 6-months. Our results show that our feature set derived from shared activity structures can significantly increase prediction accuracy compared to a recency baseline.
