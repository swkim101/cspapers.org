The computational processing of compound semantics poses several interesting challenges. Up to now, the processing of nominal compounds with non-noun left-hand constituents (henceforth XN compounds) has not received any attention, despite the fact that these also seem to be rather productive in Germanic languages. In our research project, we aim to fill this hiatus by investigating various kinds of compounds in Afrikaans and Dutch, develop annotation protocols and data sets, and model the semantics of such compounds. In this publication we present the alpha version of an annotation protocol that was designed for both descriptive linguistic and computational linguistic purposes. We describe the protocol development and discuss the current version.
