We present the SPIRE system, a hybrid case-based reasoning (CBR) and information retrieval (IR) system. It relies on a small case-base to seed the IR system to 1) select documents that are relevant to a presented problem case, and then (2) highlight within these retrieved documents passages that contain relevant information about speciic case features. SPIRE aids not only problem-solving but knowledge acquisition by fo-cusing a text extractor|person or program|on areas of text where needed information is likely to be found. Once extracted, this information can be used to create new cases or database objects thus closing the loop in the problem-solving|knowledge-acquisition cycle. 1 Introduction When confronted with a new problem, we frequently try to relate it to one that we have dealt with previously. If we have knowledge of a similar prior problem, we might try to apply the same or a related solution. Similarly, we might want to evaluate a scenario and hypothesize the likelihood of various outcomes. By analogizing the new problem, or parts of it, to past experiences, we save ourselves from having to solve every problem from scratch. By relying on prior experiences for both of these processes , we are employing \case-based reasoning". Case-based reasoners solve problems or examine and explain possible outcomes to a scenario by relying on prior similar experiences. Case-base reasoning (CBR) systems can be found in such diverse domains as cooking 8], medical diagnostics 11], manufacturing 10], game playing 12, 4], and legal applications 1, 15].
