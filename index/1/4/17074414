MediaMosaic is an editing environment developed to provide several features that are either unavailable or not adequately addressed in current editing systems. First, it is a multimedia editor of an open architecture. General media are inserted in documents by embedded virtual screens. Second, it allows users to do markup editing in context. The marked comments are overlapped and attached to the commented areas. Third, it provides a mechanism to allow users to bring data from more than one source to a single document. The views of the included data can be tailored. Fourth, users can work on an included medium through its embedded view or through another complete and duplicated view. It isolates and simplifies the interface design of individual media editors.
