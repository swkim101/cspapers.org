LOCATE is workspace layout design software that also serves as a testbed for developing and refining principles of adaptive aiding. This demonstration illustrates LOCATE's ability to determine user cognitive styles and provide help matched to those styles. Users are assessed along a Wholist-Analytic dimension and a Verbal-Imagery-Kinesthetic "trimension" and that information is stored in a User Model maintained by LOCATE. Help options provided to users for selecting alternative forms of help permit the system to track those selections and allow for system adaptation to the user's preferred style of help.
