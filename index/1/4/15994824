This paper describes the design of a course in Data Structures from the object oriented standpoint. It discusses objectives and how they are met as well as course materials and strategies. This course has been offered to Sophomores at Pace University since 1990. Materials, including a manuscript for a textbook, have been developed in both C++ and Object Pascal. The C++ version of the text is to be published by McGraw-Hill in 1993.
