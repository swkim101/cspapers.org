We identify a class of videos whose information content can be approximately encoded as an audio, thereby increasing the amount of accessible videos. We propose a model to automatically identify such videos. Our model jointly relies on the textual metadata and visual content of the video. We use this model to re-rank Youtube video search results based on accessibility of the video. We present preliminary results by conducting a user study with visually impaired people to measure the effectiveness of our system.
