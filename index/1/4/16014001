1.2 Simultaneity. The systems are composed of different parts or pieces of equipment that can work simultaneously, so that the behaviour of the system is (a priori) more than the action of a single unit with a single operation going on at a time. This simple idea is best explained by examples: all customers in a library are operating independently~ and independently of the employees who check out the books~ or bring back the books to the shelves. Cashiers, salespeople, accountants are all working at the same time in a department store. Card readers~ line printers, adders, multipliers~ memory banks~ discs are all in operation simultaneously in a computer system, and the fact that a multiplier is busy does not necessarily prevent a memory bank from sending information to the arithmetic unit.
