Flash Memory based Solid State Drive (SSD) has been called a "pivotal technology" that could revolutionize data storage systems. Since SSD shares a common interface with the traditional hard disk drive (HDD), both physically and logically, an effective integration of SSD into the storage hierarchy is very important. However, details of SSD hardware implementations tend to be hidden behind such narrow interfaces. In fact, since sophisticated algorithms are usually, of necessity, adopted in SSD controller firmware, more complex performance dynamics are to be expected in SSD than in HDD systems. Most existing literature or product specifications on SSD just provide high-level descriptions and standard performance data, such as bandwidth and latency.
 In order to gain insight into the unique performance characteristics of SSD, we have conducted intensive experiments and measurements on different types of state-of-the-art SSDs, from low-end to high-end products. We have observed several unexpected performance issues and uncertain behavior of SSDs, which have not been reported in the literature. For example, we found that fragmentation could seriously impact performance -- by a factor of over 14 times on a recently announced SSD. Moreover, contrary to the common belief that accesses to SSD are uncorrelated with access patterns, we found a strong correlation between performance and the randomness of data accesses, for both reads and writes. In the worst case, average latency could increase by a factor of 89 and bandwidth could drop to only 0.025MB/sec. Our study reveals several unanticipated aspects in the performance dynamics of SSD technology that must be addressed by system designers and data-intensive application users in order to effectively place it in the storage hierarchy.
