Today's enterprises hold ever-growing amounts of public data, stemming from different organizational systems, such as development environments, CRM systems, business intelligence systems, and enterprise social media. This data unlocks rich and diverse information about entities, people, terms, and the relationships among them. A lot of insight can be gained through analyzing this knowledge graph, both by individual employees and by the organization as a whole. In this talk, I will review recent work done by the Social Technologies & Analytics group at IBM Research-Haifa to mine these relationships, represent them in a generalized model, and use the model for different aims within the enterprise, including social search [5], expertise location [1], social recommendation [2, 3], and network analysis [4].
