We present an extremely simple yet robust multi-view stereo algorithm and analyze its properties. The algorithm first computes individual depth maps using a window-based voting approach that returns only good matches. The depth maps are then merged into a single mesh using a straightforward volumetric approach. We show results for several datasets, showing accuracy comparable to the best of the current state of the art techniques and rivaling more complex algorithms.
