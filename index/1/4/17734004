Situated displays can support behavior management for children with behavioral challenges. However, existing tools are often static, rarely engaging, and tend to focus only on individual behavior. In this work, we designed and deployed a situated display to support teamwork and cooperation in children with behavioral challenges. We evaluated this tool in two classrooms of a public school specializing in behavioral interventions with 28 children over four weeks. The results of this work demonstrate that situated displays focused on collective behavioral performance can support reflection on individual performance, improve behavior for students with behavioral challenges, as well as encourage teamwork and cooperative behavior in classrooms. These results also indicate a variety of issues to be considered when designing situated displays for these environments, including considerations for the representation of ambiguity and failure as well as the relationship between novelty and engagement.
