A controlled experiment comparing the first-year approaches of in-depth study of programming methodology to breadth of experience in programming and languages is described. The experiment involves two groups of students who will follow different paths in the freshman year which converge in the sophomore year. Performance of students from each group in the common sophomore courses will be analyzed. The efforts to reduce bias and the methods of measurement and analysis are described in detail.
