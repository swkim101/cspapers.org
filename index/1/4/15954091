Some aspects of the application of functional simulation to fault diagnosis are discussed. A technique for functional simulation that preserves a high level of accuracy is described. Applicability of this method to fault simulation and diagnosis is shown by presenting an approach to diagnostic testing and giving an algorithm for test point placement. The compatibility of the functional simulation technique and the partitioning of the system for diagnosis is indicated.
