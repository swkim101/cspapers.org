The measurement and understanding of user aesthetic preference for form is a critical element to the product development process and has been a design challenge for many years. In this article preference is represented in a utility function directly related to the engineering representation for the automobile headlight. A method is proposed to solicit and measure customer preferences for shape of the automobile headlight using a choice task on a main-effects conjoint survey design to discover and design the most preferred shape.Â© 2007 ASME
