Decomposing a software system into smaller, more manageable clusters provides an insight for better comprehension of large systems for software engineers. However, invocation-awareness and dynamic view are two features which are not supported by existed software clustering visualization tools. In this paper, we presents a novel tool, named SCuV, to partition the Software into invocation-aware clusters, Cluster them with nested containment & invocation hierarchy and Visualize the clustering result in granularity-adjustable way.
