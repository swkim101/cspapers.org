This paper outlines a representation of knowledge based on semantic networks and organized in terms of semantic axes and "scenarios". A context mechanism for such nets is also discussed, along with an algorithm for integrating new information to a semantic net. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the representation and the context mechanism.
