This paper describes a scheme to utilize semantic integrity constraints in optimizing a user specified query. The scheme uses a graph theoretic approach to identify redundant join clauses and redundant restriction clauses specified in a user query. An algorithm is suggested to eliminate such redundant joins and avoid unnecessary restrictions. In addition to these eliminations, the algorithm aims to introduce as many restrictions on indexed attributes as possible, thus yielding an equivalent, but potentially more profitable, form of the original query.
