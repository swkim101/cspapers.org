In this paper we present Clairlib, an open-source toolkit for Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Network Analysis. Clairlib provides an integrated framework intended to simplify a number of generic tasks within and across those three areas. It has a command-line interface, a graphical interface, and a documented API. Clairlib is compatible with all the common platforms and operating systems. In addition to its own functionality, it provides interfaces to external software and corpora. Clairlib comes with a comprehensive documentation and a rich set of tutorials and visual demos.
