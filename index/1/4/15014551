The optimal PLA folding problem is presented and discussed in its different forms. In particular, new algorithms for row folding in unconstrained architectures and in AND-OR-AND architectures are presented and their complexity examined. The problem of finding an optimal row folding after a column folding has been performed, is described and an algorithm for its solution given. Finally, the organization of an APL package for row and column folding of PLA's is introduced and experimental results reported.
