The growing popularity of location-based systems, allowing unknown/untrusted servers to easily collect huge amounts of information regarding users' location, has recently started raising serious privacy concerns. In this paper we introduce geoind, a formal notion of privacy for location-based systems that protects the user's exact location, while allowing approximate information -- typically needed to obtain a certain desired service -- to be released. This privacy definition formalizes the intuitive notion of protecting the user's location within a radius $r$ with a level of privacy that depends on r, and corresponds to a generalized version of the well-known concept of differential privacy. Furthermore, we present a mechanism for achieving geoind by adding controlled random noise to the user's location. We describe how to use our mechanism to enhance LBS applications with geo-indistinguishability guarantees without compromising the quality of the application results. Finally, we compare state-of-the-art mechanisms from the literature with ours. It turns out that, among all mechanisms independent of the prior, our mechanism offers the best privacy guarantees.
