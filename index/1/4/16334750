Intelligent systems interacting with users often need to relate ambiguous natural language phrases to formal entities which can be further processed.Â This work strives for learning an optimal sequence of disambiguation questions asked by an agent in order to achieve a perfect interactive disambiguation, setting itself off against previous work on interactive and adaptive dialogue systems for disambiguation in question answering. To this aim, we built a hybrid system that exhibits deductive and statistical inference capabilities by combining techniques from natural language processing, information retrieval, answer set programming and relational reinforcement learning.
