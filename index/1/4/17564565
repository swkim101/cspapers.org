We present a new sealed-bid auction protocol that allows an auctioneer to determine the winning bid in a universally veri able way and simultaneously prevents not only bidders but also an auctioneer from getting any useful information of bids of losers. We make use of a trusted third party(TTP) but in an optimistic sense[1][2], i.e., the TTP takes part in the protocol only if one bidder cheats or simply crashes. Previous schemes[3][4] require the bidder's help during opening procedures. On the other hand, our protocol is quite e√Ücient since a bidder takes part only at the beginning. More importantly, our scheme is robust against cheating bidders; i.e. any deviation of bidders cannot prevent the auctioneer from determining the auction. A strati ed distributed encryption-key chaining mechanism and a veri able encryption protocol are employed as building blocks. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the rst construction of a universally veri able bid-privacy preserving sealed-bid auction protocol with an o -line TTP.
