Detecting violations of application-level end-to-end connectivity on the Internet is of significant interest to researchers and end users; recent studies have revealed cases of HTTP ad injection and HTTPS man-in-the-middle attacks. Unfortunately, detecting such end-to-end violations at scale remains difficult, as it generally requires having the cooperation of many nodes spread across the globe. Most successful approaches have relied either on dedicated hardware, user-installed software, or privileged access to a popular web site. In this paper, we present an alternate approach for detecting end-to-end violations based on Luminati, a HTTP/S proxy service that routes traffic through millions of end hosts. We develop measurement techniques that allow Luminati to be used to detect end-to-end violations of DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS, and, in many cases, enable us to identify the culprit. We present results from over 1.2m nodes across 14k ASes in 172 countries, finding that up to 4.8% of nodes are subject to some type of end-to-end connectivity violation. Finally, we are able to use Luminati to identify and measure the incidence of content monitoring, where end-host software or ISP middleboxes record users' HTTP requests and later re-download the content to third-party servers.
