A scheme is presented for classifying recursive problems based upon an analysis of their parameters. Several well known recursive algorithms are then classified according to this scheme. The classification is used to determine if strategies for effecting significant savings in computation time of a recursive algorithm can be developed. Such strategies and the results of applying them are also discussed.
