We present an approach to simultaneously perform semantic segmentation and prepositional phrase attachment resolution for captioned images. Some ambiguities in language cannot be resolved without simultaneously reasoning about an associated image. If we consider the sentence "I shot an elephant in my pajamas", looking at language alone (and not using common sense), it is unclear if it is the person or the elephant wearing the pajamas or both. Our approach produces a diverse set of plausible hypotheses for both semantic segmentation and prepositional phrase attachment resolution that are then jointly reranked to select the most consistent pair. We show that our semantic segmentation and prepositional phrase attachment resolution modules have complementary strengths, and that joint reasoning produces more accurate results than any module operating in isolation. Multiple hypotheses are also shown to be crucial to improved multiple-module reasoning. Our vision and language approach significantly outperforms the Stanford Parser (De Marneffe et al., 2006) by 17.91% (28.69% relative) and 12.83% (25.28% relative) in two different experiments. We also make small improvements over DeepLab-CRF (Chen et al., 2015).
