We consider the problem of determining the probability distribution on the queue sizes in a general oblivious packet-routing network. We assume packets continuously arrive at each node of the network according to a Poisson Process with rate . We also assume that an edge may be traversed by only one packet at a time, and the time to traverse an edge is an exponentially distributed random variable with mean 1. We show that the queueing-theoretic solution to the problem requires solving a large system of simultaneous equations. We present a simple combinatorial formula which represents the solution to the system of queueing equations. This combinatorial formula is especially simple and insightful in the case of greedy routing to random destinations. We use the formula to obtain results including: the probability distribution on the queue sizes, the expected queue sizes, and the expected packet delay (all as a function of and n) in the case of an n n array network and a torus network with greedy randomized routing.
