In this paper, we propose a novel active probing approach for detecting malicious servers and compromised hosts that listen for (and react to) incoming network requests. Our approach sends probes to remote hosts and examines their responses, determining whether the remote hosts are malicious or not. It identifies different malicious server types as well as malware that listens for incoming traffic such as P2P bots. Compared with existing defenses, our active probing approach is fast, cheap, easy to deploy, and achieves Internet scale. We have implemented our active probing approach in a tool called CyberProbe. We have used CyberProbe to identify 151 malicious servers and 7,881 P2P bots through 24 localized and Internet-wide scans. Of those servers 75% are unknown to publicly available databases of malicious servers, indicating that CyberProbe can achieve up to 4 times better coverage than existing techniques. Our results reveal an important provider locality property: operations hosts an average of 3.2 servers on the same hosting provider to amortize the cost of setting up a relationship with the provider.
