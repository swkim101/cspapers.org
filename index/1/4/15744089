This study considers the problem of estimating the direction-of-arrival (DOA) for code-division multiple access (CDMA) signals. In this situation, DOA estimation is more difficult to solve and becomes a highly nonlinear optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a new application of genetic algorithm (GA) base on first order Taylor series iterative MVDR searching technique for the CDMA system. It has been shown that the iterative searching technique suffers from the local maximum searching problem, causing acquisition errors in DOA estimation. In conjunction with a genetic algorithm (GA) for selecting initial search angle, we present an efficient approach to achieve the advantages of iterative DOA estimation with fast convergence and more accuracy estimate over existing conventional spectral searching methods. Finally, numerical example is presented to illustrate the design procedure and confirm the performance of the proposed method.
