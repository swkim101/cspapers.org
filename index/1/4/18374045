In this paper we, in essence, point out that the methods used in the current vector based systems are in conflict with the premises of the vector space model. The considerations, naturally, lead to how things might have been done differently. More importantly, it is felt that this investigation will lead to a clearer understanding of the issues and problems in using the vector space model in information retrieval.
