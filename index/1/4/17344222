â€˜rhis paper investigates an eflicient implementation of circuit simulator sparta based on the preconditioned .Jacc>bi method on a loosely coupled distributed memory machine Fujitsu .AP1OOO, The preconditioned relaxation met hods are linear solvers effective in large scale circuit simulations. Because the preconditioned Jacobi method ha. a high parallelism, the only problem of parallelization of sparta is the application of the preconditioned to the residual vector. This paper investigates the matrix mapping schemes and the communication methods for efficient preconditioned application. The peculiarity of the preconditioned in sparta is a few full rows and columns, in spite of its rather high sparsity. The column-row mapping is the best scheme by far, where the decisive point is the IOJV communication requirements. The best communication method is the far-first cascade method, despite the out -of-order reception of messages of the one-to-one method. The parallel efficiency of sparta is reported to be higher than the other researches of the waveform relaxation technique and/or on shared memory machines. The l)r[,for~clitioneci .Jacobi method is confirmed to be effective for parallel circuit simulation on loosely coupled parallel comIJlrting environments.
