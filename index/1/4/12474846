This paper represents an entry to the SC|05 Analytics Challenge and describes a new scientific visualization tool designed to allow investigators to more effectively interrogate large unsteady datasets. By utilizing techniques such as data extracts and programmable graphics processing units, this new capability allows users to more freely interrogate time accurate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions in excess of 108 grid points. This tool known as the Advanced Technology Viewer (ATViewer) has been incorporated into Intelligent Lightâ€™s FIELDVIEW 11 product and applied here to interrogate two large unsteady datasets on the order of 60 gigabytes in size. The first is an unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes simulation of a wind turbine operating at a high yawed position. The other is a hybrid Large-Eddy simulation of an elastic helicopter rotor in forward flight.
