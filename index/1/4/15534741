PARSSS* is a parallel formulation of SSS* that is suitable for shared-memory multiprocessor systems. It is based on the distributed tree search paradigm of Ferguson and Korf. The main difficulty in parallelizing SSS* lies in achieving proper coordination between processes running on different subtrees of the game tree. This has been resolved in PARSSS* by the use of a shared array which maintains summary information on all processes that are currently in execution. Problem-independent speed-up values for PARSSS* have been obtained experimentally. It is shown that an earlier algorithm of the authors, called ITERSSS*, which allows SSS* to run in restricted memory, can also be parallelized using the above scheme.
