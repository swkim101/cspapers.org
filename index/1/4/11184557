In the past decade, there have been a large number of transfer learning algorithms proposed for various real-world applications. However, most of them are vulnerable to negative transfer since their performance is even worse than traditional supervised models. Aiming at more robust transfer learning models, we propose an ENsemble framework of anCHOR adapters (ENCHOR for short), in which an anchor adapter adapts the features of instances based on their similarities to a specific anchor (i.e., a selected instance). Specifically, the more similar to the anchor instance, the higher degree of the original feature of an instance remains unchanged in the adapted representation, and vice versa. This adapted representation for the data actually expresses the local structure around the corresponding anchor, and then any transfer learning method can be applied to this adapted representation for a prediction model, which focuses more on the neighborhood of the anchor. Next, based on multiple anchors, multiple anchor adapters can be built and combined into an ensemble for final output. Additionally, we develop an effective measure to select the anchors for ensemble building to achieve further performance improvement. Extensive experiments on hundreds of text classification tasks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of ENCHOR. The results show that: when traditional supervised models perform poorly, ENCHOR (based on only 8 selected anchors) achieves $6%-13%$ increase in terms of average accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods, and it greatly alleviates negative transfer.
