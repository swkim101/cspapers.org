Office automation is used by groups of people with complex communication needs to help them reach business goals such as scheduling, tracking, reviewing, and delegating. Effective individual and group decisions are heavily dependent on communication protocols and social conventions. Because these conventions are so ingrained, they are sometimes not readily available to conscious inspection during the design of communication systems. Even more problematic, system designers may not have first hand knowledge of the conventions and protocol for the range of environments in which their systems will be used. Nevertheless, office systems must work in tandem with these conventions. Wang Laboratories has a continuing program of research directed at identifying the psychological and social factors that come into play during the adoption and use of computer communication systems and the implications of these factors for the design of those systems. Highlights of a three year program of research are presented covering implications for voice mail, electronic mail, and electronic calendars.
