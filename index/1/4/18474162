There are many dangerous and time-consuming construction works performed on steep slopes. In order to improve the conditions in which these works are done, the authors propose a new construction machine that is a quadruped walking robot called TITAN XI. The main objective of remote-controlled TITAN XI system is to drill the deep holes for insertion of anchor bolts or rock bolts. In this paper, we report the system and design of TITAN XI.
