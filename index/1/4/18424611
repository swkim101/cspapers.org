We consider the control of Port-Controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) systems, which are a generalization of Euler-Lagrange Systems. A new matching equation for PCH systems is developed so that Interconnection Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Control (IDA-PBC) can be extended to the regulation of some underactuated PCH systems whose kinetic energy must be modified. A simple underactuated mechanical system (the inertial wheel pendulum) is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method..
