Good tracking performance is in general attributed to accurate representation over previously obtained targets or reliable discrimination between the target and the surrounding background. In this work, we exploit the advantages of the both approaches to achieve a robust tracker. We construct a subspace to represent the target and the neighboring background, and simultaneously propagate their class labels via the learned subspace. Moreover, we propose a novel criterion to identify the target from numerous target candidates on each frame, which takes into account both discrimination reliability and representation accuracy. In addition, with the proposed criterion, the ambiguity in the class labels of the neighboring background samples, which often influences the reliability of discriminative tracking model, is effectively alleviated, while the training set is still kept small. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker performs favourably against many other state-of-the-art trackers.
