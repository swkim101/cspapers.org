Within this paper the incorporation of interpolation procedures into a database management systcm is described. The interpolation functions are used to calculate intermediate values of sequences of measurements. The consequences of this class of embedded procedures for query evaluation and optimization are described. Starting with a user-fricndl y syntax, the interpolation procedures are decomposed into more refined operations on database objects. The impact of these operations and their prcdcfincd sequence on query evaluation and optimization is discussed. Promising evaluation strategies are emphasized.
