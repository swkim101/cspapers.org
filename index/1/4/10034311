We give new lower and upper bounds on the permanent of a doubly stochastic matrix. Combined with previous work, this improves on the deterministic approximation factor. We also give a combinatorial application of the lower bound, proving S. Friedland's "Asymptotic Lower Matching Conjecture"for the monomer-dimer problem.
