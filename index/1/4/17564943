This paper describes an approach to PCB routing which applies the Branch and Bound Method to the search for a path between two points. A special multiple pass method of pseudo-parallel routing is applied in order to insure that simple interconnections are made at the earliest stages. The algorithm has been implemented by Computervision Corporation on a 32K word, 16 bit minicomputer based system.
