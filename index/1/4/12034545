In this paper, we describe JHAVÉ (Java-hosted Algorithm Visualization Environment), a client-server environment for delivering algorithm visualizations over the Web. The first section of the paper briefly summarizes prior research by a variety of investigators into the pedagogical effectiveness of algorithm visualization (AV). The design goals of JHAVÉ are then placed in the context of this research. After a discussion of some technical details of the JHAVÉ architecture, we present two examples of algorithms depicted in JHAVÉ. The results of students' exploring these algorithms with JHAVÉ are analyzed. We close with a discussion of the general conclusions reached from our current work and future directions in which it may lead.
