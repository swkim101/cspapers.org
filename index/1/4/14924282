This paper describes a mathematical mockup developed to give engine and airframe designers a tool faster, more accurate, and far more versatile than the conventional, physical engine mockup. The primary uses of this mathematical mockup at present are to facilitate engine/nacelle integration, component location, and tube design and routing. The program's ability to accept and store many engine and part configurations also gives it many applications in configuration management and maintainability planning.
 When a complete digital description of an engine has been programmed into a computer, a designer can inspect the engine's surface by selecting cross section, quadrant, or side views displayed on a graphics console or plotted by a numerically controlled drafting machine. A designer can also use the mathematical model in changing an engine's external configuration. Potential interference can be discovered immediately.
