The Web has created a global information space of linked documents. The Semantic Web creates an information space of linked data from multiple sources. Information can be mined from the interlinking of available datasets by a distributed query language known as SPARQL, the SQL equivalent for the Semantic Web. Participants will understand and appreciate the role of linked data on the Semantic Web; be able to model, represent, and interpret simple linked data applications; complete exercises that create simple Linked Data models; appreciate the benefits of Linked Data over relational database modeling; be aware of successful commercial applications of linked Data; be directed to resources that facilitate incorporation of this material into their courses.
