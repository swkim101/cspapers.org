Spatial trajectory data is widely available today. Over a sustained period of time, trajectory data has been collected from numerous GPS devices, smartphones, sensors and social media applications. Daily increases of real-time trajectory data have also been phenomenal in recent years. More and more new applications have emerged to derive business values from both trajectory data warehouses and real-time trajectory data. Due to their very large volumes, their nature of streaming, their highly variable levels of data quality, as well as many possible links with other types of data, making sense of spatial trajectory data becomes one of the crucial areas for big data analytics. In this paper we will present a review of the extensive work in spatiotemporal data management and trajectory mining, and discuss new challenges and new opportunities in the context of new applications, focusing on recent advances in trajectory data management and trajectory mining from their foundations to high performance processing with modern computing infrastructure.
