Cost and dimensional variation of products are significant attributes in multistation assembly processes. These attributes depend on product/process tolerances and fixture layouts. Typically, tolerance allocation and fixture layout design are conducted separately without considering potential interrelations. In this work, we use multiobjective optimization for integrated tolerance allocation and fixture layout design to address interactions and to quantify tradeoffs among cost, product variation, and assembly process sensitivity. A nested optimization strategy is applied to a vehicle side frame assembly. Results demonstrate the presence and quantification of tradeoffs, based on which we introduce the concept of critical variation and critical budget requirements.
