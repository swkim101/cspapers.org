Present methods of production test data generation for dense logic circuit packages are costly and time-consuming. Necessary human intervention can be performed only between batch computer runs. Speed and cost improvements can be made with a system that provides the user with real-time information on the consequences of his decisions. This paper presents design considerations for a system which meets this need.
