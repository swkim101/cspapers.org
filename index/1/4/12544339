There is a current need for scheduling policies that can leverage the performance variability of resources on multi-user clusters. We develop one solution to this problem called stochastic scheduling that utilizes a distribution of application execution performance on the target resources to determine a performance-efficient schedule. In this paper, we define a stochastic scheduling policy based on time-balancing for data parallel applications whose execution behavior can be represented as a normal distribution. Using three distributed applications on two contended platforms, we demonstrate that a stochastic scheduling policy can achieve good and predictable performance for the application as evaluated by several performance measures.
