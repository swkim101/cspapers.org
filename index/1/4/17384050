In this paper, we propose a framework of recommending users and communities in social media. Given a user's profile, our framework is capable of recommending influential users and topic-cohesive interactive communities that are most relevant to the given user. In our framework, we present a generative topic model to discover user-oriented and community-oriented topics simultaneously, which enables us to capture the exact topic interests of users, as well as the focuses of communities. Extensive evaluation on a data set obtained from Twitter has demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared with other probabilistic topic model based recommendation methods.
