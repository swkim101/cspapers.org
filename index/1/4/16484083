We developed and tested a heuristic technique for extracting the main article from news site Web pages. We construct the DOM tree of the page and score every node based on the amount of text, the number of links it contains and additional heuristics. The method is site-independent and does not use any language-based features. We tested our algorithm on a set of 1120 news article pages from 27 domains. Our algorithm achieved over 97% precision and 98% recall, and an average processing speed of under 15ms per page.
