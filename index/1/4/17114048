Little has appeared on the problems of efficiently storing, accessing, and manipulating relations. These are of considerable interest, both to implementors and those seeking comparison with other database models. In this paper we examine how one relational operation, the join, can be efficiently computed. Algorithms are presented, and evaluated with respect to storage use and computing time.
