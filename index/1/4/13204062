Although color TV is an established technology, there are a number of longstanding problems for which neural networks may be suited. Impulse noise is such a problem, and a modular neural network approach is presented in this paper. The training and analysis was done on conventional computers, while real-time simulations were performed on a massively parallel computer called the Princeton Engine. The network approach was compared to a conventional alternative, a median filter. Real-time simulations and quantitative analysis demonstrated the technical superiority of the neural system. Ongoing work is investigating the complexity and cost of implementing this system in hardware.
