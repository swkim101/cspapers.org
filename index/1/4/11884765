The increasing size and complexity of integrated circuits has made an efficient data base essential to the operation of an interactive layout system. This paper describes the design of a data base for IC mask data which features rough bit-maps of entities for sorting by location, a routine for the automatic selection of the bit-map regions' boundaries, and a page-filling algorithm which facilitates the separation of dissimilar data between pages. The routine for automatic selection of region boundaries is described in detail.
