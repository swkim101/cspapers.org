This paper describes the Ô¨Årst robust approach to automatically labeling clauses with their situation entity type (Smith, 2003), capturing aspectual phenomena at the clause level which are relevant for interpreting both semantics at the clause level and discourse structure. Previous work on this task used a small data set from a limited domain, and relied mainly on words as features, an approach which is impractical in larger settings. We provide a new corpus of texts from 13 genres (40,000 clauses) annotated with situation entity types. We show that our sequence labeling approach using distributional information in the form of Brown clusters, as well as syntactic-semantic features targeted to the task, is robust across genres, reaching accuracies of up to 76%.
