Embedded multiprocessors have always been heterogeneous, driven by the power-efficiency and compute-density of hardware specialization. We aim to achieve portability and sustained performance of complete applications, leveraging diverse programmable cores. We combine instruction-set virtualization with just-in-time compilation, compiling C, C++ and managed languages to a target-independent intermediate language, maximizing the information flow between compilation steps in a split optimization process.
