With the advent of multimedia computing, the demand for very-large-scale storage systems becomes ever more imminent. Tertiary memory syst ems, once considered exotic devices equipped only with high-end computer systems, are now gradually moving into the main stream. Although helicalscan tape offers an economically feasible solution to the media cost problem for storing petabytes worth of data, the associat ed drives usually exhibit relatively poor performance and reliability characteristics. Redundant tile striping has been proposed to address some of these issues without conclusive success. This paper proposes, analyzes, demonstrates performance optimization techniques for parallel tape array architecture that alleviate the problems associated with previous proposals, and renders tape striping a favorable architectural choice than non-stripe under small concurrency (under 5) for ahnost all significant request sizes, the type of workload expected by tertiary memory systems.
