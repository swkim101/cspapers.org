A logic partitioning procedure for computer aided design of LSI's which gets solutions by interchanging clusters is described. The procedure of generating clusters has some distinct features which assure that the clusters are suitable as units for interchanging. The cluster concept gives the Kernighan and Lin algorithm foresight and efficiency, and because of these, iteration of interchanging leads to a good solution.
 Results of partition for a variety of LSI's obtained with the program of this procedure are detailed. The solutions obtained with the program are compared with the manual solutions, and the quality of the procedure is confirmed to be as good as, or better than, that of manual design. The CPU time is within a reasonable value.
