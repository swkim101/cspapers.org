We present a novel scheme for wordbased Japanese typed dependency parser which integrates syntactic structure analysis and grammatical function analysis such as predicate-argument structure analysis. Compared to bunsetsu-based dependency parsing, which is predominantly used in Japanese NLP, it provides a natural way of extracting syntactic constituents, which is useful for downstream applications such as statistical machine translation. It also makes it possible to jointly decide dependency and predicate-argument structure, which is usually implemented as two separate steps. We convert an existing treebank to the new dependency scheme and report parsing results as a baseline for future research. We achieved a better accuracy for assigning function labels than a predicate-argument structure analyzer by using grammatical functions as dependency label.
