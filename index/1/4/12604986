Given unlimited computational resources, it is best to use a criterion of minimal expected generalisation error to select a model and determine its parameters. However, it may be worthwhile to sacrifice some generalisation performance for higher learning speed. A method for quantifying sub-optimality is set out here, so that this choice can be made intelligently. Furthermore, the method is applicable to a broad class of models, including the ultra-fast memory-based methods such as RAMnets. This brings the added benefit of providing, for the first time, the means to analyse the generalisation properties of such models in a Bayesian framework.
