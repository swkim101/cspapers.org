We demonstrate CarbonDB, a web application for Life Cycle Inventory data management. Life Cycle Assessment provides a well-accepted methodology for modelling environmental impacts of human activities. This methodology relies on the decomposition of a studied system into interdependent processes in a phase called Life Cycle Inventory. Several organisations provide processes databases containing thousands of processes with their interdependency links. The usual workflow to manage those databases is based on the manipulation of individual processes, which turns out to be a very harnessing work even if there are strong semantic similarities between the involved processes. In previous publications, we proposed a new workflow for LCA inventory databases maintenance based on the addition of semantic information to the processes they contained. This method considerably eases the modeling process and offers a synthetic view of the dependencies links. We created a web application based on this approach composed of a back-end for data management and a front-end for searching processes and visualize the dependencies links in a graph.
