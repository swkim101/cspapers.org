We propose a total framework for the software development stages of specification (definition), design and coding. This framework is based on three cornerstones: (a) the concept of software development graphs which specify all the stages and steps of development; (b) the use of formal methods, in our case VDM, the Vienna Software Development Method, in all stages and steps of development; and (c) the clearly separate r√¥les of theoretical computer scientists, programmers, software engineers, and development managers in all aspects of software development. Thus not only programming is formalised (ie. programs considered formal objects), but also development, its engineering and management (ie. the entire programming itself is also considered a formal object about which to reason).
