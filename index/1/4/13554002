In the scope of the TELRI concerted action a working group is investigating the formation of a tool catalogue and repository. The idea is similar to that of the ACL Natural Language Software Registry, but the contents should be mostly limited to corpus processing tools available free of cost for research use. The catalogue should also offer a help-line for installing and using the software. The paper reports on the setup of this catalogue, and concentrates on the technical issues involved in its creation, storage and display. This involves the form interface on the Web, the XML DocBook encoding, and the XSL stylesheets used to present the catalogue either on the Web or in print. The paper lists the current entries in the catalogue and discusses plans for their expansion and maintenance.
