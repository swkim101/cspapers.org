The value of a computer system to its users is greatly enhanced if a user can, in a simple and general way, build his work upon procedures developed by others. The attainment of this essential generality requires that a computer system possess the features of equipment-independent addressing, an effectively infinite virtual memory, and provision for the dynamic linking of shared procedure and data objects. The paper explains how these features are realized in the Multics system.
