The generation of the optimal walking pattern is an important question for a biped robot to keep walking stably. This paper is proposed for generating the walking patterns resulted in best performance of the biped robot using multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. We formulate a trajectory generation problem as a multi-objective optimal problem. We obtain all Pareto-optimal solutions on the feasible solution region for various walking pattern generation of a biped robot in EA simulation.
