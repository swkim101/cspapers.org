Information retrieval components are currently incorporated in several types of information systems, including bibliographic retrieval systems, data base management systems and question-answering systems. Some of the problems arising in the real-time environment in which these systems operate are briefly discussed. Certain recent advances in information retrieval research are then mentioned, including the formulation of new probabilistic retrieval models, and the development of automatic document analysis and Boolean query processing techniques.
