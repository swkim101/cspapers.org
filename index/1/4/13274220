This paper presents a search architecture that combines classical search techniques with spread activation techniques applied to a semantic model of a given domain. Given an ontology, weights are assigned to links based on certain properties of the ontology, so that they measure the strength of the relation. Spread activation techniques are used to find related concepts in the ontology given an initial set of concepts and corresponding initial activation values. These initial values are obtained from the results of classical search applied to the data associated with the concepts in the ontology. Two test cases were implemented, with very positive results. It was also observed that the proposed hybrid spread activation, combining the symbolic and the sub-symbolic approaches, achieved better results when compared to each of the approaches alone.
