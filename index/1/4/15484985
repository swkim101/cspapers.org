The transmission system of the Utah/MIT Dextrous Hand (UMDH) is investigated theoretically and experimentally. It is shown that the friction of the routing pulleys is not negligible and should be considered in the force control of the UMDH. In the frequency range of the pneumatic actuators (80 Hz), tendons act like springs and the first mode of the tendons is above that frequency range.<<ETX>>
