One of the open problems listed in Rivest and Schapire is whether and how that the copies of L in their algorithm can be com bined into one for better performance This paper describes an algorithm called D that does that combination The idea is to represent the states of the learned model using observable symbols as well as hidden symbols that are con structed during learning These hidden sym bols are created to re ect the distinct behaviors of the model states The distinct behaviors are represented as local distinguishing experiments LDEs not to be confused with global distin guishing sequences and these LDEs are cre ated when the learner s prediction mismatches the actual observation from the unknown ma chine To synchronize the model with the en vironment these LDEs can also be concate nated to form a homing sequence It can be shown that D can learn with probability a model that is an approximation of the unknown machine in a number of actions polynomial in the size of the environment and log
