Augmented reality applications are gaining popularity due to increased capabilities of modern mobile devices. However, existing applications are tightly integrated with backend services that expose content using proprietary interfaces. We demonstrate an architecture that allows visualization of web content in augmented and mirror world applications, based on open web protocols and formats. We describe two clients, one for creating virtual artifacts, web resources that bind together web content with location and a 3D model, and one that visualizes the virtual artifacts in the mirror world.
