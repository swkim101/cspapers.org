In this paper, we apply General Order Statistics (GOS) theorem for the antenna selection in dual-hop amplify-forward fixed-gain relay transmission. The antenna selection is employed at multi-antenna relay terminal for both receiving and transmission. The closed-form expressions of SNR (Signal-to-Noise-Ratio) statistics such as CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function), PDF (Probability Density Function), MGF (Moment Generating Function) and Generalized Moments were derived. The statistics were then used for performance analysis in terms of outage probability and error rate. The expressions are new and specialize to earlier results. The analysis is confirmed with computer simulation. The results facilitate to quantify the performance loss when lower order antenna is selected for the relay links.
