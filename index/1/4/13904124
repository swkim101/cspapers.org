Game theory has been playing an increasingly visible role in computer science in general and AI in particular, most notably in the area of multi agent systems. I briefly list the areas where most of the action has been in the past decade or so. I then suggest that going forward, the most dramatic interaction between computer science and game theory - with a special role for AI - could be around what might be called game theory pragmatics.
