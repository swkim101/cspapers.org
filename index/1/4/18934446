Most of today's web content is designed for human consumption, which makes it difficult for software tools to access them readily. Even web content that is automatically generated from back-end databases is usually presented without the original structural information. In this paper, we present an automated information extraction algorithm that can extract the relevant attribute-value pairs from product descriptions across different sites. A notion, called structural-semantic entropy, is used to locate the data of interest on web pages, which measures the density of occurrence of relevant information on the DOM tree representation of web pages. Our approach is less labor-intensive and insensitive to changes in web-page format. Experimental results on a large number of real-life web page collections are encouraging and confirm the feasibility of the approach, which has been successfully applied to detect false drug advertisements on the web due to its capacity in associating the attributes of records with their respective values.
