This paper proposes the concept, and explains the characteristics, of a new group robot "Gunryu", each segment of which has autonomy but at the same time moves and operates cooperatively with the other segments. Next, the mechanisms of a primary model, GR-1, which is comprised of two prototype robot units, are introduced and the conditions for operational experiments are given.<<ETX>>
