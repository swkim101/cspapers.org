This papers presents an application of interval analysis to a 3D reconstruction problem. The aim is to build a partial boundaries representation of an object including guaranteed information according to the camera model. Features points coordinates are described using intervals. This representation is used together with a method to search stereo correspondence based on the connectivity of segments.
