In this demonstration, we present the Text-enabled Humanitarian Operations in Real-time (THOR) framework, which is being prototyped to provide visual and analytical situational awareness to humanitarian and disaster relief (HADR) planners. THOR is a collaborative effort between industrial and university research laboratories, designed with an intent to support both military and civilian HADR operations. At its core, THOR is powered by a domain-specific knowledge graph, which is derived from natural language outputs and is amenable to real-time analytics. THOR is designed to operate in low-resource linguistic environments, process heterogeneous data, including news and social media, reason about arbitrary disasters not knowable in advance, and provide advanced graphical interaction capabilities. We will demo the latest prototype of THOR using an interactive case study situation.
