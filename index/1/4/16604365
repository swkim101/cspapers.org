In this paper we present a new model for instrumenting a process on the fly. We describe a command line tool developed by our research group based on our instrumentation library, Dyninst. With this model the user no longer needs to have a full set of mutations planned out ahead of time. The command line interface allows the user to mutate a process, gather data, and generate new mutations while the mutatee is running. This model effectively allows the user to put off most of the decisions about what mutations to insert into a mutatee until run-time, and allows the user to take a more active role in analyzing the data that comes back from the mutatee.
