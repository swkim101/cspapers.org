With the rapidly increasing popularity of Social Media sites, a lot of user generated content has been injected in the Web, thus resulting in a large amount of both multimedia items (music - Last.fm, MySpace.com, pictures - Flickr, Picasa, videos - YouTube) and textual data (tags and other text-based documents). As a consequence, especially for multimedia content it has become more and more difficult to find exactly the objects that best match the users' information needs. The methods we propose in this paper try to alleviate this problem and we focus on the domain of pictures, in particular on a subset of Flickr data. Many of the photos posted by users on Flickr have been shot during events and our methods aim to allow browsing and organization of picture collections in a natural way, by events. The algorithms we introduce in this paper exploit the social information produced by users in form of tags, titles and photo descriptions, for classifying pictures into different event categories. The extensive automated experiments demonstrate that our approach is very effective and opens new possibilities for multimedia retrieval, in particular image search. Moreover, the direct comparison with previous event detection algorithms confirm once more the quality of our methods.
