We demonstrate a simple RFID sensor network comprised of an Intel WISP and a commodity UHF RFID reader. WISPs are devices that gather their operating energy from RFID reader transmissions, in the manner of passive RFID tags, and further include sensors, e.g., accelerometers, and provide a very small-scale computing platform. We believe that the small form factor and lack of battery makes the WISP an attractive alternative to motes for many of the original smart dust applications that require very small or long-lived sensors. The Intel WISP that we demonstrate has an ultra-low-power microcontroller, 32K of program space, 8K of flash, and accelerometer and temperature sensors. It harvests power from and communicates sensor data to standard (EPC Class 1 Gen 2) UHF RFID readers with a range of roughly 10 feet. This combination of RFID technology and sensor networks raises many research challenges, such as how to function with intermittent power and how to modify RFID protocols to support sensor queries.
