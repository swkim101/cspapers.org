This paper formally presents a class of planning problems which allows non-binary state variables and parallel execution of actions. The class is proven to be tractable, and we provide a sound and complete polynomial time algorithm for planning within this class. This result means that we are getting closed to tackling realistic planning problems in sequential control, where a restricted problem representation is often sufficient, but where the size of the problems make tractability an important issue.
