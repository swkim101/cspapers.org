An assumption fundamental to almost all work on supervised classification is that the probabilities of class membership, conditional on the feature vectors, are stationary. However, in many situations this assumption is untenable. We give examples of such population drift, examine its nature, show how the impact of population drift depends on the chosen measure of classification performance, and propose a strategy for dynamically updating classification rules.
