This system offers a new approach to control home appliances from a remote terminal, with an option from a local server, using the Internet and radio connection. This system is accomplished by personal computers, interface cards, radio transmitters and receivers, microprocessors, ac phase control circuits, along with window-type software and microprocessor control software. The system is designed to control home appliances' on/off, to regulate their output power, and to set their usage timing. The prototype of this system was tested and responded successfully, which verifies the feasibility of this system's theory and concept
