Computer engineering embodies the science and technology of design, construction, implementation, and maintenance of hardware and software components of modern computer systems and computer-controlled equipment. Computer engineers have strong foundations in the theories and principles of computing, mathematics, and engineering. They apply these principles to the design of hardware, software, networks, and computerized equipment and instruments to solve technical problems in diverse application domains. Continuing dramatic advances in computing and digital systems design have created opportunities for computer engineering professionals to apply those developments to the entire range of applications in engineering.
