ACCLAIM—<underline>A</underline>utomated <underline>C</underline>ircuit <underline>C</underline>ard <underline>L</underline>ayout <underline>a</underline>nd <underline>Im</underline>plementation—is a family of computer programs, written in FORTRAN IV, which reduces Boolean equations to logical elements, translates the logical elements to physically realizable gates, synthesizes the gates into a switching network, and topologically configures a printed circuit card. It then determines the connection signal paths and produces artwork which is photographically processed into an etching template.
