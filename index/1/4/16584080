Advances in computational, storage and network technologies as well as middle ware such as the Globus Toolkit allow scientists to expand the sophistication and scope of data-intensive applications. These applications produce and analyze terabytes and petabytes of data that are distributed in millions of files or objects. To manage these large data sets efficiently, metadata or descriptive information about the data needs to be managed. There are various types of metadata, and it is likely that a range of metadata services will exist in Grid environments that are specialized for particular types of metadata cataloguing and discovery. In this paper, we present the design of a Metadata Catalog Service (MCS) that provides a mechanism for storing and accessing descriptive metadata and allows users to query for data items based on desired attributes. We describe our experience in using the MCS with several applications and present a scalability study of the service.
