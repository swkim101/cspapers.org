Text-based Captchas have been widely deployed across the Internet to defend against undesirable or malicious bot programs. Many attacks have been proposed; these fine prior art advanced the scientific understanding of Captcha robustness, but most of them have a limited applicability. In this paper, we report a simple, low-cost but powerful attack that effectively breaks a wide range of text Captchas with distinct design features, including those deployed by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Amazon and other Internet giants. For all the schemes, our attack achieved a success rate ranging from 5% to 77%, and achieved an average speed of solving a puzzle in less than 15 seconds on a standard desktop computer (with a 3.3GHz Intel Core i3 CPU and 2 GB RAM). This is to date the simplest generic attack on text Captchas. Our attack is based on Log-Gabor filters; a famed application of Gabor filters in computer security is John Daugmanâ€™s iris recognition algorithm. Our work is the first to apply Gabor filters for breaking Captchas.
