Due to a high number of open source software over the internet, it is a challenge to determine which one - over a verity of alternatives - is the most appropriate for our intended needs. In this paper, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique along with the ISO 9126 will be integrated and applied to the selection process of open source software products. Thus, the intended features (i.e. the ISO 9126 quality characteristics) need to be identified in order to be taken into account to give a set of ranks for the intended open source software, that is, 'rank one' will be given to the most appropriate open source software product based on its intended features against the other alternatives of open source software products.
