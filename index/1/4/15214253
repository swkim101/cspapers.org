We introduce a family of simple and fast algorithms for solving the classical string matching problem, string matching with don't care symbols and complement symbols, and multiple patterns. In addition we solve the same problems allowing up to k mismatches. Among the features of these algorithms are that they are real time algorithms, they don't need to buffer the input, and they are suitable to be implemented in hardware.
