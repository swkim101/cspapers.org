In this paper we propose a single-pass strip-based watershed segmentation using multibank memory. This watershed segmentation is based on rainfall simulation and is targeted for low memory applications whereby only a small amount of memory is needed for processing at any one time. Using multiple memory banks for storage also ensures that clock cycles for memory accesses are kept to a minimum.
