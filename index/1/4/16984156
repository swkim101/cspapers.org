In public places we can observe that many conventional displays are replaced by digital displays, a lot of them networked. These displays mainly show advertising in a similar way to television's commercial break not exploiting the opportunities of the new medium [1]. Several approaches of interaction between mobile devices and public displays have been investigated over the last 15 years. In this demo we concentrate on challenges that are specific to public displays used for advertising. In particular we focus on how new approaches for interaction with content, means for content creation, and tools for follow-ups can be implemented based on mobile devices. With Digifieds we present a research system that has been used to explore different research questions and to showcase the potential of interactive advertising in public space.
