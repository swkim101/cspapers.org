This paper presents a general vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) formulation for the problem of learning an unknown functional dependency between a structured input space and a structured output space, in the Semi-Supervised Learning setting. Our formulation includes as special cases Vector-valued Manifold Regularization and Multi-view Learning, thus provides in particular a unifying framework linking these two important learning approaches. In the case of least square loss function, we provide a closed form solution with an efficient implementation. Numerical experiments on challenging multi-class categorization problems show that our multi-view learning formulation achieves results which are comparable with state of the art and are significantly better than single-view learning.
