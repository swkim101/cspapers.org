Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) mostly work off-line, without any direct runtime interaction or coordination with the applications (and with other IDSs) that they aim to protect. Including intrusion detection and response in the repertoire of an adaptive application extends its range of adaptivity and increases its chances for survival. In this paper we show how intrusion detection and response can be used to build agile, intrusion-aware applications under the Quality Objects (QuO) adaptive distributed middleware framework.
