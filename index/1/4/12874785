The need for e-learning systems that support a diverse set of pedagogical requirements has been identified as an important issue in web-based education. Until now, significant R&D effort has been devoted aiming towards web-based educational systems tailored to specific pedagogical approaches. The most advanced of them are based on the IEEE Learning Technology Systems Architecture and use standardized content structuring based on the ADL Sharable Content Object Reference Model in order to enable sharing and reusability of the learning content. However, sharing of learning activities among different web-based educational systems still remains an open issue. The open question is how web-based educational systems should be designed in order to enable reusing and repurposing of learning activities. In this paper we propose an authoring system, refered to as ASK-LDT that utilizes the Learning Design principles to provide the means for designing activity-based learning services and systems.
