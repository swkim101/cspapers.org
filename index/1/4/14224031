Continuously understanding a user's location context in colloquial terms and the paths that connect the locations unlocks many opportunities for emerging applications. While extensive research effort has been made on efficiently tracking a user's raw coordinates, few attempts have been made to efficiently provide everyday contextual information about these locations as places and paths. We introduce SensLoc, a practical location service to provide such contextual information, abstracting location as place visits and path travels from sensor signals. SensLoc comprises of a robust place detection algorithm, a sensitive movement detector, and an on-demand path tracker. Based on a user's mobility, SensLoc proactively controls active cycle of a GPS receiver, a WiFi scanner, and an accelerometer. Pilot studies show that SensLoc can correctly detect 94% of the place visits, track 95% of the total travel distance, and still only consume 13% of energy than algorithms that periodically collect coordinates to provide the same information.
