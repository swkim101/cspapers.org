Integrated Solution Engineering helps developers manage software complexity by offering semi-automated support for capturing and mining relationships among artifacts and/or developer tasks at different stages of the software lifecycle, and by aiding developers in the use and management of the information contained in these relationships. The use of these relationships can facilitate traceability, propagation of change, change impact analysis, evolution, and comprehension.
