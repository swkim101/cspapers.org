One of the most powerful application of computers is to capture data during an experiment, to analyze the data and calculate results, and to present the results in a meaningful graphical form. Undergraduate engineering students need to become familiar and comfortable with this type of use of computers in the laboratory. With the support of an NSF CSIP grant 1 we have used the application software LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Workbench), running on the Macintosh computer, to enable our students, primarily electrical and mechanical engineering juniors and seniors, to carry out the entire sequence of automating the collection and presentation of laboratory data. Using high-level application software, along with the use of a standard instrumentation computer interface, the IEEE488 instrument protocol, allows students to concentrate their efforts on analyzing and presenting results, rather than spending their time on details of data transfer. From a Computer Science point of view these students learn to use an application package that exhibits many goals of software engineering: program modularity; information hiding; use of program libraries; reusable programs; emphasis on the human interface of the program. They accomplish this in a workstation environment.
