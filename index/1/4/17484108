Many data stream monitoring applications involve rank queries and hence a number of efficient evaluation algorithms are proposed recently. Most of these techniques assume that rank queries are executed directly over the whole data space. However, we observe that many applications often require to perform clustering over the data streams before rank queries are run on each cluster. To address the problem, we propose a novel algorithm for integral clustering and ranking processing and we refer to such integrated queries as cluster-based rank queries. The algorithm includes two phases, namely the online phase which maintains the required data structures and statistics, and the query phase which uses these data structures to process queries. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm is efficient in both space consumption and query processing.
