The quest for a linear-time single-source shortest-path (SSSP) algorithm on directed graphs with positive edge weights is an ongoing hot research topic. While Thorup recently found an <i>&Ogr;</i>(<i>n</i> + <i>m</i>) time RAM algorithm for undirected graphs with <i>n</i> nodes, <i>m</i> edges and integer edge weights in {0,…,2<sup>w</sup> - 1} where <i>w</i> denotes the word length, the currently best time bound for directed sparse graphs on a RAM is <i>&Ogr;</i>(<i>n</i> + <i>m</i> · log log <i>n</i>).
In the present paper we study the average-case complexity of SSSP. We give a simple algorithm for arbitrary directed graphs with random edge weights uniformly distributed in [0, 1] and show that it needs linear time <i>&Ogr;</i>(<i>n</i> + <i>m</i>) with high probability.
