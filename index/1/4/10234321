WIA-PA is one of two IEC open wireless standards for the industrial process automation. In this demonstration we build a fully operational WIA-PA network and illustrate how to interconnect WIA-PA network with PLC system. We show the construction of the network, the process of configuring WIA-PA through existed PLC system, protocol and data transfer, and flow of data for a process monitoring and control application. This demonstration network serves as a proof of the WIA-PA standard viability and as a platform for our future research and experiments.
