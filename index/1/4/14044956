This paper describes how colored Petri nets can be used for modeling the Paris underground Metro system. This is one of the most complex metro systems in the world. In this paper, the metro system is analyzed and described. The method of analysis is outlined. A working model for three of the major lines was constructed using CPNs. The results and other issues that have to be tackled are explained.
