In this paper I want to describe how I have used MCHART in beginning to construct a parser for gr-mm-rs expressed in PSG, and how aspects of the chart parsing approach in general and MCHART in particular have made it easy to acco~mmodate two significant aspects of PSG: rule schemata involving variables over categories; and compound category symbols ("slash" categories). To do this I will briefly introduce the basic ideas of chart parsing; describe the salient aspects of MEHART; give an overview of PSG; and finally present the interesting aspects of the parser I am building for PSG using MCHART. Limitations of space, time, and will mean that all of these sections will be brief and sketchy I hope to produce a much expanded version at a later date.
