Component-based technologies and processes have been deployed in many organizations and in many fields over the past several years. However, modeling, reasoning about, and predicting component and system properties remains challenging in theory and in practice. CBSE6 builds on previous workshops in the ICSE/CBSE series, and in 2003 is thematically centered on automated composition theories. Composition theories support reasoning about, and predicting, the runtime properties of assemblies of components. Automation is a practical necessity for applying composition theories in practice. Emphasis is placed in this workshop on composition theories that are well founded theoretically, are verifiable or falsifiable, automated by tools, and supported by practical evaluation.
