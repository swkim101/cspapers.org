We show how node ordering can be combined with parallel window search to quickly find a nearly optimal solution to single-agent problems. First, we show how node ordering by maximum g among nodes with equal I = g + h values can improve the performance of IDA*. We then consider a window search where different processes perform IDA* simultaneously on the same problem but with different cost thresholds. Finally, we combine the two ideas to produce a parallel window search algorithm in which node ordering information is shared among the different processes. Parallel window search can be used to find a nearly optimal solution quickly, improve the solution until it is optimal, and then finally guarantee optimality, depending on the amount of time available.
