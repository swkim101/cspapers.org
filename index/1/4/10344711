Temporal and spatial information in text documents is often expressed in a qualitative way. Moreover, both are frequently affected by vagueness, calling for appropriate extensions of traditional frameworks for qualitative reasoning about time and space. Our research aims at defining such extensions based on fuzzy set theory, and applying the resulting frameworks to two important kinds of intelligent information retrieval, viz. temporal question answering and geographic information retrieval.
