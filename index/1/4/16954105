The Sequoia computer utilizes a modular, tightly-coupled multiprocessor architecture, with hardware faultdetection and software fault-recovery to achieve high degrees of reliability, availability, and data integrity. The computer comprises from one to sixtyfour processor elements (PE), and from two to one hundred twenty-eight memory elements (ME) and I/O processing elements (IOE). Configurations can be tailored to meet the needs of the applications; there are no fixed ratios of PEs to MEs or IOEs. Configuration changes can be made while the system is on-line.
