We present an image-based 3D reconstruction pipeline for acquiring geo-referenced semi-dense 3D models. Multiple overlapping images captured from a micro aerial vehicle platform provide a highly redundant source for multi-view reconstructions. Publicly available geo-spatial information sources are used to obtain an approximation to a digital surface model (DSM). Models obtained by the semi-dense reconstruction are automatically aligned to the DSM to allow the integration of highly detailed models into the original DSM and to provide geographic context.
