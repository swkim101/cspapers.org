Research in file organization is a problem in which the unstructured efforts of many individual researchers have not produced results commensurate with the effort expended. The paper briefly examines some of the reasons for this and suggests a structure consisting of a language and terminology for communication, a model of information processing systems and tools for studying and analyzing problems related to such systems. The ISDOS project is outlined as a coordinated approach which may serve as the beginning in the development of a satisfactory structure.
