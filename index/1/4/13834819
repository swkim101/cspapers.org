Demarcation of the border between solvable and unsolvable distributed tdis under various models is the holy grail of the theory of distributed computing. Oneof the most celebrated of theseresults is [6] (FLP) which established the impossibility of asynchronous consensus that can tolerate a single undetected fail-stop processor. This paper generalizes FLP to multiple faults. It establishes that k-set consensus proposed by Chaudhuri is impossible, if the protocol is to tolerate k failures, while there exists a protocol that tolerates k – 1 failures. Our proof technique is completely different than the one employed in [6]. We introduce a new model of computation, the im112ecliate-atoY12 ic-.s?2u~)shot. We fully characterize the graph of waitfree views within the model. Applying a variant of Sperner Lemma to this graph establishes the impossibility of k + 1 processors achieving waitfree k-set consensus. Finally, we introduce a new notion of nonblocking-busy-wait agreement protocol, With this ● Work supported by NSF Presiciential Young Iavest,igator Award under grant DCR84-51396 .
