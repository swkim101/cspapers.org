We propose a domain adaptation framework, and formally prove that it generalizes the feature augmentation technique in (DaumÂ´e III, 2007) and the multi-task regularization framework in (Evgeniou and Pontil, 2004). We show that our framework is strictly more general than these approaches and allows practitioners to tune hyper-parameters to encourage transfer between close domains and avoid negative transfer between distant ones.
