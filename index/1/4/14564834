A non-procedural query language for network databases is described. The language is very powerful as compared to other implemented languages. It allows to formulate complex queries which, among other things, include conditions for CODASYL-sets and conditions for n:m-relationships. Cyclic database structures can be processed to some extent.Note: This report is not written for the "naive" user of NOAH, and is not meant to replace a NOAH manual. Instead, this report describes the foundations, the underlying concepts, and the structure of the language in more theoretically oriented, technical terms.This research was performed at the university of Hagen, West Germany, and was partially supported by Triumph Adler AG, NÃ¼rnberg, West Germany.
