Most Web pages contain temporal information, which can be utilized by search engines to improve searching performance for users. However, traditional search engines have little support in processing temporal-textual Web queries. Aiming at solving this problem, in this paper we present and implement a prototype system for time-sensitive queries, which is called TASE (Time-Aware Search Engine). TASE extracts both the explicit and implicit temporal expressions for each Web page, and calculates the relevant score between the Web page and each temporal expression, and then re-rank search results based on the temporal-textual relevance between Web pages and the queries. It is demonstrated that TASE can improve the effectiveness of temporal-textual Web queries.
