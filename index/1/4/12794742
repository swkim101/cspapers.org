A previous work proposed a method which can change a predicate encryption supporting inner product (IPE) scheme into a public key encryption with conjunctive keyword search (PECK) or public key encryption with disjunctive keyword search (PEDK) scheme. However, there are two problems in this method. The one is that the PEDK scheme based on this method has low efficiency on the time and space complexity. The other is that the PECK scheme and the PEDK scheme generated by using this approach can not be combine into one scheme which can support both conjunctive and disjunctive keyword search over encrypted data. To mitigate these concerns, we propose a method for constructing a scheme called public key encryption with conjunctive and disjunctive keyword search (PECDK), and give an instance. The comparison shows that our scheme can solve two problems mentioned above efficiently.
