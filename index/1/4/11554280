Informative Workspace is one of the new practices launched in the second edition of "Extreme Programming Explained" [1]. To follow this practice, an agile team builds feedback mechanisms around them that support them in their daily work. These feedback mechanisms can take the form of visual displays, Information Radiators [2], which are manually updated by the team, or electronic eXtreme Feedback Devices [3] (XFD), such as lava lamps or audio signals linked to automated processes. It is vital to ensure that feedback mechanisms are easy to interpret, low maintenance and adapted to local working practices. This workshop will gather and share experiences on how to develop and maintain an Informative Workspace.
