Philosophical Approach to Spatial Allocation Procedures 
 Basically, the philosophy behind the development of this program, called ALOKAT, and its predecessors was that we ought not to try to be mind-readers. Mind reading is something that human beings are notoriously bad at. By having a spatial equivalent of our functional criteria, we have in essence set up a physical counterpart of abstract relationships as a meaningful start to a dialogue. No longer must we be content with each others mental maps. Instead we can point to a solution and whether that solution initially is right or wrong at least it is there.
 What do these spatial allocation programs do? They are an attempt to organize space in a two dimensional way to best satisfy the constraints of a problem. Now they do not do it in a mathematical sense because they do not deal with points in space but rather with entities that have actual dimensions.
