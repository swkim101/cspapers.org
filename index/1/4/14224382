The rolling motion of a soft robotic fingertip is in this paper explicitly included in the control objectives together with the force/position regulation targets. A model based control law is proposed to linearize and decouple the system with respect to the force/position and sliding dynamics based on an appropriately defined task Jacobian. The controller is validated by simulations including rolling on a stationary surface and graspless manipulation of a flat object.
