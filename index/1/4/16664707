This paper proposes how to effectively retrieve the mathematical equations when the plain words are given as a query. The proposed system requires no complicated mathematical symbols, no particular input tool and no constraint of query. Users can enter a query with plain words like the traditional Information Retrieval. For this, we extract features from the plain texts that are converted from the real math equations. Experimental results show an outstanding performance, a MRR of 0.6585.
