To enhance the quality of document search, recent research studies have started to exploit the social networks of users by considering social influence (SI), measurement of the affinity between a query user and the publisher of a retrieved document, in addition to the commonly used textual relevance (TR). We refer to such document search that considers social networks as social web search. In this paper, we focus on efficient top-k social web search and propose two search strategies: (i) TR-based search and (ii) SI-based search that tailor document examination orders upon TR and SI, respectively. We evaluate the proposed strategies through experimentation.
