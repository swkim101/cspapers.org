A new global register allocation technique, probabilistic register allocation, is described. Probabilistic register allocation quantifies the costs and benefits of allocating variables to registers over live ranges so that excellent allocation choices can be made. Local allocation is done first, and then global allocation is done iteratively beginning in the most deeply nested loops. Because local allocation precedes global allocation, probabilistic allocation does not interfere with the use of well-known, high-quality local register allocation and instruction scheduling techniques.
