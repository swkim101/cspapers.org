Sensor fusion combines multiple sensor measurements to improve a controller's knowledge about the internal state of an observed physical environment. Many such sensor fusion techniques exist and have been implemented for the Robot Operating System (ROS). However, they often have been developed for specific applications and cannot be easily reused for other applications. Reasons are the use of application-specific, partly undocumented interfaces, and the often limited reconfigurability caused by a tight coupling of the implementation to an application-specific purpose. Our approach is based on the concept of a fusion node which provides a configurable sensor fusion service with a generic interface. Fusion nodes can be interconnected to combine several sensor fusion techniques, can be attached to any single-dimension value sensor, can handle asynchronous multi-rate measurements and are robust regarding indeterministic, best-effort communication. This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first generic sensor fusion package (GSFP) for ROS which collects various exemplary sensor fusion methods implemented as fusion nodes. We demonstrate the feasibility of our package in a small test application. Main benefits of our contribution are the developed ROS package's independence regarding specific sensors or applications, the easy integration of configurable fusion nodes in existing applications, and the composition of fusion nodes to realize complex sensor fusion scenarios.
