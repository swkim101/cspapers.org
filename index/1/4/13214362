A general simulation program for LSI devices is described. The program provides functional simulation capability as well as the ability to simulate chip interface timing. Chip modeling utilizes chip input/output specifications and timing diagrams. Construction and coding of the model is a process very much akin to assembly language programming. GSP is a program suitable for the simulation of LSI devices as it allows for a manageable amount of detail in model descriptions and can simulate with an efficiency that is adequate for system validation activities.
