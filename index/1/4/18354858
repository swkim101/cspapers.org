Recently, many protocols in the Internet are proposing the use of public key cryptography in support of integrity and authentication security services. However, each of these protocols lacks a globally available public key distribution and management system. A secure version of the Domain Name System (DNS) is being developed which, conveniently, provides an infrastructure ideally suited for the distribution and management of public keys. We propose how this infrastructure of the secure DNS could be exploited by today's users of the Internet to distribute and manage their personal public keys.
