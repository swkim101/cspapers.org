Pointers or references can be identified as the root cause of many fundamental problems in current programming languages, typically resulting in unspecified object dependencies and missing hierarchical encapsulation. We therefore propose to abandon references from the language and to use expressive program relations instead. For this purpose, we have developed a programming language which is only based on hierarchical composition and interface connections.
