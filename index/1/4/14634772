New methods and new systems are needed to lter or to selectively distribute the increasing volume of electronic information being produced nowadays. An e ective information ltering system is one that provides the exact information that ful lls a user's interest with the minimum e ort by the user to describe it. Such a system will have to be adaptive to the user changing interest. In this paper we present a learning system for information ltering and selective information dissemination. The learning algorithm is described and the e ectiveness of the system is evaluated in a true information ltering style.
