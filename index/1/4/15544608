Due to the concept of smart city being gradually prevailed in recent years, the wireless routing algorithm for Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks is an important research for data collecting network, which is used for managing and collecting sensing data in the city. Chiu and Chen proposed an adaptive link-list routing algorithm with wormhole mechanism. The algorithm is a low collision wireless protocol, which is suitable for data collection systems such as intelligent street lighting, smart meters and smart appliances. In the algorithm some unstable status may be occurred due to the environmental interference and the inappropriate design of the protocol. In this paper, we proposed a rescuing algorithm for link-list wireless network with wormhole mechanism to overcome some problems in the link-list network, such as the node losing problem, the path-optimized construction problem and the acknowledge packet confliction problem. We use the network simulation-3 to verify the efficacy of the rescuing algorithm. The results prove that the recuing algorithm can solve the routing problem of the link-list network and help the link-list network to transfer the data quickly. The results show that the link-list network with the rescuing algorithm can build a stable and rapid data collecting network system.
