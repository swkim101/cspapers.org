Entering 'Football Players from United States' when searching for 'American Footballers' is an example of vocabulary mismatch, which occurs when different words are used to express the same concepts. In order to address this phenomenon for entity search targeting descriptors for complex categories, we propose a compositional-distributional semantics entity search engine, which extracts semantic and commonsense knowledge from large-scale corpora to address the vocabulary gap between query and data.
