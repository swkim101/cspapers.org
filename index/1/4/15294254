The evaluation of tourism crisis would have significant meanings to encounter crisis and recover from it, also can be served as decision reference to relevant managers and officials. Currently researchers usually make the evaluation of tourism crisis on the aid of complex indexes system, surplus researchers’ subjective judgment. On considering the characteristics of tourism crisis, many variables can’t be easily quantified, thus we adopt new method to evaluate tourism crisis. On combining fuzzy logics with BP algorithms to build FNNs, the model enjoys the advantages both in processing vague and uncertainty information and in good learning abilities. On analyzing the logics of fuzzy theory and BP artificial network, and on the aid of DPS v9.5 software, the implementation of FNNs in tourism crisis evaluation is also be made to show the fitness of FNNs in tourism crisis evaluation.
