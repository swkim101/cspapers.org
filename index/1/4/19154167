This gives rise to the resolution mismatch problem when matched against the high resolution (HR) gallery images (typically available in enrolment), which adversely affects the performance of person re-identification (re-id) that aims to associate images of the same person captured at different locations and different time. Most existing re-id methods either ignore this problem or simply upscale LR images. In this work, we address this problem by developing a novel approach called Super-resolution and Identity joiNt learninG (SING) to simultaneously optimise image super-resolution and person re-id matching. This approach is instantiated by designing a hybrid deep Convolutional Neural Network for improving cross-resolution re-id performance. We further introduce an adaptive fusion algorithm for accommodating multi-resolution LR images. Extensive evaluations show the advantages of our method over related state-of-the-art re-id and super-resolution methods on cross-resolution re-id benchmarks.
