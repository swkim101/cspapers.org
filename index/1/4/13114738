In this paper, we propose a method for compiling travel information automatically. For the compilation, we focus on travel blogs, which are defined as travel journals written by bloggers in diary form. We consider that travel blogs are a useful information source for obtaining travel information, because many bloggers' travel experiences are written in this form. Therefore, we identified travel blogs in a blog database and extracted travel information from them. We have confirmed the effectiveness of our method by experiment. For the identification of travel blogs, we obtained scores of 38.1% for Recall and 86.7% for Precision. In the extraction of travel information from travel blogs, we obtained 74.0% for Precision at the top 100 extracted local products, thereby confirming that travel blogs are a useful source of travel information.
