Reliable classiﬁers abstain from uncertain instance classiﬁcations. In this paper we extend our previous approach to construct reliable classiﬁers which is based on isometrics in Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) space. We analyze the conditions to obtain a reliable classiﬁer with higher performance than previously possible. Our results show that the approach is generally applicable to boost performance on each class simultaneously. Moreover, the approach is able to construct a classiﬁer with at least a desired performance per class.
