This paper investigates the application of the execution time theory of software reliability [1,2] to operational computation center software. A brief review of software reliability concepts is provided. Studies of individual operating system components are discussed, as well as a functional subsystem. This work is based on data taken at a large operating computation center over a period of 15 months.
