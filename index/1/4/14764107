In this paper, we propose a new variational framework for computing continuous curve skeletons from discrete objects that are suitable for structural shape representation. We have derived a new energy function, which is proportional to some medialness function, such that the minimum cost path between any two medial voxels in the shape is a curve skeleton. We have employed two different medialness functions; the Euclidean distance field and a variant of the magnitude of the gradient vector flow (GVF), resulting in two different energy functions. The first energy controls the identification of the shape topological nodes from which curve skeletons start, while the second one controls the extraction of curve skeletons. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework are validated both quantitatively and qualitatively against competing techniques as well as several 3D shapes of different complexity.
