Five independently generated Boolean query formulations for ten different TREC topics were produced by ten different expert online searchers. These different formulations were grouped, and the groups, and combinations of them, were used as searches against the TREC test collection, using the INQUERY probabilistic inference network retrieval engine, Results show that progressive combination of query formulations leads to progressively improving retrieval performance, Results were compared against the performance of INQUERY natural language based queries, and in combination with them. The issue of recall as a performance measure in large databases was raised, since overlap between the searches conducted in this study, and the TREC-1 searches, was smaller than expected.
