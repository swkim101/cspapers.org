In this work we have investigated the processes required for throwing objects at given targets with a KUKA KR-16 industrial robot manipulator. For this purpose a path planning algorithm and a throwing strategy were determined. A simple two-finger gripper which can be opened or closed pneumatically is used to hold the object during the acceleration phase. The position of the target is tracked by an optical tracking system. At first the experimental setup, the physical basics, the mathematical model, and the path planning algorithm are explained. Experimental results conclude
