Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) has been advocated as the basis of multiservice telecommunications in the next century. However, the public telecommunication technology of the 1990's will be ISDN, which presents a circuit switched subscriber interface. An obvious approach to building a wide area ATM network is to build it on top of primary rate ISDN. In this paper we describe the lessons learned through the design and deployment of such a network.
