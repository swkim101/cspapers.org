Communication among participants (agents, robots) is central to an appearance of Collective AI. In this work we deal with the development of local communication mechanisms for real microrobotic swarms. We demonstrate that despite of very limited capabilities of the microrobot, the specific construction of communication hardware and software allows very extended collective capabilities of the whole swarm. We propose mechanisms providing information content and context for collective navigation, coordination and spatial perception in a group of microrobots.
