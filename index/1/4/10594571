Over the past few years, the discussion between the two major architectural styles for designing and implementing Web services, the RPC-oriented approach and the resource-oriented approach, has been mainly held outside of traditional research communities. Mailing lists, forums and developer communities have seen long and fascinating debates around the assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses of these two approaches. The Second International Workshop on RESTful Design (WS-REST 2011) has the goal of getting more researchers involved in the debate by providing a forum where discussions around the resource-oriented style of Web services design take place. Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style and as such can be applied in different ways, can be extended by additional constraints, or can be specialized with more specific interaction patterns. WS-REST is the premier forum for discussing research ideas, novel applications and results centered around REST at the World Wide Web conference, which provides a great setting to host this second edition of the workshop dedicated to research on the architectural style underlying the Web.
