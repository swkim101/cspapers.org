This paper describes a new procedure for estimating the delay-dependent switching activities in CMOS combinational circuits. The procedure is based on analytic and statistical techniques to take advantage of their time-efficiency over conventional logic simulators. Combinational circuits driven by synchronized logic signals are considered as application targets and the statistical properties of logic signals and circuit parameters are defined and evaluated. The experimental result on benchmark circuits shows the significant time efficiency of the proposed procedure.
