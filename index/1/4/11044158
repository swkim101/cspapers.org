This paper presents TWinChat, a Twitter and Web user interactive chat system to support simultaneous communication between microbloggers and Web users in real-time through both the contents of microblogs and Web pages. TWinChat provides a question answering interface attached to Web pages, which allows Web users to chat with Twitter users in real-time while presenting tweets that are associated with Web pages, i.e., simultaneous cross-media communication. In order to map heterogeneous media, the system extracts relationship between tweets and Web pages by generating queries based on location names. Thus, our system can effectively present messages from Web users to help Twitter users immediately obtain useful information or knowledge, and it also can effectively present tweets from the Twitter users to help the Web users easily grasp the current situation in real-time.
