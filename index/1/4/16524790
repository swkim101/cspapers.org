The steps for modeling and control of a hydraulic rotary actuator are discussed. Our aim is to present experimental results working with a particular sensing device for angular position as a complement to pressure sensing devices. We provide the steps in experimental system identification used for modeling the system dynamics. The cascade controller designed contains an inner loop for an accurate tracking of torque while stabilizing position reference trajectories. The performance of this design is experimentally verified.
