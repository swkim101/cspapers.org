In this paper, we investigate the problem concerning about how to construct an interference-free multicast tree in the multi-channel multi-radio multi-rate wireless mesh networks with the goal of maximizing the number of clients served by the tree. This problem is referred as the profit-based multi-rate multicast tree (PMMT) problem. With the joint consideration of multicast routing, channel assignment and transmitting data rate, a cross-layer based heuristic named the profit-oriented and multi-rate (POM) algorithm is proposed for the PMMT problem. A set of preliminary experiments is also provided for evaluating the performance of the POM algorithm.
