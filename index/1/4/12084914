Quality control is one of the major problems in crowdsourcing. One of the primary approaches to rectify this issue is to assign the same task to different workers and then aggregate their answers to obtain a reliable answer. In addition to simple aggregation approaches such as majority voting, various sophisticated probabilistic models have been proposed. However, given that most of the existing methods operate by strengthening the opinions of the majority, these models often fail when the tasks require highly specialized knowledge and the ability of a large majority of the workers is inadequate. In this paper, we focus on an important class of answer aggregation problems in which majority voting fails and propose the concept of hyper questions to devise effective aggregation methods. A hyper question is a set of single questions, and our key idea is that experts are more likely to provide correct answers to all of the single questions included in a hyper question than non-experts. Thus, experts are more likely to reach consensus on the hyper questions than non-experts, which strengthen their influences. We incorporate the concept of hyper questions into existing answer aggregation methods. The results of our experiments conducted using both synthetic datasets and real datasets demonstrate that our simple and easily usable approach works effectively in cases where only a few experts are available.
