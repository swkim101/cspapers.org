Biometric authentication is more secure than using regular passwords, as biometrics cannot be "forgotten" and contain high entropy. Thus, many constructions rely on biometric features for authentication, and use them as a source for "good" cryptographic keys. At the same time, biometric systems carry with them many privacy concerns. We describe a proof-of-concept (PoC) which transforms facial attributes from a single image into keys in a consistent, discriminative, and privacy-aware manner. The outcome is a user-specific string that cannot be guessed, and it reveals no information concerning the users of the system, even when the system's secrets are revealed.
