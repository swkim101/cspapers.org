Sustainability is a formalization of the requirement for scheduling algorithms and schedulability tests that a system deemed to be correctly schedulable should remain so if its run-time behavior is better than anticipated. The notion of sustainability is extended to mixed-criticality systems, and sustainability properties are determined for a variety of widely-studied uniprocessor and multi-processor mixed-criticality scheduling algorithms.
