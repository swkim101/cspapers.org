Previous research on content-based geolocation in general has developed prediction methods via conducting pre-partitioning and applying classification methods. The input of these methods is the concatenation of individual tweets during a period of time. But unfortunately, these methods have some drawbacks. They discard the natural real-values properties of latitude and longitude as well as fail to capture geolocation in near real-time. In this work, we develop a novel generative content-based regression model via a matrix factorization technique to tackle the near real-time geolocation prediction problem. With this model, we aim to address a couple of un-answered questions. First, we prove that near real-time geolocation prediction can be accomplished if we leave out the concatenation. Second, we account the real-values properties of physical coordinates within a regression solution. We apply our model on Twitter datasets as an example to prove the effectiveness and generality. Our experimental results show that the proposed model, in the best scenario, outperforms a set of state-of-the-art regression models including Support Vector Machines and Factorization Machines by a reduction of the median localization error up to 79%.
