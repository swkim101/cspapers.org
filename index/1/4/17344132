A logic, <bold>Pr<italic>(DL)</italic></bold>, is presented, which enables reasoning about probabilistic programs or, alternatively, reasoning probabilistically about conventional programs. The syntax of <bold>Pr<italic>(DL)</italic></bold> derives from Pratt's first-order dynamic logic and the semantics extends Kozen's semantics of probabilistic programs. An axiom system for <bold>Pr<italic>(DL)</italic></bold> is presented and shown to be complete relative to an extension of first-order analysis. For discrete probabilities it is shown that first-order analysis actually suffices. Examples are presented, both of the expressive power of <bold>Pr<italic>(DL)</italic></bold>, and of a proof in the axiom system.
