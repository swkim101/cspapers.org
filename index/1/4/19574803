The RAISE'13 workshop brought together researchers from the AI and software engineering disciplines to build on the interdisciplinary synergies which exist and to stimulate research across these disciplines. The first part of the workshop was devoted to current results and consisted of presentations and discussion of the state of the art. This was followed by a second part which looked over the horizon to seek future directions, inspired by a number of selected vision statements concerning the AI-and-SE crossover. The goal of the RAISE workshop was to strengthen the AI-and-SE community and also develop a roadmap of strategic research directions for AI and software engineering.
