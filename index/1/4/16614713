In this paper we present the MapMover project as a case study into the use and design of an interactive system for collective expression. Informed by analysis and reflection we advance the concept of constructed publics: publics that are established, shaped, and maintained through the actions and influence of others. We conclude by discussing the relevance of constructed publics as a theorectical frame for the analysis and evaluation of projects in the domains of urban computing and exploratory design in HCI.
