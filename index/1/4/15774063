A new type of transactions for higher level applfcation programing in systems with databases is introduced. These so-called 'nested transactions with multiple commit points' support operations over multiple applications either atomically, fndependent, or in a combination of both. Furthermore, it is strictly distinguished between transactions as units of work and transactions as a part of so-called 'conaft spheres' and 'backout spheres', which provides more generality and flexibility than existing models.
