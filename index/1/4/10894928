This paper discusses some security issues of 'Classical IP over ATM' networks. After analyzing new threats to IP networks based on ATM, security mechanisms to protect these networks are introduced. The integration of firewalls into ATM networks requires additional considerations. We conclude that careful configuration of ATM switches and ATM services can provide some level of protection against spoofing and denial of service attacks. Our solutions are intended to be applied to current IP over ATM networks and do not require any changes to these protocols or additions to current switch capabilities.
