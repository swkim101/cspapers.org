Realistic modeling of vehicular mobility and sensing has been particularly challenging due to the lack of large libraries of measurements in the research community and the unavailability of Off-the-shelf analysis tools [1]. In this work, we propose GlobalSense a novel framework for large-scale monitoring, analysis, and visualization of spatio-temporal vehicular mobility and sensing using the freely available online traffic webcams. We collect vehicular mobility traces from 2,700 traffic webcams in 10 different cities for six months and generate a mobility dataset of 7.5 Terabytes consisting of 125 million of images. We use background subtraction algorithm on these images to estimate traffic density. The GlobalSense in Figure-1 is divided into four main components: (i) Data collection and pre-processing, (ii) Knowledge discovery, (iii) Modeling and analysis, and (iv) Graphical visualization. In data collection and pre-processing we download media feeds and process them to generate a quantifiable traffic value (density). The second and third components are designed for knowledge discovery, analysis, modeling and validating the data distribution using known statistical techniques. Finally, visualization helps to qualitatively identify hidden trends and traffic patterns.
