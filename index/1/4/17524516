Ethercom is a project which introduces many s.spects of network communication, process synchronization, and scheduling at a level suitable for an undergraduate e operating systems or networks course. The project requires a Unix workstation equipped with a microphone and speaker. The project is developed in stages starting from simple 1/0 to the audio device. The final development is two-way corn. munication over a network using lightweight processes and asynchronous 1/0. When they have completed the project, students can sit at their workstations and converse with counterparts at remote sites. Variations and enhancements for the basic project are suggested including a monitor implement ation of communication. Libraries of simplified routines for 1/0 and network communication are also available via anonymous ftp.
