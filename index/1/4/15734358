Many people have suggested adding scanning logic to a rotating memory system, such as disk or shift registers, to allow faster execution of database operations. Most of these have been concerned with producing a form of associative memory which is then used to implement one or more of the models for information storage and retrieval, such as relational or hierarchical. While these are capable of searching for simple character strings, they are incapable of handling the complex patterns sometimes necessary for textual information retrieval. In addition, textual information retrieval does not lend itself to highly formatted databases, encoding of information, or arbitrary ordering of data, concepts common to the other structures.
 A description of the operations desirable in textual information retrieval is given, and contrasted to those operations allowed in non-textual systems. The general structure for a scanning processor is presented, and a number of different trade-offs in its design and operation are discussed.
