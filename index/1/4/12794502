Cluster-level packing techniques have long been used to improve the energy proportionality of server clusters by masking the poor energy proportionality of individual servers. With the emergence of high energy proportional servers, we revisit whether cluster-level packing techniques are still the most effective way to achieve high cluster-wide energy proportionality. Our findings indicate that cluster-level packing techniques can eventually limit cluster-wide energy proportionality and it may be more beneficial to depend solely on server-level low power techniques. Server-level low power techniques generally require a high latency slack to be effective due to diminishing idle periods as server core count increases. In order for server-level low power techniques to be a viable alternative, the latency slack required for these techniques must be lowered. We found that server-level active low power modes offer the lowest latency slack, independent of server core count, and propose low power mode switching policies to meet the best-case latency slack under realistic conditions. By overcoming these major issues, we show that server-level low power modes can be a viable alternative to cluster-level packing techniques in providing high cluster-wide energy proportionality.
