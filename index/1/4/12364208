A new planning and control scheme for natural language control of robotic operations using the perceptive feedback is presented. Different from the traditional open-loop natural language control, the scheme incorporates the high-level planning and low-level control of the robotic systems and makes the high-level planning become a closed-loop process such that it is able to handle some unexpected events in the robotics system and the environment. The experimental results on a natural language controlled mobile manipulator clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.
