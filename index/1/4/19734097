The performance of a master-slave robotic system depends significantly on the ergonomics and the capability of its master device to correctly interface the user with the slave robot. Master manipulators generating commands in task space represent a commonly adopted solution for controlling a range of slave robots while retaining an ergonomic design. However, these devices present several drawbacks, such as requiring the use of clutching mechanics to compensate for the mismatch between slave and master workspaces, and the lack of capability to intuitively transmit important information such as specific joint limits to the user. In this paper, a novel joint-space master manipulator is presented. This manipulator emulates the kinematic structure of highly flexible surgical instruments which it is designed to control. This system uses 6 active degrees of freedom to compensate for its own weight, as well as to provide force feedback corresponding to the slave robot's joint limits. A force/torque sensor integrated at the end effector is used to relay user-generated forces and torques directly to specific joints. This is performed to counteract the friction stemming from structural constraints imposed by the kinematic design of the instruments. Finally, a usability study is carried out to test the validity of the system, proving that the instruments can be intuitively controlled even at the extremities of the workspace.
