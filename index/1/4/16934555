This paper describes a method for analyzing an input scene of a stack of industrial parts in order to recognize an object which is not obscured by others. Detecting a simple familiar pattern such as an ellipse in a set of strong feature points, an analyzer selects models of the machine parts from the attributes of other feature points around the pattern under the constraints of the proposed models. Finally one of the models is verified through processes of matching the detailed structures of the models to the less obvious feature points.
