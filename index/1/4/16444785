Consul and CUE are two systems that combine to support an interface to interactive computer services that is integrated across a variety of interface methods. Consul is an experimental natural language interface system designed to be customized to a set of specific interactive computer services: electronic mail, personal calendar, word processing, etc. CUE is a window- and object-based run-time support environment for interactive services with a command language, pointing device and menu interface. Using the Consul/CUE interface, the user sees a single system that is capable of handling a wide variety of input in a completely uniform service environment. The success of the combined system derives from a large knowledge base formalizing facts in the interactive service environment in an artificial intelligence network structure.
