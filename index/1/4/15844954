Web search engines are often presented with user queries that involve comparisons of real-world entities. Thus far, this interaction has typically been captured by users submitting appropriately designed keyword queries for which they are presented a list of relevant documents. Richer interactions that explicitly allow for a comparative analysis of entities represent a new potential direction to improve the search experience. With this in mind, we present an initial step of mining comparable entities from sources of information available to a large-scale Web search engine, namely, search query logs and documents from a Web crawl. Our mining methods generate a diverse set of comparables consisting of entities from a broad class of categories, such as medicines, appliances, electronics, and vacation destinations.
