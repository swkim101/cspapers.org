At nanometer manufacturing technology nodes, process variations significantly affect circuit performance. To combat them, postsilicon clock tuning buffers can be deployed to balance timing budgets of critical paths for each individual chip after manufacturing. The challenge of this method is that path delays should be measured for each chip to configure the tuning buffers properly. Current methods for this delay measurement rely on path-wise frequency stepping. This strategy, however, requires too much time from expensive testers. In this paper, we propose an efficient delay test framework (EffiTest) to solve the post-silicon testing problem by aligning path delays using the already-existing tuning buffers in the circuit. In addition, we only test representative paths and the delays of other paths are estimated by statistical delay prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the number of frequency stepping iterations by more than 94% with only a slight yield loss.
