We present the WADE Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which simplifies interface and functionality modification of existing third-party software without access to source code. WADE clones the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of a host program through dynamic-link library (DLL) injection, enabling modifications to (1) the GUI in a WYSIWYG fashion and (2) software functionality. We compare WADE with an alternative state-of-the-art runtime toolkit overloading approach in a user-study, whose results demonstrate that WADE significantly simplifies the task of GUI-based add-on development.
