Propositional Dynamic Logic can be extended to include both an infinitary iteration construct delta and a backtracking construct converse. The resulting logic does not satisfy the finite model property, but is nevertheless elementarily decidable. In order to establish this decidability result, deterministic two-way automata on infinite trees are defined and shown to be reducible to nondeterministic one-way automata on infinite trees. The decision procedure suggests a nonstandard semantics for the extended logic for which the finite model property does hold.
