In this paper, a multi-propeller multifunction aerial robot (MMAR) capable of flying, wall-climbing and arm-operating is presented. Four propellers are devoted to the attitude control of the robot, and two manipulators are designed for the wall-climbing and arm-operating modes. When the aerial robot works in wall-climbing and arm-operating, there are dynamics coupling between the manipulators and the main body. The dynamics of manipulators depends on the motion of the main body, and the motion of manipulators will have reaction force and torque applied on the main body. The dynamics modeling of the robot is investigated by using recursive method. Based on the model, the trajectory linearization control of the robot is proposed. The controller of the robot when it transitions between its flight mode and wall-climbing mode is then designed. The simulation verification of the controller is presented, which can verified the feasibility of the controller.
