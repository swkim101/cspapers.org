In this study, we propose a novel method to operate whole body of a humanoid robot, which also includes both feet, dynamically and safely with the master-slave approach. The conventional whole body master-slave approaches need static balancing assumption or a certain time length of planning after operator's input. Then, we introduce a set of limitations that allows the robot to execute human's daily dynamic bipedal locomotion, but forbid dangerous motions like the COM will be gone outside of the support region. In the limitations, we regulate COM velocity based on a positional relation of the Divergent Component of Motion (Capture Point) and the both feet, and automatically modify the swing foot contact timing with judging the ZMP is inside or outside of the single foot support region. At last, we conducted some experiments of the real time master-slave locomotion with using two life-sized humanoid robots and confirmed the effectiveness of our novel limitation methods.
