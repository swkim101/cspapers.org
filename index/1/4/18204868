Real Time audio conferencing in IP based packet network is one of the popular applications in these days. There are some serious synchronization problems in this technology, some of them are inter stream, intra stream and group synchronization. This paper deals with the problem of audio group synchronization in distributed multiparty group conferencing. When more than one participant in an audio conferencing session generates the audio packet at the same time, the mixed signal, when reaches to listener, becomes a non understandable noise. We propose an algorithm for the communication and synchronization of real time audio data in a distributed environment to overcome this group synchronization problem.
