In order to cope efficiently with simple or complex queries as well as different application requirements (e.g., ad-hoc versus repetitive queries), a query optimizer ought to support an extensible search strategy that can ideally reduce fo enumerative, randomized or more recent genetic search algorithms. In this paper, we give a solution to the extensibility of the query optimizer search strategy. This solution is based on the object-oriented modeling of the query optimizer, where the search space and the search strafegy are independently specified. It is illustrated by the application to different search strategies. This modeling facilitates the specification of assertions that enforce the successful termination of the search process
