We have implemented an interpreter (InvTS) for a declarative rule language (InvTL) supporting invariant-driven transformations of object-oriented programs. Using a library of rules, it can perform incrementalization across object abstractions, allowing the programmer to write clear, straightforward code while relying on InvTS to generate sophisticated and efficient implementations.
