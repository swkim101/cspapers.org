This paper presents a user study aiming to investigate the query reformulation in collaborative Web search. 7 pairs of participants were recruited and each pair worked as a team on two collaborative exploratory Web search tasks. Through the log analysis, we compared possible sources for participants to draw query terms from. The results show that both search and collaborative actions are possible resources for new query terms. Traditional resources for query expansion such as previous search histories and relevant documents are still important resources for new query terms. The content in chat and workspace generated by participants themselves seems more likely to be the resource for new query terms than that of their partners. Task types also affect the influences on query reformulations. For the academic task, previously saved relevance documents are the most important resources for new query terms while chat histories are the most important resources for the leisure task.
