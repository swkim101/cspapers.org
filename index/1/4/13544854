We present a machine-learned model that can automatically detect when a student using an intelligent tutoring system is off-task, i.e., engaged in behavior which does not involve the system or a learning task. This model was developed using only log files of system usage (i.e. no screen capture or audio/video data). We show that this model can both accurately identify each student's prevalence of off-task behavior and can distinguish off-task behavior from when the student is talking to the teacher or another student about the subject matter. We use this model in combination with motivational and attitudinal instruments, developing a profile of the attitudes and motivations associated with off-task behavior, and compare this profile to the attitudes and motivations associated with other behaviors in intelligent tutoring systems. We discuss how the model of off-task behavior can be used within interactive learning environments which respond to when students are off-task.
