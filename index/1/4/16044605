We discuss part-of-speech (POS) tagging in presence of large, fine-grained label sets using conditional random fields (CRFs). We propose improving tagging accuracy by utilizing dependencies within sub-components of the fine-grained labels. These sub-label dependencies are incorporated into the CRF model via a (relatively) straightforward feature extraction scheme. Experiments on five languages show that the approach can yield significant improvement in tagging accuracy in case the labels have sufficiently rich inner structure.
