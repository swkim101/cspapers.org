In the link prediction problem, formulated as a binary classification problem, we want to classify each pair of disconnected nodes in the network whether they will be connected by a link in the future. We study link formation in social networks with two types of links over several time periods. To solve the link prediction problem, we follow the approach of counting 3-node graphlets and suggest three extensions to the original method. By performing experiments on two real-world social networks we show that the new methods have a predictive power, however, network evolution cannot be explained by one specific feature at all time points. We also observe that some network properties can point at features which are more effective for temporal link prediction.
