Since modern electric systems require to support various power-demand operations for user applications and system maintenance, they need advanced power management that jointly considers power demand by the operations and power supply from various sources, such as batteries, solar panels, and supercapacitors. In this paper, we develop a power scheduling framework for a reliable energy storage system with multiple power-supply sources and multiple power-demand operations. First, we provide an offline power-supply guarantee such that every power-demand operation completes its execution in time while the sum of power required by individual operations does not exceed the total power supplied by the entire energy storage system at any time. We find similarities between this and a real-time scheduling problem, and make a power-supply guarantee using real-time scheduling techniques. Second, we propose online power management that efficiently utilizes the surplus power (available at run-time) for system performance improvement. Our experimental results on a prototype demonstrate that the proposed framework not only guarantees the required power supply, but also enhances system performance by up to 33.1%.
