The existence of modular structures in the biological world strongly suggests that the training of this kind of structures is actually feasible. It is a key indication for the development of neural networks applications especially in the field of robotics. Indeed, a single network can only efficiently treat problems with few independent variables; the combining of several networks is necessary to address more complex tasks. We investigate learning techniques and show that using a particular form of architecture can ease the training of a modular structure: a bi-directional structure that allows combining several neural networks. The approach is illustrated with Kohonen's self-organizing maps for a robotic visual sensing task.
