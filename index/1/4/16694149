Wireless resonant magnetic micro-actuators have been previously described as highly effective propulsion mechanisms for untethered mobile microrobots. The discussion thus far has been primarily relegated to a characterization of stationary devices and the de facto observation of their mobility. Before applications of microrobots can be more fully explored, devices are required that can operate reliably and repeatably in a host of operating environments. In this paper, we analyze the in situ performance of resonant magnetic actuators for microrobotic locomotion to better understand their durability, substrate requirements, and driving characteristics.
