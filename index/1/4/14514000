We make progress in the following three problems: 1. Constructing optimal seeded non-malleable extractors, 2. Constructing optimal privacy amplification protocols with an active adversary, for any possible security parameter, 3. Constructing extractors for independent weak random sources, when the min-entropy is extremely small (i.e., near logarithmic). For the first two problems, the best known non-malleable extractors by Chattopadhyay, Goyal and Li, and by Cohen all require seed length and min-entropy with quadratic loss in parameters. As a result, the best known explicit privacy amplification protocols with an active adversary, which achieve two rounds of communication and optimal entropy loss was sub-optimal in the min-entropy of the source. In this paper we give an explicit non-malleable extractor that works for nearly optimal seed length and min-entropy, and yields a two-round privacy amplification protocol with optimal entropy loss for almost all ranges of the security parameter. For the third problem, we improve upon a very recent result by Cohen and Schulman and give an explicit extractor that uses an absolute constant number of sources, each with almost logarithmic min-entropy. The key ingredient in all our constructions is a generalized, and much more efficient version of the independence preserving merger introduced by Cohen, which we call non-malleable independence preserving merger. Our construction of the merger also simplifies that of Cohen and Schulman, and may be of independent interest.
