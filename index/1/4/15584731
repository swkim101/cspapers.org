Most of the current research on automatic generation of test cases from formal specifications has been directed towards non object-oriented formal specifications. While object-oriented paradigm is the most widely accepted methodology for software development, generation of test cases from object-oriented formal specifications is still a relatively unexplored area. In this paper, we present a novel framework to automate test case generation from object-oriented formal specifications. We use IFAD VDM++ as the specification language, but the ideas presented can be generalized to other model-based object-oriented formal notations as well. The proposed approach uses a test descriptor to generate valid test sequences, and then generates test data for each method in a test sequence, using a conjunction of method precondition and class invariant to filter the input space. The test data are generated by partitioning the valid input space for each input variable into equivalence classes, and selecting representative values from each class.
