This paper gives a detailed experiment feedback of different approaches to adapt a statistical machine translation system towards a targeted translation project, using only small amounts of parallel in-domain data. The experiments were performed by professional translators under realistic conditions of work using a computer assisted translation tool. We analyze the influence of these adaptations on the translator productivity and on the overall post-editing effort. We show that significant improvements can be obtained by using the presented adaptation techniques.
