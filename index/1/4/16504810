We reduce a broad class of fundamental machine learning problems, usually addressed by EM or sampling, to the problem of finding the k extreme rays spanning the conical hull of a1 data point set. These k "anchors" lead to a global solution and a more interpretable model that can even outperform EM and sampling on generalization error. To find the k anchors, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer learning scheme "DCA" that distributes the problem to O(k log k) same-type sub-problems on different low-D random hyperplanes, each can be solved independently by any existing solver. For the 2D sub-problem, we instead present a non-iterative solver that only needs to compute an array of cosine values and its max/min entries. DCA also provides a faster subroutine inside other algorithms to check whether a point is covered in a conical hull, and thus improves these algorithms by providing significant speedups. We apply our method to GMM, HMM, LDA, NMF and subspace clustering, then show its competitive performance and scalability over other methods on large datasets.
