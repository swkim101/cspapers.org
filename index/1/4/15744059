A bimanual 7 Degree of Freedom (DOF) manipulation technique based on a hybrid 3D cursor driven by the combination of mouse and trackball is presented. This technique allows the user to move the cursor to the target location in 3D scene by following a conceived straight or curved path. In the pilot study, participants could learn the technique in a short time and perform the docking task steadily without physical fatigue.
