In this paper, we present extensive advances in live-fly field experimentation capabilities of large numbers of fixed-wing aerial robots, and highlight both the enabling technologies as well as the challenges addressed in such largescale flight operations. We showcase results from recent field tests, including the autonomous launch, flight, and landing of 50 UAVs, which illuminate numerous operational lessons learned and generate rich multi-UAV datasets. We detail the design and open architecture of the testbed, which intentionally leverages low-cost and open-source components, aimed at promoting continued advances and alignment of multi-robot systems research and practice.
