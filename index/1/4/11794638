1024 distributed-neuron synapses have been integrated in an active area of 6.1 mm × 3.3 mm using a 0.9 µm, double-metal, single-poly, n-well CMOS technology. The distributed-neuron synapses are arranged in blocks of 16, which we call '4 × 4 tiles'. Switch matrices are interleaved between each of these tiles to provide programmability of interconnections. With a small area overhead (15 %), the 1024 units of the network can be rearranged in various configurations. Some of the possible configurations are, a 12-32-12 network, a 16-12-12-16 network, two 12-32 networks etc. (the numbers separated by dashes indicate the number of units per layer, including the input layer). Weights are stored in analog form on MOS capacitors. The synaptic weights are usable to a resolution of 1 % of their full scale value. The limitation arises due to charge injection from the access switch and charge leakage. Other parameters like gain and shape of nonlinearity are also programmable.
