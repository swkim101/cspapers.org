This experiment studies how people learn to use computers. Four computer-naive persons performed six computer tasks at each of 20 task sessions over a one month period. Participants were allowed to choose a menu-driven or command-driven dialogue at any point during the study. Cognitive, affective, and performance variables were closely monitored. Results generally support the appropriateness of a menu-driven dialogue for novice users and the transition to a command-driven dialogue after approximately 16 - 20 hours of task experience. With experience, users were shown to a) choose b) perform better, and c) be more satisfied with a command driven dialogue. Results are explained within the context of a “cognitive schema” theory.
