In this paper, we describe two related techniques for delivering instructional animations of parallel algorithms --- one that runs on a Microsoft Windows workstation and another that is Web-based. After discussing the techniques, we examine their use in two pedagogical settings --- one in which students merely watch the animations as an aid to achieving a better understanding of the algorithm and one in which students actively participate in constructing the animation. The former context is appropriate in a juniorsenior algorithms course where, because of time constraints, parallel algorithms are only one of several topics studied. The latter context is appropriate for a course dedicated to the study of parallel algorithms or for a senior capstone experience. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques we have developed and with some indications of how these techniques could be extended in the future.
