Hardware primitives provide significant promises to support cryptographic primitives and security mechanisms against various forms of compromises. In this work, we study the intrinsic hardware characteristics of modern graphics processing units (GPUs) due to random manufacturing variations, and exploits the inherent randomness to generate device-specific signatures. In particular, we present a novel GPU-based hardware fingerprint scheme to generate a unique, stable, physically unclonable, unpredictable, and random bit string from the inherent hardware features of a general purpose GPU (GPGPU). The generated fingerprint can be used to implement a physically unclonable function (PUF), and thus to create a trusted computing environment with GPUs as the trust anchor.
