The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is an overlay network that provides secure and anonymous communication channels. EepSites are the anonymous websites hosted in the I2P network. To access the eepSites, DNS requests of a domain name suffixed with the {\sf .i2p} pseudo top-level domain (TLD) are routed within the I2P network. However, not only that {\sf .i2p} queries are leaking in the public DNS infrastructure, but also such leakage has various plausible root causes and implications that are different from other related leakage. In this paper, we analyze the leaked {\sf .i2p} requests captured in the A and J root name servers of the public DNS, showing that a large number of queries are observed and outlining various potential directions of addressing such leakage.
