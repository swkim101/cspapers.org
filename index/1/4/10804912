Parallelism pervades all aspects of modern computing, from in-home devices such as cell phones to large-scale supercomputers. Recognizing this - and motivated by the premise that every undergraduate student in a computer-related field should be prepared to cope with parallel computing - a working group sponsored by NSF and IEEE/TCPP, and interacting with the ACM CS2013 initiative, has developed guidelines for assimilating parallel and distributed computing (PDC) into the core undergraduate curriculum. Over 100 Early-Adopter institutions worldwide are currently modifying their computer-related curricula in response to the guidelines. Additionally, the CDER Center for Curriculum Development and Educational Resources, which grew out of the working group, is currently assembling a book of contributed essays on how to teach PDC topics in lower-level CS/CE courses, to fill the serious lack of textual material for students and instructors. This session is intended: (i) to report on the current state of this initiative; (ii) to bring together authors of book chapters and Early Adopters and other interested parties for discussions on ongoing activities and needs; (iii) to discuss the initiative and collect direct feedback from the community.
