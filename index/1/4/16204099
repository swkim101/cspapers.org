The NoPumpG prototype [7,8] suggested that the spreadsheet model of computation could simplify the creation of some types of interactive graphical application when compared with other approaches. We report here experience in developing an enhanced follow-on system, NoPumpII, and describe three applications developed using it. We conclude that (1) the potential advantages of the spreadsheet model are realized in this application experience, (2) revisions to the prototype design have permitted an increase in the complexity and scale of applications, and (3) there remain limitations in the current design which, if redressed, would further enlarge the scope of application. More generally we conclude that alternative computational models are an important area of exploration for HCI research.
