Licensing is a topic of increasing importance for software publishers and users. More and more, the magnitude of financial transfers between these two partners are determined by some electronic licensing service being part of the system on which the licensed software is running. In order to ease the use and management of such licensing schemes and to enable economic software usage in enterprise-wide computer systems through flexible and fair billing structures, various organizations are working on formulating requirements, defining architectures, and building standard interfaces for so called license brokerage systems. The trustworthiness of these services is essential because large amounts of money can depend on them. Most of these licensing services are currently operating independently of access control and rely on proprietary and unpublished security algorithms. This paper proposes an extension of access control to integrate licensing called Stateful Access Control and it addresses some aspects of virus protection.
