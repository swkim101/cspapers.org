The field of humanoids robotics is widely recognized as the current challenge for robotics research. Developing humanoids poses fascinating problems in the realization of manipulation capability, which is still one of most complex problem in robotics. The paper, starting from an overview of current activities in the development of humanoid robots, with special focus on manipulation, presents the authors' approach to the design and development of anthropomorphic sensorized hands and of anthropomorphic control and sensory-motor coordination schemes. Current achievements at the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna and Centro INAIL RTR (Research Centre on Rehabilitation Bioengineering) in the development of a robotic human prosthesis are described, together with preliminary experimental results, as well as in the implementation of biologically-inspired schemes for control and sensory-motor co-ordination, derived from models of well-identified human brain areas.
