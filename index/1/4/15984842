Crossovers on thin film substrates are conductive paths used to bridge or interconnect circuitry separated by intervening paths. Crossovers have been made by arching a fine wire or ribbon over the intervening path and bonding each end to a conductor, or by fabricating an interconnecting dielectric-conductor path sandwich by standard deposition and photolithographic techniques.
 During the past few years the number of Bell System circuits incorporating crossovers, and the number of crossovers incorporated in a single circuit, has increased very significantly. Some circuits now incorporate over 2000 crossovers. Economics dictates that all crossovers must be tested prior to committing chips and other bonded components. This paper describes a crossover fabrication process that incorporates a built-in test technique called CRONET (CROssover NEt Testing), and a computer aided design program that automates CRONET.
