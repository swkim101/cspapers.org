In this work a constraint-based control approach is proposed in order to perform a cap rotation task with a dual-arm robot. The method relies on the introduction of a robust specification for the constraint on the interaction force arising during the task, accounting for robot-environment contact model uncertainties, in addition to force measurement noise and surface uncertainties. Experiments have been performed on an ABB dual-arm prototype robot to validate the proposed approach in a cap assembly task, employing a model-based sensorless observer of the interaction forces.
