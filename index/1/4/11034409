Marek E. Rusinkiewicz, University of Houston Amit P. Sheth, Bellcore Many large organizations have data distributed in heterogeneous and autonomous information repositories. Studies of usersâ€™ needs show that providing a systematic access to such multidatabase resources is and will continue be a major problem. The tutorial will address the state-of-the-art of the related technologies, including sematic and systems issues. The tutorial will 1. introduce the basic concepts of heterogeneous multidatabase systems and identify major research problems in the area; 2. discuss various approaches to the problem of developing applications in a multidatabase environment; and 3. review the current implementation efforts, discuss the current tendencies and future directions. The tutorial will cover the following topics: l Issues: Distribution, Heterogeneity, and Autonomy l Alternatives: Inteoperability, Integration, and Interdependency l Reference Schema and System architectures l Semantic Heteorgeneity l Schema analysis, interdependency, and integration 0 System support for multisystem applications l Processing of Multidatabase Queries l Transaction issues in multidatabases
