An examination of high-level language architectures reveals that some design considerations are based on inaccurate premises. This paper discusses some HLL architecture design misconceptions. Some features that should be considered in the design of HLL architectures are presented. Based on the HLL architecture design considerations, a methodology for quantifying architecture is proposed.
