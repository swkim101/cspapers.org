An algebra which operates on partitioned relations is developed. Relation partitioning is achieved by defining equivalence relations on n-ary relations. It is shown that the algebra is as powerful as the original relational algebra, having the advantage of a set-processing capability. This feature provides both greater flexibility in query specification and efficient query processing.
