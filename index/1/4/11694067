One of the biggest challenges for software developers to build real-world predictive applications with machine learning is the steep learning curve of data processing frameworks, learning algorithms and scalable system infrastructure. We present PredictionIO, an open source machine learning server that comes with a step-by-step graphical user interface for developers to (i) evaluate, compare and deploy scalable learning algorithms, (ii) tune hyperparameters of algorithms manually or automatically and (iii) evaluate model training status. The system also comes with an Application Programming Interface (API) to communicate with software applications for data collection and prediction retrieval. The whole infrastructure of PredictionIO is horizontally scalable with a distributed computing component based on Hadoop. The demonstration shows a live example and workflows of building real-world predictive applications with the graphical user interface of PredictionIO, from data collection, algorithm tuning and selection, model training and re-training to real-time prediction querying.
