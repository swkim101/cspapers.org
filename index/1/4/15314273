In this demo we focus on the engineering of open multi-agent systems as electronic institutions. Electronic institutions are a formalism to define the rules which structure agent interactions, establishing what agents are permitted and forbidden to do. We present a set of tools that support the specification, analysis and execution of institutions, as well as the implementation of agents. Our methodology allows for a successive refinement approach to multi-agent systems engineering.
