An object-oriented software life-cycle model, the Modified Spiral Model, was successfully used as the software process in the software engineering course in the Department of Computer Science, California State University, San Bernardino. The model lends itself quite naturally to the object-oriented approach of producing software systems in the iterative and incremental manner. The software engineering class is run like a virtual software company which is composed of teams and team leaders where performance is measured on being able to submit the software deliverables and the success of the task(s) assigned to the team. The paper reports on the implementation of the software project, Algorithma (Algorithm Animation), in the virtual software company using the Modified Spiral Model.
