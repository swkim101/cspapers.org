Inspired by geckos, we built a new configuration for climbing robot, the GPL model with one passive waist and four active axil legs. In this paper, further research was made to analysis its motion. We found the anomalies line between supporting feet and its effect on robot motion. A step further, the principia of configuration design and gait planning were proposed based on dynamic analysis. The prototype was developed and the climbing forces experiment was carried out. We testified the rationality of GPL model and waist trajectory planning. Also, energy analysis was proven by the driving forces measured on the supporting feet. In our experiment, the deceleration force during the robot climbing was only provided by the gravity, indicating a potential space for speed improvement without significant energy waste.
