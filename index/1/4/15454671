Although self-adaptivity is emerging as an important system property, designers still lack principled and systematic methods for developing, reasoning about, and synthesizing specifications, architectures, and implementations for such systems. I exploit recent work on design structure and design-time adaptive capacity to devise a method for specifying, modularizing and synthesizing mechanisms for runtime self-adaptation. Results of an early evaluation of my method on a widely studied model problem suggest that it contributes to our knowledge of self-adaptive systems and has the potential to improve their design
