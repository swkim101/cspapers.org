Enterprises are dealing with ever increasing volumes of data, reaching into the petabyte scale. With many of our customer engagements, we are observing an emerging trend: They are using Hadoop-based solutions in conjunction with their data warehouses. They are using Hadoop to deal with the data volume, as well as the lack of strict structure in their data to conduct various analyses, including but not limited to Web log analysis, sophisticated data mining, machine learning and model building. This first stage of the analysis is off-line and suitable for Hadoop. But, once their data is summarized or cleansed enough, and their models are built, they are loading the results into a warehouse for interactive querying and report generation. At this later stage, they leverage the wealth of business intelligence tools, which they are accustomed to, that exist for warehouses. In this paper, we outline this use case and discuss the bidirectional connectors we developed between IBM DB2 and IBM InfoSphere BigInsights.
