Natural touch interfaces, common now in devices such as tablets and smartphones, make it cumbersome for users to select text. There is a need for a new text selection paradigm that goes beyond the high acuity selection-by-mouse that we have relied on for decades. In this paper, we introduce such a paradigm, called Smart Selection , which aims to recover a user’s intended text selection from her touch input. We model the problem using an ensemble learning approach, which leverages multiple linguistic analysis techniques combined with information from a knowledge base and a Web graph. We collect a dataset of true intended user selections and simulated user touches via a large-scale crowd-sourcing task, which we release to the academic community. We show that our model effectively addresses the smart selection task and signiﬁcantly outperforms various baselines and standalone linguistic analysis techniques.
