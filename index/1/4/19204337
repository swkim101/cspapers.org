With the explosive growth and interest in computer science, the CS education research community has been been asked significant questions from the K-12 community: What should students learn in a K-12 computer science pathway? When should they learn particular concepts? How do you implement computer science for all students? How can computer science be integrated into other subjects? The ACM, Code.org, CSTA, Cyber Innovation Center, and National Math and Science Initiative have collaborated with lead states/districts and the CS education community have developed the K-12 Computer Science Framework, a high-level guide for states or districts who want to design curriculum, standards, assessments, or teacher development programs. The framework identifies the core concepts and practices at grades 2, 5, 8, and 12. Yet the research base for the framework is incomplete. The BOF session will allow researchers to discuss opportunities in K-12 CS ed research within five areas related to the implementation and future of the framework: Equity and access, Learning progressions, Pedagogical content knowledge, Facilitating learning in other disciplines, and Policy and implementation within K-12 education systems.
