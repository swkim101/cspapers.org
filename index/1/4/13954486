We propose a novel semi-fragile multiple-watermarking algorithm based on quantization index modulation. This algorithm utilizes two quantization steps to yield the non-uniform intervals in the real-number axis. Each interval corresponds to one binary symbol, includes stable-zero (S0), unstable-zero (U0), stable-one (S1), and unstable-one (U1). In addition, visual cryptography is integrated with the watermarking algorithm to increase the watermark capacity. Therefore, the host image is embedded the multiple watermarks, and then we extract the watermarks from the corrupted image. According to the extracted watermarks, the algorithm achieves the tamper proofing and attack identification. From the experimental result, it shows single and multiple tampered areas are detected and demonstrates that the amount of test images will not influence the accuracy of attack identification.
