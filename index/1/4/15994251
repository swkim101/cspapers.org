As a programming assignment in a graduate programming course, students were to program an interactive word game, JOTTO. The language used was APL, under constraints of well-structured programming and complete control of the user-machine interaction. In response to complaints that teamwork was an impediment to programming and that it was not possible to write efficient well-structured programs in APL, the instructors undertook to complete the assignment working as a team. The results of the effort were carefully documented, including experiences with program modification, and are presented here, as they were to the class, to illustrate the principles that should be communicated to professional programmers.
