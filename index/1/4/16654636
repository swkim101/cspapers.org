This paper considers the problem of congestion in message-switched, or packet-switched, networks, which employ probabilistic routing schemes. A queueing model for the analysis of a local congestion control scheme is presented. Analytic study of the model shows that local congestion control with random routing is superior to similar control with deterministic routing for a particular example worked out here.
