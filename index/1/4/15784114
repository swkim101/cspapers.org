Open ports are typically used by server software to serve remote clients, and the usage historically leads to remote exploitation due to insufficient protection. Smartphone operating systems inherit the open port support, but since they are significantly different from traditional server machines in performance and availability guarantees, little is known about how smartphone applications use open ports and what the security implications are. In this paper, we perform the first systematic study of open port usage on mobile platform and their security implications. To achieve this goal, we design and implement OPAnalyzer, a static analysis tool which can effectively identify and characterize vulnerable open port usage in Android applications. Using OPAnalyzer, we perform extensive usage and vulnerability analysis on a dataset with over 100K Android applications. OPAnalyzer successfully classifies 99% of the mobile usage of open ports into 5 distinct families, and from the output, we are able to identify several mobile-specific usage scenarios such as data sharing in physical proximity. In our subsequent vulnerability analysis, we find that nearly half of the usage is unprotected and can be directly exploited remotely. From the identified vulnerable usage, we discover 410 vulnerable applications with 956 potential exploits in total. We manually confirmed the vulnerabilities for 57 applications, including popular ones with 10 to 50 million downloads on the official market, and also an app that is pre-installed on some device models. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to cause highly-severe damage such as remotely stealing contacts, photos, and even security credentials, and also performing sensitive actions such as malware installation and malicious code execution. We have reported these vulnerabilities and already got acknowledged by the application developers for some of them. We also propose countermeasures and improved practices for each usage scenario.
