A snake robot can traverse cluttered and irregular environments by using irregularities around its body as push-points to aid the propulsion. This characteristic feature of snake locomotion, denoted obstacle-aided locomotion, has received limited focus in previous literature. This paper presents a model of this phenomenon and a control strategy employing measured contact forces to maintain propulsion while simultaneously preventing the snake robot from being jammed between obstacles in its path. The simulation results validate the contact modelling approach and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.
