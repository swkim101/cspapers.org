This paper describes a PC-cluster based parallel DBMS, InfiniteDB, developed by the authors. InfiniteDB aims at efficiently storing and processing of massive databases in response to the rapidly growing in database size and the need of high performance analyzing of massive databases. It supports the parallelisms of intra-query, inter-query, intra-operation, inter-operation and pipelining. It provides effective strategies for processing massive databases including the multiple data declustering methods, the declustering-aware algorithms for the execution of relational operations and other database operations, and the adaptive query optimization method. It also provides the functions of parallel data warehousing and data mining, the coordinator-wrapper mechanism to support the integration of heterogeneous information resources on the Internet, and the fault tolerant and resilient infrastructures. It has been used in many applications and has proved quite effective for storing and processing massive databases in practice.
