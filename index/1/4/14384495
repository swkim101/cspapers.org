In this paper, we propose a set of concepts underlying the process and requirements of observation: that is, the process of employing web observatories for research. We refer to observation as a new concept, distinct from search, which we believe is worthy of study in its own right and note that the process of observation moves the focus of information retrieval away from universal coverage and towards improved quality of results and thus has many potential facets not necessarily present in traditional search.
