In this paper, we describe “The Evolution of SOC Interconnect and How NOC Fits Within It” which is being presented during the “A Decade of NOC Research-Where Do We Stand?” session at DAC 2010. The presentation looks at the features that have helped shape the development of on-chip interconnect solutions. The evolution of NoC is considered alongside the evolution of the AMBA on-chip communication architecture, and consideration is given to the techniques that are considered most important.
