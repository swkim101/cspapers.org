This paper describes a new location technique in the LOcation Processor (LOP), which is an automatic module location system for PWB. This technique consists of two items: one is the advanced algorithm for arbitrarily-sized and -shaped module location, and the other is the empirical path-anticipation method in the location optimization. Several experiments have proven the effectiveness of this technique, and have suggested a new approach to the automatic layout system for PWB and LSI.
