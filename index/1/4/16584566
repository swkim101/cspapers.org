This paper presents the development of a biomechatronic knee prosthesis for transfemoral amputees. This kind of prostheses are considered ‘intelligent’ because they are able to automatically adapt their response at the knee axis, as a natural knee does. This behavior is achieved by characterizing the amputee's gait through the signals captured with instrumentation of a prosthesis, which provides feedback about its current state along the gait cycle and therefore responds with the corresponding control action. In this case, unlike other commercially available intelligent knee prostheses, gait cycle characterization is based on accelerometers signals processed by an events detection algorithm. Two intelligent control strategies are presented: a bio-inspired approach, that consists of using a central pattern generator to generate a knee angle reference to be followed by the prosthesis during walking, and an adaptive scheme, that applies a control action proportional to the knee angle according to an auto-adaptive parameter dependant on gait speed. The mechanical design of the prosthesis is also presented, showing the knee joint mechanism and part of the manufacturing process. Results obtained from walking tests with both able body and amputees are shown, demonstrating the positive performance of the prosthesis in several aspects. Future works aimed at a finished product are also stated.
