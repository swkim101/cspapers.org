This paper presents a new active learning paradigm which considers not only the uncertainty of the classifier but also the diversity of the corpus. The two measures for uncertainty and diversity were combined using the MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) method to give the sampling scores in our active learning strategy. We incorporated MMR-based active machine-learning idea into the biomedical named-entity recognition system. Our experimental results indicated that our strategies for active-learning based sample selection could significantly reduce the human effort.
