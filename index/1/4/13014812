Traditional approaches to quantifier scope typically need stipulation to exclude readings that are unavailable to human understanders. This paper shows that quantifier scope phenomena can be precisely characterized by a semantic representation constrained by surface constituency, if the distinction between referential and quantificational NPs is properly observed. A CCG implementation is described and compared to other approaches.
