In this paper we present an implementation of a parallelized sparse matrix algorithm for solving the Neutron Diffusion Equation on the SUPRENUM multiprocessor system. The solution of the steady-state and transient Neutron Diffusion Equation is one of the major task in reactor physics. We used standard and preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Methods well suited for parallelization and vectorization on multiprocessor architectures. All presented algorithms were implemented on the 2 ChIster SUPRENUM at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.
