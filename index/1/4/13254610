Considering the exponential increase of Internet of Things (IoT) devices there is also unforeseen vulnerabilities associated with these IoT devices. One of the major problems in the IoT is the security testing and analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of deployments. Currently, there is no mechanism that performs security testing for IoT devices in different contexts. In addition, there is a missing framework to be able to adapt and tune accordingly with various security testing perspectives. In this paper, we propose an innovative security testbed targeted at IoT devices and also briefly introduce Adaptable and Tunable Framework (ATF) for testing IoT devices.
