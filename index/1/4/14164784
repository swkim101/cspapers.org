Traditionally, Bloom's Taxonomy has been used for creating exams and other student assessment instruments. In this paper, we advocate its use for specifying learning outcomes in computer science prior to assessment. We have found, over a period of three years, that this facilitates programmatic assessment and related accreditation activities; it benefits instructors selecting pedagogical tools and assignments; and it enhances communication among faculty engaged in curricular development. We describe Bloom's Taxonomy, illustrate a simple process for applying it in computer science (and other disciplines), and present a case study of how it may be applied in a CS1 course. We believe this process has considerably strengthened our department's assessment program and its ability to maintain its ABET accreditation.
