This paper reports a planar induction motor that can output 70 N translational thrust and 9 Nm torque with a response time of 10 ms. The motor consists of three linear induction armatures with vector control drivers and three optical mouse sensors. First, an idea to combine multiple linear induction elements is proposed. The power distribution to each element is derived from the position and orientation of that element. A discussion of the developed system and its measured characteristics follow. The experimental results highlight the potential of its direct drive features.
