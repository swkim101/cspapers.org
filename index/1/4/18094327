This paper studies fast access to data that are broadcast on multiple channels. Broadcast is a useful data dissemination technique because of its scalability, but is lacking when it comes to response time. Increasing the number of available broadcast channels is a logical way of increasing throughput. Little work, however, has considered the access structures necessary for making effective use of the additional channels. We propose various indexing schemes for a multi-channel broadcast program. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques in decreasing response time and tuning time via extensive experiments over a wide range of parameters.
