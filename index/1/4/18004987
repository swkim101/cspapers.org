A double cross-validation design was used to assess the practical predictive value of a logistic classification model developed to predict “high and low aptitude” for introductory computing. The validation study showed that the model would have a predictive accuracy of approximately 75% in actual application. The model variables were checked by formal hypotheses tests. The results of the study indicated that the classification model would be a useful tool for counseling and formation of “high and low aptitude” lecture sections in introductory computing.
