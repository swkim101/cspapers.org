Inspired by the CAP theorem, we identify three desirable properties when querying the Web of Data: Alignment (results up-to-date with sources), Coverage (results covering available remote sources), and Efficiency (bounded resources). In this short paper, we show that no system querying the Web can meet all three ACE properties, but instead must make practical trade-offs that we outline.
