Learning to program continues to be challenging for many students. This paper reports on problem-solving approaches undertaken by pair programming students. We examine reasons why some approaches lead to success while others lead to failure. We also identify some aspects of the Java language that appear to lead to student misconceptions. Finally, we provide suggestions for educators interested in helping students learn successful approaches and avoid unsuccessful ones.
