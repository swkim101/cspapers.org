This paper presents a short description of some of the methods and tools used in the TRIDENT Fire Control Software development. Use of a Program Design Language (PDL), use of a High Order Language (HOL) for programming, and the use of a SCHEMA approach to software debug are some of the highlights.
 This paper will discuss the TRIDENT Fire Control System software development effort, stressing Software Engineering concepts being used. Specific points that will be mentioned are:
 1. parallel computer - operating system development
 2. use of prototypes/planned updates
 3. structured design method
 4. use of a higher order language
 5. software test concepts
 6. configuration control/V & V effort
