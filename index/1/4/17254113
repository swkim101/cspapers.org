We present a new approach to intrinsic sum-mary evaluation, based on initial experiments in van Halteren and Teufel (2003), which combines two novel aspects: comparison of information content (rather than string similarity) in gold standard and system summary, measured in shared atomic information units which we call factoids , and comparison to more than one gold standard summary (in our data: 20 and 50 summaries respectively). In this paper, we show that factoid annotation is highly re-producible, introduce a weighted factoid score, estimate how many summaries are required for stable system rankings, and show that the factoid scores cannot be suâ€“ciently approximated by unigrams and the DUC information overlap measure.
