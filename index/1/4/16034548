An interactive graphical system has been effectively applied to the debugging of interactive graphical programs. The debugging system has been in operation for one year, has significantly reduced debugging time, has resulted in the development of better programs, and has aided in the teaching of programming. This paper concentrates on the interactive graphical techniques that were used to solve some major debugging problems.
