The transformation that has been accomplished in Cultural Heritage (CH) during the last decades has resulted in the production of vast amounts of content from many different cultural institutions, such as museums, libraries and archives. A large part of this rich content has been aggregated in digital platforms that serve as cross-domain hubs, which however offer limited usability and accessibility of content due to insufficient data and metadata quality. In our effort to make CH more accessible and reusable, we introduce WITH, an aggregation platform that provides enhanced services and enables human-computer collaboration for data annotations and enrichment. WITH excels existing cultural content aggregation platforms by advancing digital cultural data through the combination of artificial intelligence automation and creative user engagement, thus facilitating its accessibility, visibility, and re-use. In particular, by using image and free text analysis methodologies for automatic metadata enrichment, in accordance to the human expertise for enrichment and validation through crowdsourcing approaches with gamification elements, WITH combines the intelligence of humans and computers to improve the quality of digital cultural content and its presentation, establishing new ways of collaboration between cultural organizations and their audiences.
