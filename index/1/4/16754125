The problem of anomaly detection in time series has received a lot of attention in the past two decades. However, existing techniques cannot locate where the anomalies are within anomalous time series, or they require users to provide the length of potential anomalies. To address these limitations, we propose a self-learning online anomaly detection algorithm that automatically identifies anomalous time series, as well as the exact locations where the anomalies occur in the detected time series. We evaluate our approach on several real datasets, including two CPU manufacturing data from Intel. We demonstrate that our approach can successfully detect the correct anomalies without requiring any prior knowledge about the data.
