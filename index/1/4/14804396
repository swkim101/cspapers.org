Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has recently installed both a Compaq AlphaServer SC and an IBM SP, each with 4-way SMP nodes, allowing a direct comparison of the two architectures. In this paper, we describe our initial evaluation. The evaluation looks at both kernel and application performance for a spectral atmospheric general circulation model, an important application for the ORNL systems.
