When developing commercial software products it is crucial to select the right requirements for the right release and to have a short mean-time-to-market (MTTM) in order to be competitive. We report on a simulation of a model of market-driven requirements engineering processes with requirements selection quality as a key aspect. The simulator is built using an open source simulation framework and an evaluation of this framework is provided. The simulator enables investigation of how MTTM is affected by variations of internal and external process parameters. The results indicate that it is beneficial to put resources on a requirements screening phase, as this reduces the risk of process overload
