We discuss how to use techniques from such fields as text processing and knowledge management to better handle text attributes in the Infobright's RDBMS engine. Our approach leads to a rich interface for domain experts who wish to share their knowledge about data content and, on the other hand, it remains unnoticeable to data users. It enables to improve data storage, data access, and data compression, with no changes required at the database schema level.
