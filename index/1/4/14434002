Most of the geometric information in a scene is captured by local coordinate frames oriented according to local geometric features. In polyhedral worlds these features are faces, vertices and edges. Such features lead naturally to parallel algorithms for building such a scene description from stereo input that are insensitive to noise and occlusion. This representation can be used for object location, object recognition, and navigation.
