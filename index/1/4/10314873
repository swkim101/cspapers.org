In this paper, we propose the use of compliant elements in the actuation of a wheel-legged robot in order to improve its locomotion properties on unknown and irregular terrains. Detection of the obstacles is achieved by a synergistic use of the structural compliances. The robot's capabilities to surmount steep obstacles is thus improved thanks to the inertia of the chassis and flexibility in postural control. In the proposed robot's kinematics, the four wheels are attached to the main body through vertical series elastic actuators (SEA) and with a passive horizontal compliant mechanism subject to a specific wheel speed control. The overall control relies on postural servoing and a local reactive loop which adapts the vertical forces applied by the SEA on each wheel according to the detected obstacle and the stability margin. The resulting system is evaluated with physical simulations for two case studies: a canonical steep obstacle on one wheel at a time and multiple random rough terrains.
