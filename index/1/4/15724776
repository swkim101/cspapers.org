The fast temporal-dynamics and intrinsic motion segmentation of event-based cameras are beneficial for robotic tasks that require low-latency visual tracking and control, for example a robot catching a ball. When the event-driven iCub humanoid robot grasps an object its head and torso move, inducing camera motion, and tracked objects become no longer trivially segmented amongst the mass of background clutter. Current event-based tracking algorithms have mostly considered stationary cameras that have clean event-streams with minimal clutter. This paper introduces novel methods to extend the Hough-based circle detection algorithm using optical flow information that is readily extracted from the spatio-temporal event space. Results indicate the proposed directed-Hough algorithm is more robust to other moving objects and the background event-clutter. Finally, we demonstrate successful on-line robot control and gaze following on the iCub robot.
