Investigating potential purchases, such as a start-up company to acquire, is often a substantial investment under uncertainty. Standard market designs, such as simultaneous or ascending price auctions, compound this with additional uncertainty about the eventual price a bidder will have to pay in order to win. As a result they tend to confuse the process of search by leading to both wasteful information acquisition on goods that have already found a good purchaser and discouraging needed investigations of objects, potentially eliminating all gains from trade. Fully efficient procedures that avoid these problems, such as dynamic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves processes, are extremely complex and fragile. By contrast, we show that the Dutch auction preserves all of its properties from a standard setting without information costs because it guarantees, at the time of information acquisition, a price at which the good can be purchased.
