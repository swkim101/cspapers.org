We introduce the concept of "peripersonal space" of an avatar in 3D virtual reality and discuss how it plays an important role on 3D navigation with different perspectives. By analyzing the eye-gaze data of avatar-based navigation with first-person perspective and third-person perspective, we examine the effects of an avatar's peripersonal space on the users' perceptual scopes within 3D virtual environments. We propose that manipulating peripersonal space of an avatar with various perspectives has the immediate effects on the users' scopes of perception as well as the patterns of attentional capture. This study provides a helpful guideline for designing more effective navigation system with an avatar in 3D virtual environment.
