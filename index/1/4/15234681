Most known teaching experiences focus on parallel computing courses only, but some teaching experiences on distributed computing courses have also been reported. In this paper we describe a course on Parallel and Distributed Processing that is taught at undergraduate level in the Computer Science degree of our University.This course presents an integrated approach concerning concurrency, parallelism, and distribution issues. It's a breadth-first course addressing a wide spectrum of abstractions: the theoretical component focus on the fundamental abstractions to model concurrent systems, including process cooperation schemes, concurrent programming models, data and control distribution, concurrency control and recovery in transactional systems, and parallel processing models; the practical component illustrates the design and implementation issues involved in selected topics such as a data and control distribution problem, a distributed transaction-based support system and a parallel algorithm.We also discuss how this approach has been contributing to prepare the student to further actions regarding research and development of concurrent, distributed, or parallel systems.
