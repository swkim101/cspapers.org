In spite of the the issues associated with them, text passwords are the predominant means of user authentication today. To foster the adoption of alternative authentication schemes, Renaud et al. (2014) proposed the ACCESS (Authentication ChoiCE Support System) framework. In prior work, we presented the first implementation of this abstract framework as a decision support system. In this work, we report on the current progress of expanding our prototype implementation into a collaborative authentication research platform. In addition to a decision support system, this platform also includes an interface to systematically access all the information in the knowledge base and collaborative features to facilitate the process of keeping the data for the decision support system current.
