The task of review rating prediction can be well addressed by using regression algorithms if there is a reliable training set of reviews with human ratings. In this paper, we aim to investigate a more challenging task of crosslanguage review rating prediction, which makes use of only rated reviews in a source language (e.g. English) to predict the rating scores of unrated reviews in a target language (e.g. German). We propose a new coregression algorithm to address this task by leveraging unlabeled reviews. Evaluation results on several datasets show that our proposed co-regression algorithm can consistently improve the prediction results.
