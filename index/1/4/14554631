Multilinear algebra is a powerful theoretical tool for visual geometry, but widespread usage of traditional typographical notation often hides its conceptual elegance and simplicity. As demonstrated in other scientific fields, we can take full advantage of multilinear methods using graphical notation. In this paper we adapt standard tensor diagrammatic techniques to the specific requirements of visual geometry, so that geometric relations are represented by circuits which can be manipulated using simple rules. The advantages of this approach are illustrated in several constructions, including straightforward derivations of the standard multiview relations (Fundamental Matrix, Trifocal and Quadrifocal Tensors), and nearly mechanical procedures for camera extraction.
