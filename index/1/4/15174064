Simply considering labels as independent or correlated is crude; it would be beneficial to define and exploit the causality between multiple labels. For example, an image label 'lake' implies the label 'water', but not vice versa. Since the original features are a disorderly mixture of the properties originating from different labels, it is intuitive to factorize these raw features to clearly represent each individual label and its causality relationship.Following the large-margin principle, we propose an effective approach to discover the causal features of multiple labels, thus revealing the causality between labels from the perspective of feature. We show theoretically that the proposed approach is a tight approximation of the empirical multi-label classification error, and the causality revealed strengthens the consistency of the algorithm. Extensive experimentations using synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively discovers label causality, generates causal features, and improves multi-label learning.
