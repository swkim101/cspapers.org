In this paper, we present GDA, a generalized decision aggregation framework that integrates information from distributed sensor nodes for decision making in a resource efficient manner. Traditional approaches that target similar problems only take as input the discrete label information from individual sensors that observe the same events. Different from them, our proposed GDA framework is able to take advantage of the confidence information of each sensor about its decision, and thus achieves higher decision accuracy. Targeting generalized problem domains, our framework can naturally handle the scenarios where different sensor nodes observe different sets of events whose numbers of possible classes may also be different. GDA also makes no assumption about the availability level of ground truth label information, while being able to take advantage of any if present. For these reasons, our approach can be applied to a much broader spectrum of sensing scenarios. The advantages of our proposed framework are demonstrated through both theoretic analysis and extensive experiments.
