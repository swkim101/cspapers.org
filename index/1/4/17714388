In this paper, a flexible microassembly system based on hybrid manipulation scheme is proposed and applied to the assembly of a photonic component. In order to achieve both high precision and dexterity in microassembly, we propose a hybrid microassembly system with sensory feedbacks of vision and force. This system consists of the distributed 6-DOF micromanipulation units, the stereo microscope, and haptic interface for the force feedback-based microassembly. A hybrid assembly method, which combines the vision-based microassembly and the scaled teleoperated microassembly with force feedback, is proposed. The feasibility of the proposed method is investigated via experimental studies for assembly micro opto-electrical components. Experimental results show that the hybrid microassembly system is feasible for applications to the assembly of photonic components in the commercial market with better flexibility and efficiency.
