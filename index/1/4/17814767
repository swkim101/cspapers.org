Protocols which include key-distribution and data exchange phases in an asynchronous, shared key, multidomain environment are examined. A model of a distributed system is presented and the goals of the multidomain protocols are formulated. The minimal number of messages for two variants of such protocols is proved. Two multi-domain protocols which contain the minimal number of messages are presented. The results are compared with previously published work.
