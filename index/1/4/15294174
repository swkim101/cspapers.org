Traditionally, examinations have served as evaluation tools for the instructor to aid in assigning grades and to detect concepts not yet mastered by students.
 Questions requiring more information in the response than just a single word or number can give a better indication of the student's knowledge of the concepts being tested.
 This type of question is more difficult to grade because the correct answer is not a single word or number, there may be more than one correct answer, or some responses may deserve partial credit. Hand grading of such questions is often inconsistent and laborious. Automatic grading systems have been developed which score responses to complicated problems and analyze student deficiences (e.g., [2], [3]), but these methods may be too time-consuming for use in an interactive environment.
 An alternate approach to complex grading is to adapt the problems to the abilities of the student. An oral exam is an example of this approach.
 This paper discusses some problems and solutions of administering an “oral exam” via a computer. Such an exam will be referred to as a “tailored exam”. The tailored exam extends to examinations some of the ideas used in individualized instruction in Computer Assisted Instruction.
