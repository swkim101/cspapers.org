In this paper, an impedance control scheme for cooperative quadrotors with robotic arms is proposed in order to limit both the contact forces, due to the object/environment interaction, and the internal forces, due to the manipulators/ object interaction. To this aim, two impedance filters are used to determine the reference trajectories for manipulator end effectors: the first is aimed at conferring a compliant behavior at the object level (external impedance), while the second filter, is aimed at avoiding large internal loading of the object (internal impedance). Such trajectories are fed to a motion controller including an inverse kinematics algorithm and a PD controller with gravity compensation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is then verified in simulation.
