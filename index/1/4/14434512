This paper discusses the concepts and philosophy underlying a layout digitizing and mask pen plotting system developed by Rockwell International for custom microelectronic devices. It is a system composed of high reliability components requiring minimal maintenance. The software has been implemented to provide extremely simple methodologies enabling the device designer to perform the requisite procedures in an informal operating environment. This system has proven to be extremely cost effective in our computer-aided design environment.
