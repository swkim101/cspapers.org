The new concept proposed in this paper is a query free web search that automatically retrieves a web page including information related to the daily activity that we are currently engaged in for automatically displaying the page on Internet-connected domestic appliances around us such as televisions. When we are washing a coffee maker, for example, a web page is retrieved that includes tips such as `cleaning a coffee maker with vinegar removes stains well.' A method designed on the basis of this concept automatically searches for a web page by using a query constructed from the use of ordinary household objects that is detected by sensors attached to the objects. An in-situ experiment tests a variety of IR techniques and the experiment confirmed that our daily activities can produce related web pages with high accuracy.
