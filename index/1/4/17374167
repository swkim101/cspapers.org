The problems of circuit partitioning and chip placement have been studied in the past. Given a circuit partitioned into chips, one can optimize the placement of the chips on a printed circuit board with regard to a given cost function. Conversely, given a placement of the chips on the board, one can optimize the partitioning of the circuit into the chips with regard to the same cost function. However, given neither the circuit partitioning nor the chip placement, we are faced with a difficult optimization problem. Our target technology is one in which the chips are unpackaged chips placed on a substrate, analogous to the printed circuit board and interconnected together with high density interconnect to realize a complex system. We propose a new approach in which the circuit is both partitioned and placed simultaneously by a simulated annealing based algorithm. Our approach is seen to yield excellent results in reasonable run times.
