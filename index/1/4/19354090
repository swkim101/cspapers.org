Semantic mapping for autonomous mobile robots includes the place classification task that associates semantic labels (like ‘corridor’ or ‘office’) to rooms perceived in indoor environments. The mainstream approaches to place classification are characterized by local reasoning, where only features relative to the neighbourhood of each room are considered. In this paper, we propose a method for global reasoning on the whole structure of buildings, considered as single structured objects. We use a statistical relational learning algorithm, called kLog, and we compare it against a classifier, Extra-Trees, which resembles classical local approaches, in three tasks: classification of rooms, classification of entire floors of buildings, and validation of simulated worlds. Our results show that our global approach performs better than local approaches when the classification task involves reasoning on the regularities of buildings and when available information about rooms is coarse-grained.
