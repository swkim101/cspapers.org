With the booming development of the Web, popular Chinese forums enable people to find experienced customers' reviews for products. In order to get an all-around opinion about one product, users need to go through plenty of web pages, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Consequently, automatic review mining and summarization has become a hot research topic recently. However, previous approaches are not applicable for mining Chinese customer reviews. In this paper, we introduce SOPING, a Chinese customer review mining system that mines reviews from forums. Specifically, we propose a novel search-based approach to extract product features and a feature-oriented sentence orientation determination method. Our experimental results show that our proposed techniques are highly effective.
