This paper enables data storage and interaction with smart fabric, without the need for onboard electronics or batteries. To do this, we present the first smart fabric design that harnesses the ferromagnetic properties of conductive thread. Specifically, we manipulate the polarity of magnetized fabric and encode different forms of data including 2D images and bit strings. These bits can be read by swiping a commodity smartphone across the fabric, using its inbuilt magnetometer. Our results show that magnetized fabric retains its data even after washing, drying and ironing. Using a glove made of magnetized fabric, we can also perform six gestures in front of a smartphone, with a classification accuracy of 90.1%. Finally, using magnetized thread, we create fashion accessories like necklaces, ties, wristbands and belts with data storage capabilities as well as enable authentication applications.
