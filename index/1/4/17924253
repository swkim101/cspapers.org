This paper proposes a scalable communication layer for a multi-dimensional hyper crossbar network using multiple Gigabit Ethernet for the PACS-CS system which consists of 2560 single-processor nodes and a 16 x 16 x 10 three dimensional hyper-crossbar network (3D-HXB). To realize a high performance communication layer using multiple existing Ethernet networks, the host processor usage for the communication processing must be reduced to less than the appropriate packet processing time which is calculated from a message size and a target communication bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we have developed the PM/Ethernet-HXB communication facility. PM/Ethernet-HXB realizes communication protocol processing without exclusion even for Zero-copy communication between the communication buffers of nodes. We have implemented the PM/Ethernet-HXB on SCore cluster system software, and evaluated its communication and application performance. PM/Ethernet-HXB achieves a unidirectional communication bandwidth of 1065 MB/s using nine Gigabit Ethernet links on a single dimension network. It also realizes a unidirectional communication bandwidth of 741 MB/s (98.8% of the theoretical performance) and a bidirectional bandwidth of 1401 MB/s (93.4% of the theoretical performance) on the three dimensional connections (3D-HXB: a total of six Ethernet links). The results of MPI communication bandwidth are a unidirectional communication bandwidth of 960 MB/s and a bidirectional bandwidth of 1008 MB/s using eight links on a single dimension network. These results show that PM/Ethernet-HXB realizes a comparative performance using multiple Gigabit Ethernet networks to dedicated cluster networks such as InfiniBand 4x (1000 MB/s). The speedups of IS and CG Class C NAS parallel benchmarks are scalable up to using four links on eight node cluster, and performance degradation between 3D-HXB (2 x 2 x 2) and 1-dimensional network is small.
