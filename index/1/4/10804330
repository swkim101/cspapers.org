DSTC’s model transformation tool, Tefkat, is an implementation of a declarative transformation language proposed in reposonse to the OMG’s MOF 2.0 QVT RFP. The language contains several distinct features aimed specifically at enabling re-use and enhacing the maintainability of large transformation specifications. In this position paper we describe these features, how they contribute to the language and the definition of transformations, and the benefits when compared to other approaches.
