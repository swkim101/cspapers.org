The design, implementation, and evaluation of a miniature biped robot for urban reconnaissance are presented. Design specifications for mobility, space requirement weight, sensing, and control are defined. A revolute hip joint is selected based on its enhanced mobility and capability to function in reasonably confined spaces. Small size dictates minimal weight, which is achieved by an under actuated joint structure, providing steering at only one foot, minimizing sensors, and structural optimization. The smart robotic foot supports the robot on a variety of smooth surfaces and provides feedback when a firm grip is established. Adaptable control strategies and dithering are implemented in lieu of minimal sensors and uncertainty created by backlash, gravity, and compliance in the suction feet. The robot is evaluated while performing tasks on surfaces with a variety of inclinations.
