Even with the eyes closed, humans are able to grip an object with minimal force without such information as the coefficient of friction or the weight. Tactile sensors capable of detecting slippage are necessary for this gripping action to be realized in a robot hand. Heretofore, many slip sensors were developed and produced, but there was not a slip sensor of simple structure practical for installation on fingertips of a robot hand. Therefore, we propose a low-profile/lightweight slip sensor of simple structure. The special properties of pressure conductive rubber are utilized as a detection device in this sensor. In this paper, we discuss the results of trial manufacture and of slip detection property testing of this sensor. Moreover, we will report the results of slip prevention experiments by this prototype slip sensor, and indicate that the pressure conductive rubber is promising as a material of slip sensor.
