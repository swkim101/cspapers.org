Constructing evolutionary trees for species sets is a fundamental problem in computational biology. One of the standard models assumes the ability to compute distances between every pair of species, and seeks to find an edge-weighted treeT in which the distanced ij T in the tree between the leaves ofT corresponding to the speciesi andj exactly equals the observed distance,d ij . When such a tree exists, this is expressed in the biological literature by saying that the distance function or matrix isadditive, and trees can be constructed from additive distance matrices in0(n 2) time. Real distance data is hardly ever additive, and we therefore need ways of modeling the problem of finding the best-fit tree as an optimization problem.
