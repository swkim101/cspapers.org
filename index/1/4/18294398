This paper is a tutorial intended primarily for individuals just getting started in digital testing. Basic concepts of testing are described, and the steps in the test development process are discussed. A pragmatic approach to test sequence generation is presented, oriented towards ICs interconnected on a board. Finally, design for testability techniques are described, with an emphasis on solving problems that appeared during the test generation discussion.
