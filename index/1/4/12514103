We propose a fully automatic system for cardiac view classification of echocardiogram. Given an echo study video sequence, the system outputs a view label among the pre-defined standard views. The system is built based on a machine learning approach that extracts knowledge from an annotated database. It characterizes three features: 1) integrating local and global evidence, 2) utilizing view specific knowledge, and 3) employing a multi-class Logit-boost algorithm. In our prototype system, we classify four standard cardiac views: apical four chamber and apical two chamber, parasternal long axis and parasternal short axis (at mid cavity). We achieve a classification accuracy over 96% both of training and test data sets and the system runs in a second in the environment of Pentium 4 PC with 3.4 GHz CPU and 1.5 G RAM.
