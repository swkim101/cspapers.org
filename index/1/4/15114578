In this paper we focus on the task of automatically and autonomously initiating experimentation and learning based on the recognition of prediction failure. We present a mechanism that utilizes conceptual knowledge to predict the outcome of robot actions, observes their execution and indicates when discrepancies occur. We show how this mechanism was applied to a robot that learns using the paradigm of learning by experimentation, and present first results obtained from this implementation.
