Object technology is an approach that is increasingly being adopted for the development of quality software and software-intensive systems. Recent experience has demonstrated that it provides a sophisticated environment to support high quality software engineering practice. However, the use of object technology should not be restricted to languages but should encompass analysis, design, V&V and many such aspects belonging to the methodological dimension of the development life-cycle. Furthermore, it should also cover other issues belonging to the technological and contextual aspects.
