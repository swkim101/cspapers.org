NetUnify.com is a hosted service that enables its customers to maintain their project related material in a secure fashion over the Internet. They can grant access on a project-by-project basis to their employees, vendors, and customers. In addition, organizations can choose to operate their own NetUnify server rather than use the NetUnify.com service.
The NetUnify server is implemented in Squeak (see http://www.squeak.org), an open-source, highly portable object oriented environment. The OOPSLA paper titled “Back to the Future” [2] by the Walt Disney Imagineering team provides an excellent overview of the Squeak story.
