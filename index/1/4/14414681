Recent work has shown that compositionaldistributional models using element-wise operations on contextual word vectors benefit from the introduction of a prior disambiguation step. The purpose of this paper is to generalise these ideas to tensor-based models, where relational words such as verbs and adjectives are represented by linear maps (higher order tensors) acting on a number of arguments (vectors). We propose disambiguation algorithms for a number of tensor-based models, which we then test on a variety of tasks. The results show that disambiguation can provide better compositional representation even for the case of tensor-based models. Furthermore, we confirm previous findings regarding the positive effect of disambiguation on vector mixture models, and we compare the effectiveness of the two approaches.
