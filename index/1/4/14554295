We propose a novel flow control method to realize flow regulation and valveless flow switching in a microfluidic network. The proposed controller enables precise regulation of flow rates (or velocity fields) in micro-channels regardless of model uncertainties such as cross-sectional area and microchannel configuration. The controller can also minimize the pressure exerted on the microfluidic chip. The proposed system can dramatically improve performances of flow regulation and can overcome the limitations of conventional pump systems for microfluidic devices.
