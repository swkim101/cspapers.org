Queueing network models are effective tools for capacity planning of computer systems. The base of all performance oriented questions is the characterization of the computer system workload. At the capacity planning level the workload is described in user-oriented terms. At the system level the queueing network model requires input parameters, which differ from the workload description at the capacity planning level. In this paper a general procedure to transform the parameters between these two levels is presented and applied to a case study. The effect on system performance of an increase in the use of an existing application system is analysed.
