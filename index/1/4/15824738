The objective of this work is to enhance man-machine collaboration in cell production by task modeling approach. Task modeling provides a method to define and study the collaboration between man and machine. Six requirements have been derived as basis of development. In this work, the task modeling has extended classical HTA method to represent collaborative operation in a hierarchical structure with the classification of operation task levels and extended operation details as task properties. A modeling tool is developed to provide a development and data management platform. The man-machine collaboration is well defined in a structural format by the ability of task analysis method to address human task in a more flexible way. The collaboration modeling and operation resources information have significantly facilitated operation planning in both assembly and control levels. From the case study, the improvement in safety aspect has proven the ability of this approach in assisting safety design and development of production system. The integration with operation control system has shown the execution potential in real-time operation. The unique development of operation data management has expanded this work into operation information support. Through the multimodal information support system, the human operator is well guided by the operation information corresponded to the task components. The operation information also can work as evaluation functions to measure the human working performance and system performance as a whole.
