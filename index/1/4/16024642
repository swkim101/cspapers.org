The current Internet has no secure way to validate the correctness of the routing information. We suggest a mechanism that supports secure validation of routing information in the interdomain routing protocol of the Internet. Our mechanism focuses on alleviating obstacles which previously prevent the complete and correct construction of the Internet routing information. In particular, we propose an identity-based Registry with Authorized and Verifiable Search (RAVS) so that routing information can be constructed securely. We construct an efficient RAVS scheme and prove its securities in the random oracle model. By our scheme, the routing information can be securely stored and tested without revealing contents of both the registry and the search query. Furthermore, our registry is verifiable and its correctness is guaranteed. Only the legal autonomous system (AS) can construct the valid registry and the single compromised AS can be detected. Our experiment shows that our RAVS scheme can be implemented efficiently and the incurred overhead, in terms of time and space, is acceptable in practice.
