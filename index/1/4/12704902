We describe a new method of proving lower bounds on the depth of algebraic decision trees and apply it to prove a lower bound $\Omega (\log N)$ for testing membership to a convex polyhedron having $N$ facets of all dimensions. This bound apparently does not follow from the methods developed by M.\ Ben-Or,\ A.\ Bj\"orner,\ L.\ Lovasz,\ A.\ Yao (\cite{B 83}, \cite{BLY 92}) because the topological invariants used in these methods become trivial for the convex polyhedra.
