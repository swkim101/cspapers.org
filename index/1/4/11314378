Phase Changing Memory (PCM), as one of the most promising next-generation memory technologies, offers various attractive properties such as non-volatility, bit-alterability, and low idle energy consumption. In this paper, we present PCMLogging, a novel logging scheme that exploits PCM devices for both data buffering and transaction logging in disk-based databases. Different from the traditional approach where buffered updates and transaction logs are completely separated, they are integrated in the new logging scheme. Our preliminary experiments show an up to 40% improvement of PCMLogging in disk I/O performance in comparison with a basic buffering and logging scheme.
