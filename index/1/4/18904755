Real-time application using MATLAB is very difficult to be implemented since the implementation requires very long and tedious programming code. This paper presents an approach to design real-time signal generator system that uses Graphical User Interface (GUI) development tools provided in MATLAB 6.5. The real-time signal generator GUI aimed to compensate the difficulties of writing programming code that enables a beginner to use the application without having to write programming code. The system uses Humosoft AD612 data acquisition card as the hardware part. The signals generated from the GUI are compared with the external oscilloscope to verify the reliability of the GUI. The example of application described in this paper is virtual oscilloscope with 3 independent channels display for real time signal generation.
