In traditional active learning, there is only one labeler that always returns the ground truth of queried labels. However, in many applications, multiple labelers are available to offer diverse qualities of labeling with different costs. In this paper, we perform active selection on both instances and labelers, aiming to improve the classification model most with the lowest cost. While the cost of a labeler is proportional to its overall labeling quality, we also observe that different labelers usually have diverse expertise, and thus it is likely that labelers with a low overall quality can provide accurate labels on some specific instances. Based on this fact, we propose a novel active selection criterion to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of instance-labeler pairs, which ensures that the selected instance is helpful for improving the classification model, and meanwhile the selected labeler can provide an accurate label for the instance with a relative low cost. Experiments on both UCI and real crowdsourcing data sets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach on selecting cost-effective queries.
