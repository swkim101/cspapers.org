Keyword-based retrieval matches search terms and documents via term co-occurrence. Such an approach does not allow matching based on the specific plant characteristic descriptions that are often used in botanical text retrieval. This study applies information extraction techniques to automatically extract plant characteristic information from text and allows users to search using such information in combination with keywords. An evaluation experiment was conducted using actual users. The results indicate that this approach enhances task-based retrieval performance.
