This work explores the use of unsupervised morph segmentation along with statistical language models for the task of vocabulary expansion. Unsupervised vocabulary expansion has large potential for improving vocabulary coverage and performance in different natural language processing tasks, especially in less-resourced settings on morphologically rich languages. We propose a combination of unsupervised morph segmentation and statistical language models and evaluate on languages from the Babel corpus. The method is shown to perform well for all the evaluated languages when compared to the previous work on the task.
