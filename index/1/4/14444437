We present an optimal algorithm for informative path planning (IPP), using a branch and bound method inspired by feature selection algorithms. The algorithm uses the monotonicity of the objective function to give an objective function-dependent speedup versus brute force search. We present results which suggest that when maximizing variance reduction in a Gaussian process model, the speedup is significant.
