In in-flow peer review, students provide feedback to one another on intermediate artifacts on their way to a final submission. Prior work has studied examples and tests as a potentially useful initial artifact for review. Unfortunately, large test suites are onerous to produce and especially to review. We instead propose the notion of a sweep, an artificially constrained set of tests that illustrates common and interesting behavior. We present experimental data across several courses that show that sweeps have reasonable quality, and are also a good target for peer review; for example, students usually (over half the time) suggest new tests to one another in a review.
