A novel high gain printed dipole-yagi antenna array is proposed in this paper. This antenna has the gain peak of 15.86 dBi and the bandwidth of 1.4 GHz from 4.2 GHz to 5.6 GHz with wide angle coverage in azimuth plane. An antenna prototype has been tested in this paper. The measurements agree with simulations results. This low-profile antenna is easily integrated in front-end for modern wireless communication systems.
