This paper describes the construction of tele-macro/micro handling/machining system with a predictive information display. Applications of the system are tele-machining, where the operator controls a remotely located machining machine, a micro-handling system, which operates on micro-scale objects under the microscope, and a micro surgery system. In the case of constructing a teleoperated handling/machining system, displaying information appropriately to the operator is essential to improve the operability of the system. The authors selected a machine tool as a tele-operated machine and, in particular, discuss the method of predictive force and sound information display.<<ETX>>
