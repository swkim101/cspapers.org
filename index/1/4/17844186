Ubiquity of wearable devices sparked a new set of mobile computing applications that leverage the prolific information of sensors. I will focus on two main research questions: face recognition on smart glass and gait recognition on smart watch. Face recognition is one of the most popular research problems on various platforms. New research issues arise when it comes to resource constrained devices, such as smart glasses, due to the overwhelming computation and energy requirements of the accurate face recognition methods. Biometric gait recognition refers to verifying or identifying persons by their walking style, and it provides a unobtrusive way to authenticate the user and unlock the smart watches.
