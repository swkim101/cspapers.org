Discusses the trajectory control for a wheeled inverse pendulum type mobile robot. The robot considered has two independent driving wheels on the same axle, and a gyro type sensor for measuring the inclination angular velocity of the body and rotary encoders to measure the wheels' rotation. The purpose of the authors' work is to make the robot autonomously navigate in a two dimensional plane while keeping balance of its body. The control algorithm consists of three parts; the balancing and velocity control, the heading control, and the trajectory control part. The authors designed and implemented a vehicle command system for this robot with the proposed algorithm. Experiments in real world navigation have been made by using the authors' experimental system "Yamabico Kurara".<<ETX>>
