This paper is devoted to the performance optimization of an aerial manipulation system composed of a Flettner-helicopter and 7 DoF manipulator. With experiments we demonstrate that the time delays in signal propagation between perception and actuation modules play an important role for the overall performance of an aerial manipulator system using visual servoing. We present an approach for estimation of the perception-action time delay and its active compensation based on the predicted motion of the manipulator end-effector.
