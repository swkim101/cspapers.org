In thk paper, we discuss the problem of estimating a COUNT(E) query having a guaranteed error bound with a certain confidence level, where E is an arbitrary relational algebra (RA) expression with Select, Join and Intersection operations. Such a~ estimate is useful in query optimization as well as in real-time databases as it takes significantly less time to obtain compared with evaluating COUNT(E) completely. To guarantee the desired error bound with the given confidence level, we use double sampling (or two-phase sampling) where in the first stage preliminary information is obtained from a small pilot sample taken from the input relations. And then, the sample size for the second stage is deter-
