We present BRAINSUP, an extensible framework for the generation of creative sentences in which users are able to force several words to appear in the sentences and to control the generation process across several semantic dimensions, namely emotions, colors, domain relatedness and phonetic properties. We evaluate its performance on a creative sentence generation task, showing its capability of generating well-formed, catchy and effective sentences that have all the good qualities of slogans produced by human copywriters.
