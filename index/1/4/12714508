This research work proposes a robotized workstation for automatic disassembly of electric vehicle motors. A novel image processing algorithm is proposed for autonomous detection of motor screws, to automate the task of motor disassembly. Instead of having a database of templates for matching, the screws are detected based on their characteristics with respect to its grayscale, depth and HSV values. Furthermore, with frame iterations, the accuracy of the system is increased mean while reducing its runtime. The algorithm is successfully tested and implemented and yields highly accurate results.
