This paper provides a binary, token-based classiﬁcation of German particle verbs (PVs) into literal vs. non-literal usage. A random forest improving standard features (e.g., bag-of-words; affective ratings) with PV-speciﬁc information and abstraction over common nouns signiﬁcantly outperforms the majority baseline. In addition, PV-speciﬁc classiﬁ-cation experiments demonstrate the role of shared particle semantics and semantically related base verbs in PV meaning shifts.
