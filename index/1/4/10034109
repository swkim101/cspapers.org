ADSTRA CT. The study of the human hand in prehensile movements can offer insights into the design of robot grasp planners. A design for a two-level llierarchical grasp planner is presented. The first phase maps an object and task representation into a grasporiented description of the task The second phase maps this description into an opposition space, which captures the available foices and degrees of freedom of the hand As these mappings are not unique, constraints acting on the hand/object /task interaction are discussed.
