Grid computing has the potential to drastically change enterprise computing as we know it today. The main concept of grid computing is viewing computing as a utility. It should not matter where data resides, or what computer processes a task. This concept has been applied successfully to academic research. It also has many advantages for commercial data warehouse applications such as virtualization, flexible provisioning, reduced cost due to commodity hardware, high availability and high scale-out. In this paper we show how a large-scale, high-performing and scalable grid-based data warehouse can be implemented using commodity hardware (industry-standard x86-based). Oracle Database 10g and the Linux operating system. We further demonstrate this architecture in a recently published TPC-H benchmark.
