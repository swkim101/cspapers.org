In this paper we introduce a multi agent deontic update semantics, that builds on a logic of prescriptive obligations (norms) and a logic of descriptive obligations (normative propositions). In this preference-based logic we formalize rights as a new type of strong prescriptive permissions and duties and commitments as prescriptive obligations between agents.
