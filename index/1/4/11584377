We propose a novel camera calibration method for defocused images using a smartphone under the assumption that the defocus blur is modeled as a convolution of a sharp image with a Gaussian point spread function (PSF). In contrast to existing calibration approaches which require well-focused images, the proposed method achieves accurate camera calibration with severely defocused images. This robustness to defocus is due to the proposed set of unidirectional binary patterns, which simplifies 2D Gaussian deconvolution to a 1D Gaussian deconvolution problem with multiple observations. By capturing the set of patterns consecutively displayed on a smartphone, we formulate the feature extraction as a deconvolution problem to estimate feature point locations in sub-pixel accuracy and the blur kernel in each location. We also compensate the error in camera parameters due to refraction of the glass panel of the display device. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on synthetic and real data. Even under severe defocus, our method shows accurate camera calibration result.
