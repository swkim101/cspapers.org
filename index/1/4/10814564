This paper seeks to characterize the space of techniques that exist for interactive externalisations (visualizations). A selection of visualizations are classified with respect to: the types of data represented, the nature of the visible feedback displayed and the forms of interactivity used. Such characterization provides a method for evaluating potential designs and comparing different tools.
