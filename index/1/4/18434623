In this paper we describe a platform for embodied conversational agents with tutoring goals, which takes as input written and spoken questions and outputs answers in both forms. The platform is developed within a game environment, and currently allows speech recognition and synthesis in Portuguese, English and Spanish. In this paper we focus on its understanding component that supports in-domain interactions, and also small talk. Most in-domain interactions are answered using different similarity metrics, which compare the perceived utterances with questions/sentences in the agent’s knowledge base; small-talk capabilities are mainly due to AIML, a language largely used by the chatbots’ community. In this paper we also introduce E DGAR , the butler of M ONSERRATE , which was developed in the aforementioned platform, and that answers tourists’ questions about M ONSER - RATE .
