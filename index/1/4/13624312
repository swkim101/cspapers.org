A relatively small computing system can assist the engineer in performing logic design, simulation, component placement and interconnection
 Graphic computer-aided design methods improve the man-machine relationship. The combination of a small computer, disk storage units, high performance display, low -cost on-line plotter and unit record I/O devices offers significant benefits to the user.
 Even the small-sized system is enhanced by a multitasking operating system. The major benefit realized is accessibility for the user. Any nonbusy facility can be immediately accessed by the designer; he doesn't need to wait for the current computer job to complete. The multitasking program attempts to keep all devices operating full- time, thereby offering better system utilization.
 Remote Job Entry (RJE) to a larger computer system via the telephone network allows the small system to handle extremely large computations for the user. The graphic system operates as a satellite to the larger system, providing the user with a powerful input/output facility, as well as performing local computation.
