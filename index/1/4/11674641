Modern software engineering environments provide programmers with contextual information on methods and classes in their software system. However, programmers increasingly encounter frameworks such as Microsoft Foundation Classes or Enterprise Java Beans whose required plug-in mechanisms cannot be adequately described with method or class documentation. The needs of programmers using frameworks are different from the needs when using libraries. Software engineering environments should be augmented with tools to aid programmers in understanding the demands of using frameworks.
