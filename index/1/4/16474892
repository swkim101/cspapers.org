We present novel metrics for parse evaluation in joint segmentation and parsing scenarios where the gold sequence of terminals is not known in advance. The protocol uses distance-based metrics defined for the space of trees over lattices. Our metrics allow us to precisely quantify the performance gap between non-realistic parsing scenarios (assuming gold segmented and tagged input) and realistic ones (not assuming gold segmentation and tags). Our evaluation of segmentation and parsing for Modern Hebrew sheds new light on the performance of the best parsing systems to date in the different scenarios.
