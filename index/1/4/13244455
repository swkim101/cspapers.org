Minimally invasive surgery involves inserting special instruments into the body cavity through tiny incisions in order to perform surgical procedures. In this paper, the design of a robotic master-slave system for use in minimally invasive surgery is discussed. This system is capable of providing haptic feedback to the surgeon in all available degrees of freedom. System design as well as master and slave bilateral control and communication issues are discussed.
