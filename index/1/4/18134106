The goal of a blog retrieval system is to retrieve and rank blogs, as collections of documents, in response to a given query. Previous studies have shown that diversity among the top retrieved posts from a blog is a positive feature for indicating relevance of the blog to the query. However, existing methods capture the diversity of a blog using post-level properties that limits their application to a specific category of retrieval methods. In this paper, we propose a blog-level diversity measure where there is no assumption made about the underlying blog-ranking technique. The proposed measure enables us to integrate diversity in any existing blog retrieval method. Our experimental results show that the proposed method, while being more general, produces comparable results to the post-level diversity detection methods.
