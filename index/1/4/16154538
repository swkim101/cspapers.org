Of all research problems associated with the security of data in a multilevel secure database, perhaps the most dlj?icult and least understood is the problem of controlling indirect inference of sensitive data. The phenomenon of inferring sensih”ve data through the combination of non-sensitive data and realworld knowledge has been tenned deduction We do not agree with the prevailing attitude that all such deduction is unpreventable and believe that our dyamic hrrowledge-based approach to this problem provides a high degree of secun”~ with less restrictive infonnationflow than previously achieved. Our d~amic knowledge-based system is instrumental in the prevention of deduction, given sujlicient knowledge of a domain. As a query is presented to the database, our system attempts to use the knowledge in the KB, combined with the data that would be released l~the query were permitted, to deduce sensitive data as a user moderately knowledgeable in the domain might. If such data is found to be so deducible, the system has detected a possible undesirable channel for sensitive data disclosure. /kqywords: security, inference detection, knowledge-based interface]
