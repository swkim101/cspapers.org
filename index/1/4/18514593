A Computer Science degree is offered by Victoria University bothlocally in Australia and transnationally in Hong Kong. The degreeincludes a compulsory final year Project subject. The Project, ateam effort, involves the design and implementation of a real-lifecomputer application for an external client. Academics responsiblefor the degree consider Project and its three components of groupcontext, project-based problems, and outside focus essential totransforming computing students into competent graduates. DoProject students support this view? This paper reports on acomparative study of the students' perceptions of the projectexperience and the relative importance of its three components. Thepaper discusses the results of the study with respect to thedifferent locales, Melbourne and Hong Kong, and concludes byconsidering the implications of the study on the Project model.
