In this paper, we derive an analytical expression for the ACF of Rice processes in the general case of unsymmetrical Doppler power spectral densities. This expression, which is obtained based on the multidimensional Gaussian distribution approach, is shown to cover the ACF of Rayleigh processes as a special case. Various numerical examples are presented to illustrate the impact of the channel parameters on the ACF. Computer simulations, considering the von Mises distribution for the angle of arrivals, are also performed to check the validity of the analytical result. Finally, the analysis of the covariance spectrum is addressed.
