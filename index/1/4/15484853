Much research in information retrieval (IR) focuses on optimization of the rank of relevant retrieval results for single shot ad hoc IR tasks. Relatively little research has been carried out on user engagement to support more complex search tasks. We seek to improve user engagement for IR tasks by providing richer representation of retrieved information. It is our expectation that this strategy will promote implicit learning within search activities. Specifically, we plan to explore methods of finding semantic concepts within retrieved documents, with the objective of creating improved document surrogates. Further, we would like to study search effectiveness in terms of different facets such as the user's search experience, satisfaction, engagement and learning. We intend to investigate this in an experimental study, where our richer document representations are compared with the traditional document surrogates for the same user queries.
