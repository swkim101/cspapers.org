Increasing efficiency by improving the locomotion methods is a key issue for underwater robots. Hence, an accurate dynamic model is important for both controller design and efficient locomotion methods. This paper presents a model of the kinematics and dynamics of a planar, underwater snake robot aimed at control design. Fluid contact forces and torques are modeled using analytical fluid dynamics. The model is derived in a closed form and can be utilized in modern model-based control schemes. The proposed model is easily implemented and simulated, regardless of the number of robot links. Simulation results with a ten link robotic system are presented.
