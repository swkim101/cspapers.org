Distributional semantic models (DSMs) are often evaluated on artificial similarity datasets containing single words or fully compositional phrases. We present a large-scale multilingual evaluation of DSMs for predicting the degree of semantic compositionality of nominal compounds on 4 datasets for English and French. We build a total of 816 DSMs and perform 2,856 evaluations using word2vec, GloVe, and PPMI-based models. In addition to the DSMs, we compare the impact of different parameters, such as level of corpus preprocessing, context window size and number of dimensions. The results obtained have a high correlation with human judgments, being comparable to or outperforming the state of the art for some datasets (Spearman's œÅ=.82 for the Reddy dataset).
