We demonstrate automatic methods for mapping the visual content in an image to natural spoken or written language. We also introduce a human-in-the-loop evaluation strategy that quantitatively captures the meaningfulness of the generated sentences. We recorded a correctness rate of 60.34% when human users were asked to judge the meaningfulness of the sentences generated from relatively challenging images. Also, our automatic methods compared well with the state-of-the-art techniques for the related computer vision tasks.
