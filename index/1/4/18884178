Attribute-oriented induction is a set-oriented database mining method which generalizes the task-relevant subset of data attribute-by-attribute, compresses it into a generalized relation, and extracts from it the general features of data. In this chapter, the power of attribute-oriented induction is explored for the extraction from relational databases of diierent kinds of patterns, including characteristic rules, discriminant rules, cluster description rules, and multiple-level association rules. Furthermore, it is shown that the method is eecient, robust, with wide applications, and extensible to knowledge discovery in advanced database systems, including object-oriented, deductive, and spatial database systems. The implementation status of DB-Miner, a system prototype which applies the method, is also reported here.
