This paper presents a hybrid architecture for robot control supported on basic concepts from the geometry of Hilbert spaces and nonsmooth calculus. The architecture develops in two classic layers. A supervising layer chooses which motion strategies to apply from a set contained in an execution layer. The paper focuses mainly in the lower execution layer, motivated by the control of semi-autonomous robots. A set of experiments on the control of unicycle robots is presented.
