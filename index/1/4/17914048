We present a generalization of the known fairness and equifairness notions, called @@@@-fairness, in three versions: unconditional, weak and strong. For each such version, we introduce a proof rule for the @@@@-fair termination induced by it, using well-foundedness and countable ordinals. Each such rule is proved to be sound and semantically complete. We suggest directions for further research.
