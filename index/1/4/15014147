This paper presents a design capture system that allows parameterized schematics and code to be intermixed freely to produce annotated net lists. A key feature of the system is its extensibility. It provides a small set of powerful abstractions for design description that can easily be extended by users. The system also allows convenient graphical specification of layout generators, and has been used to produce several large VLSI chips.
