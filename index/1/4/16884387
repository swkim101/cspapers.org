This study developed the Hanyang Exoskeleton Assistive Robot (HEXAR)-CR50 aimed at improving muscle strength of the wearer while transporting a load. The developed exoskeleton robot HEXAR-CR50 has 7 degrees of freedom (DOF) for one foot, 3-DOF for the hip joints, 1-DOF for the knee joints, and 3-DOF for the ankle joints. Through functional analysis of each human joint, two DOFs were composed of active joints using an electric motor developed in an under-actuated form with heightened efficiency. The rest of the DOFs were composed of passive or quasi-passive joints to imitate human joints. The control of the exoskeleton robot was based on the physical human-robot interaction. In order to verify the performance of the developed HEXAR-CR50, muscle activity was measured using electromyography, vGRF was measured using F-Scan sensor. The experimental results showed that %MVIC was reduced against the external load applied, while GRF had a decrement rate, compared with the external load when the exoskeleton was worn, which verified the performance in accordance with the development objective of load carrying. A muscle strength augment effect from the developed wearable robot was verified.
