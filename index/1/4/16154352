In an effort to minimize traffic in the distribution network of a static dataflow machine the design of the system includes alternate data paths so that data movement may take place over “shorter” paths when it is permissible to do so. The main emphasis of this approach is to allow rapid transfer of data in sequential code segments residing in single memory blocks. This decreases crowding in the more expensive distribution network utilized by data that fans out to two or more blocks as required when more concurrent activity is to be initiated during the execution of the program. The objective of data movement minimization has also influenced the design of the instruction set. In this case, composite, that is, “multi-actor” instructions have been proposed as an effective strategy. This has been done without compromizing the utility of the instructions or overly increasing the time and space requirements of their execution. In the paper, these principles are illustrated by defining controlled instructions that are especially useful in the management of loops.
