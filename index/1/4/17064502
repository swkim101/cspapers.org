LCF (Icqic for Caqmtable Functions) is a prcof generating system mnsisting of an interactive programing language MG (MetaLmguage) for mnducting prcofs in PPA (Polynmrphic Predicate A-calculus) , a deductive calculus suitable for the formalisation of reasoning almut recursively defined functions, in particular about the syntax, semantics and iq?lementations of many prqrcmming languages. PPI is an enrichment (in respect of type structure and expressive pcwer) of an extended a-calculus due to Dana Scott and is fully discussed elsewhere [ 22 I . The puxposes of this paper are (a) to illustrate the features of ML which me it of general interest in language design quite independently of its use for machine assistd formal pxcof, (b) to illustrate ML applied to PPA, in encoding interesting prcof -finding-andperfonning procedures, and (c) to convey a methodology for controlled semiautomatic proof.
