We present our ongoing research in the communication of graphs and relational information to blind computer science students. We have developed a system called exPLoring graphs at UMB (PLUMB) that displays a drawn graph on a tablet PC and uses auditory cues to help a blind user navigate the graph. Beyond Computer Science education, this work has applications to assist blind individuals in navigation, map manipulation and other applications that require graph visualization.
