This paper presents a vision system and a depth processing algorithm for DRC-HUBO+, the winner of the DRC finals 2015. Our system is designed to reliably capture 3D information of a scene and objects and to be robust to challenging environment conditions. We also propose a depth-map upsampling method that produces an outliers-free depth map by explicitly handling depth outliers. Our system is suitable for robotic applications in which a robot interacts with the real-world, requiring accurate object detection and pose estimation. We evaluate our depth processing algorithm in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms on several synthetic and real-world datasets.
