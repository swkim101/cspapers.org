This paper describes the scalar processor of the VPP500. The 64-bit long instruction word (LIW) architecture allows the issue of up to three operations every clock cycle. Notable features of the architecture are the PC-relative conditional branch operations, asynchronous operations to allow out-of-order execution, and interruption facility which can handle multiple exceptions. The VPP500 implementation has a three stage pipeline which reduces the hardware cost and branch penalty. The two integer ALUs and the pipelined floating-point units allow up to two integer operations or two floating point operations to be issued per cycle. The wide data path from the cache enables the loading of a pair of either general purpose or floating point registers per cycle.
