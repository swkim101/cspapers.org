In this paper, we present a contribution to IR modeling. We propose an approach that computes on the fly, a Personalized Social Document Representation (PSDR) of each document per user based on his social activities. The PSDRs are used to rank documents with respect to a query. This approach has been intensively evaluated on a large public dataset, showing significant benefits for personalized search.
