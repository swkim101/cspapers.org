Simple Temporal Networks have proved useful in applications that involve metric time. However, many applications involve events whose timing is not controlled by the execution agent. A number of properties relating to overall controllability in such cases have been introduced in [Vidal and Ghallab, 1996] and [Vidal and Fargier, 1997], including Weak and Strong Controllability. We derive some new results concerning these properties. In particular, we prove the negation of Weak Controllability is NP-hard, confirming a conjecture in [Vidal and Fargier, 1997]. We also introduce a more general controllability property of which Weak and Strong Controllability are special cases. A propagation algorithm is provided for determining whether the property holds, and we identify tractable cases where the algorithm runs in polynomial time.
