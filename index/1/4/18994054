The contrast enhancement of medical images has an important role in diseases diagnostic, specially, cancer cases. Histogram equalization is considered as the most popular algorithm for contrast enhancement according to its effectiveness and simplicity. In this paper, we present a modified version of the Histogram Based Fast Enhancement Algorithm. This algorithm enhances the areas of interest with less complexity. It is applied only to CT head images and its idea based on treating with the soft tissues and ignoring other details in the image. The proposed modification make the algorithm is valid for most CT image types with enhanced results.
