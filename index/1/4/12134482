Recent researches on transfer learning exploit deep structures for discriminative feature representation to tackle cross-domain disparity. However, few of them are able to joint feature learning and knowledge transfer in a unified deep framework. In this paper, we develop a novel approach, called Deep Low-Rank Coding (DLRC), for transfer learning. Specifically, discriminative low-rank coding is achieved in the guidance of an iterative supervised structure term for each single layer. In this way, both marginal and conditional distributions between two domains intend to be mitigated. In addition, a marginalized denoising feature transformation is employed to guarantee the learned single-layer low-rank coding to be robust despite of corruptions or noises. Finally, by stacking multiple layers of low-rank codings, we manage to learn robust cross-domain features from coarse to fine. Experimental results on several benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on facilitating the recognition performance for the target domain.
