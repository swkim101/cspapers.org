This paper describes the organizational approaches and usability methodologies considered by HCI professionals to increase the strategic impact of usability research within companies. We collected the data from 134 HCI professionals at three conferences: CHI 98, CHI 99, and the Usability Professionals' Association 1999 conference. The results are the first steps towards a toolkit for the usability community that can help HCI practitioners learn from the experiences of others in similar situations.
