We consider the problem of constructing a spanning tree for a graph G = (V,E) with n vertices whose maximal degree is the smallest among all spanning trees of G. This problem is easily shown to be NP-hard. We describe an iterative polynomial time approximation algorithm for this problem. This algorithm computes a spanning tree whose maximal degree is at most O(Δ + log n), where Δ is the degree of some optimal tree. The result is generalized to the case where only some vertices need to be connected (Steiner case) and to the case of directed graphs. It is then shown that our algorithm can be refined to produce a spanning tree of degree at most Δ + 1. Unless P = NP, this is the best bound achievable in polynomial time.
