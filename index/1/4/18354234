In the recent times there has been a lot of effort to use the various ICT technologies available to monitor and improve the lifestyle of the older generation. In most of the countries across the globe, these elderly people have to stay alone especially during the daytime, when other family members go out for work. Thus, monitoring their presence and activities remotely through audio/video communications is a widespread practice. However, this group of elderly people generally suffers from various types of vision impairments. Hence, mere installation of surveillance audio/video systems only will not solve the problem, as they need to interact with the system and hear/watch the audio/video communications for their well-being. In this work, we carry out a subjective test on a sample population of 59 people belonging to different age groups and record their Mean Opinion Scores (MOS). Thereafter, we run the VQM algorithm over the same set of videos and observe that the scores obtained are somewhat different for the elderly people compared to the rest. Therefore, we propose a video quality prediction model based upon the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that gives a better prediction for our target age group. For this model, we take into consideration the network level Quality of Service (QoS) parameters only as they have a greater impact on the perceived video quality compared to other QoS factors.
