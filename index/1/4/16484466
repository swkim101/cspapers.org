One of the most outstanding features of the SYMBOL computer is its high level hardware compiler. This paper presents some aspects of the hardware implementation including the network characteristics of the communication scheme between compiler, system supervisor, and Memory Controller, the functional breakdown into distinct sections for implementation, the support hardware (registers, tables, etc.,), the Name Table structure, and some of the linking techniques for the structured output of the compiler.
