Most people who are involved with routing printed wiring boards have one or more favorite indicators which they use to predict routing success. Generally these indicators are looked at more as an afterthought, however. If the numbers happen to be available, people might look at them, but seldom is there a deliberate attempt to find and analyze them.
 This paper shows why the process of calculating and checking indicators, called here prerouting analysis, is a profitable task. It further examines what should be measured and shows examples of three analysis programs which have proved quite useful in multilayer board routing, and then gives actual results to substantiate the claim.
