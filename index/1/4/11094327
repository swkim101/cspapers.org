Mobility support is critical to offering seamless data service to mobile devices in 3G/4G cellular networks. To accommodate policy requests by users and carriers, micro-mobility management scheme among cells (i.e., handoff) is designated to be configurable. Each cell and mobile device can configure or even customize its own handoff procedure. In this paper, we examine the handoff misconfiguration issues in 3G/4G networks. We show that they may incur handoff instability in the form of persistent loops, where the device oscillates between cells even without radio-link and location changes. Such instability is mainly triggered by uncoordinated parameter configurations and inconsistent decision logic in the hand- off procedure. It can degrade user data performance, incur excessive signaling overhead, and violate network's expected handoff goals. We derive the instability conditions, and validate them on two major US mobile carrier networks. We further design a soft- ware tool for automatic loop detection, and run it over operational networks. We discuss possible fixes to such uncoordinated configurations among devices and cells.
