XP (eXtreme Programming) has become popular for IID (Iteration and Increment Development). It is suitable for small teams, lightweight projects and vague/volatile requirements. However, some challenges are left to developers when they desire to practise XP. A critical one of them is constructing the release plan and negotiating it with customers. In this paper, we propose a risk-driven method for XP release planning. It has been applied in a case study and the results show the method is feasible and effective. XP practicers can follow it to decide a suitable release plan and control the development process.
