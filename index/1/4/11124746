The Yale School, like many other Schools of Architecture, places an emphasis on the studio approach to teaching design. All other subjects are taught through the traditional course format including computer aided design. The School has emphasized the need for a diverse approach to design and, consequently, has upheld a number of positions that support this. The resource person in computer aided design is also expected to provide teaching in research methods, systems workshop, as well as a design theory course on methodological issues. The students fall into two types. First is the design student who wants to know enough to operate the state of the art work in computing, and second is the research student who wants to spend all of his or her time developing computer aided design systems.
