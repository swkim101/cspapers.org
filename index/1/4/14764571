We report on a four year academic research project to build a natural language processing platform in support of a large media company. The Computable News platform processes news stories, producing a layer of structured data that can be used to build rich applications. We describe the underlying platform and the research tasks that we explored building it. The platform supports a wide range of prototype applications designed to support different newsroom functions. We hope that this qualitative review provides some insight into the challenges involved in this type of project.
