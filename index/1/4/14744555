This paper proposes a novel method for generating an underactuated bipedal gait that completes in one step. First, we introduce an underactuated biped robot model that has a circular torso as a reaction wheel. Second, we consider an input-output linearization to formulate an output-following control law for achieving collisionless limit cycle walking. We then mathematically analyze the stability of the zero dynamics and investigate the fundamental gait properties through numerical simulations. Furthermore, we discuss an extension to generation of a few-steps walking motion aimed at safe and quick passage from a safety island to the next.
