We present Blast, an open source tool for error analysis of machine translation (MT) output. We believe that error analysis, i.e., to identify and classify MT errors, should be an integral part of MT development, since it gives a qualitative view, which is not obtained by standard evaluation methods. Blast can aid MT researchers and users in this process, by providing an easy-to-use graphical user interface. It is designed to be flexible, and can be used with any MT system, language pair, and error typology. The annotation task can be aided by highlighting similarities with a reference translation.
