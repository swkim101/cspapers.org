Information retrieval systems are being challenged to managelarger and larger document collections. In an effort to providebetter retrieval performance on large collections, moresophisticated retrieval techniques have been developed that supportrich, structured queries. Structured queries are not amenable topreviously proposed optimization techniques. Optimizing execution,however, is even more important in the context of large documentcollections. We present a new structured query optimizationtechnique which we have implemented in an inference network-basedinformation retrieval system. Experimental results show that queryevaluation time can be reduced by more than half with little impacton retrieval effectiveness.
