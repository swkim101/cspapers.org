Realtime web search refers to the retrieval of very fresh content which is in high demand. An effective portal web search engine must support a variety of search needs, including realtime web search. However, supporting realtime web search introduces two challenges not encountered in non-realtime web search: quickly crawling relevant content and ranking documents with impoverished link and click information. In this paper, we advocate the use of realtime micro-blogging data for addressing both of these problems. We propose a method to use the micro-blogging data stream to detect fresh URLs. We also use micro-blogging data to compute novel and effective features for ranking fresh URLs. We demonstrate these methods improve effective of the portal web search engine for realtime web search.
