In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient approach, a localized routing tree (LRT) coupled with a route redirection (RR) strategy, to support various types of queries. LRTs take care of the sensors near the sink and reduce the energy consumption of these sensors, and RR reduces the energy cost of data receptions. Compared to the existing approaches, simulation studies show that LRT together with RR has significant improvement on the query capacity.
