We present a quick preview technique that smoothly transitions between document markup code and its visual rendering. This technique allows users to regularly check the code they are editing in-place, without leaving the text editor. This method can complement classical preview windows by offering rapid overviews of code-to-document mappings and leaving more screen real-estate. We discuss the design and implementation of our technique.
