Early work on the application of user interest profiles to aid in the interpretation of queries in an information retrieval system developed the concepts of retrieval subspaces that are either ellipsoids or Cassini ovals. This report extends the theoretical basis of these models, exploring other models and the effect of different metrics on the conceptual retrieval subspace.
