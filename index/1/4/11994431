In this paper, we present a study of user perceptions on mobile interaction with visual and RFID tags. Although mobile interaction with tags has been proposed in several earlier studies, user perceptions and usability comparisons of different tag technologies have not been intensively investigated. In contrast to earlier studies, which report on user studies with evaluating new concepts or interaction techniques, we take another approach and examine the current understanding of the techniques and user perceptions on them. Our field study of 50 users charts currently existing user perceptions and reveals potential usability risks that are due to the limited or erroneous understanding of the interaction technique.
