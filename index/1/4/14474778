Address-event representation (AER), originally proposed as a means to communicate sparse neural events between neuromorphic chips, has proven efficient in implementing large-scale networks with arbitrary, configurable synaptic connectivity. In this work, we further extend the functionality of AER to implement arbitrary, configurable synaptic plasticity in the address domain. As proof of concept, we implement a biologically inspired form of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) based on relative timing of events in an AER framework. Experimental results from an analog VLSI integrate-and-fire network demonstrate address domain learning in a task that requires neurons to group correlated inputs.
