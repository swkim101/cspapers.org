Domain-Specific Modelling (DSM) has evidently increased the productivity and the quality of software development. The witnessed gains are primarily caused by the three corner stones of DSM, i.e. Domain-Specific Modelling Languages (DSML), code generators and software frameworks. Although the DSMLs and the code generators are the primary reason for the gains, little attention have been paid in making sure that these work correctly. In this paper, we present a work in progress on the technique of utilizing the Model-Based-Testing (MBT) as a means for testing the elements of the DSM basic architecture. We will discuss how the MBT can be utilized for generating a comprehensive test suite of application models, in addition to how the generated applications can be tested with the MBT. As a combination, the DSM basic architecture will be tested thoroughly. We also present how the introduced technique can be realized by utilizing the tools currently available for the DSM and the MBT.
