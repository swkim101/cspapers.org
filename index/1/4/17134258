Simulation in robotics is often based on physics engines developed for computer games and animation. These engines are inaccurate due to the applied first order numerical integration and because their ways to resolve redundant contacts lead to contact forces that are distributed in a physically unreasonable way among multiple contacts. In this paper, we present a new physics engine that resolves these flaws by designing and implementing a second order integration method, and by a new way of defining the contact-force resolution problem. We illustrate the improvement over state-of-the-art engines by a number of experiments. The new engine is proven to be particularly suitable for simulating tight fitting assembly operations where multiple contacts occur between the objects involved.
