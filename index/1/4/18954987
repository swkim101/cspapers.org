In 1994 Wells Fargo Bank was the first large financial services company to invest heavily in distributed object-oriented applications for high-volume, mission-critical applications using version 1 of OMG's Common Object Request Broker Architecture. Wells Fargo continued to improve upon its distributed applications technology leadership by launching a Model Driven Architecture [MDA] initiative in 1999. The technology provided a consistent middle-tier for retail applications such as the award-winning Wells Internet Bank and various phone-bank applications.
 Between 2001 and 2003 the original CORBA-based solution was completely replaced with new Web-Services-based distributed applications. This report contrasts the past and the present approach to such applications and discusses the lessons learned while transitioning from CORBA-based "Service Oriented Architecture" to one based on Web-Services.
 The final section of this report utilizes lessons learned from using CORBA & Web-Services for Intranet applications and proposes the "application transparent distribution" as a potential paradigm shift which may lead to radically faster and more efficient distributed application development.
