Vision has often been considered as not suitable for dynamic control of robots. The experimental results presented in this paper show that it is possible to perform better with a vision based dynamic control than with a model-based control. These results were obtained using a Cartesian computed torque control fed back, without any joint sensing, by a novel Cartesian pose and velocity estimator. The latter is designed as a virtual visual servoing scheme based on sequential acquisition of sub-images and a constant acceleration motion assumption.
