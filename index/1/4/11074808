Patterns of activity over real neural structures are known to exhibit time-dependent behavior. It would seem that the brain may be capable of utilizing temporal behavior of activity in neural networks as a way of performing functions which cannot otherwise be easily implemented. These might include the origination of sequential behavior and the recognition of time-dependent stimuli. A model is presented here which uses neuronal populations with recurrent feedback connections in an attempt to observe and describe the resulting time-dependent behavior. Shortcomings and problems inherent to this model are discussed. Current models by other researchers are reviewed and their similarities and differences discussed.
