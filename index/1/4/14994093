This paper contributes to the understanding of the fundamental properties of rectilinearly locomotion of an one-dimensional system travelling on the horizontal plane, where dry Coulomb friction acting between it and surface. We discuss an approximate steady-state motion on a simplified two-segment system, which is propelled by a periodic internal excitation. First, the analysis is presented of the sufficient and necessary conditions for the system to move from the state of rest. Then, the explicit equations to calculate the constant average velocity of the steady-state are found. In addition, the influences of different parameters on the average velocity of the steady-state motion are discussed. Finally, the obtained theoretical results are verified by the numerical simulations.
