This study empirically investigates the sensitivity of bagging predictors with respect to 12 algorithms and 9 levels of class distribution on 14 imbalanced data-sets by using statistical and graphical methods to address the important issue of understanding the effect of vary- ing levels of class distribution on bagging predictors. The experimental results demonstrate that bagging NB and MLP are insensitive to various levels of imbalanced class distribution.
