We present PiVOT, a tabletop system aimed at supporting mixed-focus collaborative tasks. Through two view-zones, PiVOT provides personalized views to individual users while presenting an unaffected and unobstructed shared view to all users. The system supports multiple personalized views which can be present at the same spatial location and yet be only visible to the users it belongs to. The system also allows the creation of personal views that can be either 2D or (auto-stereoscopic) 3D images. We first discuss the motivation and the different implementation principles required for realizing such a system, before exploring different designs able to address the seemingly opposing challenges of shared and personalized views. We then implement and evaluate a sample prototype to validate our design ideas and present a set of sample applications to demonstrate the utility of the system.
