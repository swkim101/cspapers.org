We use an event-driven process model to specify a version of the High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) protocol between two communicating protocol entities. The HDLC protocol is based upon the Asynchronous Response Mode (ARM) of operation, and uses the basic repertoire of HDLC commands and responses (with the exception of the CMDR response). It includes the features of poll/final cycles for connection management and checkpointing, sliding windows for data transfer, and ready/not ready messages for flow control. HDLC has three distinguishable functions: connection management, and one-way data transfers in opposite directions between the protocol entities. Various logical safety properties of the HDLC protocol concerning these functions have been verified using the method of projections.
