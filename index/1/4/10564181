Recent years have seen the emergence of applications and concepts that rely on the involvement of the general public (the "crowd") and, consequently, create big data (e.g., MOOCs, search engines, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, citizen/crowd science, and more). Education in particular is changing dramatically with the use of online resources and courses that generate large streams of data. In this special session, we ask: What research questions in computer science education can be explored using big data? And how can computer science education researchers apply big data analysis to support education in other disciplines? To answer these and related questions, we focus in this special interactive session on how computer science education research can be promoted by integrating big data into the research process.
