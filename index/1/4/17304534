To obtain classification systems with both good generalization performance and efficiency in space and time, we propose a learning method based on combinations of weak classifiers, where weak classifiers are linear classifiers (perceptrons) which can do a little better than making random guesses. A randomized algorithm is proposed to find the weak classifiers. They are then combined through a majority vote. As demonstrated through systematic experiments, the method developed is able to obtain combinations of weak classifiers with good generalization performance and a fast training time on a variety of test problems and real applications.
