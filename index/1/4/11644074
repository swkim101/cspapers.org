We describe our submission to the domain adaptation track of the CoNLL07 shared task in the open class for systems using external resources. Our main finding was that it was very difficult to map from the annotation scheme used to prepare training and development data to one that could be used to effectively train and adapt the RASP system unlexicalized parse ranking model. Nevertheless, we were able to demonstrate a significant improvement in performance utilizing bootstrapping over the PBIOTB data.
