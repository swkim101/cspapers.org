This paper aims to propose a paradigm of constructing the system which is capable of controlling the locomotion direction of Lateral Undulation gait of snake-like robots. Firstly, we explain the function of each essential component of such system as well as their means of implementation. Secondly, we deliver a control scheme which unifies all these components to make a single complete system that helps reduce many degrees of freedom of snake-like robots to just one in the context of direction control. Finally, some simulations are conducted to verify the ability of such system. A part of which is also tested with a real robot.
