In this talk, I'll describe some recent indicators suggesting that businesses are on the cusp of operational exploitation of the web as a decision support resource. From consumer research and purchasing behavior to enterprise brand tracking, intelligence gathering, and advertising, the web is suddenly on everybody's mind - not as an exciting future possibility, but as an exploitable resource. I'll describe some technological approaches to employing this resource, talk about what's possible today, and describe some challenges for the future. As a running example, I'll cover IBM's WebFountain system: its architecture, analytical model, and applications.
