In this paper, we aim at finding out which users are likely to publicly demonstrate frustration towards their jobs on the microblogging platform Twitter - we will call these users haters. We show that the profiles of haters have specific characteristics in terms of vocabulary and connections. The implications of these findings may be used for the development of an early alert system that can help users to think twice before they post potentially self-harming content.
