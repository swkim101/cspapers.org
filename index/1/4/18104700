A visually guided shock absorber for high-speed catching without rebound is designed and realized. This visual shock absorber is based on the Maxwell model, which uses plastic deformation to suppress rebounding. The shock absorber is constructed from a spring-based passive elastic body and a servo control-based software damper connected in series. The visual shock absorber is realized in a robot with two degrees of freedom and high-speed vision. The robot receives the impact of a rolling object without repelling it.
