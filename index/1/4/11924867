This paper describes a programming tool for real-time embedded systems. Real-time embedded systems are usually implemented by multiple tasks. It is important to allocate tasks to the system appropriately. Our tool, called TRUE, performs the allocation of tasks by transformation of the program the user has written. TRUE reads the program and the requirements about its response time. TRUE transforms the program applying rules based on the requirements. Then the program is translated into a code for operating system I-TRON. I-TRON is our original real-time operating system for 32-bit microprocessors. This paper also describes the implementation of TRUE and an example of its use.
