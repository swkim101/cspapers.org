Integrating full character-level dependencies with character embedding and human annotated character-level part-of-speech and dependency labels for the first time, we show an extra performance enhancement from the evaluation on Chinese Penn Treebank and SJTU (Shanghai Jiao Tong University) Chinese Character Dependency Treebank and the potential of better understanding deeper structure of Chinese sentences.
