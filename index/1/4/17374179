With the rapid growth of the mobile industry, a considerable amount of mobile applications and services are available. Meanwhile, pirates and illegal distributions of digital contents have become serious issues. Digital Rights Management (DRM) aims at protecting digital contents from being abused through regulating the usage of digital contents. In this paper, a cloud based SIM DRM scheme, called CS-DRM, is proposed for the mobile Internet. Also, a prototype of our DRM scheme is implemented to demonstrate the correctness, effectiveness and efficiency of CS-DRM.
