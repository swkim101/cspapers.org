In this paper, we study the problem of segmenting graph sequences with labeled nodes. Memes on the Twitter network, diseases over a contact network, movie-cascades over a social network, etc. are all graph sequences with labeled nodes. Most related work is on plain graphs (and hence ignore the label dynamics) or fix parameters or require much feature engineering. Instead, we propose SnapNETS, to automatically find segmentations of such graph sequences, with different characteristics of nodes of each label in adjacent segments. It satisfies all the desired properties (being parameter-free, comprehensive and scalable) by leveraging a principled, multi-level, flexible framework which maps the problem to a path optimization problem over a weighted DAG. Extensive experiments on several diverse real datasets show that it finds cut points matching ground-truth or meaningful external signals outperforming non-trivial baselines. We also show that SnapNETS scales near-linearly with the size of the input.
