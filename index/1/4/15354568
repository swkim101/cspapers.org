Solid State Drive (SSD), emerging as new data storage media with high random read speed, has been widely used in laptops, desktops, and data servers to replace hard disk during the past few years. However, poor random write performance becomes the bottle neck in practice. In this paper, we propose to insert unmodified data into random write sequence in order to convert random writes into sequential writes, and thus data sequence can be flushed at the speed of sequential write. Further, we propose a clustering strategy to improve the performance by reducing quantity of unmodified data to read. After exploring the intrinsic parallelism of SSD, we also propose to flush write sequences with the help of the simultaneous program between planes and parallel program between devices for the first time. Comprehensive experiments show that our method outperform the existing random-write solution up to one order of magnitude improvement.
