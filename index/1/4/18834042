We introduce P2P Wikipedia, a prototype of a personalized tag-based navigation system for Wikipedia multimedia content. It is the first peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system able to deal with large files like movies, music, and software, but that is also scalable to HTML content. The combined techniques in our prototype are the automated calculation of tags from HTML content, a personalized P2P file sharing system built on a social network, the use of incentives for user cooperation to optimize system performance, and the design of a user interface with advanced navigational features.
