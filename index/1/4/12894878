Various interfaces exist for annotations. Little is known, however, about how such interface variations affect communication. We designed an annotation interface intended to facilitate annotation and undertook a study to compare this interface to two commonly used alternatives. Results support the hypothesis that annotation interfaces affect the number and types of problems about which collaborators communicate. Results also suggest the need for more research on interface effects within other communicative contexts.
