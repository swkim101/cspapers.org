ABSTRACr The design and analysis of a distributed multiple-response resolver for value-ordered retrieval is presented. It is similar to the design proposed by Ramamoorthy et. at., the fastest scheme to date in its class, but has a number of improvements over it. We present the detailed algorithm and the logic design of our scheme. Its performance is evaluated by simulation. Approximate analytical results are given as well. We also compare our design with previous designs to illustrate its superiority. The most important feature of our design is to terminate the selection process as soon as the responder set contains only one responder or the largest responder includes all the other responders in the active responder set, and to retain the history of the selection process so that succeeding retrievals do not have to start from the first bit slice.
