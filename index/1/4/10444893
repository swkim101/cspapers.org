A control law is proposed that achieves predefined performance indices regarding the speed of response, the steady state and the allowed overshoot of the robot force/position tracking errors, ensuring no loss of contact of the robot end effector. The controller incorporates a transformed error, which includes the performance indices. The control objective is satisfied under parametric uncertainties in the robot dynamics and the elasticity model constant. Simulation results confirm the theoretical findings and compare the proposed controller with a conventional one.
