This paper presents a novel framework for visual object recognition using infinite-dimensional covariance operators of input features, in the paradigm of kernel methods on infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. Our formulation provides a rich representation of image features by exploiting their non-linear correlations, using the power of kernel methods and Riemannian geometry. Theoretically, we provide an approximate formulation for the Log-Hilbert-Schmidt distance between covariance operators that is efficient to compute and scalable to large datasets. Empirically, we apply our framework to the task of image classification on eight different, challenging datasets. In almost all cases, the results obtained outperform other state of the art methods, demonstrating the competitiveness and potential of our framework.
