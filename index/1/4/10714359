How to design a robotic hand for reproducing the move characteristics of human hand joints is a big challenge in robotics. In this paper, we present an approach to determine the actuation configuration based on the statistical results of hand joint angle in different grasps. A relationship between the basic statistical metrics and actuation configuration strategies is built. In this case, a novel actuation configuration is proposed and the joints of four fingers are arranged into five actuation modules. For the mechanical implementation, the motion of human four finger joints is decomposed to proportion motion, differential motion and chain proportion motion, mechanically implemented by pulley, planetary gear differential module and gear transmission chain. Finally, the implemented mechanism is embedded in palm, and the mechanical implementation to the human hand move characteristics is verified by the measured joint angles of the robotic hand when actuators separately move along PC1 and PC2. Meanwhile, the robotic hand can grasp different objects with a versatile grasp function.
