In this paper we outline Design Space Exploration methodology aimed at homogeneous multi-core architectures, where the safety-criticality is the crux of a system design. Multi-core architectures provide better computational abilities, but at the same time complicate the computation of timing bounds. Determining suitable architectures that achieve timing requirements is an important aspect for a system designer. The proposed work conceptualizes ways to automate and explore different design facets of a multi-core processor. The intention is to ensure that the particular application meets its deadlines, while optimizing other objectives such as minimizing hardware costs, energy consumption and floor area. The automated exploration builds upon Mulitcore Response Time Analysis for timing verification and multicube for heuristic search methods. The aim is to generate an architecture design in the end that can be used directly to build a custom application specific processor.
