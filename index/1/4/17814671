We propose a new egomotion estimation algorithm for a compound omnidirectional camera. Image features are detected by a conventional feature detector and then quickly classified into near and far features by checking infinity on the omnidirectional image of the compound omnidirectional sensor. Egomotion estimation is performed in two steps: first, rotation is recovered using far features; then translation is estimated from near features using the estimated rotation. RANSAC is used for estimations of both rotation and translation. Experiments in various environments show that our approach is robust and provides good accuracy in real-time for large motions.
