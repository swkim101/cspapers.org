In this paper we formulate new mapping strategies for partial differential equations (PDE) computations into MIMD architectures. These mappings are based on decompositions of the geometric data (meshes) associated with the PDE domain, and distribute the solution of large linear systems across many parallel processors in such a way that the processor workload is balanced and the synchronization / communication cost among them is a minimal. For the allocation of computations associated with each subdomain to individual processors, we use an intermediate 2-D Euclidean space to represent the decomposition graph of the computation and the topology of the architecture. Then correlation between subdomains and processors is pursued according to a number of performance criteria and iterative improvement techniques. ated with the PDE domain, the discrete algebraic equations associated with some discretization of the PDE equations, and the data flow graph of the PDE solver. In this paper we study mapping techniques formulated at the geometric data structures of the PDE problem. Mapping approaches formulated on other levels have been studied in [Fox 86], [Sada 87], [Pomm 90], [Ayka 88] and [Hous 87, 90 b]. The mapping met hodology employed in this paper consists of two phases: the partitioning and allocation. In the partitioning phase we decompose the geometric data structures (meshes) to a prespecified number (usually equal to the number of processors) of sub domains or substructures such that the following criteria are approximately satisfied: (i) the subdomains have approximately the same number of elements (finite element meshes) or grid points (grids),
