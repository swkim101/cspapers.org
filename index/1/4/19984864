With the increasing demand for personalized applications, user interests' mining is gaining more and more importance. Various sources of information have been used for extracting and modeling parameters that portray users' interests. Social media has become one of the most popular and significant platform for information sharing and dissemination. These social platforms provide users not only a medium to share the content of their interest but also provide an insight of their day to day activities. Mining this content to define user interests can be used for the customization and personalization of a variety of commercial and non-commercial applications like product marketing and recommendation. In this paper, we propose a user interest's model using a popular social community called twitter. Proposed user model represents interests in the form of ontological concepts interlinked with predefined source ontology by using concepts from Wikipedia and Wordnet.
