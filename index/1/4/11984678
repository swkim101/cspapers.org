New methods for retrieving records from a database with links are given so that records are retrieved only once and not multiple times as happens when using the traditional method of retrieval Improvements as great as 50 percent are expected for queries over databases containing only many-to-one relationships and much greater improvements are expected when many-to-many relationships are embedded in the database Furthermore, it is shown how to combine relational and network retrieval methods Relations, containing many tuples, are created during the evaluation of a network query Each relation is either joined with other relations or is used to continue the evaluation of the network query The methods given show how to optimize data retrieval from a relational database that is implemented using links, where each link represents a many-to-one relationship
