This paper presents a deterministic O (nm log n + n2log2n) = Õ (nm) time algorithm for splitting off all edges incident to a vertex s of even degree in a multigraph G, where n and m are the numbers of vertices and links (= vertex pairs between which G has an edge) in G, respectively. Based on this, many graph algorithms using edge-splitting can run faster. For example, the edge-connectivity augmentation problem in an undirected multigraph can be solved in Õ (nm) time, which is an improvement over the previously known randomized Õ (n3) bound and deterministic Õ (n2m) bound.
