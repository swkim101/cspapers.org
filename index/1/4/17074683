We present an online algorithm that continually optimizes recommendation relevance based on behavior of past users. Our method trades weaker theoretical guarantees in asymptotic performance than the state-of-the-art for stronger theoretical guarantees in the online setting. We test our algorithm on real-world data collected from previous recommender systems and show that our algorithm learns faster than existing methods and performs equally well in the long-run.
