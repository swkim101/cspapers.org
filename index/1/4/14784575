We study the problem of discovering a manifold that best preserves information relevant to a nonlinear regression. Solving this problem involves extending and uniting two threads of research. On the one hand, the literature on sufficient dimension reduction has focused on methods for finding the best linear subspace for nonlinear regression; we extend this to manifolds. On the other hand, the literature on manifold learning has focused on unsupervised dimensionality reduction; we extend this to the supervised setting. Our approach to solving the problem involves combining the machinery of kernel dimension reduction with Laplacian eigenmaps. Specifically, we optimize cross-covariance operators in kernel feature spaces that are induced by the normalized graph Laplacian. The result is a highly flexible method in which no strong assumptions are made on the regression function or on the distribution of the covariates. We illustrate our methodology on the analysis of global temperature data and image manifolds.
