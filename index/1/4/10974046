Information retrieval of ASCLI documents generally refers to retrieval based on linear patterns found in the source documents. We have developed a method for recognizing and extracting tabular data, inthis case financial tables. Tables are extracted using a version of the LR(k) parsing algorithm adapted for this purpose. Because of sloppiness in the construction of tables, somewhat less than 100% of the tables can be retrieved automatically; a method has been found to integrate the parsing algorithm into amodule analogous to a programming language debugger that allows operators to quickly correct defects in the source document. This paper describes an application in commercial use.
