This paper discusses variable selection for the efficient dynamic control of the Quattro parallel robot through an inverse dynamic model expressed by means of leg orientations. A selection is made within a group of variables where each can imply the state of the robot. Besides, in this work, steering a parallel robot dynamically using its self-projection onto the image plane (where the edges of the lower-legs are exploited in control) is proposed and validated for the first time. In the light of the realistic control simulation, the formative points of better control of the Quattro robot are figured out.
