In our previous work, we implemented a TDMA tree based protocol on the Magnetic Induction Radio IC. The protocol was designed for Body Area Networks (BANs). The result was a protocol that worked for that specific situation, but could not be extended to other applications. The protocol needed some mechanism that would provide extra flexibility to the network. In this work, we add QoS to the protocol, which results in the protocol that can be used in several kinds of applications. The resulting protocol has the capability to be configured at runtime for the kind of sensors that are being used, in order to optimize the throughput and efficiency.
