This project concerns building a document parser that can be used as a software engineering tool. A software tester's task frequently involves comparing the behavior of a running system with a document describing the behavior of the system. If a problem is found, it may indicate an update is required to the document, the software system, or both. A tool to generate tests automatically based on documents would be very useful to software engineers, but it requires a document parser which can identify and extract testable conditions in the text.
