The power-consumption of network equipment is under ever-increasing scrutiny. As part of an ensemble project seeking to reduce power-consumption within data-centers1, this work focuses on reducing the power consumption of photonic transceivers for future fast power gated and/or optical switching networks. Utilising an open-source toolkit, we show that Serializer/Deserializer (SERDES) dominates power consumption of traditional optical transceivers. This result has particular implications for the modulation format of future interconnects. At 25 Gb/s line rate, SERDES blocks of PAM-16 and 4-wavelength WDM are shown to have 53% and 79% lower power respectively compared with SERDES of serial NRZ as well as reduced power gating restoration time and energy.
