In this paper, an approach for sound source localisation and calibration of an asynchronous microphone array is proposed to be solved simultaneously. A graph-based Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) method is used for this purpose. Traditional sound source localisation using a microphone array has two main requirements. Firstly, geometrical information of microphone array is needed. Secondly, a multichannel analog-to-digital converter is required to obtain synchronous readings of the audio signal. Recent works aim at releasing these two requirements by estimating the time offset between each pair of microphones. However, it was assumed that the clock timing in each microphone sound card is exactly the same, which requires the clocks in the sound cards to be identically manufactured. A methodology is hereby proposed to calibrate an asynchronous microphone array using a graph-based optimisation method borrowed from the SLAM literature, effectively estimating the array geometry, time offset and clock difference/drift rate of each microphone together with the sound source locations. Simulation and experimental results are presented, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in achieving accurate estimates of the microphone array characteristics needed to be used on realistic settings with asynchronous sound devices.
