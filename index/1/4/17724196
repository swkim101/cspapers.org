Existing computer science laboratories are generally based upon the laboratory model which is used in the physical sciences. In this paper, we introduce a laboratory model for computer science which is based upon the engineering design laboratory. Our laboratory model features a strong laboratory component and couples lectures, homework and programming projects with thk laboratory component to form a unified course framework.
