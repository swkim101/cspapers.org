CC-TEGAS3 is a time domain digital logic simulation and test generation system. Presently there are six primary modes of simulation with other modes in development. Modes one through three are for true value simulation only and are used for logic verification and design verification. Modes four through six correspond to modes one through three, respectively, but are for fault simulation. These later modes allow a user to simulate faults at either the logic verification level, (using assignable nominal element propagation delays), or at the design verification level using assignable minimum-maximum delay times. Mode six represents one of the most accurate fault simulators yet to be implemented.
 The description, analysis, design considerations, implementation techniques, and data structures used in the fault simulation modes of the CC-TEGAS3 system are the subject of this paper.
