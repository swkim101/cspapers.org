It is expected that future on-chip networks for many-core processors will impose huge overheads in terms of energy, delay, complexity, verification effort, and area. There is a common belief that the bandwidth necessary for future applications can only be provided by employing packet-switched networks with complex routers and a scalable directory-based coherence protocol. We posit that such a scheme might likely be overkill in a well designed system in addition to being expensive in terms of power because of a large number of power-hungry routers. We show that bus-based networks with snooping protocols can significantly lower energy consumption and simplify network/protocol design and verification, with no loss in performance. We achieve these characteristics by dividing the chip into multiple segments, each having its own broadcast bus, with these buses further connected by a central bus. This helps eliminate expensive routers, but suffers from the energy overhead of long wires. We propose the use of multiple Bloom filters to effectively track data presence in the cache and restrict bus broadcasts to a subset of segments, significantly reducing energy consumption. We further show that the use of OS page coloring helps maximize locality and improves the effectiveness of the Bloom filters. We also employ low-swing wiring to further reduce the energy overheads of the links. Performance can also be improved at relatively low costs by utilizing more of the abundant metal budgets on-chip and employing multiple address-interleaved buses rather than multiple routers. Thus, with the combination of all the above innovations, we extend the scalability of buses and believe that buses can be a viable and attractive option for future on-chip networks. We show energy reductions of up to 31X on average compared to many state-of-the-art packet switched networks.
