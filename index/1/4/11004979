Robot plan generation is a field which engendered the development of AI languages and rule-based expert systems. Utilization of these latter concepts permits a flexible formalism for robot planning research. We present a robot plan-generation architecture and its application to a real-world mobile robot system. The system undergoes tests through its utilization in the IIILARE robot project (Ciralt, et al., 1984). Though the article concentrates on planning, execution monitoring and error recovery are discussed. The system includes models of its synergistic environment as well SR of its sensors and effectors (i.e. operators). Its rules embody both planning specific and domair specific knowledge. The system gains generality and adaptiveness through the use of planning variables which provide constraints to the plan generation system. It is implemented in an efficient compiled Production System language (PSL).
