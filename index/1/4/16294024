We identify the three principle factors affecting the performance of learning by networks with localized units: unit noise, sample density, and the structure of the target function. We then analyze the effect of unit receptive field parameters on these factors and use this analysis to propose a new learning algorithm which dynamically alters receptive field properties during learning.
