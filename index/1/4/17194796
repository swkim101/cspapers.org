We present a platform for Web services. Web services are implemented in a special XML programming language called XL [1, 2]. A Web service receives an XML message as input and returns an XML message as output. The platform supports a number of features that are particularly useful to implement Web services; e.g., logging, timetables, conversations, workflow management, automatic transactions, security. Our platform is going to be compliant with all W3C standards and emerging proposals. The programming language is very abstract and can be optimized automatically (like SQL). Furthermore, the platform allows to integrate Web services that are written in XL and other programming languages.
