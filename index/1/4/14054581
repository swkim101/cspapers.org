We present an 8-dimensional (8D) display that allows glasses-free viewing of 3D imagery, whist capturing and reacting to incident environmental and user controlled light sources. We demonstrate two interactive possibilities enabled by our lens-array-based hardware prototype, and realtime GPU-accelerated software pipeline. Additionally, we describe a path to deploying such displays in the future, using current Sensor-in-Pixel (SIP) LCD panels, which physically collocate sensing and display elements.
