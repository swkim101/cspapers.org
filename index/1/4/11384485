This paper introduces a class of reconfigurable parallel robots consisting of a fixed base and a moving platform connected by serial chains having RRPÌ²S (Revolute-Revolute-Prismatic-Spherical) topology. Only the prismatic joint is actuated and the first revolute joint in the chain can be locked or released online. The introduction of these lockable joints allow the prismatic actuators to maneuver to approximate 6-DoF motions for the moving platform. An algorithm for generating these maneuvers is first described. Then, a motion planner, based on the generation of a Probabilistic RoadMap (PRM) whose nodes are connected using the described maneuvers, is presented. The generated trajectories avoid singularities and possible collisions between legs. (See accompanying video)
