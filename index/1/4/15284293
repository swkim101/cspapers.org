This paper proposes a method for detecting the camera motion between two successive images to compensate background motion. The camera motion is restricted with regard to panning, tilting, and zooming. For small panning and tilting angles and small values of zooming difference, we assume that the apparent background motion occurring between two consecutive images can be approximated. We perform this using a scaling transformation followed by a translation. The vertical and horizontal histograms of two successive images are created and then matched using Hough transformations. The transformation parameters are determined when the vertical and horizontal histograms are matched. A multi-resolution Hough transformation is employed to reduce processing time.
