This paper outlines the application of a generalpurpose software package, a tool for distributed backtrack programming (TDBP), that supports a wide range of applications such as recursive backtrack, branch-andbound, and alpha-beta pruning to be implemented on a parallel computer. This software is an ideal support environment for laboratory experiments of students who are following a course in parallel and distributed algorithms, where adopting a parallel programming language either is not possible or it is not feasible. To use the TDBP the application program needs to specify only the root of the recursion tree, the computation to be performed at each node, and how to generate children at each node. In addition, the application program may optionally specify how to synthesize values of tree nodes from their children’s vahtes and how to disseminate information (such as Imttnds) either globally or locally in the tree. Many applications have been implemented quite easily, including exhaustive traversal (N queens, knight’s tour, negamax tree evaluation), branch-andbound (traveling salesman) and alpha-beta search (the game of NIM). Speedup is excellent for exhaustive traversal and quite good for branch and bound.
