The Smalltalk Model-View-Controller (MVC) user interface paradigm uses polling for its input control. The polling loops consume CPU cycles even when the user is not interacting with the interface. Applications using Smalltalk as their front-end often suffer unnecessary performance loss. This paper presents a prototype event-driven MVC framework to solve these problems. A solution to the compatibility problem is also provided to allow interface objects built under both polling and event-driven mechanisms to be used by each other with no modification and no performance penalty.
