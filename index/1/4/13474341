A number of methods have been proposed for selecting and evaluating commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) component-based systems. Few methods, however, focus on post-implementation evaluation of these systems in the context of use. This paper reports on the use of one such method that employs scenarios as the central unit of analysis. The method is inspired by immersive, ethnographic techniques and informed by work in scenario-based design. In this paper, we describe the development of the method and its application for evaluating a complex, COTS-based system for product lifecycle management (PLM).
