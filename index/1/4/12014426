This session is a progress report from the first committee created under the SIGCSE Committee Initiative. The Committee on Implementation of a Discrete Mathematics Course is charged with developing implementation models and materials for the one-semester discrete math course proposed in Computing Curriculum 2001. At the time of the session, the Committee will have completed about three-fourths of its task. In this session the committee will present a number of course models which, for each, will include a syllabus/course outline and a list of possible applications which connect the mathematics to fundamental ideas in computer science. Comments and additional input from the SIGCSE community will be solicited. Presentation will by Bill Marion, one of the two committee co-facilitators and two other committee members.
