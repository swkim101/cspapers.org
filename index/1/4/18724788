Allgather is an important MPI collective communication. Most of the algorithms for allgather have been designed for homogeneous and tightly coupled systems. The existing algorithms for allgather on Gridsystems do not efficiently utilize the bandwidths available on slow wide-area links of the grid. In this paper, we present an algorithm for allgather on grids that efficiently utilizes wide-area bandwidths and is also wide-area optimal. Our algorithm is also adaptive to gridload dynamics since it considers transient network characteristics for dividing the nodes into clusters. Our experiments on a real-grid setup consisting of 3 sites show that our algorithm gives an average performance improvement of 52% over existing strategies.
