This paper describes the navigation of a mobile robot in unknown static environments using an omnidirectional stereo and a laser range finder. The robot detects obstacles by the sensors, estimates the ego-motion, integrates the sensor data to generate a probabilistic occupancy map, and plans a safe motion. This paper focuses on the ego-motion estimation and the data integration for map generation. We extend our previous methods to increase the robustness of navigation. Experimental results show the feasibility of our navigation method.
