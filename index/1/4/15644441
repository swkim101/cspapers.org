In this paper, we propose a non-invasive and nonrestrictive human vital-signs sensory system using an electrically-conductive fiber. To maintain health, it is important to monitor our physical condition daily. Even during sleep, a person's condition is not constant and sometimes it can change suddenly. Therefore, we are developing a human vital-signs sensory system for monitoring purposes. Our proposed system consists of a sensing part, data collection part and signal processing part. The sensing part is composed of electrically-conductive fibers incorporated in a conventional bed sheet. Since the sensors are arranged in a grid structure, we can detect the pressure distribution on the sheet. We utilize this sheet to acquire human vital signs such as respiration and heart rate continuously. With a preliminary prototype, we show the basic properties of the proposed sensory system.
