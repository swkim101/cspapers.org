As organizations become distributed across multiple sites, they are looking to technology to help support enterprise-wide communication and training to distant locations. We developed an application called Forum that broadcasts live video, audio, and slides from a speaker to distributed audiences at their computer desktops. We studied how distributed presentations over Forum differed from talks given in face-to-face settings. We found that Forum attracted larger audiences, but the quality of interaction was perceived to be lower. Forum appeared to provide more flexible and effective use of slides and other visual materials. On the whole, audiences preferred to watch talks over Forum but speakers preferred to give talks in a local setting. The study raises issues about how to design this technology and how to help people discover effective ways of using it.
