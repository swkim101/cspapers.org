This paper investigates the use of neural networks for the acquisition of selectional preferences. Inspired by recent advances of neural network models for nlp applications, we propose a neural network model that learns to discriminate between felicitous and infelicitous arguments for a particular predicate. The model is entirely unsupervised ‐ preferences are learned from unannotated corpus data. We propose two neural network architectures: one that handles standard two-way selectional preferences and one that is able to deal with multi-way selectional preferences. The model’s performance is evaluated on a pseudo-disambiguation task, on which it is shown to achieve state of the art performance.
