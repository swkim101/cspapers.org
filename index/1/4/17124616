As technology scaling drives the number of processor cores upward, current on-chip routers consume substantial portions of chip area and power budgets. Since existing research has greatly reduced router latency overheads and capitalized on available on-chip bandwidth, power constraints dominate interconnection network design. Recently research has proposed bufferless routers as a means to alleviate these constraints, but to date all designs exhibit poor operational frequency, throughput, or latency. In this paper, we propose an efficient bufferless router which lowers average packet latency by 17.6% and dynamic energy by 18.3% over existing bufferless on-chip network designs. In order to maintain the energy and area benefit of bufferless routers while delivering ultra-low latencies, our router utilizes an opportunistic processor-side buffering technique and an energy-efficient circuit-switched network for delivering negative acknowledgments for dropped packets.
