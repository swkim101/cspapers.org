In this paper, we leverage these similarities to improve the translation performance in neural machine translation. Specifically, we introduce an attention-via-attention mechanism that allows the information of source-side characters flowing to the target side directly. With this mechanism, the target-side characters will be generated based on the representation of source-side characters when the words are similar. For instance, our proposed neural machine translation system learns to transfer the character-level information of the English word "system" through the attention-via-attention mechanism to generate the Czech word "syst√©m." Consequently, our approach is able to not only achieve a competitive translation performance, but also reduce the model size significantly.
