We consider live-streaming over a peer-to-peer network in which peers are allowed to enter or leave the system adversarially and arbitrarily. Previous approaches for streaming have either used randomized distribution graphs or structured trees with randomized maintenance algorithms. Randomized graphs handle peer churn well but have only probabilistic connectivity guarantees, while structured trees have good connectivity but have proven hard to maintain under peer churn. We improve upon both approaches by presenting a novel distribution structure with a deterministic and distributed algorithm for maintenance under peer churn. The algorithm has a constant repair time for connectivity, and near optimal delay. As opposed to order results, the guarantees provided by our algorithm are exact and hold for any network size.
