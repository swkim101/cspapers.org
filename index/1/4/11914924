We prove results indicating that it is hard to compute efficiently good approximate solutions to the Graph Coloring, Set Covering and other related minimization problems. Specifically, there is an c >0 such that Graph Coloring cannot be approximated with ratio nâ€™ unless P=NP. Set Covering cannot be approximated with ratio clog n for any c < 1/4 unless NP is contained in DTIME[nPOIY log ~ ]. Similar results follow for related problems such as Clique Cover, Fractional Chromatic Number, Dominating Set and others.
