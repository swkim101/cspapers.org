Predicting user engagement with direct displays (DD) is of paramount importance to commercial search engines, as well as to search performance evaluation. However, understanding within-content engagement on a web page is not a trivial task mainly because of two reasons: (1) engagement is subjective and different users may exhibit different behavioural patterns; (2) existing proxies of user engagement (e.g., clicks, dwell time) suffer from certain caveats, such as the well-known position bias, and are not as effective in discriminating between useful and non-useful components. In this paper, we conduct a crowdsourcing study and examine how users engage with a prominent web search engine component such as the knowledge module (KM) display. To this end, we collect and analyse more than 115k mouse cursor positions from 300 users, who perform a series of search tasks. Furthermore, we engineer a large number of meta-features which we use to predict different proxies of user engagement, including attention and usefulness. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is able to predict more accurately different levels of user engagement and outperform existing baselines.
