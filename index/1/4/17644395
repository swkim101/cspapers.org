Real-time audio and music processing frequently requires actions to be taken relative to a number of different control rates such as audio sample rate or sensor inputs. These processing systems frequently use schedulers to manage this complexity. The design of a flexible scheduling system must avoid limiting the types of actions or the range of control rates available. Abstracting time and events from the underlying scheduler provides a high degree of flexibility for designers of processing networks. Marsyas[4] is an open source software framework for analysis, retrieval, and synthesis of audio signals with specific emphasis to Music Information Retrieval applications. The Marsyas scheduler uses these abstractions to provide a highly extensible scheduler.
