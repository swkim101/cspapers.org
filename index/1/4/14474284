The use of Semantic Web Service (SWS) technologies have been suggested to enable more dynamic B2B integration of heterogeneous systems and partners. We present how we add semantics to RosettaNet specifications to enable the WSMX SWS environment to automate mediation of messages. The benefits of applying SWS technologies include flexibility in accepting heterogeneity in B2B integrations.
