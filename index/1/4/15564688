The widespread deployment of wireless networks presents an opportunity for localization and mapping using only signal-strength measurements. The current state of the art is to use Gaussian process latent variable models (GP-LVM). This method works well, but relies on a signature uniqueness assumption which limits its applicability to only signal-rich environments. Moreover, it does not scale computationally to large sets of data, requiring O (N3) operations per iteration. We present a GraphSLAM-like algorithm for signal strength SLAM. Our algorithm shares many of the benefits of Gaussian processes, yet is viable for a broader range of environments since it makes no signature uniqueness assumptions. It is also more tractable to larger map sizes, requiring O (N2) operations per iteration. We compare our algorithm to a laser-SLAM ground truth, showing it produces excellent results in practice.
