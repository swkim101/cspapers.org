Although kernel k-means is central for clustering complex data such as images and texts by implicit feature space embedding, its practicality is limited by the quadratic computational complexity. In this paper, we present a novel technique based on scalable centroid approximation that accelerates kernel k-means down to a sub-quadratic complexity. We prove near-optimality of our algorithm, and experimentally confirm its efficiency.
