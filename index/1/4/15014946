An (α, β)-spanner of an unweighted graph <i>G</i> is a subgraph <i>H</i> that approximates distances in <i>G</i> in the following sense. For any two vertices <i>u, v: Δ<inf>H</inf></i> (<i>u, v</i>) ≤ αΔ<i>G</i>(<i>u, v</i>) + β, where Δ<i>G</i> is the distance w.r.t. <i>G.</i> It is well known that there exist (multiplicative) (2<i>k</i> - 1, 0)-spanners of size <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>1+1/<i>k</i></sup>) and that there exist (purely additive) (1, 2)-spanners of size <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>3/2</sup>). However no other (1, <i>O</i>(1))-spanners are known to exist.In this paper we develop a couple new techniques for constructing (α, β)-spanners. The first result is a purely additive (1, 6)-spanner of size <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>4/3</sup>). Our construction algorithm can be understood as an economical agent that assigns <i>costs</i> and <i>values</i> to paths in the graph, <i>purchasing</i> affordable paths and ignoring expensive ones, which are intuitively well-approximated by paths already purchased. This general approach should lead to new spanner constructions.The second result is a truly simple linear time construction of (<i>k, k</i> - 1)-spanners with size <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>1+1</sup>/k). In a distributed network the algorithm terminates in a <i>constant</i> number of rounds and has expected size <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>1+1</sup>/k). The new idea here is primarily in the analysis of the construction. We show that a few simple and local rules for picking spanner edges induce seemingly coordinated global behavior.
