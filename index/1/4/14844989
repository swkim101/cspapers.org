In this paper, we take both tasks into account and propose a multi-task deep network (MTDnet) that makes use of their own advantages and jointly optimize the two tasks simultaneously for person ReID. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate both tasks in one network to solve the person ReID. We show that our proposed architecture significantly boosts the performance. Furthermore, deep architecture in general requires a sufficient dataset for training, which is usually not met in person ReID. To cope with this situation, we further extend the MTDnet and propose a cross-domain architecture that is capable of using an auxiliary set to assist training on small target sets. In the experiments, our approach outperforms most of existing person ReID algorithms on representative datasets including CUHK03, CUHK01, VIPeR, iLIDS and PRID2011, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
