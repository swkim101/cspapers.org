Spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) recently received significant attentions for its promising characteristics in cache and memory applications. As an early-stage modeling tool, NVSim has been widely adopted for simulations of emerging nonvolatile memory technologies in computer architecture research, including STT-RAM, ReRAM, PCM, etc. In this work, we introduce a new member of NVSim family - NVSim-VXs, which enables statistical simulation of STT-RAM for write performance, errors, and energy consumption. This enhanced model takes into account the impacts of parametric variabilities of CMOS and MTJ devices and the chip operating temperature. It is also calibrated with Monte-Carlo Simulations based on macro-magnetic and SPICE models, covering five technology nodes between 22nm and 90nm. NVSim-VXs strongly supports the fast-growing needs of STT-RAM research on reliability analysis and enhancement, announcing the next important stage of NVSim development.
