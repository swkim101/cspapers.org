The problem of stabilization of networked control systems (NCSs) with data packet dropout is studied. Sufficient conditions are presented on the stability and stabilization of the NCSs with packet dropout. The novelty of this work lies in that NCSs with arbitrary but finite data packet dropout are modelled as switched linear systems, and this enables us to apply the result of switched systems to the analysis and synthesis of such NCSs. The admissible upper bound of the dropped packets can be determined by a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which guarantee the stability of the NCSs. Stabilizing controllers (via state feedback and static output feedback) can be constructed by solving a set of LMIs. Also, for an NCS with a convergence rate constraint, similar results are obtained. Examples are worked out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
