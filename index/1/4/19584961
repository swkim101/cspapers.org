Aggressive pitch scaling in sub-10nm nodes has introduced complex design rules which make routing extremely challenging. Cell architectures have also been changed to meet the design rules. For example, metal layers below M1 are used to gain additional routing resources. New cell architectures wherein inter-row M1 routing is allowed force consideration of vertical alignment of cells. In this work, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based, detailed placement optimization to maximize direct vertical M1 routing utilization for congestion and wirelength reduction.
