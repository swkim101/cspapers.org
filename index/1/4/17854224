We study logic-based abduction, where knowledge is represented by propositional formulas. The computational complexity of this problem is highly intractable in many interesting settings. In this work we therefore present an extensive parameterized complexity analysis of abduction within various fragments of propositional logic together with (combinations of) natural parameters.
