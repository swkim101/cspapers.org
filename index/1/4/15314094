Android has a dominating share in the mobile market and there is a significant rise of mobile malware targeting Android devices. Android malware accounted for 97% of all mobile threats in 2013 [26]. To protect smartphones and prevent privacy leakage, companies have implemented various host-based intrusion prevention systems (HIPS) on their Android devices. In this paper, we first analyze the implementations, strengths and weaknesses of three popular HIPS architectures. We demonstrate a severe loophole and weakness of an existing popular HIPS product in which hackers can readily exploit. Then we present a design and implementation of a secure and extensible HIPS platform---"Patronus." Patronus not only provides intrusion prevention without the need to modify the Android system, it can also dynamically detect existing malware based on runtime information. We propose a two-phase dynamic detection algorithm for detecting running malware. Our experiments show that Patronus can prevent the intrusive behaviors efficiently and detect malware accurately with a very low performance overhead and power consumption.
