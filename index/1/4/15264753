A robust robot perception system intended to enable object manipulation needs to be able to accurately identify objects and their pose at high speeds. Since objects vary considerably in surface properties, rigidity and articulation, no single detector or object estimation method has been shown to provide reliable detection across object types to date. This indicates the need for an architecture that is able to quickly swap detectors, pose estimators, and filters, or to run them in parallel or serial and combine their results, preferably without any code modifications at all. In this paper, we present our implementation of such an infrastructure, ReIn (REcognition INfrastructure), to answer these needs. ReIn is able to combine a multitude of 2D/3D object recognition and pose estimation techniques in parallel as dynamically loadable plugins. It also provides an extremely efficient data passing architecture, and offers the possibility to change the parameters and initial settings of these techniques during their execution. In the course of this work we introduce two new classifiers designed for robot perception needs: BiGGPy (Binarized Gradient Grid Pyramids) for scalable 2D classification and VFH (Viewpoint Feature Histograms) for 3D classification and pose. We then show how these two classifiers can be easily combined using ReIn to solve object recognition and pose identification problems.
