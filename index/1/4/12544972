In this paper we present a scalable model of a network of Active Queue Management (AQM) routers serving a large population of TCP flows. We present efficient solution techniques that allow one to obtain the transient behavior of the average queue lengths, packet loss probabilities, and average end-to-end latencies. We model different versions of TCP as well as different versions of RED, the most popular AQM scheme currently in use. Comparisons between our models and <tt>ns</tt> simulation show our models to be quite accurate while at the same time requiring substantially less time to solve, especially when workloads and bandwidths are high.
