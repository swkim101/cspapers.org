The authors study motion laws of a quadruped robot in environments which are concerned with slope, i.e. from slope to level, from a slope to another slope. The authors unify a slope recognition and gradient measuring method for all environments which are concerned with slope. The three rules which are used to recognize a slope are proven. The authors study prediction of posture after body turn and posture adjustment before body turn, the stability and maximum step length of a quadruped robot in transition area.
