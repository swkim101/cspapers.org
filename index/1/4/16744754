An introductory computer course was offered to adults 60 years and older. A computer attitude survey was administered before and after the course in order to uncover preexisting concerns and reveal those attitudes most affected by the course. Attitudes following the course were marked by highly positive changes. Survey results revealed that after the course the participants felt better acquainted with computer terminology, less left out because they are unfamiliar with computers, less apprehensive about using a computer, and more certain of their ability to interpret a computer printout. An interaction diary maintained by each of the participants revealed enthusiastic learners who were eager to take more courses in the future. Contrary to widely held stereotypes, many older adults view computer technology favorably and can benefit from acquisition of basic computer skills.
