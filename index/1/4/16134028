Maximal repeating pattern (MRP) analysis is a recently developed user interface evaluation technique that uses an algorithm to analyze transcripts of user sessions by detecting repeated user actions. Encouraged by results of an initial study of the MRP technique, we conducted a study in which we evaluated a simple prototype interface using both the MRP technique and observation. Interface problems found by observation were also found by MRP analysis. Although the MRP algorithm produced large amounts of data that an interface evaluator had to analyze, we found that by mapping raw user inputs in the transcripts into more abstract classes via prefiltering, we could perform more useful MRP analyses.
