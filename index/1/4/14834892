A maximum entropy (ME) model is usually estimated so that it conforms to equality constraints on feature expectations. However, the equality constraint is inappropriate for sparse and therefore unreliable features. This study explores an ME model with box-type inequality constraints, where the equality can be violated to reflect this unreliability. We evaluate the inequality ME model using text categorization datasets. We also propose an extension of the inequality ME model, which results in a natural integration with the Gaussian MAP estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the inequality models and the proposed extension.
