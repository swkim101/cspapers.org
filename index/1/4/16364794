A collective actuator is a self-reconfigurable modular-robotic structure which produces useful mechanical work through simultaneous reconfiguration of its constituent units. An actuator is additionally called scalable if its force-to-weight ratio does not depend on the number of its member modules. In this work, we consider scalable collective actuators built from spherical catoms with two connection types: strong but fixed and weak but mobile. We investigate how to construct these actuators in such a way, as to maximize their force-to-weight ratio. We present a number of designs of high strength, whose force capacities significantly exceed those of similar actuators reported previously.
