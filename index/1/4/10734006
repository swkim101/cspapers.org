Social network analysis (SNA) has been explored in many contexts with different goals. Here, we use concepts from SNA for recommending collaborations in academic networks. Recent work shows that research groups with well connected academic networks tend to be more prolific. Hence, recommending collaborations is useful for increasing a group's connections, then boosting the group research as a collateral advantage. In this work, we propose two new metrics for recommending new collaborations or intensification of existing ones. Each metric considers a social principle (homophily and proximity) that is relevant within the academic context. The focus is to verify how these metrics influence in the resulting recommendations. We also propose new metrics for evaluating the recommendations based on social concepts (novelty, diversity and coverage) that have never been used for such a goal. Our experimental evaluation shows that considering our new metrics improves the quality of the recommendations when compared to the state-of-the-art.
