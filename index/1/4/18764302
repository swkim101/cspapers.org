Automated expert advisors should provide real time information that allows assessment of the advisor's response instead of providing explanation facilities that add to the operator's workload. In system control environments, an automated expert advisor applies established rules to system data, arriving at an assessment of the system status. The processing of data results in information being either conserved, reduced, or created. Automated advisors typically reduce or create information thereby reducing operator workload. In a system where the human operator retains final control, the primary goal is for the operator to be able to maintain the system, using the advisor's assessment in a manner consistent with the accuracy of that assessment.
