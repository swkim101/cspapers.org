Models of human-computer interaction (HCI) can provide a degree of theoretical unity for diverse work in computing for users with special needs. Example adaptations for special users are described in the context of both implementation-oriented and linguistic models of HCI. It is suggested that the language of HCI be used to define standards for special adaptations. This would enhance reusability, modifiability, and compatibility of adaptations, inspire new innovations, and make it easier for developers of standard interfaces to incorporate adaptations. The creation of user models for subgroups of users with special needs would support semantic and conceptual adaptations.
