This paper presents two algorithms, one for clustering a set of interconnected nodes and the other for forming a linear placement of clustered interconnected nodes. The linear placement algorithm requires the output of clustering as an input. The two algorithms were designed to analyze the structure of digital logic for automatic placement of logic functions on a MOS/LSI chip as part of an automatic layout system8 and so far have only been used for that application. However, the clustering algorithm could be used to analyze any undirected graph. Both algorithms are noniterative and provide very good results with small amounts of computer time.
