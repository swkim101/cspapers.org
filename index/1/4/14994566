The Unit Package is an interactive knowledge representation system with representations for individuals, classes, indefinite individuals, and abstractions. Links between the nodes are structured with explicit definitional roles, types of inheritance, defaults, and various data formats. This paper presents the general ideas of the Unit Package and compares it with other current knowledge representation languages. The Unit Package was created for a hierarchical planning application, and is now in use by several AI projects.
