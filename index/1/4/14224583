Most face recognition systems focus on photo-based face recognition. In this paper, we present a face recognition system based on face sketches. The proposed system contains two elements: pseudo-sketch synthesis and sketch recognition. The pseudo-sketch generation method is based on local linear preserving of geometry between photo and sketch images, which is inspired by the idea of locally linear embedding. The nonlinear discriminate analysis is used to recognize the probe sketch from the synthesized pseudo-sketches. Experimental results on over 600 photo-sketch pairs show that the performance of the proposed method is encouraging.
