The ever-increasing requirement of high performance and huge capacity memories of emerging consumer electronics appliances, such as mobile phone, digital camera, MP3, PMP, PDA, etc., has led to the widespread adaptation of flash memory as main data storages, respectively. As a result, managing the data on ash memory has been gaining in significant to satisfy the requirement of mobile embedded applications. However, the read/write/erase behaviors of flash memory are radically different than that of magnetic disks which make traditional database technology irrelevant. In this paper, we introduce LGeDBMS, a scale-downed DBMS engine designed for ash memory and its application. Finally, we demonstrate a PIM(Personal Information Management) application on a mobile phone using LGeDBMS.
