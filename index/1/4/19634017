A new algorithm of pattern matching for time-space speech feature using Dynamic Programming is proposed for recognizing infinite-connected words spoken by male speakers without adaptation of speakers before the utterance. The new algorithm carries out frame-wisely two kinds of normalizations : the time normalization for removing speed variation of speech and the space normalization for removing speaker-dependence. This algorithm is realizable by a simple cellular automaton. The recognition rate 85.7% is obtained for 50 categories, h male speakers and 440 samples (connected words).
