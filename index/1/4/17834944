This paper presents the design of a novel variable stiffness gripper with two parallel fingers (jaws). Compliance of the system is generated by using permanent magnets as the nonlinear springs. Based on the presented design, the position and stiffness level of the fingers can be adjusted simultaneously by changing the air gap between the magnets. The modeling of magnetic repulsion force and stiffness are presented and verified experimentally. An experiment is also conducted to demonstrate the functionality of the gripper to improve safety when a fragile object was grasped and the gripper collided with an obstacle.
