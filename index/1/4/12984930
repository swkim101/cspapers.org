An effective way to visualize the prediction of deep neural networks on an image is to decompose the prediction into the contribution of units (pixels or patches). In the existing works, these units are largely considered independently, thus limiting the performance of visualization. In this paper, we propose a new predication visualization method that uses super-pixel as a contribution unit. Moreover, our method takes into consideration of the interaction of adjacent super-pixels. We implement our technique and evaluate its performance with various images. Our results show its excellent performance.
