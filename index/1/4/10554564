Scholarly entities, such as articles, journals, authors and institutions, are now mostly ranked according to expert opinion and citation data. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded MESUR project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory is developing metrics of scholarly impact that can rank a wide range of scholarly entities on the basis of their usage. The MESUR project starts with the creation of a semantic network model of the scholarly community that integrates bibliographic, citation, and usage data collected from publishers and repositories world-wide. It is estimated that this scholarly semantic network will include approximately 50 million articles, 1 million authors, 10,000 journals and conference proceedings, 500 million citations, and 1 billion usage-related events; the largest scholarly semantic network ever created. The developed scholarly semantic network will then serve as a standardized platform for the definition and validation of new metrics of scholarly impact. This poster describes the MESUR project's data aggregation and processing techniques including the OWL scholarly ontology that was developed to model the scholarly communication process.
