Sensing the forces applied to the palm of a robot manipulator requires robust compliant sensors guarded against collision. The force sensing palm for the MLab Simple Hand measures three components of net contact force in a simple robust design using flexure springs and optical position sensing. The hand is calibrated in an automatic process. Measurements are included to compare performance to the theoretical model.
