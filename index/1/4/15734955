We consider random walks on graph colourings of an nvertex graph. It has been shown by Jerrum and by Salas and Sokal that a simple random walk would mix rapidly provided the number of colours, k, exceeded the maximum degree A of the graph by a factor of at least 2. Lack of improvements on this bound led to a conjecture that k 2 2A was a natural barrier. We disprove this conjecture in the simplest case of 5-colouring graphs of maximum degree 3. Our proof involves a novel computer-assisted proof technique to establish rapid mixing of a new “heat bath” Markov chain on colourings using the method of path coupling. We outline an extension to 7-colourings of triangle-free 4-regular graphs.
