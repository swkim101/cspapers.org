Over 30 years of research have gone into software reliability engineering during testing. With today's complex software systems however, reliability has to be built into the early phases of development, including architectural design. We present a software architecture-based approach to estimating component reliability. Our sto-chastic reliability model is applicable to early stages of development when the implementation artifacts are unavailable and the exact execution profile is unknown.
