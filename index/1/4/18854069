With highly dynamic, structured P2P system needs very large maintenance cost. But there is little research on this kind of maintenance. This article focuses on reducing maintenance cost of structured P2P system and proposes a Clone Node Protocol, CNP for short. We realize a new system based on Chord using CNP, i.e. CNChord. CNP can reduce maintenance cost greatly, and improve query efficiency at some extent.
