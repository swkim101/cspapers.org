This paper discusses the main shortcomings of existing software test pattern generation systems and describes the development of a new system. The new system will be developed in two phases. The first phase is called the scan-in/scan-out test generation sub-system. This sub-system will be used for testing designs which have 100% scan-in/scan-out (reading or writing of every register from external world is possible). The second phase will include the development of efficient general functional models. The test generation system to be developed in the first phase will be updated to incorporate the capability of handling such models. The functional models include general-combinational, register, counter ROM, RAM, and microprocessor. In this paper, only, an outline of some of the distinct features of the system will be described.
