A set of procedures to graphically display ordered and unordered trees has been developed. The procedures have been used in several class demonstration programs to illustrate tree insertion, deletion, and balancing algorithms. The procedures are available for inclusion in student programs so that they can determine if their programs are working correctly. The procedures are written in Turbo Pascal for an IBM PC.
