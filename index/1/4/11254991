Visually demanding interfaces on a mobile phone can diminish the user experience by monopolizing the user's attention when they are focusing on another task and impede accessibility for visually impaired users. Because mobile devices are often located in pockets when users are mobile, explicit foot movements can be defined as eyes-and-hands-free input gestures for interacting with the device. In this work, we study the human capability associated with performing foot-based interactions which involve lifting and rotation of the foot when pivoting on the toe and heel. Building upon these results, we then developed a system to learn and recognize foot gestures using a single commodity mobile phone placed in the user's pocket or in a holster on their hip. Our system uses acceleration data recorded by a built-in accelerometer on the mobile device and a machine learning approach to recognizing gestures. Through a lab study, we demonstrate that our system can classify ten different foot gestures at approximately 86% accuracy.
