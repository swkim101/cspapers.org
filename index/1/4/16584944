The performance of typestate-oriented programming languages is difficult to evaluate as existing benchmarks do not exercise the unique features of these languages. We address this by developing a new benchmark suite specifically designed to evaluate typestate-oriented functionality. These benchmarks model projected applications, providing overhead and memory loads similar to actual applications.
