An optimizing translation mechanism for the dynamic interaction between a logic-based expert system written in PROLOG and a relational database accessible through SQL is presented. The mechanism makes use of an intermediate language that decomposes the optimization problem and makes the proposed approach target-language independent. It can either facilitate expert system - database interaction, e.g., when integrating expert systems into business systems, or augment existing databases with (external) deductive capabilities.
