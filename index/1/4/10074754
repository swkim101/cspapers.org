Information retrieval in large databases of complex objects, such as images, audio or documents, requires approximate search algorithms in practice, in order to return semantically similar objects to a given query in a reasonabletime. One practical approach is supervised binary hashing, where each object is mapped onto a small binary vector so that Hamming distances approximate semantic similarities, and the search is done in the binary space more efficiently. Much work has focused on designing objective functions and optimization algorithms for learning b-bit hash functions from a dataset. Recent work has shown that comparable or better results can be obtained by training b hash functions independently from each other and making them cooperate by introducing diversity with ensemble learning techniques. We show that this can be further improved by two techniques: pruning an ensemble of hash functions, and learning local hash functions. We show how it is possible to train our improved algorithms in datasets orders of magnitude larger than those used by most works on supervised binary hashing.
