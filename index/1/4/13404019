We present the first practical reliable benchmark. This benchmark is “uncheatable” in the sense that one can not Sigal Ar* substantiate a claim to have obtained the results of its computation without actually doing so. In addition to having the ability to check the computation results for correctness, they are known to require at least some specified amount of computation time, to be computed correctly. Initial work trying to provide reliability in benchmarking is presented in [6]. They rely on cryptographic assumptions for the reliability feature in the benchmarks proposed. The benchmarks we propose are based on numerical instability of some matrix computations, and are therefore very similar to benchmarks actually in use, with the added benefit of reliability.
