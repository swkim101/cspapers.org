Web scale classification problems, such as Web page tagging and E-commerce product recommendation, are typically regarded as multi-label classification with an extremely large number of labels. In this paper, we propose GPT, which is a novel tree-based approach for extreme multi-label learning. GPT recursively splits a feature space with a hyperplane at each internal node, considering approximate k-nearest neighbor graph on the label space. We learn the linear binary classifiers using a simple optimization procedure. We conducted evaluations on several large-scale real-world data sets and compared our proposed method with recent state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
