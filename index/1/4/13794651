Ignoring this structure information may limit theperformance of existing hashing algorithms.This paper explores the research problemof learning to Hash on Structured Data (HSD) and formulates anovel framework that considers additional structure information.In particular, the hashing function is learned in a unified learning framework by simultaneously ensuring the structural consistency and preserving the similarities between data examples.An iterative gradient descent algorithm is designed as the optimization procedure. Furthermore, we improve the effectiveness of hashing function through orthogonal transformation by minimizing the quantization error.Experimentalresults on two datasets clearly demonstrate the advantages ofthe proposed method over several state-of-the-art hashing methods.
