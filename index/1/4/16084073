We describe a completely automated large scale visual recommendation system for fashion. Our focus is to efficiently harness the availability of large quantities of online fashion images and their rich meta-data. Specifically, we propose two classes of data driven models in the Deterministic Fashion Recommenders (DFR) and Stochastic Fashion Recommenders (SFR) for solving this problem. We analyze relative merits and pitfalls of these algorithms through extensive experimentation on a large-scale data set and baseline them against existing ideas from color science. We also illustrate key fashion insights learned through these experiments and show how they can be employed to design better recommendation systems. The industrial applicability of proposed models is in the context of mobile fashion shopping. Finally, we also outline a large-scale annotated data set of fashion images Fashion-136K) that can be exploited for future research in data driven visual fashion.
