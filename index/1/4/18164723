TimesTen is an in-memory, application-tier data manager that delivers low response time and high throughput. Applications may create tables and manage them exclusively in TimesTen, and they may optionally cache frequently used subsets of a disk-based relational database in TimesTen. Cached tables and tables managed exclusively by TimesTen may coexist in the same database. Queries and updates to the cache are performed by the application through SQL. Applications running on different mid-tier servers may cache different or overlapping subsets of the same back-end database. TimesTen keeps the caches synchronized with each other and with the back-end database.
