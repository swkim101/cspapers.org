Frames deÔ¨Åned in FrameNet (FN) share highly similar structures with events in ACE event extraction program. An even-t in ACE is composed of an event trigger and a set of arguments. Analogously, a frame in FN is composed of a lexical unit and a set of frame elements, which play similar roles as triggers and arguments of ACE events respectively. Besides having similar structures, many frames in FN actually express certain types of events. The above observations motivate us to explore whether there exists a good mapping from frames to event-types and if it is possible to improve event detection by using FN. In this paper, we propose a global inference approach to detect events in FN. Further, based on the detected results, we analyze possible mappings from frames to event-types. Finally, we improve the performance of event detection and achieve a new state-of-the-art result by using the events automatically detected from FN.
