Recent work in neural machine translation has shown promising performance, but the most eective architectures do not scale naturally to large vocabulary sizes. We propose and compare three variable-length encoding schemes that represent a large vocabulary corpus using a much smaller vocabulary with no loss in information. Common words are unaected by our encoding, but rare words are encoded using a sequence of two pseudo-words. Our method is simple and eective: it requires no complete dictionaries, learning procedures, increased training time, changes to the model, or new parameters. Compared to a baseline that replaces all rare words with an unknown word symbol, our best variable-length encoding strategy improves WMT English-French translation performance by up to 1.7 BLEU.
