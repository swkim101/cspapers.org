Location-awareness is an important requirement for many mobile wireless applications today. When GPS is not applicable because of the required precision and/or the resource constraints on the hardware platform, radio interferometric ranging may offer an alternative. In this paper, we present a technique that enables the precise tracking of multiple wireless nodes simultaneously. It relies on multiple infrastructure nodes deployed at known locations measuring the position of tracked mobile nodes using radio interferometry. In addition to location information, the approach also provides node velocity estimates by measuring the Doppler shift of the interference signal. The performance of the technique is evaluated using a prototype implementation on mote-class wireless sensor nodes. Finally, a possible application scenario of dirty bomb detection in a football stadium is briefly described.
