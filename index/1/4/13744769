The problem of task assignment to workers is of

long-standing fundamental importance. Examples of this include the classical

problem of assigning computing tasks to nodes in a distributed computing

environment, assigning jobs to robots, and crowdsourcing. Extensive research

into this problem generally addresses important issues such as uncertainty and

incentives. However, the problem of adversarial tampering with the task

assignment process has not received as much attention. Â We are concerned with a particular adversarial setting in

task assignment where an attacker may target a set of workers in order to

prevent the tasks assigned to these workers from being completed. For the case when all tasks are homogeneous, we provide an

efficient algorithm for computing the optimal assignment. When tasks are

heterogeneous, we show that the adversarial assignment problem is NP-Hard, and present an

algorithm for solving it approximately. Our theoretical results are accompanied

by extensive simulation results showing the effectiveness of our algorithms.
