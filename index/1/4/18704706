External single-input single-output sorts can use multiple processors each with a large tournament replacement-selection in memory, and each with private disks to sort an input stream in linear elapsed time. Of course, increased numbers of processors, memories, and disks are required as the input file size grows. This paper analyzes the algorithm and reports the performance of an implementation.
