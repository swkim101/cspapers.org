Description provide a syntactic device for abbreviating expressions of a formal language. We discuss the motivation for descriptions in a system called DLOG. We describe two approaches to specifing their semantics, and a method for implementing their use. We explain why some descriptions should be given a higher order interpretation, and explain how such descriptions can be interpreted in the simpler logic of Prolog. The essential idea is to constrain the domain of desriptions so that an extended unification procedure can determine description equivalence within the prolog framework.
