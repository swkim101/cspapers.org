We present a new hash function Argon2, which is oriented at protection of low-entropy secrets without secret keys. It requires a certain (but tunable) amount of memory, imposes prohibitive time-memory and computation-memory tradeoffs on memory-saving users, and is exceptionally fast on regular PC. Overall, it can provide ASIC-and botnet-resistance by filling the memory in 0.6 cycles per byte in the non-compressible way.
