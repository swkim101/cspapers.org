Computer-related gender differences are examined using survey responses from 651 college students. Issues studied include gender differences regarding interest and enjoyment of both using a computer and computer programming. Interesting gender differences with implications for teaching are examined for the groups (family, teachers, friends, others) that have the most influence on students' interest in computers. Traditional areas such as confidence, career understanding and social bias are also discussed. Preliminary results for a small sample of technology majors indicate that computer majors have unique interests and attitudes compared to other science majors.
