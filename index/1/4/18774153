As a step towards enabling snake robots to move in unstructured environments, this paper considers control strategies where environment adaptation is combined with directional control of snake robot locomotion. The first contribution of the paper is a general framework for motion control of snake robots, which allows the motion to be specified in terms of a body wave component, an environment adaptation component, and a heading control component. As a second contribution, we employ the controller framework to propose a control law for straight line path following control of snake robots in environments with obstacles. The paper presents simulation results where the path following controller is combined with a waypoint guidance strategy in order to steer the snake robot between waypoints in an obstacle environment.
