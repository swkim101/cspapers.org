Software designers in the object-oriented paradigm can make use of modeling tools and standard notations such as UML. Nevertheless, casual observations from collocated design collaborations suggest that teams tend to use physical mediums to sketch a plethora of informal diagrams in varied representations that often diverge from UML. To better understand such collaborations and support them with tools, we need to understand the origins, roles, uses, and implications of these alternate representations. To this end we conducted observational studies of collaborative design exercises, in which we focused on representation use. Our primary finding is that teams intentionally improviserepresentations and organize design information in responseto ad-hoc needs, which arise from the evolution of the design, and which are difficult to meet with fixed standard notations. This behavior incurs orientation and grounding difficulties for which teams compensate by relying on memory, other communication mediums, and contextual cues. Without this additional information the artifacts are difficult to interpret and have limited documentation potential. Collaborative design tools and processes should therefore focus on preserving contextual information while permitting unconstrained mixing and improvising of notations.
