Debugging operational networks can be a daunting task, due to their size, distributed state, and the presence of black box components such as commercial routers and switches, which are poorly instrumentable and only coarsely configurable. The debugging tool set available to administrators is limited, and provides only aggregated statistics (SNMP), sampled data (NetFlow/sFlow), or local measurements on single hosts (tcpdump). In this paper, we leverage split forwarding architectures such as OpenFlow to add record and replay debugging capabilities to networks - a powerful, yet currently lacking approach. We present the design of OFRewind, which enables scalable, multi-granularity, temporally consistent recording and coordinated replay in a network, with fine-grained, dynamic, centrally orchestrated control over both record and replay. Thus, OFRewind helps operators to reproduce software errors, identify datapath limitations, or locate configuration errors.
