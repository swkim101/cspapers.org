Nowadays security systems have become highly sophisticated. However, breaches are inevitable. Nevertheless, post-breach analysis is performed to assess the severity of the breach and to trace the intruder's actions. This paper proposes drWatson, a layered file system that in case of an illegitimate file system access provides data for post-breach analysis to assess the severity of the breach and to trace the intruder's actions. drWatson, when mounted on top of any concrete file system, works by logging all the operations along with their date time stamps targeted to the below mounted file system.
