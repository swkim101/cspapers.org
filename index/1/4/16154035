This demonstration shows our versatile heterogeneous sensor networks testbed. This testbed supports high speed embedded WLAN node, medium speed IEEE802.15.4 node, wired computer and so on with powerful supervision platform. The unique features of the testbed are as follows: (1) Supporting heterogeneous sensor networks; (2) Owning powerful testbed nodes; (3) Emulating the interference and noise with the USRP2 replaying the real signal.
