This paper deals with the geometrical properties of an ellipsoidal object (aspect ratio, volume, orientation) estimation with an underwater sensor inspired by the uncommon sense of the electric fish. The proposed method first locates the object independently of its geometrical properties thanks to the MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) algorithm and then, estimates the geometrical properties using an optimization method and the object's electrical response model. The simulation results show the relevance of the method.
