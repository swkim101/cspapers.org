In this paper, we report on a set of initial results for English-to-Arabic Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). We show that morphological decomposition of the Arabic source is beneficial, especially for smaller-size corpora, and investigate different recombination techniques. We also report on the use of Factored Translation Models for English-to-Arabic translation.
