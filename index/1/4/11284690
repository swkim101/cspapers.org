Although standard components' manufacture and reuse is common practice in many engineering domains (e.g. electrical and mechanical engineering), this is not yet the case with respect to software development. Ironically, in such a highly “automated” domain, users still fail to find available components that match their needs faster than developing them again. The gap between what designers expect from reuse (and how it should be offered), and the actual reuse attempts remains the main barrier. This paper deals with conceptual schema construction in terms of reuse and the respective semantic requirements. It proposes a semantic retrieval mechanism based on imprecise queries for the reuse of conceptual schema components.
