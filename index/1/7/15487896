A very high speed multiplier unit is an indispensable part of many applications such as real-time speech processing , image processing and enhancing, pattern classification, fast fourier transformation, etc. This paper addresses the VLSI design of a fast systolic multiplier unit. The system is a collection of two basic components replicated in a 2-dimensional space. Such a recursive structure offers simplicity in the design and implementation. Moreover, in comparison with the alternative models, the p r o p o s e d pipeline architecture reduces the number of required ports (PINs) per chip by a factor of two.
