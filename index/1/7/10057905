This paper analyzes secrecy outage probability (SOP) of underlay cognitive radio systems (UCRSs) interfered by signals from primary networks, impaired by channel information inaccuracy and Rayleigh fading, constrained by peak transmit power and tolerable interference power. The analytical result is presented in an exact expression and corroborated by computer simulations. Multiple results illustrate that the SOP suffers a floor in a regime of large peak interference power or large peak transmit power. Additionally, the influence of the interference from the primary network and the channel information inaccuracy on information securing capability is severe.
