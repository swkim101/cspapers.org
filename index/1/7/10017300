We are developing a coordinated team of robots to assemble structures, a task that cannot be performed by any single robot. Even simple operations in this domain require complex interaction between multiple robots and the number of contingencies that must be addressed if the team is to act completely autonomously is prohibitively large. This scenario forces incorporation of a human operator. Ideally we would like a seamless interface between the robots and the operator such that the operator can interact with the system by helping it be more efficient or get out of a stuck condition or performing a task that the robots are not capable of themselves. We use an architecture that implements "sliding autonomy" to accomplish these goals. The system of robots can be fully autonomous as long as all is well. The system is capable of accepting input from the operator at any time, especially when it is unable to recover from a failure. We motivate this scenario with results from an extended series of experiments we have conducted with three robots that work together to dock both ends of a suspended beam. We show the difference in performance between a completely teleoperated system, a fully autonomous system, and one in which sliding autonomy has been incorporated.
