Multi-robot information gathering teams typically require communication for data fusion and cooperative decision making. However, when communication takes place over wireless networks, stringent bandwidth limits apply. These limits raise the need for efficient utilisation of available communication resources in a manner that balances information gathering utility with communication costs or limits. In our previous work, we introduced the dynamic information flow (DIF) problem as a general formulation of this trade-off. We introduced two variants of the problem addressing the issue of communication efficiency for data fusion only. In this paper, we extend one of the variants to address communication efficiency for both data fusion and cooperative decision making in a synergistic manner. We present a solution to this new variant that integrates a multi-cast routing algorithm with information structure optimisation. This solution allows teams that involve high-data-rate sensors and tight coordination to respect bandwidth limits. Through several simulations we verify that our solution significantly reduces bandwidth usage of such teams while maintaining information gathering performance.
