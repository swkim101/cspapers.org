One popular class of unsupervised algorithms are competitive algorithms. In the traditional view of competition, only one competitor, the winner, adapts for any given case. I propose to view competitive adaptation as attempting to fit a blend of simple probability generators (such as gaussians) to a set of data-points. The maximum likelihood fit of a model of this type suggests a "softer" form of competition, in which all competitors adapt in proportion to the relative probability that the input came from each competitor. I investigate one application of the soft competitive model, placement of radial basis function centers for function interpolation, and show that the soft model can give better performance with little additional computational cost.
