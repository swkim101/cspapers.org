In this work we use Branch-and-Bound (BB) to efficiently detect objects with deformable part models. Instead of evaluating the classifier score exhaustively over image locations and scales, we use BB to focus on promising image locations. The core problem is to compute bounds that accommodate part deformations; for this we adapt the Dual Trees data structure [7] to our problem. 
 
We evaluate our approach using Mixture-of-Deformable Part Models [4]. We obtain exactly the same results but are 10-20 times faster on average. We also develop a multiple-object detection variation of the system, where hypotheses for 20 categories are inserted in a common priority queue. For the problem of finding the strongest category in an image this results in a 100-fold speedup.
