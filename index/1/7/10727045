This paper discusses the design of a vehicle for in-pipe inspection using omnidirectional wheels and active stabilizing control. A novel propulsion mechanism is discussed using omnidirectional wheels (or omni-wheels) is presented which allows direct control of the orientation in the pipe. This paper will show the development and evaluation of a prototype model. Rapid prototyping techniques have been used in this proof-of-principle.
