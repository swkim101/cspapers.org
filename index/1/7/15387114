This paper explains how patterns can be used to describe the implementation of other patterns. It is demonstrated how certain design patterns can describe their own design. This is a fundamental reflexive relationship in pattern relationships. The process of assembling patterns by other patterns is named pattern tiling. Tiling enables us to interweave simple understood concepts of patterns into their complex real-life implementation. Several pattern tilings for the Interpreter design pattern are illustrated.
