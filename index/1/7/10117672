Various knowledge sources are used for spoken dialog systems such as task model, domain model, and agenda. An agenda graph is one of the knowledge sources for a dialog management to reflect a discourse structure. This paper proposes a clustering and linking method to automatically construct an agenda graph from human-human dialogs. Preliminary evaluation shows our approach would be helpful to reduce human efforts in designing prior knowledge.
