DOMAIN/DELPHI is the retrieval component of Apollo's in-house, integrated publishing system. It retrieves and displays documentation in a networked workstation environment in which each workstation has access to a common database of user and systems documents. Users can find information by “browsing” through a table of contents or by an indexed search for all documents on a subject. DELPHI incorporates a graphical, menu-driven user interface and displays output with multiple fonts and line art.
