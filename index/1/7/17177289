This paper suggests that there exists a large class of inherently graphical applications that could use pictures as their primary input data. These applications have no need to store input data in any other format and thus eliminate the need to do conversions between input data and a graphical representation. Since the graphical representation is the only representation of the data, such applications allow users to edit an application's input data by manipulating pictures in a drawing editor. Such an environment would be ideal for users of pen-based machines since data would not have to be entered via a keyboard, instead a gesture based drawing editor could be used. CUPID, which is a tool for Creating U ser-Interfaces that use Pictures as Input Data, is presented.
