Power capping and energy efficiency are critical concerns in server systems, particularly when serving dynamic workloads on resource-sharing multicores. We present a new operating system facility (power and energy containers) that accounts for and controls the power/energy usage of individual fine-grained server requests. This facility is enabled by novel techniques for multicore power attribution to concurrent tasks, measurement/modeling alignment to enhance predictability, and request power accounting and control.
