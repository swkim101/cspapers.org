Stereo-based off-road obstacle detection is a complex and still open problem. The challenges are in great extent related to computational cost and noise level. Previous work has shown that visual saliency and voting mechanisms are extremely effective in tackling these issues. This paper proposes a set of extensions to these mechanisms, to further improve the detector's speed-accuracy trade-off as well as its robustness. The observed enhancements are due in part to the adaptive way saliency is accounted for by the detector during the image scanning procedure. Additionally, detector's positive results are in turn used to boost the saliency map itself, thus reinforcing the analysis of relevant regions of the image. To enable detection in highly roughed terrain, the detector's invariance to the robot's posture is also enhanced. Experimental results show that, with the extended detector, denominated of ESalOD, higher levels of robustness, accuracy and computational efficiency are attained.
