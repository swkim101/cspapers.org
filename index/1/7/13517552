In this paper, we consider the performance analysis problem for a work conserving link with a large number of independent regulated inputs. For such a problem, we derive simple stochastic bounds under a general traffic constraint for the inputs. The bound for queue length is shown to be a stochastic extension of the deterministic worst case bound and it is asymptotically tighter than the bound in Kesidis and Konstantopoulos [23]. We also test the bound by considering periodic inputs with independent starting phases. Based on Sanov's theorem and importance sampling, we propose a fast simulation algorithm that achieves significant variance reduction. The simulations results are compared with our stochastic bound and the bound in [23].
