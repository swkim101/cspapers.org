In this paper we develop an efficient algorithm to determine the strongly connected components of a (dynamic) periodic graph. A periodic graph is an infinite graph with a periodic structure. These graphs are used to model VLSI circuits and systems of finite recurrences. They have a compact representation as a finite directed graph (called the static graph) with multidim~ensional edge weights. This problem generalizes the following question about an integer program: Given an integral matrix A, find the set of vectors b such that there are non-negative integral vectors x and y such that Ax = b and Ay = â€“b.
