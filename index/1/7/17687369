In social media platform such as Facebook.com and Twitter, there are many settings in which users can publicly post content. A number of these sites ofier mechanisms for other users to make responses to these content: a canonical example is from Facebook.com, where posts come with annotations like\1,492 people like this"or\view all 307 comments". Usually these user-generated content have the efiectiveness of gaining in∞uence for their publishers in social media by getting positive comments or \like". The in∞uence gained from users varies widely across difierent posts, and reasoning about the efiectiveness of a post for gaining in∞uence is an important task in social media analysis. In this paper we develop a framework for analyzing and modeling how the online content get in∞uence in the social media platform, using a large-scale collection of Facebook.com posts as the dataset. We flnd that the efiectiveness of a post to gain in∞uence depends not just on its content but also on when it is published and in a subtle way on how the post relates to their users’ interests. As part of our approach, we also propose a simple and natural method to model and predict the efiectiveness of a post in gaining social in∞uence. The experimental results on the real-world dataset is consistent with our flndings. Our work provides a new method to analyze the social media from data mining view, which contrasts with a number of theories from marketing and sociology.
