Session fixation is a technique for obtaining the visitor's session identifier (SID) by forcing the visitor to use the SID supplied by the attacker. The attacker who obtains the victim's SID can masquerade as the visitor. In this paper, we propose a technique to automatically detect session fixation vulnerabilities in web applications. Our technique uses attack simulator that executes a real session fixation attack and check whether it is successful or not. In the experiment, our system successfully detected vulnerabilities in our original test cases and in a real world web application.
