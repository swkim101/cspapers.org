Publication Time (P-time for short) of Web pages is often required in many application areas. In this paper, we address the issue of P-time detection and its application for page rank. We first propose an approach to extract P-time for a page with explicit P-time displayed on its body. We then present a method to infer P-time for a page without P-time. We further introduce a temporal sensitive page rank model using P-time. Experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform the baseline methods significantly.
