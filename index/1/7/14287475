In this paper we report on a series of experiments designed to investigate query modification techniques motivated by the area of abductive reasoning. In particular we use the notion of abductive explanation, explanations being a description of data that highlight important features of the data. We describe several methods of creating abductive explanations, exploring term reweighting and query reformulation techniques and demonstrate their suitability for relevance feedback.
