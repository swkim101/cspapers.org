Global Computing is a particular modality of Grid Computing targeting massive parallelism, Internet computing and cycle-stealing. This new computing infrastructure has been shown to be exposed to a new type of attacks, where authentication is not relevant, network security techniques are not sufficient, and result-checking algorithms may be unavailable. The behavior of a Global Computing System, which is likely to be bimodal, nevertheless offers an opportunity for a probabilistic verification process that is efficient in the most frequent cases, and degrades gracefully as the problem becomes more difficult. For the two cases of a system based on anonymous volunteers, and a better controlled system, we propose probabilistic tests which self-adapt to the behavior of the computing entities.
