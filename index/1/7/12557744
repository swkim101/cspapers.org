Kamp's Discourse Representation Theory is a major breakthrough regarding the systematic translation of natural language discourse into logical form. We have therefore chosen to marry the User Specialty Languages System, which was originally designed as a natural language frontend to a relational database system, with this new theory. In the paper we try to show taking - for the sake of simplicity - Kamp's fragment of English how this is achieved. The research reported is going on in the context of the project Linguistics and Logic Based Legal Expert System undertaken jointly by the IBM Heidelberg Scientific Center and the Universitat Tubingen.
