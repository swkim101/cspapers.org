Existing graph partitioning approaches are mainly based on optimizing edge cuts and do not take the distribution of edge weights (link distribution) into consideration. In this paper, we propose a general model to partition graphs based on link distributions. This model formulates graph partitioning under a certain distribution assumption as approximating the graph affinity matrix under the corresponding distortion measure. Under this model, we derive a novel graph partitioning algorithm to approximate a graph affinity matrix under various Bregman divergences, which correspond to a large exponential family of distributions. We also establish the connections between edge cut objectives and the proposed model to provide a unified view to graph partitioning.
