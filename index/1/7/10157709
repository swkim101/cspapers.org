As more and more RDF data becomes available, such as DBpedia, Yago and Freebase, it is desired to provide users with simple interfaces to access the datasets. Although the SPARQL query language is a standard way to query RDF data, it remains tedious and difficult even for expert users because of the formality of the language and the complexity of the underlying schema of RDF data. An ideal system should allow users to express queries in their own languages. In this work, we propose a methodology to translate natural language questions into SPARQL queries, which can be answered by existing RDF engines and fulfill users? information need.
