Toward to realizing a novel drug delivery system, a simulation system is considered to be important for a future analysis of it. In this paper, a novel, miniature, and energy-efficient bio-mimetic propulsion concept was proposed. The antibody binding technique is developed and used to attach bacteria to liposome's surface for enhancing liposome mobility. Bacteria and liposome are strongly combined through antibody. Consequently, the effect of antibody when bacteria attached to liposome is studied experimentally. The stochastic nature of bacterial propulsion of liposome is investigated experimentally and analytically. It is shown that antibody plays an important role in attaching bacteria to liposome and the liposome with bacteria moved broader compared to the liposome without bacteria. Statistical calculation matches well with experimental data.
