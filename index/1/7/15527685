We introduce an unsupervised process to co-cluster groups of stocks and financial ratios, so that investors can gain more insight on how they are correlated. Our idea for the co-clustering is based on a graph concept called maximal quasi-bicliques, which can tolerate erroneous or/and missing information that are common in the stock and financial ratio data. Compared to previous works, our maximal quasi-bicliques require the errors to be evenly distributed, which enable us to capture more meaningful co-clusters. We develop a new algorithm that can efficiently enumerate maximal quasi-bicliques from an undirected graph. The concept of maximal quasi-bicliques is domain-independent; it can be extended to perform co-clustering on any set of data that are modeled by graphs.
