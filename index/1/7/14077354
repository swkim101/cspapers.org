Describing XML Namespaces is an open issue for many users of XML technologies, and even though namespaces are one of the foundations of XML, there is no generally accepted and widely used format for namespace descriptions. We present a framework for describing namespaces based on GRDDL using a controlled vocabulary. Using this frame-work, namespace descriptions can be easily generated, har-vested and published in human- or machine-readable form.
