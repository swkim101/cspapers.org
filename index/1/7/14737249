We propose a product specification database which is suited to product evolution, modeling the product specification as an object. In this database, we propose a behavioral constraint to maintain consistency. Furthermore, this database can manage visual specification, such as operational specification, which is hard to handle in an ordinary database. We have been developing Visual CASE: an object-oriented software development system for home appliances. Visual CASE is a visual prototyping system based on the object model we propose. In this paper, we show that the product specification is easy to examine, using visual prototyping. We also discuss implementation issues of the database applied to the home appliance software development process.
