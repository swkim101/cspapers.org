This work focuses on how to compute trajectories for an autonomous wheelchair based on indoor GIS maps, in particular on IndoorGML maps, which set the standard in this context. Good wheelchair trajectories are safe and comfortable for the user and the people sharing the space with him, turn gently, are high legible, and smooth (at least G2 continuos). We derive a navigation graph from a given IndoorGML map. We define and solve an optimization problem to find the desired path: given a succession of cells to traverse, the path corresponds to the best composite BeÃÅzier trajectory for the wheelchair. We discuss a related multi-objective path planning problem. Experimental results and an implementation on real robots show the planner performance.
