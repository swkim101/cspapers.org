The design of generalized data translators, particularly in the area of data base translation, has been the subject of much research in recent years. The practical application of this research has been limited and conducted primarily at the university level. This article outlines the research and development of a prototype generalized file translator by Honeywell.The Honeywell file translator is driven by descriptions of the input file, the output file and the file transformation to take place. These descriptions are provided using a straight-forward, data definition language (FDDL), which can easily be used by an applications programmer accustomed to working with a high level language. Techniques are discussed that attack many problems fundamental to a practical implementation of a generalized file translator. These problems include creating a DDL environment with which the user is familiar, and which includes simple data attribute descriptions; providing adequate performance; and supplying error detection and control at translation time.
