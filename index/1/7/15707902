Approximately 200 errors were detected during the formal in-house validation of a real time communications system that provides for ship-to-shore communications via both conventional and satellite links. A cost equation was developed to assess the utilization of expenditures associated with validation. The components of this equation reflected the costs that are typically expended during validation, such as reporting, analysis, remediation, retesting, and general managerial over-head. The results of a parametric analysis of the cost equation with respect to error cause and system impact indicated a significant under utilization of resources expended for validation.
