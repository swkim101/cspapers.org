We consider the problem of scheduling jobs on unrelated machines so as to minimize the sum of weighted completion times. Our main result is a (3/2-c)-approximation algorithm for some fixed c>0, improving upon the long-standing bound of 3/2. To do this, we first introduce a new lift-and-project based SDP relaxation for the problem. This is necessary as the previous convex programming relaxations have an integrality gap of 3/2. Second, we give a new general bipartite-rounding procedure that produces an assignment with certain strong negative correlation properties.
