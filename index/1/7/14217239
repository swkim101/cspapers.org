We introduce a natural new family of scheduling problems, which allow us to better model data dependencies which occur between program instructions that occur on a synchronous parallel architecture. We look at the problem of finding an optimal schedule, when concurrency and weak precedence constraints, as well as the classical partial order constraints are all allowed among tasks. We prove that the problem of scheduling with both prerequisites and corequisites, and the problem of scheduling with just < constraints, are both NP-Complete for k z 3 parallel processors. We get linear time and NC algc)rithms for optimally scheduling with any subset of{<, <, =} constraints for k = 2, and obtain approximation algorithms for k ~ 3 processors. Our results apply to a problem that arises in practice on the Horizon architecture, and for which we obtain an NP-Completeness result and an approximation algorithm.
