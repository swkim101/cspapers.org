Relevance feedback is a powerful technique to enhance Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) performance. It solicits the user's relevance judgments on the retrieved images returned by the CBIR systems. The user's labeling is then used to learn a classifier to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant images. However, the top returnedimages may not be the most informative ones. The challenge is thus to determine which unlabeled images would be the most informative (i.e., improve the classifier the most) if they were labeled and used as training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm, called Laplacian Optimal Design (LOD), for relevance feedback image retrieval. Our algorithm is based on aregression model which minimizes the least square error on the measured (or, labeled) images and simultaneously preserves the local geometrical structure of the image space. Specifically, we assume that if two images are sufficiently close to each other, then their measurements (or, labels) are close as well. By constructing a nearest neighbor graph, the geometrical structure of the image space can be described by the graph Laplacian. We discuss how results from the field of optimal experimental design may be used to guide our selection of a subset of images, which gives us the most amount of information. Experimental results on Corel database suggest that theproposed approach achieves higher precision in relevance feedback image retrieval.
