Currently, multimedia documents can be accessed at anytime and anywhere with a wide variety of mobile devices, e.g., laptops, smartphones, tablets. Obviously, platforms heterogeneity, user's preferences and context variations require documents adaptation according to execution constraints, e.g., audio contents may not be played while a user is participating at a meeting. Current context modeling languages do not handle such a real life user constraints. They generally list multiple information values that are interpreted by adaptation processes in order to deduce implicitly such high-level constraints. This paper overcomes this limitation by proposing a novel context modeling approach based on services where context information are linked according to explicit high-level constraints. In order to validate our proposal, we have used Semantic Web technologies by specifying RDF profiles and experiment their usage on several platforms.
