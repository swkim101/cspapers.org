In situated dialogue humans often utter linguistic expressions that refer to extralinguistic entities in the environment. Correctly resolving these references is critical yet challenging for artificial agents partly due to their limited speech recognition and language understanding capabilities. Motivated by psycholinguistic studies demonstrating a tight link between language production and human eye gaze, we have developed approaches that integrate naturally occurring human eye gaze with speech recognition hypotheses to resolve exophoric references in situated dialogue in a virtual world. In addition to incorporating eye gaze with the best recognized spoken hypothesis, we developed an algorithm to also handle multiple hypotheses modeled as word confusion networks. Our empirical results demonstrate that incorporating eye gaze with recognition hypotheses consistently outperforms the results obtained from processing recognition hypotheses alone. Incorporating eye gaze with word confusion networks further improves performance.
