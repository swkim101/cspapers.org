COPPER (CustOmizable Puzzle Programming EnviRonment) is a meta-configurable tool for creating coding puzzles on a grid using a blocks-based programming language, similar to puzzles in Code.org's Hour of Code. COPPER has the potential to increase student interest and engagement by allowing a teacher to customize levels for individual classes or students. Teachers can create characters for specialized puzzles by uploading pictures to customize their appearance and using the block-language to design the character's behavior. They can then place these characters onto a grid, and arrange them into a puzzle for their students to solve. A teacher can specify the goal of each coding puzzle, as well as restrict which blocks a student may use, allowing a teacher to gradually introduce programming concepts. For example, an elementary school teacher could highlight concepts from a history lesson by building a customized grid where characters from a historical context navigate around objects relevant to the topic being studied. COPPER uses Google's Blockly framework to eliminate the mental overhead of memorizing textual syntax, allowing students to focus on building computational thinking skills. Block-based languages have been shown to be more effective than text-based languages when teaching programming to first-learners. Combined with customization, COPPER has the potential to lead to higher student interest and comprehension of programming concepts in a customized context. This poster will also summarize results obtained through initial experimentation through collaboration with K-8 teachers and their students.
