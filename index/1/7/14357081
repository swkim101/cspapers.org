The effectiveness of software quality techniques varies. Many uncertain or unpredictable factors influence effectiveness, including human factors, the types of defects in the program, and luck. Compared to using a single quality technique, a diversified portfolio of techniques will typically be more effective and less variable. This work postulates a simple model, adapted from financial Modern Portfolio Theory, for the variability and effectiveness of techniques, singly and in portfolios. Proofs and simulations analyze the model to evaluate factors influencing the success of diversification; the model is checked against data sets from previous work.
