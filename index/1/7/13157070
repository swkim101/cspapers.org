We examine applications of clustering to the ﬁltering task. We use the on-line version of the star algorithm [JPR98, JPR99] as the clustering tool because this algo-rithm computes, with high precision, naturally occuring topics in a collection and it admits an eﬃcient on-line so-lution for dynamic corpora. We describe several ﬁltering algorithms and show extensive experimental results using the TREC collection.
