This study presents the high-precision microinjection of fluorescent micro-gel beads into Caenorhabditis elegans trapped in a suction microchannel. In our previous works, we demonstrated survival microinjection by a conventional micromanipulation technique. However, the focal planes differed between the tip of the microinjection tool and the target axon inside the C. elegans body. To resolve this problem, we here propose a suction microchannel that traps C. elegans during the microinjection operation. The focal plane of the target nerve axon matches that of the fluorescent microbead in the microinjection tool, enabling high-precision microinjection into the interior of the C. elegans body under a microscopic view. In an experimental evaluation, the positioning accuracy of the injection into C. elegans was within the target accuracy (15 Î¼m). The head-flrst navigation alignment of C. elegans along the microchannel was controlled by electrotaxis. Injection of the fluorescent micro-gel bead into the C. elegans body was quantitatively confirmed by confocal microscopy.
