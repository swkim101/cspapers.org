Competency In Computer Instruction In Illinois Public Schools.
 Very few states have developed certification requirements for public school teachers of digital computing. Therefore it is not surprising that elementary and secondary school teachers have received limited computer training. This paper describes a series of workshops to be offered at Western Illinois University during 1979 leading to a “certificate of competency” for Illinois public school teachers. These workshops are designed to provide teachers and administrators with an introduction to the computing field. Topics will include computer literacy, instructional applications and techniques of digital computing, and teaching strategies and methods used in the instruction of computing within the public school environment.
