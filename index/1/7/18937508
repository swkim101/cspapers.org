One of the first applications of satellite telecommunication systems being studied within the NADIR pilot project is high speed (several Mbits/s) file transfer. After a short description of the French “TELECOM 1” satellite communication system, the paper points out that usual protocols such as HDLC cannot be simply adapted to fit satellite transmission requirements (high bandwidth, long propagation delay and various error rates). Specific problems, such as choice of frame length, error correction procedure, numbering scheme, and flow control mechanism are discussed, and a set of feasible solutions to be experimented are proposed.
