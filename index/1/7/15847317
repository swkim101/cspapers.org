The scheduling of sporadic task systems upon multiprocessor platforms is considered, when inter-processor migration is permitted. It is known that current schedulability tests for such systems perform quite poorly when compared to schedulability tests for partitioned scheduling. Limitations of current tests are identified, which may be responsible for the unsatisfactory performance of these tests. A new test that overcomes some of these limitations is proposed and proved correct.
