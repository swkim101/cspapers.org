In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the relationship between an individual’s personal traits and his/her brand preferences. In our analysis, we included a large number of character traits such as personality, personal values and individual needs. These trait features were obtained from both a psychometric survey and automated social media analytics. We also included an extensive set of brand names from diverse product categories. From this analysis, we want to shed some light on (1) whether it is possible to use personal traits to infer an individual’s brand preferences (2) whether the trait features automatically inferred from social media are good proxies for the ground truth character traits in brand preference prediction.
