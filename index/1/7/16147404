Relevance feedback has been shown to improve retrieval for a broad range of retrieval models. It is the most common way of adapting a retrieval model for a specific query. In this work, we expand this common way by focusing on an approach that enables us to do query-specific modification of a retrieval model for learning-to-rank problems. Our approach is based on using feedback documents in two ways: 1) to improve the retrieval model directly and 2) to identify a subset of training queries that are more predictive than others. Experiments with the Gov2 collection show that this approach can obtain statistically significant improvements over two baselines; learning-to-rank (SVM-rank) with no feedback and learning-to-rank with standard relevance feedback.
