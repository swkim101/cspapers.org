This paper presents an efficient implementation of linearised lattice minimum Bayes-risk decoding using weighted finite state transducers. We introduce transducers to efficiently count lattice paths containing n-grams and use these to gather the required statistics. We show that these procedures can be implemented exactly through simple transformations of word sequences to sequences of n-grams. This yields a novel implementation of lattice minimum Bayes-risk decoding which is fast and exact even for very large lattices.
