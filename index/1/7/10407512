Microcomputers are beginning to invade the lives of non-professionals. In the near future most people will be using them for entertainment and education both at home and in school. Undoubtedly many of them will soon discover that one of the main attractions of computers is the programming of them. This development is going to occur sooner if the programming environment is appropriate for non-professional users. In order for this to be a positive development from the point of view of professionals the environment must satisfy appropriately defined specifications. This presentation attempts to outline some of the basic desirable features of the non-professional user's environment. It then shows the implications of this specification for one of the essential components of these environments, the definition, translation, and run-time implementation of the preferred programming language. It is postulated that if the environment is defined to “optimally” reflect user's needs and professional's insights it will be accepted by the general public.
