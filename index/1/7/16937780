The wheelchair-mounted robotic arm (WMRA) is a mobile manipulator that consists of a 7-DoF robotic arm and a 2-DoF power wheelchair platform. Previous works combined mobility and manipulation control using weighted optimization for dual-trajectory tracking [7]. In this work, we present an image-based visual servoing (IBVS) approach with scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) using an eye-in-hand monocular camera for combined control of mobility and manipulation for the 9-DoF WMRA system to execute activities of daily living (ADL) autonomously. We also present results of the physical implementation with a simple “Go to and Pick Up” task and the “Go to and Open the Door” task previously published in simulation, using IBVS to aid the task performance.
