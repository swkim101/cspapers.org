In this paper we attempt to tighten the connections between classical mathematics, automata theory, and the theory of programming languages. Formal linguistic objects corresponding to programs are defined via sets of functional equations; two interpretations of such an object are given, one in classical mathematics, and one in terms of an abstract machine that executes the program. Within this framework we examine flow charts, recursion, parameterization, and declaration.
