We present an algorithm which is expected to realise Bayes optimal predictions in large feed-forward networks. It is based on mean field methods developed within statistical mechanics of disordered systems. We give a derivation for the single layer perceptron and show that the algorithm also provides a leave-one-out cross-validation test of the predictions. Simulations show excellent agreement with theoretical results of statistical mechanics.
