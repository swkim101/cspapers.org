We give efficient quantum algorithms for the problems of <sc>Hidden Translation</sc> and <sc>Hidden Subgroup</sc> in a large class of non-abelian groups including solvable groups of constant exponent and of constant length derived series. Our algorithms are recursive. For the base case, we solve efficiently <sc>Hidden Translation</sc> in Z <inf>p</inf><sup>n</sup>, whenever <i>p</i> is a fixed prime. For the induction step, we introduce the problem <sc>Orbit Coset</sc> generalizing both <sc>Hidden Translation</sc> and <sc>Hidden Subgroup</sc>, and prove a powerful self-reducibility result: <sc>Orbit Coset</sc> in a finite group <i>G</i> is reducible to <sc>Orbit Coset</sc> in <i>G/N</i> and subgroups of <i>N</i>, for any solvable normal subgroup <i>N</i> of <i>G</i>.
