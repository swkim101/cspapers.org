Traditional curricular structures can be fragmented in the sense that course inter-relationships or links between theories, methodologies, and practices, are not immediately recognized by the students. The completion of the course puzzle and the integration of course knowledge usually become evident only after graduation. In this paper, we describe a course/lab implementation that has offered students a unique opportunity to experience the full spectrum of course elements, namely, fundamentals of theory, algorithmic design, hardware design and simulation, and implementation and testing on programmable logic devices all within a single framework. The course/lab design has been a collaborative effort between the Dept. of Electrical Engr. (EE) at the University of New Orleans (UNO) and the Dept. of Math and Computer Science (CS) at Barry University (BU). This has helped ensure that the course/ lab offerings can be implemented successfully in diverse environments.
