A project has been undertaken this past year using a cognitive based approach to implement the Computing I and II courses as defined in Implementation D of Computing Curricula 1991. The salient features of this project include: (i) strategic sequencing and associated levels of mastery of key topics based on Bloom levels; (ii) a spiral approach to presentation; (iii) integral use of structured closed labs; (iv) frequent feedback and (v) early use of teams. This project has led to a series of course documents that explicitly define and schedule course micro-objectives, that map each micro-objective to a specific Bloom knowledge level, and that help to achieve and measure those objectives.
