This article presents the work towards a purely generic navigation solution for wheeled mobile robots motivated by the following goals: Generic: Works for different types of robots. Configurable: Parameters maps to geometric properties of the robot. Predictable: Well defined where the robot will drive. Safe: Avoid fatal collisions. Based on a survey of existing methods and algorithms the article presents a generic way to represent constraints for different types of robots, a generic way to represent trajectories using BeÌˆzier curves, a method to convert the trajectory so it can be driven in a smooth motion, a method to create a safe velocity profile for the robot, and a path following controller.
