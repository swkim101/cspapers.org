In this paper two problems arising in the digital passive scheme for telemanipulation presented in are addressed. At first, we show how to preserve system passivity in presence of quantization error introduced by position sensor (i.e. encoders) by introducing energy dissipation. Then, we introduce a scheme for a redundant communication channel that will compensate for missed packets improving performances while preserving passivity of the overall scheme.
