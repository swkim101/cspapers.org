Pattern matching and data abstraction are important concepts in designing programs, but they do not fit well together. Pattern matching depends on making public a free data type representation, while data abstraction depends on hiding the representation. This paper proposes the views mechanism as a means of reconciling this conflict. A view allows any type to be viewed as a free data type, thus combining the clarity of pattern matching with the efficiency of data abstraction.
