This article addresses the issues of colour classification and collision detection as they occur in the legged league robot soccer environment of RoboCup. We show how the method of one-class classification with support vector machines (SVMs) can be applied to solve these tasks satisfactorily using the limited hardware capacity of the prescribed Sony AIBO quadruped robots. The experimental evaluation shows an improvement over our previous methods of ellipse fitting for colour classification and the statistical approach used for collision detection.
