Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks (WSNs) consist of randomly and densely deployed nodes which self-organize to cooperatively maintain multi-hop network connectivity [1]. The nodes act as both environmental sensors and network routers. The ability to set up distributed sensor networks inexpensively, in large-scale, quickly, and without fixed infrastructure makes them a promising candidate for a host of applications, including military surveillance and disaster relief.
