We developed an optical high-speed image rotation controller and realized a high-speed roll camera that is able to cancel the rotational motion blur of a rotating target. This system is composed of a hollow motor, a Dove prism, and a high-speed camera and controls optical image rotation according to the target rotation by using high-speed image processing. This so-called optical lever formed of the Dove prism worked effectively also for a high-speed rotating target, and our prototype system shows that rotational motion blur was suppressed to 0.125 [Â°] at 1420 [r/min].
