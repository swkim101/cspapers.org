Most tele-operation to manipulate an object consists of grasping and manipulation, and two or more 6-DOF haptic devices are usually used in master side. In this article, a new simply designed 7-DOF haptic device, PATHOS II is proposed for 1-DOF grasping and 6-DOF manipulation. The merits of a parallel type haptic device such as high stiffness and accuracy are natural characteristics of PATHOS-II with optimized workspace. Due to its unique symmetric structure, the isotropic manipulability is enhanced within the reachable workspace. This parallel type haptic device can be used in applications which need high precision, stiffness and isotropic manipulability.
