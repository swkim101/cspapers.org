Due to increased adoption of digital inclusion in various businesses, location based services are gaining importance to provide value-added services for their customers. In this work, we present a computer vision based system for tracking customer locations by recognizing individual shopping carts inside shopping malls in order to facilitate location based services. We provide an efficient approach for cart recognition that consists of two stages: cart detection and then cart recognition. A binary pattern is placed between two pre-defined color markers and attached to each cart for recognition. The system takes live video feed as input from the cameras mounted on the aisles of the shopping mall and processes frames in real-time. In the cart detection stage, color segmentation, feature extraction and classification are used for detection of binary pattern along with color markers. In recognition stage, segmented binary strip is processed using spatial image processing techniques to decode the cart identification number.
