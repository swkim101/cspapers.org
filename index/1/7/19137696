Face sketches synthesized by conventional methods usually exhibit coarse structures of faces, whereas fine details are lost especially on some critical facial components. In this paper, by imitating the coarse-to-fine drawing process of artists, we propose a novel face sketch synthesis framework consisting of a coarse stage and a fine stage. In the coarse stage, a mapping relationship between face photos and sketches is learned via the convolutional neural network. It ensures that the synthesized sketches keep coarse structures of faces. Given the test photo and the coarse synthesized sketch, a probabilistic graphic model is designed to synthesize the delicate face sketch which has fine and critical details. Experimental results on public face sketch databases illustrate that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both quantitive and visual comparisons.
