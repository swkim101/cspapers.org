In games research, Go is considered the classical board game that is most resistant to current AI techniques. Large-scale knowledge engineering has been considered indispensable for building state of the art programs, even for subproblems such as Life and Death, or tsume-Go. This paper describes the technologies behind TSUMEGO EXPLORER, a high-performance tsume-Go search engine for enclosed problems. In empirical testing. this engine outperforms GoTools. which has been the undisputedly best tsume-Go program for 15 years.
