This paper proposes a fair electronic gambling scheme for the Internet. The proposed scheme provides a unique link between payment and gambling outcome so that the winner can be ensured to get the payment. Since an optimal fair exchange method is used in gambling message exchange the proposed system guarantees that no one can successfully cheat during a gambling process. Our system requires an off-line Trusted Third Party (TTP). If a cheating occurs, the TTP can resolve the problem and make the gambling process fair.
