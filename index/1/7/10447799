This paper presents an end-to-end, low-cost solution for visualizing time-varying volume data rendered on a parallel computer located at a remote site. Pipelining and careful grouping of processors are used to hide I/O time and to maximize processors utilization. Compression is used to significantly cut down the cost of transferring output images from the parallel computer to a display device through a widearea network. This complete rendering pipeline makes possible highly efficient rendering and remote viewing of high resolution time-varying data sets in the absence of high-speed network and parallel I/O support. To study the performance of this rendering pipeline and to demonstrate high-performance remote visualization, tests were conducted on a PC cluster in Japan as well as an SGI Origin 2000 operated at the NASA Ames Research Center with the display located at UC Davis.
