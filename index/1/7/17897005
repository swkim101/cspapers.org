We propose IPAC(Interactive aPproach to Access Control for semi-structured data), a framework for XML access constraint specification and security view selection. IPAC clearly demarcates access constraint specification, access control strategy and security mechanism (implementation). It features a declarative access constraint specification language, a global access control strategy configuration unit, and an automatic security view generation and ranking tool. IPAC is the first system that assists the DBA in specifying access control strategies and access constraints on XML data, and helps the DBA in choosing the optimal plan that implements the specified strategy and access constraints accurately and efficiently.
