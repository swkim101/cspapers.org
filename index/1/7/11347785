We are developing a computerized desk which we have named InteractiveDESK [1]. One of the major features of the InteractiveDESK is reality awareness; that is, the ability to respond to situational changes in the real world in order to reduce usersâ€™ workloads. In this paper, we present a new method, as an example of the reality awareness, to retrieve electronic documents with real objects such as paper documents or folders. Users of the InteractiveDESK can retrieve electronic documents by just showing real objects which have links to the electronic documents. The links are made by the users through interactions with the InteractiveDESK. The advantage of this method is that the user can unify the arrangement of electronic documents into the arrangement of real objects.
