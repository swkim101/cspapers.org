We discuss the direct relevance of on-going testing research to the 'users' of the research, namely the industrial practitioners. The current state-of-the-practice in software testing is quite ad-hoc and provides little or no assertions about the quality of the delivered software product. We propose the view that research that is aligned with formal approaches to software development is the best bet to achieve this goal.
