In this paper, we discuss the directions of active and passive force closures in hybrid active/passive-closure grasps. We show the directions are orthogonal to each other. We also discuss the magnitudes of the internal forces in the manipulation of the object. In hybrid active/passive-closure grasps, there exist two kinds of magnitudes of internal forces. One is the magnitude of internal forces, which changes if the object moves and the geometry of the fingers changes. The other is the one which don't change even when the object moves. We derive these two magnitudes.
