In this paper, we propose an Energy based Fall Prediction (EFP) which observes the real-time balance status of a humanoid robot during standing. The EFP provides an analytic and quantitative measure of the level of balance. Both simulation and experimental studies were conducted and compared with the previously proposed indicators, such as Capture Point (CP) and Foot Rotation Indicator (FRI). The EFP also suggests the balance augmentation by active foot tilting to create larger potential barriers. As a proof of concept, a hybrid balance controller was designed to stabilize the robot including under-actuation phases so the robot can also balance with shoes. Our study reveals that both EFP and CP successfully predict falling about 0.2s in advance for the tested robot, while the FRI fails due to the light weight of the foot and limited resolution of the force/torque measurement.
