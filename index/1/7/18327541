Traffic video surveillance applications are increasingly implemented by networks of embedded smart cameras. These smart cameras provide on-board real-time video analysis and streaming. This work presents a light-weight middleware for a heterogeneous multi-processor smart camera platform comprising a network processor and several DSPs. It supports dynamic reconfiguration by changing and rearranging algorithms at runtime. The middleware employs a publisher-subscriber-based architecture for task communication. It's the aim of this work to provide efficient communication by imposing minimum overhead on the DSPs. Experimental analysis shows the efficiency of the approach.
