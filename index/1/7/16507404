What started off as an enrichment assignment for a third grader has developed into a rich source of programming assignments. The long integers, needed to determine whether a number eventually becomes a palindrome under the process of reversal and addition, can be described as an abstract data type and implemented as a C++ class. There are intriguing open questions which call for great creativity and efficiency in terms of data structures. Even graphics have been employed to illuminate the problem. The next step is probably parallel processing.
