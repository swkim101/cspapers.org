A central development in the database area concerns tools that allow non expert users to understand and easily extract information from a database. Fourth generation query languages, although non-procedural, are not friendly enough for a casual user who must know both the logical structure of the database and the syntax and semantics of the DBMS query language. Instead, recently proposed visual systems which allow a user to extract information by means of interactive graphical commands, have not yet been able to combine ease of use and high expressive power.
