The design and development of user interfaces to interactive computer systems has suffered from the inability of designers to easily express their design concepts in concrete, comprehensive, and comprehensible working models. An effort is underway to improve the process of man-machine dialogue design and implementation by developing prototyping and simulation tools to be used as an integral part of the specification and design process. These include an interactive display building utility and a syntax-driven interactive dialogue controller.
