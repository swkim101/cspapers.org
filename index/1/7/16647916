This paper presents the data model and basic features of a data base management system including text as a data type family and document as a data base concept used to describe texts. A document is composed of a written text associated whith data needed in order to manipulate it within an organisation. Texts are described with a tree structure and parameters permitting to adapt them to a wide number of applications. Besides the usual facilities of DBMSs this system includes the production of formatted texts, mailing procedures and information retrieval based on keywords contained in the text. A prototype of the system has been developed as an extension of the DBMS SOCRATE on a Solar 16/65 minicomputer. A final goal of this research is the design and implementation of a generalized DBMS integrating concepts from classical data bases and office systems.This paper presents a research project accomplished in cooperation with the SEMS, ECA-Automation and DAP companies on one hand, and the IMAG laboratory on the other. It was financed by the SEMS contract no.511/81.1.1 and by the Agence de l'Informatique contract no.81/206.
