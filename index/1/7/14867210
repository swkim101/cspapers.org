Modern mobile devices have become an important part of our daily life but the performance of multimedia applications still suffers from the constrained energy supply and communication bandwidth of the mobile devices. In this work, we develop an energy-efficient streaming system for mobile hotspots to achieve better Quality-of-Experience. Our main idea is (a) to avoid redundant 3G transmissions as well as reduce the usage of 3G links for those low residual-energy users, and (b) to enable nearby mobile users cooperatively to share the downloaded data via short-range interfaces. The experiment results shows our scheme can improve the system lifetime by 27%, and provide better throughput as well as lower loss rate than conversional 3G systems do.
