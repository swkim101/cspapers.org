This paper describes a method to verify safety properties of parameterized linear networks of processes. The method is based on the construction of a network invariant, defined as a fixpoint. Such invariants can often be automatically computed using heuristics based on Cousot's widening techniques. These techniques have been implemented and some non-trivial examples are presented.
