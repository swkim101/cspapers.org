Query-oriented relevance, information richness and novelty are important requirements in query-focused summarization, which, to a considerable extent, determine the summary quality. Previous work either rarely took into account all above demands simultaneously or dealt with part of them in the dynamic process of choosing sentences to generate a summary. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates all these requirements skillfully by treating them as sentence features, making that the finally generated summary could fully reflect the combinational effect of these properties. Experimental results on the DUC2005 and DUC2006 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
