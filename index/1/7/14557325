Evaluation-oriented information provision is a function performed by many systems that serve as personal assistants, advisors, or sales assistants. Five general tasks are distinguished which need to be addressed by such systems. For each task, techniques employed in a sample of systems are discussed, and it is shown how the lessons learned from these systems can be taken into account with a set of unified techniques that make use of well-understood concepts and principles from Multi-Attribute Utility Theory and Bayesian networks. These techniques are illustrated as realized in the dialog system PRACMA.
