A new golf swing robot performing high-speed golf swings has been developed by the authors. This paper deals with the motion planning problem of the golf swing. At first, the reverse time symmetry and single pendulum inherences in manipulator dynamics are introduced. Then, by utilizing the first inherence, the Rest-to-Point motion planning problem for the backswing and downswing is transformed into a reverse time symmetric Point-to-Rest motion planning problem. Finally, based on the second inherence, a Proportional plus Gravity and Coupling Torque Compensation (PGCTC) control scheme is developed to solve both the reverse time symmetric Point-to-Rest motion planning problem for the backswing and downswing and the forward time Point-to-Rest problem for the follow-through. Simulation shows the effect of the proposed method.
