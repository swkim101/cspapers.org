In the New Product Development processes, there are usually multiple players interacting through coupled design activities with conflicting design objectives. We use Set-based des ign approach and Constraint Satisfaction Problem solving techniques to deal with the multiplayer, multi-objective design problem. In ord e to observe the states of the players during the design process, we dev lop satisfaction and progress indicators and combine them into a wel lbeing indicator. In this paper we simulate different player behavior s n a two-player, multi-objective engineering design problem of a hol low cylindrical cantilever beam. During the simulation cases, at ea ch simulation iteration automatic players are prioritized regardi ng their wellbeing states for proposing constraints in order to find a set of consistent solutions that improve their satisfaction states. T herefore during the simulation process, while solution space converges to a single solution, epistemic uncertainty is reduced and play ersâ€™ satisfaction states are improved in wellbeing equilibrium.
