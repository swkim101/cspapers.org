Specifically, almost all existing recommendation algorithms only exploit rating scores in order to find users' preference, but ignore the review texts accompanied with rating information. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization model (called TopicMF) which simultaneously considers the ratings and accompanied review texts. Experimental results on 22 real-world datasets show the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness for recommendation tasks.
