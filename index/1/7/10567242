New approaches to system development depend heavily on graphical methods for representation of system requirements and the depiction of final design configuration. Among various diagramming methods, Data Flow Diagrams, Entity-Relationship diagrams and Structure Charts have received the most attention.
An automated diagramming tool is created and is made available to students. This tool requires minimum hardware and does not require the use of licensed software to operate. It therefore can be made accessible to many students at different schools.
