The problem of fault detection and test generation for programmable logic arrays (PLAs) is investigated. The effect of actual physical failures is viewed in terms of the logical changes of the product terms (growth, shrinkage, appearance and disappearance) constituting the PLA. Methods to generate a minimal single fault detection test set (T /sub S/) from the product term specification of the PLA, are presented. It is shown that such a test set can be derived using a set of simple, easily implementable algorithms. Methods to augment Ts in order to obtain a multiple fault detection test set (T /sub M/) are also presented.
