This paper deals with a detection approach that tries to solve major problems of traffic flow by combining a higher order modeling tool and the principal components analysis. This modeling system is applied to the data preprocessing level. The PCA is introduced for fault detection by comparing the method of SPE and Hotteling T2. For fault isolation, calculating contributions enables identify faulty variables.
