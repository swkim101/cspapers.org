An analysis is provided for Java programs that reverse engineers parameterized types into existing Java code. This analysis propagates precise type information about the contents of container objects. As an application, the analysis can be used to justify the safe removal of downcasts that are guaranteed to succeed. Another application is in automatically reverse engineering parameterized types into existing Java libraries, so that they can be used in Java dialects with parameterized types.
