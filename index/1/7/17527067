So far, mathematical models used in urban planning were descriptive or predictive. It is the purpose of this paper to describe a planning model, Joe. a model whose purpose is to produce a plan rather than to predict the consequences of a given plan. It produces a land use plan as well as a transportation plan and takes into account the interactions between land use and transportation.
 In part I, I take the transportation network for given and formalize the land use planning problem as a quadratic assignment problem as formulated by Koopmans and Beckmann (ref. 4). I describe the principles for a branch and bound algorithm yielding an exact optimal solution, first stated by Lawler (ref. 5). This algorithm has been progranmned and computational efficiency is examined here.
 In part II, I present the problem of optimizing jointly land use and transportation. The formalization chosen is an extension of the quadratic assignment problem. Principles for a branch and bound algorithm are statedï¾° This algorithm has been progranmned and its efficiency is examined.
 In part III, heuristic techniques for solving the joint problem are examined briefly.
