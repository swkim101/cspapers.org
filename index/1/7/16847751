In this paper, we describe a graphical workflow management system called HyperThesis to address the challenges of integrating bioinformatics applications. HyperThesis is an integral component of the Genomics Research Network Architecture (gRNA). The gRNA was designed and developed to address the challenges of developing new bioinformatics applications. Specifically, HyperThesis makes constructing workflows (pipelines of execution of applications) in the gRNA fast and intuitive for biologists and bio-programmers alike. It provides a large repository of interconnectable, parameterized workflow components for processing and relating diverse biological data and software programs. It also enables us to add new workflow components as new algorithms develop in ones area of interest. HyperThesis has been fully implemented using Java.
