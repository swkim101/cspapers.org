Current designs of battery-powered uninterruptible power supplies only provide power for a short time, and offer few control options. We combined a compact synchronous generator with a battery with 10% of the capacity of a UPS of the same rating to produce an uninterruptible generator supply (UGS). The controller of this UGS runs FreeRTOS, which enables it to respond quickly to a power outage. A wifi module provides connectivity to a web server for real-time monitoring and management on a remote PC or cellphone.
