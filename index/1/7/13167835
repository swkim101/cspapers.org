We present results from two methods of solving the gravitational N-body problem on ASCI Red. The first method, a trivial O(N^2) algorithm, obtained 635 Gflops for a 1 million particle problem on 6800 Pentium Pro processors. The second method, a treecode which scales as O(N log N), sustained 170 Gflops over a continuous 9.4 hour period on 4096 processors and 430 Gflops on 6800 processors during the initial part of the simulation. We also present two simulations which sustained roughly one Gigaflop on each of two 16 processor Beowulf-class computers constructed entirely from commodity personal computer technology for $50k each in September, 1996.
