We consider the problem of embedding knowledge graphs (KGs) into continuous vector spaces. Existing methods can only deal with explicit relationships within each triple, i.e., local connectivity patterns, but cannot handle implicit relationships across different triples, i.e., contextual connectivity patterns. This paper proposes context-dependent KG embedding, a twostage scheme that takes into account both types of connectivity patterns and obtains more accurate embeddings. We evaluate our approach on the tasks of link prediction and triple classification, and achieve significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
