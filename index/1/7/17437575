The Norden Division of United Aircraft Corporation has had an active and extensive design automation program for the past 2 1/2 years. We are trying to apply the same thought and effort to development of man-machine systems for performing our engineering work more efficiently that we normally apply to development of radars, display systems, navigation systems, and other complex electronic equipment. Emphasis throughout our design automation program has been placed on development of user-oriented systems in which computer assistance is made conveniently available to engineers in the context of their own problems. These users do not have to become programmers to learn and use the systems we develop.
 Since most of our business is in development of electronic equipment, a large part of our design automation effort has been directed toward improved methods for synthesis, analysis, layout, and packaging of electronic circuits. Our early start, rapid progress, and demonstrated capability attracted outside recognition and support in two important areas.
