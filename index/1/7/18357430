Data flow analysis is a technique essential to the compile-time optimization of computer programs, wherein facts relevant to program optimizations are discovered by the global propagation of facts obvious locally.This paper extends flow analysis techniques developed for sequential programs to the analysis of communicating, concurrent processes.
