Improving branch prediction accuracy is essential in enabling high-performance processors to find more concurrency and to improve energy efficiency by reducing wrong path instruction execution, a paramount concern in today's power-constrained computing landscape. Branch prediction traditionally considers past branch outcomes as a linear, continuous bit stream through which it searches for patterns and correlations. The state-of-the-art TAGE predictor and its variants follow this approach while varying the length of the global history fragments they consider. This work identifies a construct, inherent to several applications that challenges existing, linear history based branch prediction strategies. It finds that applications have branches that exhibit multi-dimensional correlations. These are branches with the following two attributes: 1) they are enclosed within nested loops, and 2) they exhibit correlation across iterations of the outer loops. Folding the branch history and interpreting it as a multidimensional piece of information, exposes these cross-iteration correlations allowing predictors to search for more complex correlations in the history space with lower cost. We present wormhole, a new side-predictor that exploits these multidimensional histories. Wormhole is integrated alongside ISL-TAGE and leverages information from its existing side-predictors. Experiments show that the wormhole predictor improves accuracy more than existing side-predictors, some of which are commercially available, with a similar hardware cost. Considering 40 diverse application traces, the wormhole predictor reduces MPKI by an average of 2.53% and 3.15% on top of 4KB and 32KB ISL-TAGE predictors respectively. When considering the top four workloads that exhibit multi-dimensional history correlations, Wormhole achieves 22% and 20% MPKI average reductions over 4KB and 32KB ISL-TAGE.
