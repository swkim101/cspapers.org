The BBC is currently tagging programmes manually, using DBpedia as a source of tag identifiers, and a list of suggested tags extracted from the programme synopsis. These tags are then used to help navigation and topic-based search of programmes on the BBC website. However, given the very large number of programmes available in the archive, most of them having very little metadata attached to them, we need a way to automatically assign tags to programmes. We describe a framework to do so, using speech recognition, text processing and concept tagging techniques. We describe how this framework was successfully applied to a very large BBC radio archive. We demonstrate an application using automatically extracted tags to aid discovery of archive content.
