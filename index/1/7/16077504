In this paper, a lightweight central pattern generator(CPG) model is designed for a snake-like robot, to achieve smooth transition of body shape and locomotion speed. First, based on the convergence behavior of the gradient system, a lightweight CPG model with fast computing time is designed and compared with other widely adopted CPG models. Then, the body shape and locomotion speed transitions in rolling gait are simulated based on the proposed CPG model. Compared with the sinusoid-based method, a smooth transition process can be achieved, without generating undesired movement or abnormal torque. Finally, extensive prototype experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the CPG-based control can effectively ensure smooth transition process and avoid abnormal torque, when the body shape and locomotion speed are changed.
