In this paper, we study on the reliability of search engine users using click-through data. We proposed a graph-based approach to evaluate user reliability according to how users click on search result lists. We tried to incorporate this measure of reliability into relevance feedback for improving ranking performances. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is both effective and applicable.
