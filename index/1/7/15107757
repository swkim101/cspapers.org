The database and sensor network community have both recognized the utility of SQL for interfacing with sensor network systems. Recently there have been proposals to construct Internet protocols declaratively in variants of Datalog. We take these ideas to their logical extreme, and demonstrate entire distributed sensor network systems built declaratively. Our demo exposes the rapidity, flexibility, and efficiency of our approach by building several fully-functional yet widely-varying sensor network applications and services declaratively. As a result of our declarative construction, we are able to highlight a wealth of previously underexposed similarities between sensor networks and database concepts. In addition, we tackle many database systems challenges in building multiple layers of a declarative database for an embedded, distributed system.
