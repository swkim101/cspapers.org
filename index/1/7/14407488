Economic transactions often rely on trust. For instance, sellers usually know more than buyers about items or services offered and could misrepresent them. Without trust, mutually beneficial transactions may not take place, resulting in economic loss [4]. Fortunately, with repeated transactions, reputations [9] can encourage truthful behavior and have been applied to e-commerce in the form of ratings, such as those used by eBay. However, reputation mechanisms can be manipulated through collusion by groups of friends or the creation of false identities. One approach to this problem uses the growing availability of online social networks. These consist of links among individuals indicating various social relationships. Services building online social networks, such as Friendster, LinkedIn, and Spoke, have rapidly acquired millions of users and assist them in forming new social or business contacts through those they already have. These existing contacts are either entered manually or gathered automatically, e.g., from email, instant messaging, and the web of trust for decentralized cryptographic keys [6]. We consider two uses of social networks for reputation mechanisms: as an automated aid to identify reputation based on position in the network, and as a filtering tool for users’ ratings. The thresholds and weights we describe can be efficiently computed using the network structure. The first approach uses an individual’s position in a social network to compute an implicit reputation [14, 12, 3], without requiring explicit effort on the part of users to rate one another. This approach is useful to the extent that social connectivity correlates with likely behavior. One way to assign reputation based on social network structure considers each link in the network as an implicit
