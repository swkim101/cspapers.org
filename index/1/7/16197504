We apply the theory of Tishby, Levin, and Solla (TLS) to two problems. First we analyze an elementary problem for which we find the predictions consistent with conventional statistical results. Second we numerically examine the more realistic problem of training a competitive net to learn a probability density from samples. We find TLS useful for predicting average training behavior.
