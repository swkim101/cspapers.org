Performance modelling of data base management systems, and in particular data base models capable of describing representation features in secondary storage, are discussed. Data structures relevant for secondary storage representations are defined, and a partial characterization of several actual systems is given. The accent is on the use of these structures in the context of a simulation model. We sketch the operation of a generalized modelling program in terms of these structures. Data description and system mechanisms required to generate attribute values are treated. The problem of "appropriate values" is discussed in the context of two probabilistic models.
