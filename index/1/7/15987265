In the near future, we believe that we will need much more sophisticated answer-finding schemes in an object-oriented database in order to satisfy the needs of truly intelligent information system. In this paper, we introduce a method to apply the intensional query processing techniques of deductive databases to object-oriented databases. So, we can generate intensional answers to represent answer-set abstractly for a given query in object-oriented databases.
Our approach consists of four steps: rule generation, pre-resolution, resolution, and post-resolution. In rule generation, we generate a set of deductive rules based on an object-oriented database schema. In pre-resolution, rule transformation is done to get unique intensional literals and extended term-restricted rules. In resolution, we identify rules that are potentially relevant to a query. In post-resolution, we find relevant resolvents as candidates for intensional answers among potentially relevant resolvents. We also use the notion of potentially relevant resolvents and relevant resolvents to avoid generating certain meaningless intensional answers.
