Nonuniformity correction plays an important role in improving image quality of the infrared focal plane array. A self-adaptive nonuniformity correction algorithm for infrared images combined with two-point correction along the rim is proposed in this paper. With the help of perimeter blackbody in low and high temperature, two-point correction is executed initially to perimeter detectors. Then based on the scene information and shift between adjacent frames, a special algebraic algorithm is proposed to transport correction parameters from perimeter detectors to those interior un-corrected ones. In this way, the correction parameters of the whole field of view (FOV) are calculated. All calculations are algebraic, with a low computation load. This algorithm can realize adaptive two-point correction without covering the central FOV rapidly. It proves to get a satisfying correction effect after being tested by using real infrared images.
