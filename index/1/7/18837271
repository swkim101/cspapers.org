Digital text communication (DTC) has transformed the way people communicate. Static typographical cues like emoticons, punctuation, letter case, and word lengthening (ie. Hellooo?) are regularly employed to convey intonation and affect. However, DTC platforms like instant messaging still suffer from a lack of nonverbal communication cues. This paper introduces an Animated Text Instant Messenger (ATIM), which uses text animations to add another distinct layer of cues to existing plaintext. ATIM builds upon previous research by using kinetic typography in communication. This paper describes the design principles and features of ATIM and discusses how animated text can add more nuanced communication cues of intonation and body motion.
