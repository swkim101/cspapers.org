An <i>interval graph</i> for a set of intervals on a line consists of one vertex for each interval, and an edge for each pair of intersecting intervals. A <i>probe interval graph</i> is obtained from an interval graph by designating a subset <i>P</i> of vertices as <i>probes,</i> and removing the edges between pairs of vertices in the remaining set <i>N</i> of <i>non-probes.</i> We examine the problem of finding and representing possible layouts of the intervals, given a probe interval graph. We obtain an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> + <i>m</i> log <i>n</i>) bound, where <i>n</i> is the number of vertices and <i>m</i> is the number of edges. The problem is motivated by an application to molecular biology.
