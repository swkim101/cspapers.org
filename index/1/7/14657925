A wide variety of uses have been proposed for the spectrum of currently available microprocessor systems. Included in this set of applications is the use of microprocessors for implementing larger systems; here, the possibility of employing bit slice microprocessors for various parts of a multiple control unit SIMD processor is discussed. A brief summary of bit slice microprocessor architecture is given, followed by an outline of individual applications to various components such as control units and arithmetic/logic units of the SIMD processor.
