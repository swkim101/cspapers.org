This paper presents an improved force-free control method based on current, which can be applied to industrial articulated robotic arms with large mass and large friction torque for direct teaching. Three kinds of torques that influence direct teaching are analyzed, and thus a calibration method and a compensation model are proposed. The model has been demonstrated effective through experiments. Considering the issue of large inertia, some security strategies are proposed at last and also well testified.
