Visual search is a major challenge for low vision people. Conventional vision enhancements like magnification help low vision people see more details, but cannot indicate the location of a target in a visual search task. In this paper, we explore visual cues---a new approach to facilitate visual search tasks for low vision people. We focus on product search and present CueSee, an augmented reality application on a head-mounted display (HMD) that facilitates product search by recognizing the product automatically and using visual cues to direct the user's attention to the product. We designed five visual cues that users can combine to suit their visual condition. We evaluated the visual cues with 12 low vision participants and found that participants preferred using our cues to conventional enhancements for product search. We also found that CueSee outperformed participants' best-corrected vision in both time and accuracy.
