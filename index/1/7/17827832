The VisDB system developed at the University of Munich is a sophisticated tool for visualizing and analyzing large databases. The key idea of the VisDB system is to support the exploration of large databases by using the phenomenal abilities of the human vision system which is able to analyze visualizations of mid-size to large amounts of data very efficiently. The goal of the VisDB system is to provide visualizations of large portions of the database, allowing properties of the data and structure in the data to become perceptually apparent.
