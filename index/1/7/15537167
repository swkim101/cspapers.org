This paper presents an architecture called "multi-streaming SIMD" that enables one SIMD instruction to simultaneously manipulate multiple data streams. To efficiently and flexibly realize the proposed architecture, an operation cell is designed by fusing the logic gates and the storage cells together. The operation cells then are used to compose a register file with the ability of performing SIMD operations called "Multimedia Operation Storage Unit (MOSU)". Further, many MOSUs are used to compose a multi-streaming SIMD computing engine that can simultaneously manipulate multiple data streams and exploit the subword parallelisms of the elements in each data stream. This paper also designs three instruction modes (global, coupling, and isolated modes) for programmers to dynamically configure the multi-streaming SIMD computing engine at the instruction level to manipulate different amounts of data streams. Simulation results show that when the multi-streaming SIMD architecture has four 4-register MOSUs, it provides a factor of 3.3x to 5.5x performance improvement compared with Intel's MMX extensions on eleven multimedia kernels.
