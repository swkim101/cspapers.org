A new generation of innovative, highly visual children’s programming environments is under development. In this paper, we consider the instructional requirements for children learning to program in a visual environment. Based on our year-long experience using Apple Computer’s KidSim/Cocoa prototype [2] and the results of a year-end assessment, we conclude that the children failed to grasp many aspects of the program operation. The children readily mastered drawing and animating characters in imaginary worlds, but struggled to achieve more complex behaviors. Lack of explicit instruction on program functionality hindered these children in their attempts to create more sophisticated science programs. We explore the prospects for more effective instruction and suggest some guidelines for designing visual programming environments.
