One of the major design issues in wireless ATM is the support of inter‐switch handoff. An inter‐switch handoff occurs when a mobile terminal moves to a new base station connecting to a different switch. Recently, a two‐phase handoff protocol has been proposed to support inter‐switch handoff in wireless ATM networks. With the aim of shortening handoff delay while using the network resources efficiently, the two‐phase handoff protocol employs path extension for each inter‐switch handoff, followed by path optimization if necessary. To implement the two‐phase handoff protocol efficiently, we need to determine when to trigger path optimization. In this paper, we propose and analyze three path optimization schemes, namely: periodic, exponential, and Bernoulli, for the two‐phase handoff protocol. The design objective is to determine the time to invoke path optimization such that the average cost per connection is minimized. We develop a discrete time analytical model and a discrete‐event simulation model for comparing the performance of the three path optimization schemes. Results indicate that the Bernoulli path optimization scheme outperforms the other two schemes by providing a lower average cost per connection. The proposed models can also be adapted to analyze other path optimization schemes in general.
