Speech activated interface between human and autonomous/semi-autonomous systems requires accurate voice detection and recognition. In this area, pitch and end-point detection is of vital importance. This paper presents a new method for pitch detection based on the phase of the continuous wavelet transform. The advantage of the proposed technique is that it can serve not only as an accurate pitch detector, but also can offer an efficient solution to the end-point detection problem. Experimental results are provided for the detection of pitch periods and end points in a neural-network based voice enabled wheelchair system.
