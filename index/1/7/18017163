Query latency is an important performance measure of any search engines because it directly affects search users' satisfaction. The key challenge is how to efficiently retrieve top-K ranked results for a query. Current search engines process queries in either the conjunctive or disjunctive modes. However, there is still a large performance gap between these two modes since the conjunctive mode is more efficient with lower search accuracy while the disjunctive mode is more effective but requires more time to process the queries. In this paper, we propose a novel query evaluation method that aims to achieve a better balance between the efficiency and effectiveness of top-K query processing. The basic idea is to prioritize candidate documents based on the number of the matched query terms in the documents as well as the importance of the matched terms. We propose a simple priority function and then discuss how to implement the idea based on a decision tree. Experimental results over both Web and Twitter collections show that the proposed method is able to narrow the performance gap with the conjunctive and disjunctive modes when K is larger or the length of a query is longer. In particular, compared with one of the fastest existing query processing methods, the propose method can achieve a speedup of 2 with marginal loss in the retrieval effectiveness on the Web collection.
