The cost to generate pre-calculating diagnostics using the stuck (0,1) fault simulation is increasing with logic complexity. This paper describes a real-time diagnostic procedure that does not require fault simulation. This paper describes a Probe Diagnostic Algorithm for making real-time deterministic decisions that direct a single pin probe to as many probe nodes as are required to diagnose a defect to the lowest repairable or replaceable unit.
 These probe diagnostic criteria are applicable to other test systems, including multiple pin probe testers and manually positioned probes. This Diagnostic Probe Algorithm was designed to be fully automatic or manually interactive.
