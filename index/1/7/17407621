Conventional routing protocols and algorithms work most efficiently on sparsely connected networks. Network topologies today include multiaccess links which include hundreds of nodes, all of which are capable of direct communication with each other. Some of these multiaccess links have broadcasting ability. This paper presents protocols and algorithms for efficiently dealing with the characteristics of various types of multiaccess links, when they are included as links in a general topology net.
