Node localization is a challenging problem in wireless sensor networks, especially in the scenarios of tuning multiple transmit-powers. In this article, we utilized particle filter to infer static node position from the correlations between Radio Frequency (RF) received signal strength indication (RSSI) and distance under multiple power settings. The RSSI based stochastic measurement model was analyzed and followed by the particle filter design. The simulation results verified the performance of proposed algorithm for localization. The proposed method is contributive in terms of making advantages of multiple transmit power for localization.
