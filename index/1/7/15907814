This paper discusses the phenomenon of method specialization in object-oriented programming languages. A typed function calculus of objects and classes is presented, featuring method specialization when methods are added or redefined. The soundness of the typing rules (without subtyping) is suggested by a translation into a more traditional calculus with recursively-defined record types. However, semantic questions regarding the subtype relation on classes remain open.
