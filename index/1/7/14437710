A biomimetic mobile robot called “Shrewbot” has been built as part of a neuroethological study of the mammalian facial whisker sensory system. This platform has been used to further evaluate the problem space of whisker based tactile Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (tSLAM). Shrewbot uses a biomorphic 3-dimensional array of active whiskers and a model of action selection based on tactile sensory attention to explore a circular walled arena sparsely populated with simple geometric shapes. Datasets taken during this exploration have been used to parameterise an approach to localisation and mapping based on probabilistic occupancy grids. We present the results of this work and conclude that simultaneous localisation and mapping is possible given only noisy odometry and tactile information from a 3-dimensional array of active biomimetic whiskers and no prior information of features in the environment.
