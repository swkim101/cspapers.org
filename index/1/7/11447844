Aggressive technology scaling to 45 nm and below introduces serious reliability challenges to the design of microprocessors. Large SRAM structures used for caches are particularly sensitive to process variation due to their high density and organization. Designers typically over-provision caches with additional resources to overcome the hard-faults. However, static allocation and binding of redundant resources results in low utilization of the extra resources and ultimately limits the number of defects that can be tolerated. This work re-examines the design of process variation tolerant on-chip caches with the focus on flexibility and dynamic reconfigurability to allow a large number defects to be tolerated with modest hardware overhead. Our approach, ZerehCache, combines redundant data array elements with a permutation network for providing a higher degree of freedom on replacement. A graph coloring algorithm is used to configure the network and find the proper mapping of replacement elements. We perform an extensive design space exploration of both L1/L2 caches to identify several Pareto optimal ZerehCaches. For the yield analysis, a population of 1000 chips was studied at the 45 nm technology node; L1 designs with 16% and an L2 designs with 8% area overheads achieve yields of 99% and 96%, respectively.
