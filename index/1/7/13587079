We are building and testing a set of computer-based design tools for creating telephone operator services. Currently at NYNEX, operator services are created by a small team of skilled developers using a programming language called SCL (Service Creation Language).The tools we are developing are part of a domain-oriented design environment for operator services. This environment will empower people who are knowledgeable in the domain to create services directly rather than requiring the task to be delegated to SCL developers. Our approach toward achieving this is twofold: (1) understanding the language of the operator services domain, and (2) representing this language in a seeded design environment.
