This paper presents a problem-reduction 
approach to extractive multi-document 
summarization: we propose a reduction 
to the problem of scoring individual sentences 
with their ROUGE scores based on 
supervised learning. For the summarization, 
we solve an optimization problem 
where the ROUGE score of the selected 
summary sentences is maximized. To this 
end, we derive an approximation of the 
ROUGE-N score of a set of sentences, and 
define a principled discrete optimization 
problem for sentence selection. Mathematical 
and empirical evidence suggests 
that the sentence selection step is solved 
almost exactly, thus reducing the problem 
to the sentence scoring task. We perform 
a detailed experimental evaluation on two 
DUC datasets to demonstrate the validity 
of our approach.
