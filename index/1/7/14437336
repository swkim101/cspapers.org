The meaning of compound noun phrases can be approximated in the form of lexical interpretations extracted from text. The interpretations hint at the role that modifiers play relative to heads within the noun phrases. In a study examining the role of query sessions in explaining compound noun phrases, candidate interpretations of compound noun phrases are extracted from pairs of queries that belong to the same query session. Experimental results over multiple evaluation sets of noun phrases show a higher accuracy of the interpretations when extracted from query sessions rather than from individual queries.
