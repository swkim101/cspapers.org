Due to excellent dynamic properties and high precision, parallel manipulators are particularly suited for high-speed and high-accuracy object handling. For this reason, the design process of parallel manipulators is usually supposed to optimize the manipulators' dexterity or structural stiffness. Accordingly, this research intends to analyze the effects of changing actuator and frame-configurations regarding the handling performance of a class of translational 3-RPC-manipulators. Since the RPC-structure can be arranged with translational and/or rotational actuators, several different drive configurations are possible. Additionally, four different frame configurations can be identified, expanding the number of possible manipulators. In order to find an optimized actuator and frame configuration for a given task, this research approach systematically reduces the number of possible configurations by means of validity detection and kinetostatic performance analysis. Hence, it is shown that good performance can be achieved for all frame configurations by selecting a suitable actuator combination.
