3D web software visualization has always been expensive, special purpose, and hard to program. Most of the technologies used require large amounts of scripting, are not reliable on all platforms, are binary formats, or no longer maintained. We can make 3D software visualization of object-oriented programs cheap, portable, and easy by using X3D, which is a new open standard for web 3D graphics. In this film we show our X3D web software visualizations in action.
