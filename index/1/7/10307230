In this paper, we presented a new study for Web query entity disambiguation (QED), which is the task of disambiguating different candidate entities in a knowledge base given their mentions in a query. QED is particularly challenging because queries are often too short to provide rich contextual information that is required by traditional entity disambiguation methods. In this paper, we propose several methods to tackle the problem of QED. First, we explore the use of deep neural network (DNN) for capturing the character level textual information in queries. Our DNN approach maps queries and their candidate reference entities to feature vectors in a latent semantic space where the distance between a query and its correct reference entity is minimized. Second, we utilize the Web search result information of queries to help generate large amounts of weakly supervised training data for the DNN model. Third, we propose a two-stage training method to combine large-scale weakly supervised data with a small amount of human labeled data, which can significantly boost the performance of a DNN model. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in the experiments using large-scale real-world datasets.
