In this paper, we describe how we have improved the efficiency of a finite-element method for interconnect resistance extraction by introducingarticulation nodes in the finite-element mesh. The articulation nodes are found by detecting equipotential regions and lines in the interconnects. Without generating inaccuracies, these articulation nodes split the finite-element mesh into small pieces that can be solved independently. The method has been implemented in the layout-to-circuit extractor Space. All interconnect resistances of a circuit containing 63,000 transistors are extracted on an HP 9000/735 workstation in approximately 70 minutes.
