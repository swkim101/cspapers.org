Requirement engineering has been successfully applied to many superficial problems, but there has been little evidence of transfer to complex system construction. In this paper we present a new conceptual model which is for incomplete requirement descriptions. The model is especially designed for supporting the requirement specification and the analysis of open systems. An analysis of existing models and languages shows the main problem in requirement engineering: the harmony between a well-defined basic model and a convenient language. The new model REMOS combines the complex requirements of open systems with the basic characteristics of transaction-oriented systems. Transaction-oriented systems are fault-tolerant and offer security and privacy mechanisms. Such systems provide such excellent properties - why don't we already profit from it during requirement specification? The model REMOS and the applicative language RELOS take advantage of transaction properties. The idea REMOS is based on is the definition of scenarios and communicating subsystems. REMOS guides the users to making their requirements more clear, and RELOS offers a medium for requirement definition.
