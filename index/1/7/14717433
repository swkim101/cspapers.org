We present a hands-on approach to problem solving in the formal languages and automata theory course. Using the tool JFLAP, students can solve a wide range of problems that are tedious to solve using pencil and paper. In combination with the more traditional theory problems, students study a wider-range of problems on a topic. Thus, students explore the formal languages and automata concepts computationally and visually with JFLAP, and theoretically without JFLAP. In addition, we present a new feature in JFLAP, Turing machine building blocks. One can now build complex Turing machines by using other Turing machines as components or building blocks.
