Recently, there have been a number of algorithms proposed for analyzing hypertext link structure so as to determine the best “authorities” for a given topic or query. While such analysis is usually combined with content analysis, there is a sense in which some algorithms are deemed to be “more balanced” and others “more focused”. We undertake a comparative study of hypertext link analysis algorithms. Guided by some experimental queries, we propose some formal criteria for evaluating and comparing link analysis algorithms.
