Description logic reasoners are able to detect incoherences (such as logical inconsistency and concept unsatisfiability) in knowledge bases, but provide little support for resolving them. We propose to recast techniques for propositional inconsistency management into the description logic setting. We show that the additional structure afforded by description logic statements can be used to refine these techniques. Our focus in this paper is on the formal semantics for such techniques, although we do provide high-level decision procedures for the knowledge integration strategies discussed.
