In this paper, a system of computer programs for the geometric description of hot forgings is outlined. The system is known as the MODCON system which stands for MODular CONstruction. The MODCON system allows quite complex forging shapes to be produced from relatively few input instructions. The forging geometry is defined as a series of volumetric modules which are then merged together during generation of the N.C. tape necessary to machine the finishing-cut EDM electrode for the whole forging cavity. The system can also be used for the roughing cut of the EDM electrode before the finishing cut stage as well as for generating cross-sectional data which serves as input to subsequent preform design systems. The system represents a considerable saving in time and cost over current methods involving conventional pattern making for the copy milling of electrodes.
