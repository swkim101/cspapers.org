The GALILEO system implements novel mechanisms for automated ontology evolution in physics. These mechanisms, called ontology repair plans , resolve logical conﬂicts between several modular ontologies. To demonstrate that ontology evolution can be automated using ontology repair plans, we propose a ﬂexible architecture for the implementation. Support for inference of formulae that trigger repair plans and modularisation of ontologies are central to the design. Huet’s Zipper data structure is to be used to avoid encoding the object-level formalism with a deep embedding. For a high degree of modularity, the management of a collection of ontologies is handled by development graphs.
