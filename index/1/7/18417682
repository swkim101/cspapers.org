"People-nearby applications" (PNAs) are a form of ubiquitous computing that connect users based on their physical location data. One example is Grindr, a popular PNA that facilitates connections among gay and bisexual men. Adopting a uses and gratifications approach, we conducted two studies. In study one, 63 users reported motivations for Grindr use through open-ended descriptions. In study two, those descriptions were coded into 26 items that were completed by 525 Grindr users. Factor analysis revealed six uses and gratifications: social inclusion, sex, friendship, entertainment, romantic relationships, and location-based search. Two additional analyses examine (1) the effects of geographic location (e.g., urban vs. suburban/rural) on men's use of Grindr and (2) how Grindr use is related to self-disclosure of information. Results highlight how the mixed-mode nature of PNA technology may change the boundaries of online and offline space, and how gay and bisexual men navigate physical environments.
