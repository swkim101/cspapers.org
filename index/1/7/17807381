We describe how movement is handled in a class of computational devices called active production networks (APNs). The APN model is a parallel, activation-based framework that has been applied to other aspects of natural language processing. The model is briefly defined, the notation and mechanism for movement is explained, and then several examples are given which illustrate how various conditions on movement can naturally be explained in terms of limitations of the APN device.
