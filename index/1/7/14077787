This paper presents a complete case study - named ROSACE for Research Open-Source Avionics and Control Engineering - that goes from a baseline flight controller, developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK, to a multi-periodic controller executing on a multi/many-core target. The interactions between control and computer engineers are highlighted during the development steps, in particular by investigating several multi-periodic configurations. We deduced ways to improve the discussion between engineers in order to ease the integration on the target. The whole case study is made available to the community under an open-source license.
