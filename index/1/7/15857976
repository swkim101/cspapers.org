In this paper, we present the concept of Time Sequence Summarization to support chronology-dependent applications on massive data sources. Time sequence summarization takes as input a time sequence of events that are chronologically ordered. Each event is described by a set of descriptors. Time sequence summarization produces a concise time sequence that can be substituted for the original time sequence in chronology-dependent applications. We propose an algorithm that achieves time sequence summarization based on a generalization, grouping and concept formation process. Generalization expresses event descriptors at higher levels of abstraction using taxonomies while grouping gathers similar events. Concept formation is responsible for reducing the size of the input time sequence of events by representing each group created by one concept. The process is performed in a way such that the overall chronology of events is preserved. The algorithm computes the summary incrementally and has reduced algorithmic complexity. The resulting output is a concise representation, yet, informative enough to directly support chronology-dependent applications. We validate our approach by summarizing one year of financial news provided by Reuters.
