Recognition of non-verbal communication (NVC) is important for understanding human communication and designing user centric user interfaces. Cultural differences affect the expression and perception of NVC but no previous automatic system considers these cultural differences. Annotation data for the LILiR TwoTalk corpus, containing dyadic (two person) conversations, was gathered using Internet crowdsourcing, with a significant quantity collected from India, Kenya and the United Kingdom (UK). Many studies have investigated cultural differences based on human observations but this has not been addressed in the context of automatic emotion or NVC recognition. Perhaps not surprisingly, testing an automatic system on data that is not culturally representative of the training data is seen to result in low performance. We address this problem by training and testing our system on a specific culture to enable better modeling of the cultural differences in NVC perception. The system uses linear predictor tracking, with features generated based on distances between pairs of trackers. The annotations indicated the strength of the NVC which enables the use of v-SVR to perform the regression.
