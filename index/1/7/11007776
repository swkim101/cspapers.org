We present a flexible new optimization framework for finding effective, reliable pseudo-relevance feedback models that unifies existing complementary approaches in a principled way. The result is an algorithmic approach that not only brings together different benefits of previous methods, such as parameter self-tuning and risk reduction from term dependency modeling, but also allows a rich new space of model search strategies to be investigated. We compare the effectiveness of a unified algorithm to existing methods by examining iterative performance and risk-reward tradeoffs. We also discuss extensions for generating new algorithms within our framework.
