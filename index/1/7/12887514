This paper describes the design of a distributed information system for full text retrieval. The system is similar in functionality to STAIRS and is being developed on a network of PC's interconnected by PC Network. The implementation is built on a generalisation of the remote procedure call concept. Communications are based upon the recent CCITT X.400 standard. Examples are given of the design strategy for a subset of the STAIRS system.
