Quality data recorded in varied realistic environments is vital for effective human face related research. Currently available datasets for human facial expression analysis have been generated in highly controlled lab environments. We present a new static facial expression database Static Facial Expressions in the Wild (SFEW) extracted from a temporal facial expressions database Acted Facial Expressions in the Wild (AFEW) [9], which we have extracted from movies. In the past, many robust methods have been reported in the literature. However, these methods have been experimented on different databases or using different protocols within the same databases. The lack of a standard protocol makes it difficult to compare systems and acts as a hindrance in the progress of the field. Therefore, we propose a person independent training and testing protocol for expression recognition as part of the BEFIT workshop. Further, we compare our dataset with the JAFFE and Multi-PIE datasets and provide baseline results.
