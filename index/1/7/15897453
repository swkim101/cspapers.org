In recent years, the demand for rocket launching has increased due to the development of space technology. However, using inexpensive rockets is not always possible. Although the cost of solid-propellant rockets is relatively reasonable, safely manufacturing a large amount of solid propellant is difficult, and the manufacturing process is disjointed. Therefore, safe and continues manufacturing of solid propellant is necessary. On the basis of the movements of the intestinal tract, we realized that the movements required for transport and mixing of solid propellants are possible to achieve without the application of a large force. By mimicking these intestinal movements, we can safely and continuously manufacture a large amount of solid propellant. We developed a peristaltic pump, based on bowel peristalsis, using straight-fiber-type artificial muscle, and in this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of this pump for transporting the highly viscous fluids and solid-liquid mixed fluid. We consider that the peristaltic pump can also be effectively used as a mixing device. In this paper, we show that mixing one highly viscous fluid with another is possible by measuring the luminance values. In the manufacturing process, we use glass beads with the same diameter as microparticles and a sodium polyacrylate aqueous solution resembling a high viscosity fluid or hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene as the raw material in the solid propellant. We then measure the glass beads in the resulting solid-liquid mixed fluid.
