Text-Mining is a growing area of interest within the field of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery. Given a collection of text documents, most approaches to Text Mining perform knowledge-discovery operations either on external tags associated with each document, or on the set of all words within each document. Both approaches suffer from limitations. This paper focuses on an intermediate approach, one that we call text mining via information extraction, in which knowledge discovery takes place on focused, relevant terms, phrases and facts, as extracted from the documents.
