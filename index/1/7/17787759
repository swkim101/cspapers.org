This article presents the nonlinear dynamics and the posture stabilization control scheme for the single-wheeled pendulum robot (SWPR). Considering the maneuverability of SWPR, the steering is realized through the control for the inertia pendulum (IP) installed horizontally on the middle part of robot body. The feature of the control system modeling consists in a technique for which the posture stabilization control design is based on the parameterization of the dynamic interactions (DIT) between the lateral dynamics, the longitudinal dynamics, and the rotational dynamics. Simulation results showed the feasibility of the SWPR model and the control algorithm.
