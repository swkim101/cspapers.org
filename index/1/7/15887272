One of the greatest benefits provided by computer networks, in particular local area networks, is the ability to access files served by other computers in a network. Whereas file system concepts are first introduced in Operating Systems units, many file system concepts need to be readdressed and generalized in later Computer Networks units. Moreover, as students become increasingly familiar with internetworking and programs such as ftp, many of the strong links between the Operating Systems and Computer Networks units may be reinforced. This paper discusses the successes experienced with two strongly related projects offered in our third year Computer Networks unit. Each project requires students to support a minimal distributed file system by implementing user-level libraries which redefine a handful of operating system system calls supporting remote file access.
