Minimizing response times for mobile applications is critical for quality user experience that often impacts the revenue of mobile services. Generalized approaches to accelerated mobile applications (e.g., TCP acceleration, SPDY, compression) are less effective because they do not take account for application specific behaviors. In contrast, application specific approaches build application-specific proxies by leveraging the app-specific protocol behaviors to enable dynamic caching and/or prefetching. However, this is non-trivial because it requires manual analysis of application level protocols and their interactions. Therefore, only a small number of apps enjoyed the benefit. This paper addresses the problem of scaling the number of applications by automating the process. To this end, we present a framework for mobile application acceleration that leverages automatic protocol analysis to automatically discover opportunities for app acceleration. The framework automatically finds out when and where to prefetch or perform dynamic caching. We present the framework design and a preliminary result that demonstrates its viability.
