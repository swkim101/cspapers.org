Making computer science assignments interesting and relevant is a constant challenge for instructors of introductory courses. Android has become popular in these courses to take advantage of the increasing popularity of smartphones and mobile "apps." This has been shown to increase student engagement but it is only the first step, and we must continue to provide support for teaching methodologies that we have used in the past, such as test-driven development and automated assessment. We have developed RoboLIFT, a library that makes unit testing of Android applications approachable for students. Furthermore, by supporting existing automated grading techniques, we are able to sustain large student enrollments, and we evaluate the effects that using Android has had on student performance.
