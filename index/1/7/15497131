This paper provides the design of a low cost master controller for teleoperation systems. The system consists of a center handle and four off the shelf haptic devices. The control law of the four devices coordinates them to provide six degree-of-freedom(DOF) force feedback. The relative position and the dimension of the handle are designed to maximize the range of motion. The system actuation redundancy problem is formulated into a standard convex optimization problem and resolved. The squared sum of the force provided by all the haptic devices are defined as the optimization function and the desired force and torque feedback is used as the linear constraints. Experiments in teleoperation and haptics projects were carried out to verify the theoretical results about system.
