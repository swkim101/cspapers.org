This work presents the SIDnet, a simulation-based environment for applications development in wireless sensor networks settings. It enables run-time interactions with the network for the purpose of observing the behavior of algorithms protocols in the presence of various conditions such as phenomena fluctuations, or a sudden loss of service both at an individual node, as well as a collection of nodes.
