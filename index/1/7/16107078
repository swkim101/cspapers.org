We propose a distributed architecture for knowledge revisionintegration, where each element is conceived as a knowledgebased system able to exchange information with the others. since nodes can be affected by some degree of incompetence, part of the information running through the network may be incorrect and might cause contradictions in the knowledge base of some nodes. To manage these contradictions, each node is equipped with a belief revision module which makes it able to discriminate among more or less credible information and more or less reliable information sources. Our aim is that of comparing on a simulation basis the performances and the characteristics of this distributed system vs. those of a centralised architecture. We report here the fmt results of our experiments.
