This paper presents a system for capturing human movement and tactile data and methods for analyzing this data. We cannot fully capture the essence of motion without tactile information, and sometimes the lack of such information causes critical problems. To achieve a better understanding of motion behavior, we developed a wearable motion capture suit with full-body tactile sensors. We also developed a motion sensor which can estimate its orientation with its inner CPU. We also built a tactile sensor module which can fit many kinds of body shapes. With this system, we can measure a user's movement and tactile information simultaneously. By integrating tactile data with motion data, we can achieve many kinds of meaningful insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this system with experiments. We captured two motions: stretching after sitting on a chair and laying down on a bed. By recognizing the contact point from the tactile data and fitting it into the environment, we were able to estimate the motion trajectories.
