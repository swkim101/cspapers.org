Video security is one of multi-view video applications. However the current multi-view video coding (MVC) software does not contain any rate control technique, this paper proposes a rate control algorithm for MVC based on the quadratic rate-distortion (R-D) model. The proposed algorithm adopts the fluid-flow traffic model, HRD (hypothetical reference decoder) and linear prediction model of MAD (the mean absolute difference). Compared to the multi-view video coding with fixed quantization parameter, the proposed scheme can efficiently control the bit rate with an average rate control error of 0.62% while keeping high coding efficiency.
