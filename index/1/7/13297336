Virtual world simulators represent one of the latest and most successful frontiers of online entertainment. Among them, Second Life [5] is the tenth most popular Internetbased virtual world [2] in terms of subscribers with over 500,000 active users. A client program called the Second Life Viewer allows itâ€™s users (called residents) to interact with each other through mobile avatars. Inside the game, residents can socialize and participate in individual and group activities. The appearance of an avatar has a wide range of physical attributes. She may be customized to produce a variety of forms. Avatars may be completely invented, without any relation to the physical aspect of the human user, or can be made to resemble the human whom they represent. However, in the current system, there is still a divide between the virtual world and the real one. Specifically, a user may be able to recreate her appearance but she can not automatically mirror/translate her current actions and movements in her real life to the virtual life of her avatar. Our vision is to bridge the current divide between real worlds and virtual worlds, by having real world activities (e.g., sitting, walking, running, cooking) and other aspects of the human represented in real time in the virtual world [5]. Our aim is to go a step further than simply reproducing spaces (e.g., rooms, buildings, public spaces [6]) and the objects with which humans interact. We focus instead on the provision of the virtual representation of humans, their surroundings as sensed by the humans themselves, and interactions with the members of their social networks (e.g., fetched from external sources like Facebook [4]).
