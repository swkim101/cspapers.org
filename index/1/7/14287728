We present a study of the cluster hypothesis, and of the performance of cluster-based retrieval methods, performed over large scale Web collections. Among the findings we present are (i) the cluster hypothesis can hold, as determined by a specific test, for large scale Web corpora to the same extent it does for newswire corpora; (ii) while spam documents do not affect the extent to which the cluster hypothesis holds, they considerably affect the performance of cluster based, as well as that of document-based, retrieval methods; and, (iii) as is the case for newswire corpora, cluster-based methods can yield better performance than document-based methods for Web corpora.
