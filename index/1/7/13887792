Containers are general-purpose data structures that provide functionality for inserting, reading, removing, and iterating over elements. Since many applications written in modern programming languages, such as C++ and Java, use containers as standard building blocks, precise analysis of many programs requires a fairly sophisticated understanding of container contents. In this paper, we present a sound, precise, and fully automatic technique for static reasoning about contents of containers. We show that the proposed technique adds useful precision for verifying real C++ applications and that it scales to applications with over 100,000 lines of code.
