Collaborative filtering is a technique for recommending documents to users based on how similar their tastes are to other users. If two users tend to agree on what they like, the system will recommend the same documents to them. The generalized vector space model of information retrieval represents a document by a vector of its similarities to all other documents. The process of collaborative filtering is nearly identical to the process of retrieval using GVSM in a matrix of user ratings. Using this observation, a model for filtering collaboratively using document content is possible.
