We study the problem of constructing a sorting circuit, network, or PRAM algorithm that is tolerant to faults. For the most part, we focus on fault patterns that are random, e.g., where the result of each comparison is independently faulty with probability upperbounded by some constant. All previous fault-tolerant sorting circuits, networks, and parallel algorithms require R(log2 n) depth (time) and/or n(n log2 n) comparisons to sort n items. In this paper, we construct
