The production of consistently executable and dependable software demands a thoughtful systematic implementationâ€”with clear documentation at each production stage. Recognizing this, the Data Systems Laboratory, at Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA, began a research effort to help discover and institute sound engineering principles into a methodology for the production of software. The design of this methodology is based upon five principal stages of software development:
 1. Feasibility: Can software be written to solve the initial problem?
 2. Requirements/Design: Are software requirements and design clear, complete, traceable, and testable?
 3. Coding: Is use being made of reliable high level coding practices?
 4. Testing: Is testing sufficiently thorough to instill initial user confidence?
 5. Maintenance: has the software and its design been explicitly documented?
