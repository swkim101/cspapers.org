Scilab is a software which is quite rich in tools for the numerical approximation of control problems for ordinary differential equations (ODE's). On the contrary, it is less practical when dealing with partial differential equations (PDE's). In this work, we present some recent developments to (partly) fill this gap. These new tools be used to address problems related to the phenomenon of time-reversal, and in particular the problem of focusing acoustic time-harmonic waves in waveguides
