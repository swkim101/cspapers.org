The science of computer graphics is gaining undisputed momentum in the rapidly growing computer field. While it is true that automated drafting has had a measurable effect on design technology, particularly in the reduction of costs, one cannot classify it as automated design. Automated drafting simply permits the designer to automate the final phase of his work and to either increase the quantity, and possibly the quality, of the final output of drawings, or to give him more time for creative thinking. The automated design, however, involves not only the preparation of drawings, but actually organizes the designer's thoughts, the design constraints, the manufacturability, and the cost of implementing the design; it may consider other possible problems, such as stress, vibration, weight, temperature, material selection, etc.
 Shortly after the first successful flight of General Electric's Mark 2 re-entry vehicle, thoughts were given to at least partially automate the preliminary calculations of the basic design problems of determining the centers of gravity and pressure of the proposed re-entry vehicle shapes. The resulting computer program was, of course, rather rudimentary, but its usefulness prompted a continuing effort of development and improvment. Today, after several iterations, a sophisticated computer program exists which not only performs the preliminary re-entry vehicle design and its evaluation, but actually prepares the graphic layouts necessary to delineate the selected computer-produced vehicle design configurations.
