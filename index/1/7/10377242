In this work we tackle the problem of planning grasps for an underactuated gripper which enable it to retrieve target objects from a cluttered environment. Furthermore, we investigate how additional manipulation capabilities of the gripping device, provided by active surfaces on the inside of the fingers, can lead to performance improvement in the grasp execution process. To this end, we employ a simple strategy, in which the target object is `pulled-in' towards the palm during grasping which results in firm enveloping grasps. We show the effectiveness of the suggested methods by means of experiments conducted in a real-world scenario.
