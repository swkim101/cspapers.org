Proper representation of the meaning of texts is crucial to enhancing many data mining and information retrieval tasks, including clustering, computing semantic relatedness between texts, and searching. Representing of texts in the concept space derived from Wikipedia has received growing attention recently, due to its comprehensiveness and expertise, This concept-based representation is capable of extracting semantic relatedness between texts that cannot be deduced with the bag of words model. A key obstacle, however, for using Wikipedia as a semantic interpreter is that the sheer size of the concepts derived from Wikipedia makes it hard to efficiently map texts into concept-space. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm which is able to represent the meaning of a text by using the concepts that best match it. In particular, our approach first computes the approximate top-k concepts that are most relevant to the given text. We then leverage these concepts for representing the meaning of the given text. The experimental results show that the proposed technique provides significant gains in execution time over current solutions to the problem.
