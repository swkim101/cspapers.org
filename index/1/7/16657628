Our model is applied to assess semantic similarity between sentences, where we exceed state of the art, outperforming carefully handcrafted features and recently proposed neural network systems of greater complexity. For these applications, we provide word-embedding vectors supplemented with synonymic information to the LSTMs, which use a fixed size vector to encode the underlying meaning expressed in a sentence (irrespective of the particular wording/syntax). By restricting subsequent operations to rely on a simple Manhattan metric, we compel the sentence representations learned by our model to form a highly structured space whose geometry reflects complex semantic relationships. Our results are the latest in a line of findings that showcase LSTMs as powerful language models capable of tasks requiring intricate understanding.
