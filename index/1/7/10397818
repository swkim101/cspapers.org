We describe two systems ~hat use interactive computer-coutrolled video for shared awareness and casual communication. Polyscope lets users monitor a large number of video sources simultaneously. Observers are provided with a wiudow containing a collection of franle-grabbed bitmap images or animations. These images can be used to access additional video services, such as videophone. Vr-ooms is a follow-on system, which employs a strong spatial metaphor. Users can enter and leave virtual rooms. Once in a virtual room, users can see and be seen by all the other occupants, and have easy access to other video, audio, and text-based communication tools.
