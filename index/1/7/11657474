Classical Unconnected Set (UCS) and other iterative placement improvement algorithms may converge slowly toward desirable component arrangements. This paper discusses mechanisms that inhibit convergence, then proposes techniques for accelerating rate of improvement. A placer incorporating these procedures is described, and experimental results demonstrating effectiveness of the approach are given.
