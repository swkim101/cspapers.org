In this paper, we present a haptic teleoperation control algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicles, applying a kinetic scrolling-based position mapping. The proposed algorithm overcomes the master workspace limitations and enables to teleoperate the aerial vehicle in unbounded workspace in a fast and intuitive manner. Moreover, it provides high precision to teleoperation tasks. Simulation and experimental results validating the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are also presented.
