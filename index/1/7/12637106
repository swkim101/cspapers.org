We consider the problem of designing an automatic grader for a laboratory in the area of cyber-physical systems. The goal of this laboratory is to program a robot for specified navigation tasks. Given a candidate student solution (control program for the robot), our grader first checks whether the robot performs the task correctly under a representative set of environment conditions. If it does not, the grader automatically generates feedback hinting at possible errors in the program. The auto-grader is based on a novel notion of constrained parameterized tests based on signal temporal logic (STL) that capture symptoms pointing to success or causes of failure in traces obtained from a realistic simulator. We define and solve the problem of synthesizing constraints on a parameterized test such that it is consistent with a set of reference solutions with and without the desired symptom. The usefulness of our grader is demonstrated using a large data set obtained from an on-campus laboratory-based course at UC Berkeley.
