Two experiments were performed to determine the effects of friction and needle geometry during robotic needle insertion into soft tissues. In Experiment I, friction forces along the instrument axis were characterized during needle insertion into bovine liver under CT fluoroscopic imaging. Because the relative velocity of the tissue and needle affect viscous and Coulomb friction, the needle insertion process was segmented into several phases of relative motion: none, partial and complete. During the complete relative motion phase, it was found that Coulomb friction accounts for the majority of needle force. In Experiment II, insertion forces along and orthogonal to the needle axis were measured during insertion into a silicone rubber phantom with a consistency similar to liver. The effects of needle diameter and tip type (bevel, cone, and triangle) on insertion force were characterized. A bevel tip causes more needle bending and is more easily affected by tissue density variations. Forces for larger diameter needles are higher due to increased cutting and friction forces. These results may be used in the control of needle insertion for robot-assisted percutaneous therapies.
