We attempt in this paper to outline a method for the automatic construction of a knowledge base. We propose some methods and a domain knowledge model. A new idea is to conceive a system that is able to each phase of its construction to acquire domain knowledge from all new information that it is building, in particular the indexing terms; the last section is an attempt in this sense.
