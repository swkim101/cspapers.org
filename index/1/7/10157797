The growing use of ontologies in applications creates the need for an infrastructure that allows developers to more easily combine different software modules like ontology stores, editors, or inference engines towards comprehensive ontology-based solutions. We call such an infrastructure Ontology Software Environment. The papers discusses requirements and design issues of such an Ontology Software Environment. In particular, we present this discussion in light of the ontology and (meta)data standards that exist in the Semantic Web and present our corresponding implementation, the KAON SERVER.
