This BOF is a chance for information sharing among faculty interested in involving students in ICTD research and/or service learning toward cultural and economic development globally. It takes a lot to get students out into the field. Challenges include developing partnerships, negotiating agreements, vetting the safety of destinations, identifying sources of funding, navigating the logistics of immunizations, visas, accommodations and flights to less-traveled places, reassuring parents as to the wisdom of their child's participation, managing development partner expectations, advising students' activities, and many more. This BOF will provide a venue for sharing experiences, information, and identifying potential new collaborations.
