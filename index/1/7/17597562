Control flow relations in a high level language program can be represented by a hierarchy of small graphs that combines nesting relations among statements in an ALGOL-like syntax with relevant perturbations caused by goto or leave statements. Applications of the new style of representation include denotational semantics, data flow analysis, source level compiler diagnostics, and program proving.
