The analysis and use of visual information is a first order task for AI researchers. Due to the architecture of classical computers and to the computational complexity of state-of-the-art algorithms, it is required to find better ways to store, process and retrieve information for image processing. One plausible and exciting approach is Quantum Information Processing (QIP). In this poster we present an initial step towards the definition of an emerging field, Quantum Image Processing, by showing how to store an image using a quantum system as well as some of the unique properties of that storage process derived from quantum mechanics laws.
