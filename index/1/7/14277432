This paper develops an efficient new method for 3D partial shape retrieval. First, a Monte Carlo sampling strategy is employed to extract local shape signatures from each 3D model. After vector quantization, these features are represented by using a bag-of-words model. The main contributions of this paper are threefold as follows: 1) a partial shape dissimilarity measure is proposed to rank shapes according to their distances to the input query, without using any timeconsuming alignment procedure; 2) by applying the probabilistic text analysis technique, a highly compact representation "Shape Topics" and accompanying algorithms are developed for efficient 3D partial shape retrieval, the mapping from "Shape Topics" to "object categories" is established using multi-class SVMs; and 3) a method for evaluating the performance of partial shape retrieval is proposed and tested. To our best knowledge, very few existing methods are able to perform well online partial shape retrieval for large 3D shape repositories. Our experimental results are expected to validate the efficacy and effectiveness of our novel approach.
