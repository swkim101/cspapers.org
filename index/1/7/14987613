Recognizing an action from a sequence of 3D skeletal poses is a challenging task. First, different actors may perform the same action in various styles. Second, the estimated poses are sometimes inaccurate. These challenges can cause large variations between instances of the same class. Third, the datasets are usually small, with only a few actors performing few repetitions of each action. Hence training complex classifiers risks over-fitting the data. We address this task by mining a set of key-pose-motifs for each action class. A key-pose-motif contains a set of ordered poses, which are required to be close but not necessarily adjacent in the action sequences. The representation is robust to style variations. The key-pose-motifs are represented in terms of a dictionary using soft-quantization to deal with inaccuracies caused by quantization. We propose an efficient algorithm to mine key-pose-motifs taking into account of these probabilities. We classify a sequence by matching it to the motifs of each class and selecting the class that maximizes the matching score. This simple classifier obtains state-of the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.
