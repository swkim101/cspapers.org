Light color estimation is crucial to the color constancy problem. Past decades have witnessed great progress in solving this problem. Contrary to traditional methods, many researchers propose a variety of combinational color constancy methods through applying different color constancy mathematical models on an image simultaneously and then give out a final estimation in diverse ways. Although many comprehensive evaluations or reviews about color constancy methods are available, few focus on combinational strategies. In this paper, we survey some prevailing combinational strategies systematically; divide them into three categories and compare them qualitatively on three real-world image data sets in terms of the angular error and the perceptual Euclidean distance. The experimental results show that combinational strategies with training procedure always produces better performance.
