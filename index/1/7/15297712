FLOWWARE is an interactive, graphical language to aid in the understanding and design of digital networks. The language is based upon the concept of flow charting. The user specifies the register layout of the network and the sequential operation in the form of a flow chart on a graphics terminal. The flow chart allows a user who is unfamiliar with the network to easily understand the function and operation of the network.
