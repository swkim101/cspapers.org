A wearable sensor for measuring finger flexion force based on volar displacement of flexor tendon is presented. The proposed sensor utilizes a principle that the volar displacement of tendon under a pulley depends on both of tendon tension and finger posture when a external compressive force is applied on the pulley. A prototype sensor is built for the verification of the proposed method. Experiments with isometric conditions are performed in 9 different finger postures to observe the response of the sensor with regard to the finger flexion force and finger posture. The results show that the output of the proposed sensor has dependency on both of finger force and posture. This implies that the sensor can be used for measuring finger flexion force when the finger posture and the corresponding sensor response is known. A simulation with simplified model is performed to explain the behavior of the sensor output.
