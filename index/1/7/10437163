This paper presents a general grasp synthesis algorithm. The algorithm follows a stochastic approach that calculate a large number of grasps with good quality in short amount of time. It takes as an input a 3D point cloud that represents the contact points of the object and heuristically selects concurrent points which are covered by contact points and identifies concurrent grasps from such contact points. Empirical examples are performed to show that the proposed algorithm can generate a large number of good quality grasps comparing to other methods.
