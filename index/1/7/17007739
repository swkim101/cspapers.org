In this work, we propose a control scheme for attitude control of a falling, two link active tailed robot with only two degrees of freedom of actuation. We derive a simplified expression for the robot's angular momentum and invert this expression to solve for the shape velocities that drive the body's angular momentum to a desired value. By choosing a body angular velocity vector parallel to the axis of error rotation, the controller steers the robot towards its desired orientation. The proposed scheme is accomplished through feedback laws as opposed to feedforward trajectory generation, is fairly robust to model uncertainties, and is simple enough to implement on a miniature microcontroller. We verify our approach by implementing the controller on a small (175 g) robot platform, enabling rapid maneuvers approaching the spectacular capability of animals.
