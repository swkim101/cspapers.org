Continuous access control after an object is released into a distributed environment has been regarded as the usage control problem and has been investigated by different researchers in various papers. However, the enabling technology for usage control is a challenging problem and the space has not been fully explored yet. In this paper we identify the general requirements of a trusted usage control enforcement in heterogeneous computing environments, and also propose a general platform architecture to meet these requirements.
