Efficient and intuitive interfacing of the interventionalist to the information and tools available from image-guided robotic assisted surgeries is required to achieve the full benefit of these technologies. Ongoing research has been performed into the use of forbidden region guided fixtures (FRVF) for human-in-the-loop control of image-guided procedures via haptic force-feedback devices (FFD). Although commercially available FFD provide sufficient degrees-of-freedom (DoF), collaborating clinicians, as well as the results of our previous work indicate that these systems are not completely intuitive for controlling fixed-point access interventional tool which have a remote center of motion. Within this context, we introduce a new FFD which is designed with the same DoF constraints as a fixed-point access interventional tool. The device is tested in a clinical simulation of a robot assisted trans-apical valve implantation under guidance from real-time magnetic resonance imaging. Pre-acquired real-time images are used in the clinical simulation to dynamically update the FRVF and therefore provide guiding forces to allow the operator to see the safe boundaries of operation via a visualization interface and physically feel them through the FFD. Inertial and gravity compensation and per DoF dynamic response of the physical prototype are validated and the frequency response of the system demonstrates it is adequate for tactile sensing. During clinical simulation the operator was successfully able to maneuver the tool within the safe path to the region of interest with the guidance of visual and force-feedback.
