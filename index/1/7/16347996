The goal of a typical information retrieval system is to satisfy a user's information need---e.g., by providing an answer or information "nugget"---while the actual search space of a typical information retrieval system consists of documents---i.e., collections of nuggets. In this paper, we characterize this relationship between nuggets and documents and discuss applications to system evaluation. In particular, for the problem of test collection construction for IR system evaluation, we demonstrate a highly efficient algorithm for simultaneously obtaining both relevant documents and relevant information. Our technique exploits the mutually reinforcing relationship between relevant documents and relevant information, yielding document-based test collections whose efficiency and efficacy exceed those of typical Cranfield-style test collections, while also generating sets of highly relevant information.
