Formalizing and automating aspects of human plausible reasoning is an important challenge for the field of artificial intelligence. Practical advances, however, are hampered by the fact that most forms of plausible reasoning rely on background knowledge that is often not available in a structured form. In this paper, we first discuss how an important class of background knowledge can be induced from vector space representations that have been learned from (mostly) unstructured data. Subsequently, we advocate the use of qualitative abstractions of these vector spaces, as they are easier to obtain and manipulate, among others, while still supporting various forms of plausible reasoning.
