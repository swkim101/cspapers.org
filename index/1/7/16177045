Students are very interested in cutting-edge technologies like virtual reality (VR), and VR has many potential uses in education. However, building VR applications has proved challenging due to both cost and technical skill barriers. Through a series of experiments in "shoestring" VR, we have developed methods of bringing an important facet of VR, stereoscopic display, to our students in a simple, cost-effective way. This paper describes our approach.
