The discovering of frequent XML query patterns gains its focus due to its many applications in XML data management, and several algorithms have been proposed to discover frequent query patterns using the frequent structure mining techniques. In this paper we consider the problem of incremental mining of frequent XML query patterns. We propose a method to minimize the I/O and computation requirements for handling incremental updates.
