Proposing measurements in diagnosis systems for static systems is a well understood task. Usually, entropy based approaches are used, sometimes extended by cost and other considerations. How to do the same task in dynamic systems is less clear, and so far measurement proposal algorithms have been ignored in the recent approaches advanced for dynamic systems. In this paper we will describe a set of techniques and algorithms suitable for measurement proposal in a temporal diagnosis formalism discussed in our previous work. This formalism is based on qualitative Allen constraints. The current paper introduces a measurement proposal algorithm and improves it in several ways. Finally an entropy-based computation method is described for this temporal setting.
