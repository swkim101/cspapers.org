Classifying a visual concept merely from its associated online textual source, such as a Wikipedia article, is an attractive research topic in zero-shot learning because it alleviates the burden of manually collecting semantic attributes. Recent work has pursued this approach by exploring various ways of connecting the visual and text domains. In this paper, we revisit this idea by going further to consider one important factor: the textual representation is usually too noisy for the zero-shot learning application. This observation motivates us to design a simple yet effective zero-shot learning method that is capable of suppressing noise in the text. Specifically, we propose an l2,1-norm based objective function which can simultaneously suppress the noisy signal in the text and learn a function to match the text document and visual features. We also develop an optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting problem. By conducting experiments on two large datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms those competing methods which rely on online information sources but with no explicit noise suppression. Furthermore, we make an in-depth analysis of the proposed method and provide insight as to what kind of information in documents is useful for zero-shot learning.
