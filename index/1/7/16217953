We propose a privacy enhanced location verification system that uses in-region location verification to verify if a location claim is from within an area specified by a policy. The novelty of our work is the use of distance bounding protocols to construct a pseudo-rectangle (P-rectangle) that optimizes coverage of the policy area, and uses it to verify the claim with respect to the P-rectangle, thereby minimizing error. We propose a privacy enhancement for the system that ensures that the prover's location cannot be inferred by an adversary who monitors protocol messages. We discuss our results and propose directions for future research.
