Assertion-based design is becoming more widely used in industry. However, little has been done to take advantage of existing design assertions in the theorem-proving verification environments. In this paper, we present our work on development of the semi-automated theorem-proving based verification system ROVERIFIC that makes use of existing design assertions. We have defined generic predicate templates that capture the semantics of PSL, and a subset of Verilog. ROVERIFIC uses these templates, and automatically compiles a design under verification (Verilog) and its assertions (PSL) into the higher-order predicates of the PVS [11] theorem proving system. Design verification can be subsequently conducted by proving the correctness properties.
