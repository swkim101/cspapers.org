We investigate important differences between two styles of document clustering in the context of Topic Detection and Tracking. Converting a Topic Detection system into a Topic Tracking system exposes fundamental differences between these two tasks that are important to consider in both the design and the evaluation of TDT systems. We also identify features that can be used in systems for both tasks.
