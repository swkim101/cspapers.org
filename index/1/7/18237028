The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, a set of design goals for data base machines is defined, together with a partial order of importance. The main objective is chosen to be a machine capable of executing any relational operation in constant time. Second, architecture of a data base machine is described. Associative array processors are employed together with other means to achieve very high performance. The difficulties arising from the proposed design are considered, various alternatives and trade-offs are discussed, and the effects of future technology are predicted.
