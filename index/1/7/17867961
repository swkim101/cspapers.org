A television-based computer display system is described which uses a minicomputer to calculate scan lines of the display image. A display resolution of 512 lines by 512 positions is achieved with each position definable with 15 bits of color information (over 32,000 colors). The scan conversion process incorporates hidden surface removal, calculation of intersections, surface shading and, optionally, perspective. Object description must be by polygonal planar surfaces; the surfaces can have a solid color and are considered opaque. Object complexity is limited only by main storage size.The design criteria which motivated the system architecture are discussed along with pertinent details on the particular implementation. The system described effectively mates minicomputer technology with that of the television industry to produce an economical, fast turnaround, color display system for 2-D and 3-D computer graphics. This system relies upon a special scan-line generator and upon a skillful hardware/software trade-off to achieve an economical and realistic color display device.Performance data and examples of display objects are given.
