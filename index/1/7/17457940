It is argued that the data-base of a nation-wide organization will exhibit geographic locality of reference. That is, most of the transactions homing on a given component of the data base originate from a particular geographic region. At the same time there is a need to operate the collection of components as a single data base to provide for occasional transactions which cross regional boundaries, and for managerial queries and retrieval operations that span the entire data base. There are several examples of this associated with business and industry: credit and inventory records for exmple.
 Modest CPU power will suffice to perform most transaction processing on the data base. We are therefore led to consider a network of identical mini computers (or midis). Each host will execute an identical copy of the operating system in the network. The machines differ only in their complement of hardware (number of discs, primary storage size, etc.) and in the data they hold. Hence we assume that we are able to specify host hardware, host software and communications subnetwork as a single integrated system. The major goal of this work has been to investigate how far these freedoms can be exploited to yield simple elegant structures.
 The paper summarizes the design of the communication nucleus (4) of the network and focusses primarily on the design of the software to support transaction processing against the data base (3). Processor distribution is extended to include the ideas of a terminal host, a disc host, a central host and a communications device. The application of the proposed architecture to a typical commercial data processing problem is outlined.
