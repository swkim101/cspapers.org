The computer aided design (CAD) technique for LSI is an indispensable tool to develop LSI. Setting up a LSI CAD system with center on CAD database would make CAD technique more effectual. And a LSI CAD system for minicomputer has advantages of lower cost and convenient management. In this paper we are concerned with describing effective LSI CAD system - QCADS for minicomputer. The paper consists of four parts: (1) design objectives and strategy of the system, (2) framework of the system structure, (3) logical structure of database and (4) CAD description language.
