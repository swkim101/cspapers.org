Cloud computing has achieved great development both in academic and industry communities due to the fact that it relieves the burden of data storage and data management. However, data stored in the cloud may suffer from malicious use by cloud service providers. Therefore, exploring an efficient search technique for encrypted data is extremely urgent. This paper focuses on semantic search and preferred search schemes in cloud. We survey the existed schemes' advantage or disadvantage. At last, we give some open issues and research challenges in the future.
