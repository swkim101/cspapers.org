When fixing a bug, a programmer tends to search for similar bugs that have been resolved in the past. A fix for a similar bug may help him fix his bug or at least understand his bug. We designed and implemented the Bug Query Language (BQL) and its accompanying tools to help users search for similar bugs to aid debugging. This paper demonstrates the main features of the BQL infrastructure. We populated BQL with bugs collected from open-source projects and show that BQL could have helped users to fix real-world bugs.
