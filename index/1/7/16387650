Web sites and services, i.e. to customize sys-tem contents, characteristics, or appearance with respect toa speciﬁc user. Each system independently builds up userproﬁles and may then use this information to personalizethe system’s content and service offering. Such isolated ap-proaches have two major drawbacks: ﬁrstly, investments ofusers in personalizing a system either through explicit pro-vision of information or through long and regular use arenot transferable to other systems. Secondly, users have littleor no control over the information that deﬁnes their proﬁle,since user data are deeply buried in personalization enginesrunning on the server side.
