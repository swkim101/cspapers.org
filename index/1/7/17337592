We explore the design space of freehand pointing and clicking interaction with very large high resolution displays from a distance. Three techniques for gestural pointing and two for clicking are developed and evaluated. In addition, we present subtle auditory and visual feedback techniques to compensate for the lack of kinesthetic feedback in freehand interaction, and to promote learning and use of appropriate postures.
