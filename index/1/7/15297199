We present a method to acquire a realistic, visually convincing 3D model of indoor office environments based on a mobile robot that is equipped with a laser range scanner and a panoramic camera. The data of the 2D laser scans are used to solve the SLAM problem and to extract walls. Textures for walls and floor are built from the images of a calibrated panoramic camera. Multiresolution blending is used to hide seams in the generated textures.
