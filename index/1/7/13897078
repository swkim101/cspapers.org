Ten years ago, the term “object-oriented” was known by few people, and understood by even fewer. Today, it is impossible to avoid the term, it appears in nearly every book, journal and magazine which relates to computer so%vare, and yet, while they rush to embrace it, many computer professionals and educators still do not understand what object orientation means. This is unfortunate, as object orientation promises remarkable improvements in software quality. However, if we fail to make a successful shift to the “new” paradigm, its promise will remain unfhlfNed. There is ample evidence, in the literature and in the profession, to indicate that many people believe that objectoriented programming requires nothing more than a change of language, the acquisition of new syntax rules. By drawing on Kuhn’s work on scientific revolutions, the case is made for a true paradigm shift, which requires nothing less than a complete change of world view. Attention is then given to the integration of object orientation into the computer science curriculum.
