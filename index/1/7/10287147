Managing temporal data is becoming increasingly important for many applications. Several database systems already support the time dimension, but provide only few temporal operators, which also often exhibit poor performance characteristics. On the academic side, a large number of algorithms and data structures have been proposed, but they often address a subset of these temporal operators only. In this paper, we develop the Timeline Index as a novel, unified data structure that efficiently supports temporal operators such as temporal aggregation, time travel, and temporal joins. As the Timeline Index is independent of the physical order of the data, it provides flexibility in physical design; e.g., it supports any kind of compression scheme, which is crucial for main memory column stores. Our experiments show that the Timeline Index has predictable performance and beats state-of-the-art approaches significantly, sometimes by orders of magnitude.
