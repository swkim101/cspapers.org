This paper discusses the Dual Bus Protocol (DBP) developed for the Terrestrial Wideband Network (TWBNET), a high-speed trans-continental network that supports distributed real-time applications and protocol research. DBP is a descendant of the QPSX protocol proposed as the IEEE 802.6 Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) standard, with enhancements to create a protocol suitable for a wide area network and to provide network services such as reserved bandwidth. In addition, the protocol was designed to be scalable for use in networks that are larger and faster than the TWBNET. This paper describes the DBP and its network environment and provides an analysis of the performance of the protocol based on both simulations and TWBNET measurements.
