On December 1, 2000, forty years have passed since the first registered computer run was made in Turku, a city in the South-West corner of Finland. The computer, a Wegematic 1000 was donated by Axel Leonard Wenner-Gren, a Swedish businessman active in many areas. The donation letter from WennerGren Center, dated Jan 19, 1960 stated that the donation to the University of Turku and the Foundation for Ã…bo Akademi, comprising an automatic computer Wegematic 1000, was "for promoting research and teaching within applied mathematics and within this field strengthen the contacts between the universities and the business world".
