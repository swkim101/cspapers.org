Citation chaining is a powerful means of exploring the academic literature. Starting from just one or two known relevant items, a na√Øve researcher can cycle backwards and forwards through the citation graph to generate a rich overview of key works, authors and journals relating to their topic. Whilst online citation indexes greatly facilitate this process, the size and complexity of the search space can rapidly escalate. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction model called citation chain aggregation (CCA). CCA employs a simple three-list view which highlights the overlaps that occur between the first-generation relations of known relevant items. As more relevant articles are identified, differences in the frequencies of citations made by or to unseen articles provide strong relevance feedback cues. The benefits of this technique are illustrated using a simple case study.
