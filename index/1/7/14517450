This paper studies an attitude tracking control system of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) under the condition of large-angle rotational maneuvers. We first established the attitude error model, taking both external disturbances and internal uncertainties into account. Thereafter, a switching control strategy is proposed for both high tracking accuracy and velocity constraints. Experiments on attitude tracking validate higher control accuracy with proposed method. Tasks of flight at unknown initial attitude and flip are also presented to verify the effectiveness of this method under large-angle rotational maneuverability.
