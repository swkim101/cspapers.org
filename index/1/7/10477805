The discretionary ability implied in the notion of ownership is often provided in terms of groups rather than individuals. The group approach has its conveniences but is limiting since access decisions do not discriminate among members of a group. The ability for users to define group membership dynamically offers flexibility and convenience. In this paper we investigate a variety of polices for doing so in the context of a simplified file system. We specify the polices using the Schematic Protection Model (SPM). Our investigation reveals that there are many policy options and demonstrates how SPM is used to precisely specify these options.
