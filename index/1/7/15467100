Three-dimensional (3D) integration based on through-silicon-vias (TSVs) is rapidly gaining traction for industry adoption. However, manufacturing processes for TSVs have been shown to introduce new failure mechanisms. In particular, thermo-mechanical stress and electromigration introduce reliability threats for TSVs, e.g., voids and interfacial cracks, which can lead to hard-to-predict timing errors on critical paths with TSVs, thereby resulting in accelerated chip failure in the field. Burn-in for screening latent defects during manufacturing is expensive and its effectiveness for new TSV defect types has yet to be thoroughly characterized. We describe a reconfigurable in-field repair solution that is able to effectively tolerate latent TSV defects through the judicious use of spares. The proposed solution includes a reconfigurable repair architecture that enables spare TSV sharing between TSV grids, and the corresponding in-field repair algorithms. The effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed solution is evaluated using 3D benchmark designs.
