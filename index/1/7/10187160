We present a decentralized approach to multi- robot manipulation where the team of robots surround and trap an object and transport it, by dragging or pushing, to the goal configuration in an environment with obstacles. The proposed feedback controllers are obtained by sequentially composing vector fields or behaviors and are decentralized in the sense that robots do not exchange each other's state information. Rather, cooperative manipulation is achieved by relying solely on each robot's local information and a global knowledge of the task. We present computer simulations and experimental results obtained using our multi-robot testbed.
