Reference counting is not naturally suitable for running on multiprocessors. The update of pointers and reference counts requires atomic and synchronized operations. We present a novel reference counting algorithm suitable for a multiprocessor that does not require any synchronized operation in its write barrier (not even a compare-and-swap type of synchronization). The algorithm is efficient and may complete with any tracing algorithm.
