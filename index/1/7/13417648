This paper is concerned with adding knowledge to a data base management system and suggests two appropriate mechanisms, namely hypothetical data bases (HDB's) and experts. Herein we indicate the need for HDB's and define the extensions that are needed to a data base system to support HDB's.In addition, we suggest that the notion of "experts" is an appropriate way to add semantic knowledge to a data base system. Unlike most other proposals which extend an underlying data model to capture more meaning, our proposal does not require extensions to the schema. Moreover, the DBMS does not even have to know how an expert functions. In this paper we define an expert and indicate how it would be added to one existing data base system.
