With an ordinary style of twelve men's seamless underwear as the target of study, of which made the same style, material and the different cylinder diameters, organization structures and knitting methods. The pressure and pressure sense of different positions in the upper body of seamless underwear were tested by young men of M body sizes under static and action state. The methods of objective combined with subjective evaluation, grey correlation and multiple linear regression were used to analyzing pressure values and comfortable sense values. The key positions which can weigh total pressure comfort of men's seamless underwear are obtained, they are elbow, shoulder and chest. Models between pressure and comfort sense under different state are also obtained. By confirming, mathematical models have good accuracy and can give a useful guidance to enterprise for predicting whether the pressure of seamless underwear is comfort or not before mass production.
