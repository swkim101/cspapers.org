One of the challenges facing the U.S. technological workforce is that as fewer students take computing courses, fewer college graduates are being prepared for computing careers. Besides trying to attract more CS majors, another approach is to (i) design a computing curriculum that appeals to students and faculty from other (non-CS) disciplines, (ii) use special scholarships to attract students to that curriculum, and (iii) sponsor faculty development workshops for non-CS departments. In this paper, we detail this approach, using a new introductory course oriented to science majors, and scholarships funded by the National Science Foundation Scholarships for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (NSF S-STEM) program to motivate non-CS majors to take CS courses. We also present several success stories that this approach has produced in its first two years.
