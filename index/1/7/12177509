In view of the advantages of deep networks in producing useful representation, the generated features of different modality data (such as image, audio) can be jointly learned using Multimodal Restricted Boltzmann Machines (MRB-M). Recently, audiovisual speech recognition based the M-RBM has attracted much attention, and the MRBM shows its effectiveness in learning the joint representation across audiovisual modalities. However, the built networks have weakness in modeling the multimodal sequence which is the natural property of speech signal. In this paper, we will introduce a novel temporal multimodal deep learning architecture, named as Recurrent Temporal Multimodal RB-M (RTMRBM), that models multimodal sequences by transforming the sequence of connected MRBMs into a probabilistic series model. Compared with existing multimodal networks, it's simple and efficient in learning temporal joint representation. We evaluate our model on audiovisual speech datasets, two public (AVLetters and AVLetters2) and one self-build. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can obviously improve the accuracy of recognition compared with standard MRBM and the temporal model based on conditional RBM. In addition, RTMRBM still outperforms non-temporal multimodal deep networks in the presence of the weakness of long-term dependencies.
