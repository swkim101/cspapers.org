In this paper, we present a new ranking scheme, collaborative ranking (CR). In contrast to traditional non-collaborative ranking scheme which solely relies on the strengths of isolated queries and one stand-alone ranking algorithm, the new scheme integrates the strengths from multiple collaborators of a query and the strengths from multiple ranking algorithms. We elaborate three specific forms of collaborative ranking, namely, micro collaborative ranking (MiCR), macro collaborative ranking (MaCR) and micro-macro collaborative ranking (MiMaCR). Experiments on entity linking task show that our proposed scheme is indeed effective and promising.
