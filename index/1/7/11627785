The enormous amount of information on the Internet has raised the challenge of highlighting new information in the context of already viewed content. This type of intelligent interface can save users time and prevent frustration. Our goal is to scale up novelty detection to large web properties like Google News and Yahoo News. We present a set of lightweight features for online novelty scoring and fast nonlinear feature transformation methods. Our experimental results on the TREC 2004 shared task datasets show that the proposed method is not only efficient but also very powerful, significantly surpassing the best system at TREC 2004.
