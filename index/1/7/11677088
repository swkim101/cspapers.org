Cache misses for which data must be obtained from a remote cache (cache-to-cache transfer misses) account for an important fraction of the total miss rate. Unfortunately, cc-NUMA designs put the access to the directory information into the critical path of 3-hop misses, which significantly penalizes them compared to SMP designs. This work studies the use of owner prediction as a means of providing cc-NUMA multiprocessors with a more efficient support for cache-to-cache transfer misses. Our proposal comprises an effective prediction scheme as well as a coherence protocol designed to support the use of prediction. Results indicate that owner prediction can significantly reduce the latency of cache-to-cache transfer misses, which translates into speed-ups on application performance up to 12%. In order to also accelerate most of those 3-hop misses that are either not predicted or mispredicted, the inclusion of a small and fast directory cache in every node is evaluated, leading to improvements up to 16% on the final performance.
