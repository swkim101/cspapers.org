Controlled mobility in wireless sensor networks provides many benefits towards enhancing the network performance and prolonging its lifetime. Mobile elements, acting as mechanical data carriers, traverse the network collecting data using single-hop communication, instead of the more energy demanding multi-hop routing to the sink. Scaling up from single to multiple mobiles is based more on the mobility models and the coordination methodology rather than increasing the number of mobile elements in the network. This work addresses the problem of designing and coordinating decentralized mobile elements for scheduling data collection in wireless sensor networks, while preserving some performance measures, such as latency and amount of data collected. We propose two mobility models governing the behaviour of the mobile element, where the incoming data collection requests are scheduled to service according to bidding strategies to determine the winner element. Simulations are run to measure the performance of the proposed mobility models subject to the network size and the number of mobile elements.
