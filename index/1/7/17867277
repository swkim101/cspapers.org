Since the 1950's, psychologists have studied the behavioral aspects of software engineering. However, the results of their research have never been organized into a subfield of either software engineering or psychology. This failure results from the difficulty of integrating theory and data from the mixture of paradigms borrowed from psychology. This paper will review some of the psychological research on software engineering performed since the Garmisch Conference in 1968. This review will be organized under two of the psychological paradigms used in exploring programming problems: individual differences and cognitive science. The major theoretical and practical contributions of each area to the theory and practice of software engineering will be discussed. The review will end with a call for more research guided by the paradigm of cognitive science, since such results are the easiest to integrate with new developments in artificial intelligence and computer science theory.
