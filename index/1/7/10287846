The study of compiler generators is an integral part of compiler construction, and for this reason it is customary to have a programming project entirely devoted to it in compiler courses. There are many compilers generators, but their use in a compiler course presents several problems (e.g. the parsers generated are difficult to understand and to debug). In this paper, we describe such problems and present a compiler generator system, AnLex-AnSin, that solves these problems, and can thus be used in compiler programming projects.
