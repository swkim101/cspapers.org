We tackle the problem of searching microblog posts and frame it as a rank aggregation problem where we merge result lists generated by separate rankers so as to produce a final ranking to be returned to the user. We propose a rank aggregation method, TimeRA, that is able to infer the rank scores of documents via latent factor modeling. It is time-aware and rewards posts that are published in or near a burst of posts that are ranked highly in many of the lists being aggregated. Our experimental results show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art rank aggregation and time-sensitive microblog search algorithms.
