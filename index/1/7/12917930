We propose a 3D obstacle avoidance method for mobile robots. Besides the robot's 2D laser range finder, a Time-of-Flight camera is used to perceive obstacles that are not in the scan plane of the laser range finder. Existing approaches that employ Time-of-Flight cameras suffer from the limited field-of-view of the sensor. To overcome this issue, we mount the camera on the head of our anthropomorphic robot Dynamaid. This allows to change the gaze direction through the robot's pan-tilt neck and its torso yaw joint.
