EUFID is a natural language frontend for data management systems. It is modular and table driven so that it can be interfaced to different applications and data management systems. It allows a user to query his data base in natural English, including sloppy syntax and misspellings. The tables contain a data management system view of the data base, a semantic/syntactic view of the application, and a mapping from the second to the first.
