In this paper, we consider a statistical multiplexer in a computer network, which consists of many multiplexer and swit thing nodes. Messages arrive to a multiplexer via low-speed access lines. We model the multiplexer as a discrete-time single server queueing system with a batch cluster arrival process. Thus an arrival process is bursty, and there is a strong correlation between successive arrivals. We first introduce the definition of the discrete-time batch cluster process (DBCP). Then we carry out the queueing analysis for an DBCP arrival process. Expressions for the generating functions of the queue size and packet delay are obtained. From these results expressions can be derived for the moments of the packet delay distribution. The influence of the correlation and of the burstiness of the packet arrival stream is investigated. We observe that neglecting the correlation in the packet arrivals tends to considerably underestimate the packet delay.
