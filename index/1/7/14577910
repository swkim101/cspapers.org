We consider the problem of selective and lightweight closure conversion, in which multiple procedure-calling protocols may coexist in the same code. Flow analysis is used to match the protocol expected by each procedure and the protocol used at each of its possible call sites. We formulate the flow analysis as the solution of a set of constraints, and show that any solution to the constraints justifies the resulting transformation. Some of the techniques used are suggested by those of abstract interpretation, but others arise out of alternative approaches.
