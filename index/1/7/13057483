If students are to internalize software engineering concepts and incorporate them into their individual software development styles, they must use these concepts during the initial stages of their computer science education. In this paper, we examine how laboratories that emphasize software development can be used to familiarize students with the basic elements of software engineering during the introductory computer science course sequence.
