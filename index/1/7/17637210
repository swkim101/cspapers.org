In this paper, we study how artificial facts can be added to an RDFS ontology. Artificial facts are an easy way of proving the ownership of an ontology: If another ontology contains the artificial fact, it has probably been taken from the original ontology. We show how the ownership of an ontology can be established with provably tight probability bounds, even if only parts of the ontology are being re-used. We explain how artificial facts can be generated in an inconspicuous and minimally disruptive way. Our demo allows users to generate artificial facts and to guess which facts were generated.
