A control strategy inspired by the hunting tactics of ladybugs is presented to simultaneously achieve sensor coverage and exploration of an area with a group of networked robots. The controller is distributed in that it requires only information local to each robot, and adaptive in that it modifies its behavior based on information in the environment. The ladybug controller is developed as a modification to a basic coverage control law, first for the non-adaptive case, then for the adaptive case. Stability is proven for both cases with a Lyapunov-type proof. Results of numerical simulations are presented.
