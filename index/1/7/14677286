This paper presents a parser of an inflectional free word order language, namely Finnish. Two-way finite automata are used to specify a functional dependency grammar and to actually parse Finnish sentences. Each automaton gives a functional description of a dependency structure within a constituent. Dynamic local control of the parser is realized by augmenting the automata with simple operations to make the automata, associated with the words of an input sentence, activate one another.
