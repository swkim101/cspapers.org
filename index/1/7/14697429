Current research into data modelling of large scientific simulation programs is described. The research includes an empirical study of data management in such programs and an analysis of how scientists actually use their data. The goal of the research is to provide theoretical tools to improve data management for this class of applications. In this paper, data modelling in the scientific environment is described, and some comparisons between data modelling for scientific simulation programs and commercial applications are made.
