The creation, customization, and maintenance of knowledge resources are essential for fostering the full deployment of Language Technologies. The definition and refinement of knowledge resources are time- and resource-consuming activities. In this paper we explore how the Wiki paradigm for online collaborative content editing can be exploited to gather massive social contributions from common Web users in editing knowledge resources. We discuss the Wikyoto Knowledge Editor, also called Wikyoto. Wikyoto is a collaborative Web environment that enables users with no knowledge engineering background to edit the multilingual network of knowledge resources exploited by KYOTO, a cross-lingual text mining system developed in the context of the KYOTO European Project.
