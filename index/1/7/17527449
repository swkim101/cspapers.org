In this paper, we use a simple concept based on k-reverse nearest neighbor digraphs, to develop a framework RECORD for clustering and outlier detection. We developed three algorithms - (i) RECORD algorithm (requires one parameter), (ii) Agglomerative RECORD algorithm (no parameters required) and (iii) Stability-based RECORD algorithm (no parameters required). Our experimental results with published datasets, synthetic and real-life datasets show that RECORD not only handles noisy data, but also identifies the relevant clusters. Our results are as good as (if not better than) the results got from other algorithms.
