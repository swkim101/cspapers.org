A rotary machine useful as a rotary compressor or engine having a cylindrical compressor rotor with a lobe outstanding from its cylindrical rolling surface geared to another cylindrical rotor with a recess, in its cylindrical rolling surface, the rotors being rotatable within respective parallel intersecting cylinders of a stator so that the lobe sweeps its stator cylinder and meshes with the recess as it moves past the other rotor.
