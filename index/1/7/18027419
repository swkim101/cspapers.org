Robust, scalable localization unlocks path-planning, obstacle avoidance as well as manipulation and thus is a core competency for many robotic applications. However, as we leave the lab and move out in the world, models of the environment no longer span distances of meters but kilometers in length. Now, gigabytes instead of megabytes of memory are required to hold the model of the environment required for localization. Discarding data and keeping the map representation compact is thus essential for any meaningful application. This paper presents and evaluates a map compression algorithm that approaches this data-reduction as an constrained optimization problem. At the core of the algorithm is the concept of a Summary Map, a reduced map representation that includes only the landmarks that are deemed most useful for place recognition. To assign landmarks to the map we have to satisfy the conflicting goals of map coverage and localizability as well as our tight memory budget. While using an optimization approach for compression is not novel, in this paper we propose adaptations to drastically reduce the computational requirements. Our approach improves scalability from trajectories of a few tens of meters manageable by the state of the art to virtually unlimited dataset sizes in our system. We evaluate the performance of various compression levels as well as several methods for selecting the best localization landmarks from outdoor datasets.
