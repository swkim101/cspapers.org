This paper introduces a novel wireless collaborated hybrid data center architecture called RF-HYBRID that could optimize the effect of wireless transmission while reduce the complexity of wired network. RF-HYBRID improves throughput and packet delivery latency through flexible wireless detours and shortcuts, with a comprehensive routing and congestion control method.
