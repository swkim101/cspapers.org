We present new geometrical and numerical analysis structure theorems for the Delaunay diagram of point sets in R~ for a fixed d where the point sets arise naturally in numerical methods. In particular, we show that if the largest ratio of the circum-radius to the length of smallest edge over all simplexes in the Delaunay diagram of P, DT(P), is bounded, (called the bounded radius-edge ratio property), then DT(P) is a subgraph of a density graph, the Delaunay spheres form a k-ply system for a constant k, and that we get optimal rates of convergence for approximate solutions of Poisson’s equation constructed using control volume techniques. The density graph result implies that DT(P) has a partition of cost O(rrl ‘Id) that can be efficiently found by the geometric separator algorithm of Miller, Teng, Thurston, and Vavasis and therefore the numerical linear system defined on D7’(P) using the finite-volume method can be solved efficiently on a parallel machine (either by a director an iterative method). The constant ply structure of Delaunay spheres leads to a linear-space point location structure for these Delaunay diagrams with O(log n) time per query. Moreover, we present a new parallel algorithm for computing the Delaunay diagram for these point sets in any fixed dimension in O(log n) random parallel time and n processors. Our results show that the bounded radius-edge ratio property is desirable for well-shaped triangular meshes for numerical methods such as finite element, finite difference, and in particular, finite volume methods.
