We present a software architecture used to demonstrate the ability of a tank-like robot to climb multiple flights of stairs. The algorithm we use incorporates intelligent sensor fusion and a hierarchical modular structure. This structure simplifies the overall design, enables reuse, and promotes extensibility. The modular nature of the design also allows for a variety of user interface modes with different levels of user autonomy. The robustness of our algorithm allows us to ascend and descend stairs autonomously in many environments with different textures and configurations, all with minimal adjustment to the algorithm. Our approach develops an extensible sensor and task model that reduces the effect of sensor inaccuracies and geometric constraints, uses minimal information about the environment, and utilizes characteristic features in the environment for navigation.
