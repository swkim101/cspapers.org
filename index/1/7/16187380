Extracting human's health condition using wireless sensors impose a challenge in the balance between data storage and CPU power. Taking available resources on nodes into consideration, we apply Step-wise Context Extraction (SCE) to AoK mule system [4]. SCE compresses data obtained at the mule into a context as the data is forwarded. In this demonstration, we show how the raw data is converted into the context in the AoK system.
