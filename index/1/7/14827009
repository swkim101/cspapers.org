We present a 4-bit power scalable flash analog-to-digital converter in digital 0.18-Î¼m CMOS, targeting low power ultra-wide band receivers. To minimize static power consumption, we exploit dynamic comparators with built-in digitally tunable thresholds. The converter has been realized and tested outperforming recent comparable designs even in more advanced technologies. The main performance figures include 5.8GHz effective resolution bandwidth and 0.8pJ/conversion-step at 1-GS/s and Nyquist conditions.
