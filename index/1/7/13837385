SPARQL endpoints are one possible access method to linked data. The results of SPARQL queries serialized in JSON are, however, not suitable to be directly used by web developers in end-user applications who often need to merge the values resulting from variable bindings. In this work, we propose a generic approach implemented in a JavaScript module that takes as input a JSON file describing both the SPARQL query and the shape of the expected output at the same time.
