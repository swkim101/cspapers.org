We present a novel way of extracting features from short texts, based on the activation values of an inner layer of a deep convolutional neural network. We use the extracted features in multimodal sentiment analysis of short video clips representing one sentence each. We use the combined feature vectors of textual, visual, and audio modalities to train a classifier based on multiple kernel learning, which is known to be good at heterogeneous data. We obtain 14% performance improvement over the state of the art and present a parallelizable decision-level data fusion method, which is much faster, though slightly less accurate.
