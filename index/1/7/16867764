As an advocate of infusing various algorithmic and mathematical aspects when teaching about programming, I have come to realize that an early such practice is essential for a rounded computer science education. In this paper, I show how this can be done while focusing on one theme: Fibonacci. Perhaps the most common use of Fibonacci has been to show the power of recurrence in implementing the Fibonacci sequence, which is often accompanied by a caveat that it is not the best implementation (very slow). Nevertheless, the sequence, with its rabbit story and celebrated golden ratio, is a rather exciting "gadget" for many students and it often pays off to introduce it. Therefore, I explore ways to use Fibonacci (the binary word) and the golden ratio for guiding implementation, and to successfully convey an important message of computer science that programming is not just about writing code. This will be done in the context of one dimensional and two dimensional arrays.
