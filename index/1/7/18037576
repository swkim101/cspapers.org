The development of microprocessors has suggested the design of distributed processing and multiprocessing computer architectures. A computer system design incorporating these ideas is proposed, along with its impact on memory management and process control aspects of the system's operating system. The key design feature is to identify system processes with microprocessors and interconnect them in a hierarchy constructed to minimize intercommunication requirements.
