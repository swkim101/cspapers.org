The modern teaching should be based on data driven techniques. Yet many of us do not have the resources to collect, analyze and act on course data on a regular basis. The process of collecting data from multiple sources, integrating and analyzing can be a daunting task. The purpose of this workshop is to help simplify this process. The workshop introduces participants to the basic process of establishing a data collection protocol, dealing with institutional review board (IRB) if applicable, setting up an interactive framework to help facilitate data collection, and developing customized dashboards to help support classroom teaching. We will also discuss ways to set up interactive reading and video viewing activities and student collaboration activities to increase student course engagement. These techniques can help collect student interaction data on a regular basis. The workshop will also discuss data integration standards such as Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) that can facilitate data integration efforts across data rich learning applications that are already in use
