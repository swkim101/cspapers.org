This paper presents the design methodology that the author teaches in a junior level Database Management course at ~-and Valley State College. The methodology is heavily grounded in the relational model. Included in the paper is a discussion of critical relationaI model concepts necessary for understanding the methodology. INTRODUCT10N The purpose of this paper is to present the database design methodology that I teach at Grand Valley State Co]]ege in our first Database course. The course is an introduction to the theory and practice of database management. It follows a course in ~hich the students have actually implemented a small database themselves maintaining their own pointers. The database course covers all of the basic models: hierarchical, network (specifically CODASYL), inverted file and relational. The students are required to complete projects which involve a CODASYL database, typically including about 9-10 record types and 10-12 set types. The students use IDS-II, a major CODASYL system, with COBOL as a host and IDP, a query languages on our Honeywell mainframe. In addition they complete projects invoIving the updating of =.and retrieval ~rom a relational database using KnowledgeMan on IBM PC's. This course is followed by a database project course in which the students, working in teams of 5-6 students, complete a major database-oriented project. This project is completed on the mainfrale using COBOL, IDS-II, IDP and several utility tools. This project involves the development of a complete menu-driven, screen-oriented application system supporting full shared update, full on-line help, journaling, and other features of a normal production environment.

Though database design is extremely important in its own right, the presence of the project course adds even more importance to the topic. I present an introduction to a variety of database design methodologies, such as the canonical schema of James Martin [I] and the entity-relationship model of Peter Chen [23. Since database design is of very special interest to me, I try to read every book and â€¦
