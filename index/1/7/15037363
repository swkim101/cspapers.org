Entity Relationship Modelling (ERM) is a fundamental skill in database design. Though ERM concepts are simple, the modelling process itself is a complex activity. Novice ER modellers make systematic errors in their models. Current tool-based support for learning ER modelling is limited, since it concentrates on notation at the expense of methodology, and provides little or no feedback to the learner about the quality of her constructed models. A text-based virtual learning environment, based on the Multi-User Dimension paradigm, is described, in which learners undertake ER modelling tasks by interacting with objects in a virtual world. This learning environment concentrates on the methodology of ER modelling rather than its notation, and provides immediate feedback to a learner about the quality of her models. Preliminary results suggest that this learning environment is both easy to use and effective.
