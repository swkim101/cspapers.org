This paper aims at advancing micromanipulation technology with in situ polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric force sensing during microassembly and packaging process. Based on the previously developed PVDF 1-D sensor, by employing the parallel beam structure, a novel 2-D force sensor with relatively high natural frequency and sensitivity is optimally designed. The sensor can detect micro force and force rate signals, which can be fed back so as to greatly, improve the reliability of microassembly. Preliminary calibration and experimental results on assembly of surface MEMS devices both verified the performance of the new 2-D sensor that demonstrates a high sensitivity and a resolution in the range of /spl mu/N. Ultimately the technology would provide a critical and major step towards the development of automated micro-manufacturing processes for batch assembly of micro devices.
