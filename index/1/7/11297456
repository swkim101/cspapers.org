We propose a novel method to deal with sphere ambiguity, occlusion, appearance and disappearance of points in image registration. We have developed a number of rigid motion constraints through analysis of geometrical properties of reflected correspondence vectors synthesised into a single coordinate frame. The properties are used as further constraints to eliminate false matches obtained by the iterative closest point criterion. A number of experiments based on both synthetic data and real images demonstrate that the proposed method is accurate, robust, and efficient for the registration of free-form shapes.
