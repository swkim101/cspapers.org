Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important task for location-based social networks (LBSNs). However, previous efforts suffer from the high computational complexity, besides the transition pattern between POIs has not been well studied. In this paper, we proposed a twofold approach for next POI recommendation. First, the preferred next category is predicted by using a third-rank tensor optimized by a Listwise Bayesian Personalized Ranking (LBPR) approach. Specifically we introduce two functions, namely PlackettLuce model and cross entropy, to generate the likelihood of a ranking list for posterior computation. Then POI candidates filtered by the predicated category are ranked based on the spatial influence and category ranking influence. The experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the significant improvements of our methods over several state-ofthe-art methods.
