In this work, we propose a novel scheme for sentiment classification (without labeled examples) which combines the strengths of both "learn-based" and "lexicon-based" approaches as follows: we first use a lexicon-based technique to label a portion of informative examples from given task (or domain); then learn a new supervised classifier based on these labeled ones; finally apply this classifier to the task. The experimental results indicate that proposed scheme could dramatically outperform "learn-based" and "lexicon-based" techniques.
