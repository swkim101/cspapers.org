For a set <i>S</i> of points in ℝ<sup>d</sup>, a t-spanner is a sparse graph on the points of <i>S</i> such that between any pair of points there is a path in the spanner whose total length is at most <i>t</i> times the Euclidean distance between the points. In this paper, we show how to construct a (1 + ε)-spanner with <i>O</i>(<i>n/ε<sup>d</sup></i>) edges and maximum degree <i>O</i>(1/ε<i><sup>d</sup></i>) in time <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>). A spanner with similar properties was previously presented in [6, 8]. However, using our new construction (coupled with several other innovations) we obtain new results for two fundamental problems for constant doubling dimension metrics:
 The first result is an essentially optimal compact routing scheme. In particular, we show how to perform routing with a stretch of 1 + ∈, where the label size is [log <i>n</i>] and the size of the table stored at each point is only <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>/ε<i><sup>d</sup></i>). This routing problem was first considered by Peleg and Hassin [11], who presented a routing scheme in the plane. Later, Chan <i>et al.</i> [6] and Abraham <i>et al.</i> [1] considered this problem for doubling dimension metric spaces. Abraham <i>et al.</i> [1] were the first to present a (1 + ∈) routing scheme where the label size depends solely on the number of points. In their scheme labels are of size of [log <i>n</i>], and each point stores a table of size <i>O</i>(log<sup>2</sup> <i>n</i>/ε<i><sup>d</sup></i>). In our routing scheme, we achieve routing tables of size <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>/ε<i><sup>d</sup></i>), which is essentially the same size as a label (up to the factor of 1/ε<i><sup>d</sup></i>).
 The second and main result of this paper is the first <b>fully</b> dynamic geometric spanner with poly-logarithmic update time for both insertions and deletions. We present an algorithm that allows points to be inserted into and deleted from <i>S</i> with an amortized update time of <i>O</i>(log<sup>3</sup> <i>n</i>).
