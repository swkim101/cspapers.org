Aspectual Business Process Modelling is not a new concept in business process based development to support the separation of the cross cutting concerns. Most of the researchers use the concept of the heavyweight extensions of the business processes to incorporate the aspects. This requires changes in the meta-models of the languages and the tool infrastructures, which is not a feasible option. Some of the researchers also provide lightweight extensions in the form of profiles, but these are mostly incomplete and do not provide solutions for modelling some important aspectual concepts like Pointcuts effectively. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we provide a lightweight extension of the business processes expressed in BPMN to incorporate the aspect specific concepts in it. We propose a profile ABPMN which uses the existing notations of the BPMN models for expressing aspectual concepts. Further, we developed a language PCDL to express the pointcuts in an effective way. The language is implemented using XText in Eclipse. To evaluate the applicability of our approach, we applied it on a case study of the E-Bidding system.
