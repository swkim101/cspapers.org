The techniques to be described in this paper are generally applicable to any time domain, parallel fault, digital logic simulation system. The particular implementation was done on the CC-TEGAS3 system and quoted results are from this system.
 The first technique to be considered provides accuracy of fault simulation when using assignable nominal delays for different element types. The second technique provides for handling fault induced activity in a network, in such a way as to considerably reduce the amount of simulation time required.
