This paper reports the work in progress of incorporating a participatory disease detection mechanism into the existing web- and mobile device application DoctorMe in Thailand. As Southeast Asia has a high likelihood of hosting potential outbreaks of epidemics it is crucial to enable citizens to collectively contribute to improved public health through crowdsourced data, which is currently lacking. This paper focuses foremost on the localised approach, utilizing elements such as gamification, digital volunteerism and personalised health recommendations for participating users. DoctorMe's participatory disease detection approach aims to tap into the accelerating technological landscape in Thailand and to improve personal health and provide valuable data for institutional analysis that may prevent or decrease the impact of infectious disease outbreaks.
