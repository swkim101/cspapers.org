The I-SPY meta-search engine uses a technique called collaborative Web search to leverage the past search behaviour (queries and selections) of a community of users in order to promote search results that are relevant to the community. In this paper we describe recent studies to clarify the benefits of this approach in situations when the behaviour of users cannot be relied upon in terms of their ability to consistently select relevant results during search sessions.
