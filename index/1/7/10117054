Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are the subject of an increasing interest in many applications and a key requirement is the stabilization of the vehicle. Some previous works have suggested using catadioptric vision, instead of traditional perspective cameras, in order to gather much more information from the environment and therefore improve the robustness of the UAV attitude estimation. This paper belongs to a series of recent publications of our research group concerning catadioptric vision for UAVs. Currently, we focus on the estimation of the complete attitude of a UAV flying in urban environment. In order to avoid the limitations of horizon-based approaches, the difficulties of traditional epipolar methods (such as rotation-translation ambiguity, lack of features, retrieving motion parameters from matrix decomposition, etc..) and improve UAV dynamic control, we suggest computing infinite homography. We show how catadioptric vision plays a key role to: first, extract a large number of lines, second robustly estimate the associated vanishing points and third, track them even during long video sequences. Therefore it is not only possible to estimate the relative rotation between consecutive frames but also compute the absolute rotation between two distant frames without error accumulation. Finally, we present some experimental results with ground truth data to demonstrate the accuracy and the robustness of our method.
