High level power estimation is essential for designing complex low-power ICs. However, the lack of flexibility of all previously presented high level power estimation approaches limits their use to small (datapath) parts of ICs. In this paper a more general and flexible high level power estimation approach is presented, based on VHDL simulation. The obtained results are very encouraging.
