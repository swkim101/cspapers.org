In this position paper we bnng together and try to integrate the different views of application systems and data bases that have arisen in the infomation system, control system, data base, and business reengineering communities. We define process systems, and make them the focus of the survey. We also introduce a number of discussion questions. 1 Introduction This position paper explores one major theme and formulates several theses that relate to it. The theme: modern enterprises are defined by processes IDa93, Be95, Ha96], and the volatile nature of the application domains in which the processes operate [Hu84] requires that the software that supports the processes be rapidly adjustable to suit new conditions [Be96]. Some examples of processes: order fulfillment and inventory control, manufacture of goods, transportation of goods, maintenance of a communication network, software development. The process orientation and domain volatility have major implications for data base research, which we consider in the form of the following theses. First, application systems tend to be classified as information or as control systems, and data bases have traditionally been associated with information systems. Such separation is becoming artificial in that systems in the one category contain features characteristic of the other. Our thesis is that information and control systems should become collectively identified as process systems. Second, under a process-system orientation, data base research has to become more concerned with control issues. To some extent this is recognized by research on active data bases.

Our thesis is that the terminology is of little consequence, hut that the separate paths that have been taken by research on information systems, control systems, and active data bases should be made to join up again. Third, in order for an enterprise to cope with rapid changes …
