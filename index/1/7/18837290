We present and evaluate diBOX, an algorithm for

multi-agent path finding on strongly biconnected

directed graphs. diBOX runs in polynomial time,

computes suboptimal solutions and is complete for

instances on strongly biconnected digraphs with at

least two unoccupied positions. A detailed empirical

analysis shows a good scalability for diBOX.
