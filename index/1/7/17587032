These days it is increasingly commonplace and publicly acceptable for applications to make memory demands that only a couple of years ago seemed outrageous. The prices of fast, powerful personal computers capable of running such applications are plummeting. It is therefore becoming reasonable to wonder how pre-college education might benefit from the use of software that until very recently was excluded even from the fantasies of educational visionaries because of cost considerations and the inaccessibility of suitable hardware. Among the topics that may now realistically be considered for inclusion in the pre-college curriculum is the important subject of solid modeling.
