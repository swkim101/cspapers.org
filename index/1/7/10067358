It is crucial for the success of a search-driven web application to answer users' queries in the best possible way. A common approach is to use click models for guessing the relevance of search results. However, these models are imprecise and waive valuable information one can gain from non-click user interactions. We introduce TellMyRelevance!---a novel automatic end-to-end pipeline for tracking cursor interactions at the client, analyzing these and learning according relevance models. Yet, the models depend on the layout of the search results page involved, which makes them difficult to evaluate and compare. Thus, we use a Random Mouse Cursor as an extension to our pipeline for generating layout-dependent baselines. Based on these, we can perform evaluations of real-world relevance models. A large-scale interaction log analysis showed that we can learn relevance models whose predictions compare favorably to predictions of an existing state-of-the-art click model.
