In this paper we discuss some of the major issues dealing with the design of a functional level concurrent fault simulator for digital net works. In the area of functional level modeling we discuss the following items: motivation; algorithms for primitives; state events; u-events; timing considerations including inertial delays; and finally the relationship between faults and functional models. For concurrent faults simulation we first discuss the various advantages of this technique, including its compatiability with function level modeling. We then present the major attributes of an abstract data structure required for this system, and then the concurrent simulation mechanism is described.
 Finally we discuss the problem of switching between functional and gate level models for a module.
