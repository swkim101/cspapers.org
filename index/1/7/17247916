Many global internet services today can be thought of as being managed 'top-down' without much appreciation or requirement for local control. New services such as location-based data stores implemented in cities around the world suggest opportunities for novel forms of management of data with relevance to a local context. We argue that such localization of ubiquitous system management provides an opportunity in supporting local off-line interaction and 'community building' and that urban development, which requires interaction between members of different communities, presents an interesting case where such systems could be realised.
