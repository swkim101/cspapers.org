This paper proposes a remote navigation system for a simple tele-presence robot. In general, robot functions of tele-presence robots are limited, and visual angle of the camera on robots is narrow, so they are unsuitable to use navigation services. The proposed system overcomes the difficulty by adopting system architecture in which robots are controlled remotely via a server located in the Internet, by using well-designed virtual reality techniques for robot control and by implementing almost all robot navigation functions into the server. In this paper, we also implemented Remote Open Campus System (ROCS) as a prototype system, and by using that, we confirmed the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed system.
