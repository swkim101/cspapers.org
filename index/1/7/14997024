A concept of on-line trajectory generation for robot motion control systems enabling instantaneous reactions to unforeseen sensor events was introduced in a former publication. This previously proposed class of algorithms requires constant kinematic motion constraints, and this paper extends the approach by the usage of time-variant motion constraints, such that low-level trajectory parameters can now abruptly be changed, and the system can react instantaneously within the same control cycle (typically one millisecond or less). This feature is important for instantaneous switchings between state spaces and reference frames at sensor-dependent instants of time, and for the usage of the algorithm as a control submodule in a hybrid switched robot motion control system. Real-world experimental results of two sample use-cases highlight the practical relevance of this extension.
