In this paper, we describe MySearchView, a system for assembling search engines into metasearch engines. With this system, any user can create a metasearch engine by simply letting the system know the URLs of the search engines the user wants to be included and the metasearch engine will be built fully automatically. In this paper, the main steps of building metasearch engines will be sketched. We will also outline our plan to demonstrate all the features of MySearchView.
