In this article, we show how to compute for n-vertex planar graphs in O(n11/6 polylog(n)) expected time the diameter and the sum of the pairwise distances. The algorithms work for directed graphs with real weights and no negative cycles. In O(n15/8 polylog(n)) expected time, we can also compute the number of pairs of vertices at distances smaller than a given threshold. These are the first algorithms for these problems using time O(nc) for some constant c< 2, even when restricted to undirected, unweighted planar graphs.
