We present UMLtoCSP, a tool for the formal verification of UML/OCL models. Given a UML class diagram annotated with OCL constraints, UMLtoCSP is able to automatically check several correctness properties, such as the strong and weak satisfiability of the model or the lack of redundant constraints. The tool uses Constraint Logic Programming as the underlying formalism and the constraint solver ECLiPSe as the verification engine.
