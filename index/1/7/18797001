Many existing rating systems for goods or services simply total the number of good and bad evaluations reported by the consumers when generating the ratings. These systems, however, make it difficult to create really reliable reports since there is no incentive for the evaluators to provide accurate or truthful reports. This paper proposes to introduce an index that represents the trust we can place on the evaluator. This index increases if the evaluator's past estimation of the reputation of goods or service is subsequently found to be true. An evaluator who earns a higher index score has more impact on the rating system. This mechanism generates fairer and more objective ratings.
