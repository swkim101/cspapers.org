This paper will explore the role of design automation in the preliminary design process. For this purpose, design automation is considered as the use of computer programs in the analysis and synthesis of a tactical weapon system. The weapon system consists of all the elements required to deliver a warhead onto an unfriendly target. The design process is considered and the role of computer programs is defined. From these studies the requirements for design automation are obtained, and the value of design automation is assessed.
