Technological and fundamental developments in robotics can emerge from various sources like publications or international research plans. Among the various sources of analysis, patents results valuable in expressing the efforts performed both by companies and research institutions. This work takes the occasion of the fifty years of robotics for presenting an analysis and visualization of trends in robotics by means of patent mining. This work focuses, in particular, on the domains of rehabilitation and surgical robotics. The discussed methodology highlights the role of haptic interfaces in these fields and the relationships between relevant companies.
