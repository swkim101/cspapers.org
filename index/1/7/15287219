Although graph matching is a fundamental problem in pattern recognition, and has drawn broad interest from many fields, the problem of learning graph matching has not received much attention. In this paper, we redefine the learning of graph matching as a model learning problem. In addition to conventional training of matching parameters, our approach modifies the graph structure and attributes to generate a graphical model. In this way, the model learning is oriented toward both matching and recognition performance, and can proceed in an unsupervised fashion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional methods for learning graph matching.
