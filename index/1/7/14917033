This paper describes the application of MATRAN-III, a computer program developed by the author, to planning the space for a branch bank in Southern California. MATRAN-III is used to identify clusters of elements within a set of interrelated elements. The program accepts any arbitrary listing of the elements and their proximal relations and creates an adjacency matrix. This matrix is block diagonalized yielding visually recognizable patterns which can be mapped into line-dot diagrams. These diagrams can then be presented to a designer providing him with a memory pattern from which we can begin laying out the geometric configuration of the space.
