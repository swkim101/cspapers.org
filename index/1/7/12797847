The discrete logarithm problem asks to solve for the exponent x, given the generator g of a cyclic group G and an element h∈ G such that gx=h. We give the first rigorous proof that Pollard's Kangaroo method finds the discrete logarithm in expected time (3+o(1))√{b-a} for the worst value of x∈[a,b], and (2+o(1))√b-a when x∈uar[a,b]. This matches the conjectured time complexity and, rare among the analysis of algorithms based on Markov chains, even the lead constants 2 and 3 are correct.
