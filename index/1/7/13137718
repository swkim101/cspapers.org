An array of very simple processing elements is described each with a local semiconductor store. The array may also be used as main storage.
 Bit-organisation gives great flexibility, including the minimisation of word length. Use of MSI and LSI is helped by the simplicity of the serial design. Using 15-bit fixed point, the theoretical performance of a 72 Ã— 128 array is about 108 multiplications or 109 additions per second. Comparisons are made with other architectures.
 Meteorology is considered as an application. It is attractive to have the whole problem in the array storage.
