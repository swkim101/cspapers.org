The classical pumping lemma [BP&S] and Ogden's lemma [Og] are among the most powerful tools we possess for proving that languages are not context-free. Hence one goal of recent research has been to obtain analogous theorems for subclasses of the context-free languages.
 We establish here a property of LL(k) derivation trees which is analogous to the left part property for strict deterministic grammars[H&H]. We show that our property characterizes LL(k) grammars and use it to establish two iteration theorems for the LL languages. These theorems, in turn, enable us to prove simply and rigorously that a variety of LR languages are not LL. In particular, the “dangling” Algol 60 IF-THEN-ELSE construct allowed in Pascal and PL/1 cannot be generated by an LL(k) grammar.
