This tutorial aims to provide attendees with a detailed understanding of end-to-end evaluation pipeline based on human judgments (offline measurement). The tutorial will give an overview of the state of the art methods, techniques, and metrics necessary for each stage of evaluation process. We will mostly focus on evaluating an information retrieval (search) system, but the other tasks such as recommendation and classification will also be discussed. Practical examples will be drawn both from the literature and from real world usage scenarios in industry.
