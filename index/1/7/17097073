Matrix-matrix multiplication is one of the core computations in many algorithms from scientific computing or numerical analysis and many efficient realizations have been invented over the years, including many parallel ones. The current trend to use clusters of PCs or SMPs for scientific computing suggests to revisit matrix-matrix multiplication and investigate efficiency and scalability of different versions on clusters. In this paper we present parallel algorithms for matrix-matrix multiplication which are built up from several algorithms in a multilevel structure. Each level is associated with a hierarchical partition of the set of available processors into disjoint subsets so that deeper levels of the algorithm employ smaller groups of processors in parallel. We perform runtime experiments on several parallel platforms and show that multilevel algorithms can lead to significant performance gains compared with state-of-the-art methods.
