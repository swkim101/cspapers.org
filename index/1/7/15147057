In the recent past there has been much research and development on cloud based computing. While cloud computing provides huge opportunities, it also imposes several challenges. One of the challenges that current data network operators and future 5G network are foreseeing is huge increase in data traffic. To fulfill such exponential data traffic growth, along with other user expectation, requires multiple innovative approaches and re-consideration of the current network design principals. Mobile Edge Fog computing, as proposed in this paper offers huge opportunities to future data network operators, as well as to equipment vendors. Due to its relatively newer concept, still much research is ongoing and detail architecture is still evolving. This paper proposes and discusses a novel Mobile Edge Computing design and architecture, along with real-time implementation details of the proposed solutions. It exploits many benefits of D2D by incorporating D2D functionalities into the proposed relay-gateways. The application running on top of the proposed network shows significant benefits e.g. in terms of delay as well as core-network signalling and data offloading.
