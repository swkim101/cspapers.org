Figure 1: Overview of WiPrint system. User can input a floor plan, location of an AP and a desired signal map to the system. The desired signal pattern is marked with red and black regions indicating areas which should have strong and weak signals respectively. WiPrint uses an optimization algorithm to produce a reflector shape. This reflector is then fabricated and applied to an AP to achieve this desired signal pattern.
