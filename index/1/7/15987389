Times series techniques have been extensively used for Sales forecasting. Research has established that a combination forecast works better than a single forecast. Our research attempts to design an Intelligent Forecasting Engine which will use a combination forecasting technique. This design is based on use of Genetic Algorithms, for selecting the best methods to combine for forecasting. Early results demonstrate that Genetic Algorithms have the potential to become a powerful tool for time series sales forecasting.
