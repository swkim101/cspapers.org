Integrating enterprise information requires an accurate, precise and complete understanding of the disparate data sources, the needs of the information consumers, and how these map to the semantic business concepts of the enterprise. We describe how MetaMatrix captures and manages this metadata through the use of the OMG's MOF architecture and multiple domain-specific modeling languages, and how this semantic and syntactic metadata is then used for a variety of purposes, including accessing data in real-time from the underlying enterprise systems, integrating it, and returning it as information expected by consumers.
