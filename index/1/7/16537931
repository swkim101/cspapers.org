A fast, simple algorithm for recognizing hand drawn geometric shapes is presented and evaluated. The algorithm recognizes (without regard to size) rectangles, ellipses, circles, diamonds, triangles, and lines. Each shape may consist of multiple strokes as long as they are entered without pauses. A pen-based graphic diagram editor employing this algorithm was developed on GOâ€™s PenPoint operating system. The editor will be part of a pen-based notebook system for teaching math to school children. The recognition algorithm was evaluated by ten subjects drawing a total of 200 shapes. It achieved a recognition rate of up to 98Y0.
