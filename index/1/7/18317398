Cached statistics are a means of extending the reach of traditional statistical machine learning algorithms into application areas where computational complexity is a limiting factor. Recent work has shown that cached statistics greatly reduce the computational requirements of building a mixture model of a distribution using Expectation-Maximization for a small trade oo in model error. This paper describes a method whereby a mixture model built using cached statistics is used as a means of improving the color normal-ization performance of two standard color constancy algorithms. Color constancy algorithms factor out illumination eeects such that normalized pixel color values become an invariant representation of surface reeectance properties. This can improve the performance of machine vision and image database algorithms which use color as a feature. This processing is also important in digital camera and scanning applications where a preferred rendition of a scene is to be realized independently of the lighting conditions at the time of image capture. The details and experimental evaluation of two modiied color constancy algorithms which utilize a parametric mixture model are described.
