SOCLE is a hybrid representation system in which cells of constraints are identified with slots of frame networks. Constraint formulas are maintained with respect to slots in frame networks and in turn provide for the dependency regulation of values on the frames. This paper illustrates the use of SOCLE and outlines the control structure decisions made for its design and implementation.
