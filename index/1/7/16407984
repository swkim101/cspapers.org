The Perifoveal Display (see Figure 1) is a visualization display for complex, real-time, dynamic data such as stock market data, traffic or control room as well as virtual 3D environments. The system takes advantage of the unique properties of the human perceptive system, which is capable of perceiving a high degree of detail in the foveal area, but has a unique more subliminal type of perception of movement and brightness in the peripheral area. The Perifoveal Display varies how data is visualized based on the user's viewing direction. Data in the center of the user's focus is displayed in a lot of detail. Movement and change in brightness as well as amount of detail and size highlight important data changes that fall into the periphery. The results of our user study show that the system is able to support the user while observing complex data.
