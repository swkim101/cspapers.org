In recent years many researchers have investigated the use of Markov Random Fields (MRFs) for computer vision. They can be applied for example to reconstruct surfaces from sparse and noisy depth data coming from the output of a visual process, or to integrate early vision processes to label physical discontinuities. In this paper we show that by applying mean field theory to those MRFs models a class of neural networks is obtained. Those networks can speed up the solution for the MRFs models. The method is not restricted to computer vision.
