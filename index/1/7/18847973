We propose a sensor-driver integrated muscle module by integrating necessarily components for tendon-driven robot which is likely to complicate. The module has abilities of high-tension measurability and flexible tension control. In order to achieve flexible tension control, we developed the new tension measurement mechanism with high-tension measurability and the new motor driver which enables current based motor control. We demonstrate the tension control ability of the module by several experiments. Furthermore, utilizing the module advantage of design facilitation, we made two types of tendon-driven robots and confirmed effectiveness of the module.
