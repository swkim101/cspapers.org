We discuss a strategy for polychotomous classification that involves estimating class probabilities for each pair of classes, and then coupling the estimates together. The coupling model is similar to the Bradley-Terry method for paired comparisons. We study the nature of the class probability estimates that arise, and examine the performance of the procedure in simulated datasets. The classifiers used include linear discriminants and nearest neighbors: application to support vector machines is also briefly described.
