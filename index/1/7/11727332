We describe the design and performance of code added to the Mach microkernel (Mach 4.0, version UK02p21) that permits one to build a Mach kernel that includes unmodified Linux device drivers. We have written emulation code to support all Linux 1.3.35 network and SCSI drivers for the ISA and PCI I/O buses. Emulation increases latency, but very little. The degree depends on both device and operation, and varies from 2 microseconds for receiving small (60 byte) network packets up to 197 microseconds for writing 16KB to an ISA SCSI device.
