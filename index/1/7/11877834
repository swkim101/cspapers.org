Absm~-PIPE (Parallel Instructions and Pipelined Execution) is a research vehicle for stud)~ng high performance VLSI architectures and organizations. Its principal features are: 1) it is pipelined, 2) it makes extensive use of architectural queues, 3) it is capable of a decoupled mode of operation where two processors cooperate in executing the same task and communicate via hardware queues. 4) it has an instruction cache, and 5) it has a memory interface that allows overlapped memory transactions. This paper describes the architecture and its implementation. Results of extensive simulation studies are reported.
