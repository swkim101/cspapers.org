In this paper we present a novel and simple handheld device for measuring in vivo human grasp impedance. The measurement method is based on a static identification method and intrinsic impedance is identified inbetween 25 ms. Using this device it is possbile to develop continuous grasp impedance measurement methods as it is an active research topic in physiology as well as in robotics, especially since nowadays (bio-inspired) robotics can be impedance-controlled. Potential applications of human impedance estimation range from impedance-controlled telesurgery to limb prosthetics and rehabilitation robotics. We validate the device through a physiological experiment in which the device is used to show a linear relationship between finger stiffness and grip force.
