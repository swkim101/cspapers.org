In this paper, non first normal form relations (or NFRa) are discussed. First the authors define compoai t ion of tuplea to introduce NFR and discuss some properties. Then canonical forma of NFRa are defined using Vest‚Äù operations. This is optimal in the sense that every 1NF relation can be always transformed into canonical ones and canonical forma have the desired properties to some extent. Also we shall consider data dependency and its effect to NFRa. Finally we consider some algorithms for updating tuplea in NFRa with their complexity.
