In this demo we present and validate a LoRa cell traffic generator, able to emulate the behavior of thousands of low-rate sensor nodes deployed in the same cell, by using a single Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. Differently from traditional generators, whose goal is creating packet flows which emulate specific applications and protocols, our focus is generating a combined radio signal, as seen by a gateway, given by the super-position of the signals transmitted by multiple sensors simultaneously active on the same channel. We argue that such a generator can be of interest for testing different network planning solutions for LoRa networks.
