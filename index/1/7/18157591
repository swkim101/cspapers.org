In this paper we propose an account of human/computer awareness for use in the (re)design of complex human/computer interaction, before empirically testing its utility. Specifically, having situated our work in the wider field of human/computer awareness research, we address the well-reported phenomenon of "situation awareness" breakdowns in the aviation domain. We assert the need for an explanatory and predictive model of the phenomenon if the frequency of such breakdowns is to be reduced and propose such a model. We then go on to investigate the utility of our model as a guide for design through the discussion of a recent experiment involving manipulations of an animated warning signal on a simulated cockpit control panel. Our results show initial support both for the model and for our assertion of its utility. We conclude that our composite view of awareness yields practical benefit in the design of human computer awareness support.
