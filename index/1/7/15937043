Our goal is to understand redo recovery. We define an installation graph of operations in an execution, an ordering significantly weaker than conflict ordering from concurrency control. The installation graph explains recoverable system state in terms of which operations are considered installed. This explanation and the set of operations replayed during recovery form an invariant that is the contract between normal operation and recovery. It prescribes how to coordinate changes to system components such as the state, the log, and the cache. We also describe how widely used recovery techniques are modeled in our theory, and why they succeed in providing redo recovery.
