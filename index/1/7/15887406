A proactive display is an application that selects content to display based on the set of users who have been detected nearby. For example, the Ticket2Talk [17] proactive display application presented content for users so that other people would know something about them.
 It is our view that promising patterns for proactive display applications have been discovered, and now we face the need for frameworks to support the range of applications that are possible in this design space.
 In this paper, we present the Proactive Display (ProD) Framework, which allows for the easy construction of proactive display applications. It allows a range of proactive display applications, including ones already in the literature. ProD also enlarges the design space of proactive display systems by allowing a variety of new applications that incorporate different views of social life and community.
