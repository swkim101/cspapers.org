We propose a new weight compensation mechanism with a non-circular pulley and a spring. We show the basic principle and numerical design method to derive the shape of the non-circular pulley. After demonstration of the weight compensation for an inverted/ordinary pendulum system, we extend the same mechanism to a parallel five-bar linkage system, analyzing the required torques using transposed Jacobian matrices. Finally, we develop a three degree of freedom manipulator with relatively small output actuators and verified that the weight compensation mechanism significantly contributes to decrease static torques to keep the same posture within manipulator's work space.
