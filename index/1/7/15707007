Crowdsourcing is a new paradigm for utilizing the power of "crowds" of people to facilitate large scale tasks that are costly or time consuming with traditional methods. Crowdsourcing has enormous potential that can be truly unleashed when extended to sensor-rich mobile devices, such as smart phones. In this paper, we demonstrate mCrowd, an iPhone based mobile crowdsourcing platform that enables mobile users to post and work on sensor-related crowdsourcing tasks. mCrowd enables mobile users to fully utilize the rich sensors equipped with iPhone to participate and accomplish crowdsourcing tasks at fingertips, including geolocation-aware image collection, image tagging, road traffic monitoring, and others.
