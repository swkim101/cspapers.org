This paper demonstrates that singular configuration of a two-link robot arm is advantageous in doing the task of pulling or lifting up a heavy object with small joint torques. As a result of numerical optimization, the initial configuration that minimizes the joint torques necessary for the task is close to the singular configuration where the arm is stretched out. The singular configuration has the dynamic feature that the joint angle vector can be accelerated in a certain direction almost independently of the mass of the object. Then, the joint torques can generate large kinetic energy efficiently at the singular configuration, and the energy can be utilized to pull or lift up the object. The experimental results show that the dynamic feature is practically useful, even when a feedback control is applied in order to make the object follow a planned trajectory.
