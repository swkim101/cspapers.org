Conventional ultrasonic drills can drill into rocks using high frequency axial vibration, which feature lower power and lower preload force, thus they could become a very attractive solution for future deep-space exploration. However, drill cuttings cannot be removed effectively with the increase of drilling depth by conventional ultrasonic drills that only driven by longitudinal vibration. To address this issue, a Rotary-Percussive Ultrasonic Drill (RPUD) is proposed, which employs one single PZT transducer to generate rotary-percussive motion for rock fracturing. RPUD is composed of a PZT transducer, a percussive unit, a rotary unit, and a drill tool. The percussive unit enlarges the longitudinal vibration of front part of PZT transducer, and provides a reciprocating percussion to the drill tool. The rotary unit transforms longitudinal vibration of rear part of PZT transducer into longitudinal-torsional vibration to drive the drill tool to rotate continuously. The rotary and percussive motions are independent of each other, and can be adjusted separately. To make the rotary and percussive motions move synchronously, finite element method is employed to tune the resonance frequencies of the rotary unit and percussive unit to be close by transient analysis. Experimental results show that RPUD can improve removal efficiency of the drill cuttings due to its rotary motion, compared with conventional ultrasonic drills.
