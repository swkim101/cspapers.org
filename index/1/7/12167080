News websites give their users the opportunity to participate in discussions about published articles, by writing comments. Typically, these comments are unstructured making it hard to understand the flow of user discussions. Thus, there is a need for organizing comments to help users to (1) gain more insights about news topics, and (2) have an easy access to comments that trigger their interests. In this work, we address the above problem by organizing comments around the entities and the aspects they discuss. More specifically, we propose an approach for entity and aspect extraction from user comments through the following contributions. First, we extend traditional Named-Entity Recognition approaches, using coreference resolution and external knowledge bases, to detect more occurrences of entities in comments. Second, we exploit part-of-speech tag, dependency tag, and lexical databases to extract explicit and implicit aspects around discussed entities. Third, we evaluate our entity and aspect extraction approach, on manually annotated data, showing that it highly increases precision and recall compared to baseline approaches.
