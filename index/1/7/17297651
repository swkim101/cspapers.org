We address the problem of sharpness enhancement of images. Existing hierarchical techniques that decompose an image into a smooth image and high frequency components based on Gaussian filter and bilateral filter suffer from halo effects, whereas techniques based on weighted least squares extract low contrast features as detail. Other techniques require multiple images and are not tolerant to noise.
