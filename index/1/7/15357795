(MATH) We show the following: <ol> <li>For any ε ρ 0, (log n)<sup>(3 + ε)</sup>-term DNF cannot be polynomial-query learned with membership and strongly proper equivalence queries.</li> <li>For any function <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>) ε <i>o</i> [box] (&frac;<sup>√<i>n</i></sup> \over <sub>log <i>n</i></sub>) [end-box] , <i>m</i>-term DNF formulas cannot be polynomial-query learned by a membership and equivalence query algorithm that uses <i>m</i> &dotfill; <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>)-term DNF formulas as hypotheses.</li> <li>Read-thrice DNF formulas are not learnable with membership and proper equivalence queries.</li> <li>log <i>n</i>-term DNF formulas can be polynomial-query learned with membership and proper equivalence queries. (This complements a result of Bshouty, Goldman, Hancock, and Matar stating that [box] √log <i>n</i> [end-box] -term DNF can be so learned in polynomial <i>time</i>. </li></ol>.Using purely information theoretic techniques, these results extend and improve what is currently known. (For example, a weaker version of (a) was known only under a barely plausible complexity theoretic assumption, (b) was previously unknown, and (c) was known under the assumption P ‡ NP.)
