A foundational problem in semi-supervised learning is the construction of a graph underlying the data. We propose to use a method which optimally combines a number of differently constructed graphs. For each of these graphs we associate a basic graph kernel. We then compute an optimal combined kernel. This kernel solves an extended regularization problem which requires a joint minimization over both the data and the set of graph kernels. We present encouraging results on different OCR tasks where the optimal combined kernel is computed from graphs constructed with a variety of distances functions and the 'k' in nearest neighbors.
