This paper is about reusable, efficient implementations of complex algorithms and their integration into software packages. It seems that this problem is not yetwell understood, and that it is not at all clear how object-oriented and other approaches may contribute to a solution. We analyze the problem and try to reduce it to a few key design goals. Moreover, we discuss various existing approaches in light of these goals, and we briefly report experiences with experimental case studies, in which these goals were rigorously addressed.
