Previous work often used a pipelined framework where Chinese word segmentation is followed by term extraction and keyword extraction. Such framework suffers from error propagation and is unable to leverage information in later modules for prior components. In this paper, we propose a four-level Dirichlet Process based model (DP-4) to jointly learn the word distributions from the corpus, domain and document levels simultaneously. Based on the DP-4 model, a sentence-wise Gibbs sampler is adopted to obtain proper segmentation results. Meanwhile, terms and keywords are acquired in the sampling process. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our method.
