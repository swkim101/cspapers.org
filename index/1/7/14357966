This paper presents a speech understanding component for enabling robust situated human-robot communication. The aim is to gain semantic interpretations of utterances that serve as a basis for multi-modal dialog management also in cases where the recognized word-stream is not grammatically correct. For the understanding process, we designed semantic processable units, which are adapted to the domain of situated communication. Our framework supports the specific characteristics of spontaneous speech used in combination with gestures in a real world scenario. It also provides information about the dialog acts. Finally, we present a processing mechanism using these concept structures to generate the most likely semantic interpretation of the utterances and to evaluate the interpretation with respect to semantic coherence.
