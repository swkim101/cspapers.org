In this paper it is shown how the topic of BASED storage in PL/I can be used to illustrate a wide variety of concepts in intermediate level courses in data structures and programming languages. Because most instructors introduce the topic only from the point of view of a linked list, the true meaning of BASED storage and POINTERs is lost in the maze of practical problems which these features can be used to solve. Because BASED storage allows the programmer close access to physical storage, an understanding of these features goes a long way toward clarifying the behind the scenes actions involved in implementing and using data structures in high level languages.
