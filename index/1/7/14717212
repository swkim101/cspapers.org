We show lower bounds of Q( $ Sort(V)) for the I/Ocomplexity of graph theoretic problems like connected components, biconnected components, and minimum spanning trees, where E and V are the number of edges and vertices in the input graph, respectively. We also present a deterministic O($ Sort(V) â€™ max(l,loglog 9)) algorithm for the problem of graph connectivity, where B and D denote respectively the block size and number of disks. Our algorithm includes a breadth first search; this maybe of independent
