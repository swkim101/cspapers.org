Simplified models of the lateral geniculate nucles (LGN) and striate cortex illustrate the possibility that feedback to the LGN may be used for robust, low-level pattern analysis. The information fed back to the LGN is rebroadcast to cortex using the LGN's full fan-out, so the cortex→LGN→cortex pathway mediates extensive cortico-cortical communication while keeping the number of necessary connections small.
