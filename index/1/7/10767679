Ambiguity is an important concept for HCI because of its pervasiveness in everyday life, yet its emergent nature challenges the role of design. We examine these difficulties with regards to Aoki and Woodruff's [1] proposal to use ambiguity as a resource for designing space for stories in personal communication systems. We challenge certain assumptions about ambiguity and propose a set of design and evaluation guidelines that flow from this re-conceptualization of ambiguity and design.
