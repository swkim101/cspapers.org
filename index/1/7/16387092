A software system is described which aids in the design of digital processors with a topdown method. It takes the design language MIMOLA as its input. Input may be either a high level functional or a structural description of the hardware. The output is a description of the hardware on the block level. In the case of a high level functional input, the output contains a listing of the hardware which is necessary to execute the input together with utilization factors of the hardware units. The amount of creatable hardware may be limited in a declaration. If there is not enough hardware to execute the input statements in parallel, the necessary intermediate steps are inserted by the system and a corresponding functional description is presented.
