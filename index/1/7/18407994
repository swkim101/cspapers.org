Object identification is the problem of determining whether different observations correspond to the same object. It occurs in a wide variety of fields, including vision, natural language, citation matching, and information integration. Traditionally, the problem is solved separately for each pair of observations, followed by transitive closure. We propose solving it collectively, performing simultaneous inference for all candidate match pairs, and allowing information to propagate from one candidate match to another via the attributes they have in common. Our formulation is based on conditional random fields, and allows an optimal solution to be found in polynomial time using a graph cut algorithm. Parameters are learned using a voted perceptron algorithm. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that collective objective identification outperforms the standard approach.
