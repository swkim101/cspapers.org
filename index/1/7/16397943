The paper presents an approach to automatic annotation of learning objectsâ€™ (LOs) content units that we tested in TANGRAM, an integrated learning environment for the domain of Intelligent Information Systems. The paper mainly reports on the contentmining algorithms and heuristics applied for determining values of certain metadata elements used to annotate content units. Specifically, the focus is on the following elements: title, description, subject (based on a domain ontology), and pedagogical role (based on an ontology of instructional context).
