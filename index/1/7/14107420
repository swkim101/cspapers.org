This demonstration presents SharedDB, an implementation of a relational database system capable of executing all SQL operators by sharing computation and resources across all running queries. SharedDB sidesteps the traditional query-at-a-time approach and executes queries in batches. Unlike proposed multi-query optimization ideas, in SharedDB queries do not have to contain common subexpressions in order to be part of the same batch, which allows for a higher degree of sharing. By sharing as much as possible, SharedDB avoids repeating parts of computation that is common across all running queries. The goal of this demonstration is to show the ability of shared query execution to a) answer complex and diverse workloads, and b) reduce the interaction among concurrently executed queries that is observed in traditional systems and leads to performance deterioration and instabilities.
