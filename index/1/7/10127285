As the number of telephony voice applications grow, there will be a need for a browser to surf the Web of interconnected voice applications (called as VoiceSites). These VoiceSites are accessed through a telephone over an audio channel. We present the concept and architecture of T-Web Browser, a World Wide Telecom Web browser that enables browsing the Web of voice applications through an ordinary phone. This browser will support rich browsing features such as history and bookmarking.
