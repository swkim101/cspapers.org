In this paper, we describe a novel approach for representing state information for the purpose of intention recognition in cooperative human-robot environments. States are represented by a combination of spatial relationships in a Cartesian frame along with cardinal direction information. This approach is applied to a manufacturing kitting operation, where humans and robots are working together to develop kits. Based upon a set of predefined high-level states relationships that must be true for future actions to occur, a robot can use the detailed state information presented in this paper to infer the probability of subsequent actions occurring. This would enable the robot to better help the human with the operation or, at a minimum, better stay out of his or her way.
