This paper presents a control design based on the method of virtual constraints and hybrid zero dynamics to achieve stable running on MABEL, a planar biped with compliance. In particular, a time-invariant feedback controller is designed such that the closed-loop system not only respects the natural compliance of the open-loop system, but also enables active force control within the compliant hybrid zero dynamics and results in exponentially stable running gaits. The compliant-hybrid-zero-dynamics-based controller with active force control is implemented experimentally and shown to realize stable running gaits on MABEL at an average speed of 1.95 m/s (4.4 mph) and a peak speed of 3.06 m/s (6.8 mph). The obtained gait has flight phases upto 39% of the gait, and an estimated ground clearance of 7.5 - 10 cm.
