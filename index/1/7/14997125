Enterprises are looking to find new and cost effective means to leverage existing investments in IT infrastructure and incorporate new capabilities in order to improve business productivity. As a means to improve the integration of applications hosted both internal and external to the enterprise, enterprises are turning to Service Oriented Architectures.In this paper, we describe some of the major aspects associated with the introduction of a Service Oriented Architecture and the impact that it can have on an enterprise's information architecture. We outline the concept of exposing data sources as services and discuss the critical integration aspects that need to be addressed including data access, data transformation, and integration into an over arching enterprise security scheme. The paper suggests alternatives, utilizing a Service Oriented Architecture approach, to promote flexible, extensible, and evolvable information architectures.
