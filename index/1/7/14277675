A taxonomy for gesture-based interaction between a human and a group (swarm) of robots is described. Methods are classified into two categories. First, free-form interaction, where the robots are unconstrained in position and motion and the user can use deictic gestures to select subsets of robots and assign target goals and trajectories. Second, shape-constrained interaction, where the robots are in a configuration shape that can be modified by the user. In the later, the user controls a subset of meaningful degrees of freedom defining the overall shape instead of each robot directly. A multi-robot interactive display is described where a depth sensor is used to recognize human gesture, determining the commands sent to a group comprising tens of robots. Experimental results with a preliminary user study show the usability of the system.
