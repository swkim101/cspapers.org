The Hamming and the edit metrics are two common notions of measuring distances between pairs of strings x,y lying in the Boolean hypercube. The edit distance between x and y is defined as the minimum number of character insertion, deletion, and bit flips needed for converting x into y. Whereas, the Hamming distance between x and y is the number of bit flips needed for converting x to y. In this paper we study a randomized injective embedding of the edit distance into the Hamming distance with a small distortion. We show a randomized embedding with quadratic distortion. Namely, for any x,y satisfying that their edit distance equals k, the Hamming distance between the embedding of x and y is O(k2) with high probability. This improves over the distortion ratio of O( n * n) obtained by Jowhari (2012) for small values of k. Moreover, the embedding output size is linear in the input size and the embedding can be computed using a single pass over the input. We provide several applications for this embedding. Among our results we provide a one-pass (streaming) algorithm for edit distance running in space O(s) and computing edit distance exactly up-to distance s1/6. This algorithm is based on kernelization for edit distance that is of independent interest.
