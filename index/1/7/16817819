The paper presents a task-priority motion planning algorithm for a balancing robot, derived from the endogenous configuration space approach. The motion planning problem is composed of three sub-tasks. Firstly, the robot has to reach a desirable point in task space (proper motion planning). Secondly, the upward position of the robot torso should be maintained during the motion. Thirdly, the motion should save the control energy. Performance of our algorithm is presented in simulations.
