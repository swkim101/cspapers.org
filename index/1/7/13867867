An effective approach to detecting anomalous points in a data setis distance-based outlier detection. This paper describes a simplesampling algorithm to effciently detect distance-based outliers indomains where each and every distance computation is veryexpensive. Unlike any existing algorithms, the sampling algorithmrequires a xed number of distance computations and can return goodresults with accuracy guarantees. The most computationallyexpensive aspect of estimating the accuracy of the result issorting all of the distances computed by the sampling algorithm.The experimental study on two expensive domains as well as tenadditional real-life datasets demonstrates both the effciency andeffectiveness of the sampling algorithm in comparison with thestate-of-the-art algorithm and there liability of the accuracyguarantees.
