The paper considers the modular programming with hierarchically structured multi-processor tasks on top of SPMD tasks for distributed memory machines. The parallel execution requires a corresponding decomposition of the set of processors into a hierarchical group structure onto which the tasks are mapped. This results in a multi-level group SPMD computation model with varying processor group structures. The advantage of this kind of mixed task and data parallelism is a potential to reduce the communication overhead and to increase scalability. We present a runtime library to support the coordination of hierarchically structured multi-processor tasks. The library exploits an extended parallel group SPMD programming model and manages the entire task execution including the dynamic hierarchy of processor groups. The library is built on top of MPI, has an easy-to-use interface, and leads to only a marginal overhead while allowing static planning and dynamic restructuring.
