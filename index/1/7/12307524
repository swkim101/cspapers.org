The rapid advancements of networking technology have boosted potential bandwidth to the point that the cabling is no longer the bottleneck. Rather, the bottlenecks lie at the crossing points, the nodes of the network, where data traffic is intercepted or forwarded. As a result, there has been tremendous interest in speeding those nodes, making the equipment run faster by means of specialized chips to handle data trafficking. The Network Processor is the blanket name thrown over such chips in their varied forms. To date, no performance data exist to aid in the decision of what processor architecture to use in next generation network processor. Our goal is to remedy this situation. In this study, we characterize both the application workloads that network processors need to support as well as emerging applications that we anticipate may be supported in the future. Then, we consider the performance of three sample benchmarks drawn from these workloads on several state-of-the-art processor architectures, including: an aggressive, out-of-order, speculative super-scalar processor, a fine-grained multithreaded processor, a single chip multiprocessor, and a simultaneous multithreaded processor (SMT). The network interface environment is simulated in detail, and our results indicate that SMT is the architecture best suited to this environment.
