We describe an implicit data structure for <italic>n</italic> multikey records that supports searching for a record, under any key, in the asymptotically optimal search time <italic>&Ogr;</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>). This improves on [Mun87] in which Munro describes an implicit data structure for the problem of storing <italic>n k</italic>-key records so that search on any key can be performed in <italic>&Ogr;</italic>(log<supscrpt><italic>k</italic></supscrpt> <italic>n</italic>(log log <italic>n</italic>)<supscrpt><italic>k</italic>-1</supscrpt>) comparisons. The theoretical tools we develop also yield practical schemes that either halve the number of memory references over obvious solutions to the non-implicit version of the problem, or alternatively reduce the number of pointers involved significantly.
