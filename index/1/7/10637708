Calibration is a classical issue in computer vision needed to retrieve 3D information from image measurements. This work presents a calibration approach for hybrid stereo rig involving multiple central camera types (perspective, fisheye, catadioptric). The paper extends the method of monocular perspective camera calibration using virtual visual servoing. The simultaneous intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of central cameras rig, using different models for each camera, is developed. The presented approach is suitable for the calibration of rigs composed by N cameras modelled by N different models. Calibration results, compared with state of the art approaches, and a 3D plane estimation application, allowed by the calibration, show the effectiveness of the approach. A cross-platform software implementing this method is available1.
