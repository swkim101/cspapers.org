A template layout problem of great interest is to determine the maximum number of two-dimensional shapes that can be cut from a sheet of stock material without having to search through all possible arrangements. An algorithm is proposed to computerize the layout of parts on a stock sheet in order to minimize waste. The method can be extended to three-dimensional shapes.
