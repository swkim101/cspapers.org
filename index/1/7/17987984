When a mobile manipulator functions as an assistive device, the robot's initial configuration and the configuration of the environment can impact the robot's ability to provide effective assistance. Selecting initial configurations for assistive tasks can be challenging due to the high number of degrees of freedom of the robot, the environment, and the person, as well as the complexity of the task. In addition, rapid selection of initial conditions can be important, so that the system will be responsive to the user and will not require the user to wait a long time while the robot makes a decision. To address these challenges, we present Task-centric initial Configuration Selection (TCS), which unlike previous work uses a measure of task-centric manipulability to accommodate state estimation error, considers various environmental degrees of freedom, and can find a set of configurations from which a robot can perform a task. TCS performs substantial offline computation, so that it can rapidly provide solutions at run time. At run time, the system performs an optimization over candidate initial configurations using a utility function that can include factors such as movement costs for the robot's mobile base. To evaluate TCS, we created models of 11 activities of daily living (ADLs) and evaluated TCS's performance with these 11 assistive tasks in a computer simulation of a PR2, a robotic bed, and a model of a human body. TCS performed as well or better than a baseline algorithm in all of our tests against state estimation error.
