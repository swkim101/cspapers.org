of the implication is defined as the distance. The certainty is defined as the complement of the uncertainty. The function F in formulae 2 is defined as the product of two implications, Suppose that a document D={ (tl ,al),(t&a2),(t3,a3)), and a query Q={ (tt ,bt),(td,bd)}, where ti is a term, ai and bi are respectively the weight of the term ti in the document and the query (for simplicity we suppose Cai=l, Cbi=l)-The Q is not totally satisfied in D, for the second part t4 is not explained in D. So the Q has to be reduced into Qn={(tl,bl)} in removing t4 from the query. In Qn there is only one the term tl which is satisfied in D. The distance from Q to Qn is then: so d(Q,Qn) = bZ/(bl +bz) = b2 = 1-bl P(D+Q) = I-d(Q,Qn) = bl Similar to the evaluation of D+Q, we get: d(D,Dn) = (a2+a3) / (al+aZ+a3) = al+a2 = l-at P(Q+D) = I-d(D,Dn) = al Then, R(D,Q) = P(D+Q) * J?(Q+D) = al-b1 When the query is a conjunction of two sub-queries Q = Qr V Qz, it is considered that, if one of the sub-queries matches (in specificity and exhaustivity) a document, then the whole query matches the document. In the other words, we have the following inequations: WD,Q) 2 WQQO R(D,Q) 2 R(QQ2) Then the correspondance of the query can be evaluated by: WQQ) = MAWWD,QO, WAQ2)J Suppose a query as below: Q = Ql V Q2 = [ (tl,bl),(t%b4)} V { (&c2),(t5,c5)] (where bl+b4=1 and c2+c5=1) As in the above exampIe, R(D,Ql) and R(D,Q2) are respectively evaluated into: R(D,QI) = al.bi R(D,Q2) = a2c2 Then R(D,Q) = MAX(aI.61, a~-c2) These correspondence measurements are part of those in a fuzzy request model (see [B0080]). All the evaluation equations in this model may be generated in a similar way from our model. This will not be show here.
