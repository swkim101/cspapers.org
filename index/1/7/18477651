Today's web applications demand very high release cycles--and consequently, frequent tests. Automating these tests typically requires a behavior model: A description of the states the application can be in, the transitions between these states, and the expected results. Furthermore one needs scripts to make the abstract actions (transitions) in the model executable. However, specifying such behavior models and writing the necessary scripts manually is a hard task. We present ProCrawl (Process Crawler), a tool that automatically mines (extended) finite-state machines from (multi-user) web applications and generates executable test scripts. ProCrawl explores the behavior of the application by systematically generating program runs and observing changes on the application's user interface. The resulting models can be directly used for effective model-based testing, in particular regression testing.
