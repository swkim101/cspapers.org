Ubiquitous computing is characterized by the merger of physical and virtual worlds as physical artifacts gain digital sensing, processing, and communication capabilities. Maintaining an appropriate level of privacy in the face of such complex and often highly dynamic systems is challenging. We argue that context awareness not only enables novel UbiComp applications but can also support dynamic regulation and configuration of privacy mechanisms. We propose a higher level context model that abstracts from low level details and contains only privacy relevant context features. Context changes in our model can trigger reconfiguration of privacy mechanisms or facilitate context-specific privacy recommendations to the user. Based on our model, we analyze potential privacy implications of context changes and discuss how these results could inform actual reconfiguration of privacy mechanisms.
