This paper presents a new method for 'perception-action' behavior control of a mobile robot in uncertain environments using fuzzy logic. 'Perception-action' behavior control suffers from two significant problems: 1. The quantitative formulation of 'perception-action' behaviors; 2. The efficient coordination of conflicts and competitions among multiple behaviors. The main idea of the present study is to incorporate fuzzy logic control with behavior-based control such that: 'perception-action' behaviors are formulated by fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules; conflicts and competitions among different behaviors are coordinated by fuzzy reasoning. Simulation results show that the proposed method can be applied to efficient robot navigation in complex and unknown environments by weighting multiple behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles, following edges, and moving to a target, and so forth. In addition, this method is suitable for robot navigation by multisensor fusion and integration.<<ETX>>
