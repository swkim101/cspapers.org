This work presents an optimum approach to design PID controllers. The primary design goal is to obtain good load disturbance response by minimizing the integral absolute control error. At the same time, the transient response is guaranteed by minimizing the maximum overshoot, settling time, rise time of step response. This study proposes a solution algorithm based on the ant colony optimization technique to determine the parameters of the PID controller for getting a well performance for a given plant. Simulation results demonstrate that better control performance can be achieved in comparison with known methods
