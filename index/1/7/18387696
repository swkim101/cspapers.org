Previous methods mostly apply the relations in the knowledge base, without fully utilizing the contents, i.e., the attributes of concepts in knowledge base. In this paper, we propose a content-structural relation inference method (CSRI) which integrates the content and structural information between concepts for relation inference. Experiments on data sets show that CSRI obtains 15% improvement compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
