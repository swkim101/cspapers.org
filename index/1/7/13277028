Roles have a limited use within object-oriented (OO) analysis and design. In extending OO concepts to agentoriented software engineering (AOSE), roles must be adapted to incorporate autonomy and other agent essentials. In this paper, we present our perspective on roles and how to specify them. We also introduce an extension to roles for design, namely agent classes. We describe how roles and agent classes can be used in practice during the requirements and architectural phases of AOSE.
