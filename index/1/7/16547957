We propose a protocol for intellectual property protection by watermarking the selection of register scan chain during the sequential logic test generation design-for-test step. The watermark, a user-specific digital signature, is embedded into the design by restricting and/or forcing specific registers to appear in the chain of scan registers. Therefore, selection enforcement is enabled by imposing additional signature-specific constraints on the design. This approach to intellectual property protection has a serious advantage with respect to the existing techniques: it does not require reverse engineering of the design. Copyright fraud detection can be performed by inserting a standard set of test vectors and receiving a set of outputs from the scan chain uniquely dependent upon the embedded signature.
