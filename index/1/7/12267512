In this demo, we propose to use multiple inexpensive off-the-shelf radios to build the FAIR system that can be flexibly configured to realize (1) non-contiguous spectrum access (2) MIMO and beamforming (3) constructing wider-band radio. While non-contiguous spectrum access and MIMO/beamforming are naturally supported by the FAIR system, we further develop radio bonding technique for constructing wider-band radio. Radio bonding provides a cost effective alternative to proprietory radio development that it can realize a non-existing wider-band radio using multiple commodity narrower-band radios. We demonstrate FAIR and radio bonding based on Sora 2.0.
