In this paper we consider the confidentiality aspects of particular Grid's ap plications such as, for ex- ample, genetic applications. The search of DNA similarities is one of the interestin g areas of genetic biology. However, DNA sequences comparisons need greedy and sensitive computations. We propose a model allowing to search DNA similarities in a public DNA database on the Grid. The model is related to the private approximate string matching problem where neither the inputs nor the outputs of the comparisons are revealed. We analyze the performance of our proposed DNA disguising method by taking into account how the edit distances between the client's queries and their corresponding disguises are distributed along th e DNA sequences.
