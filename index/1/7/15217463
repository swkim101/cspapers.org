This paper describes a non-field-of-view (NFOV) localization approach for a mobile robot in an unknown environment based on an acoustic signal combined with the geometrical information from an optical sensor. The approach estimates the location of a target through the mobile robot's sensor observation frame, which consists of a combination of diffraction and reflection acoustic signals and a 3-D environment geometrical description. This fusion of audio-visual sensor observation likelihoods allows the robot to estimate the NFOV target. The diffraction and reflection observations from the microphone array generate the acoustic joint observation likelihood. The observed geometry also determines far-field or near-field acoustic conditions to improve the estimation of the sound direction of arrival. A mobile robot equipped with a microphone array and an RGB-D sensor was tested in a controlled environment, an anechoic chamber, to demonstrate the NFOV localization capabilities. This resulted in +/- 18 degrees, and less than 0.75 m error in angle and distance estimation, respectively.
