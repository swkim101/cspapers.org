In data-intensive real-time embedded applications, it is desirable to process data service requests in a timely manner using fresh data, consuming less power. However, related work is relatively scarce. In this paper, we present an effective approach to decrease both the deadline miss ratio and power consumption by merging similar real-time transactions, while systematically adapting the data freshness. In a simulation study, our approach considerably reduces deadline misses and power consumptions compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, supporting the required data freshness.
