This research note suggests that before we design hardware or software for the task of problem solving, we re-evaluate the task of problem solving in terms of the linguistic constituents which will be required and the manner in which these linguistic constituents will be combined. Utilizing the principles of composition and abstraction-to-specifics, we conclude that all data and programs might be realized in a structured format called messages. We conclude with a few preliminary thoughts and questions as to how an architecture designed for such structured operands and operators might be designed.
