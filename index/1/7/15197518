This paper presents a 3D laser scanner that can gaze at an arbitrary region. By modulating the secondary rotation speed of roundly swinging 3D laser scanner, it gazes at a specific region and measures with high density measurement points. The proposed method uses a secondary rotation motor to control the measurement point density and no extra motor is required. The 3D scanner can keep the field of view of and scan cycle time while gazing at any region. The system is evaluated on experimental targets for different scenarios using a mobile robot.
