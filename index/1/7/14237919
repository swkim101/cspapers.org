This paper is the first in a sequence of papers which will prove the existence of a random polynomial time algorithm for the set of primes. The techniques used are from arithmetic algebraic geometry and to a lesser extent algebraic and analytic number theory. The result complements the well known result of Strassen and Soloway that there exists a random polynomial time algorithm for the set of composites.
