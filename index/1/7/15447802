In this paper, we discuss a decision-theoretic strategy for surveillance as a rst step towards automating the planning of the movement of an autonomous surveillance robot. We extend a previous proposal by including some heuris-tics based on an abstract representation of the environment. We show, using a concrete example , how these heuristics allow computation-ally feasible, nite look-ahead versions of the decision-theoretic strategy to escape local minima , and to better approximate globally optimal solutions.
