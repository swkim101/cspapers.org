Quasi-Behavioral Objectives supersede the usual course descriptions, as are found in Curriculum 68 and college curriculum syllabi, by also describing the required behavior of the student and the learning level in the specified content area. The specification of an entire curriculum based on these objectives facilitates a smooth interfacing of courses, both in the hierarchy of course materials and in the progressive skill levels of the students. The development process for the creation of a curriculum specification based on Quasi-Behavioral Objectives is described and uses of these objectives beyond curriculum specification alone are suggested.
