In this paper, we discuss in-person or face-to-face grading: what it is, a rationale for its use, our use of it, and an experiment we conducted to evaluate its use. While no statistically significant differences in instructional outcome effects were found, several interesting affective results were seen. Additionally, a number of research methodological suggestions arose from the study.
