Despite all the progress that has been made in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, traditional approaches seem unsuitable to build truly intelligent robots, exhibiting human-like behaviours. Many authors agree that the source of intelligence is, to a great extent, the use of a huge memory, where sequences of events that guide our later behaviour are stored. Inspired by that idea, our approach is to navigate a robot using sequences of images stored in a Sparse Distributed Memory-a kind of associative memory based on the properties of high dimensional binary spaces, which, in theory, exhibits some human-like behaviours. The robot showed good ability to correctly follow most of the sequences learnt, with small errors and good immunity to the kidnapped robot problem.
