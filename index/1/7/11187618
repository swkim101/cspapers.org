In this paper, we introduce a new type of integrity constraint, which we call a statistical constraint, and discuss its applicability to enhancing database correctness. Statistical constraints manifest embedded relationships among current attribute values in the database and are characterized by their probabilistic nature. They can be used to detect potential errors not easily detected by the conventional constraints. Methods for extracting statistical constraints from a relation and enforcement of such constraints are described. Preliminary performance evaluation of enforcing statistical constraints on a real life database is also presented.
