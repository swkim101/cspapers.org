Presented is the design of a flexible expandable multi-processor system for video graphics and image processing. The design involves a central controller which broadcasts data to a variable number of independently executing processing units, each of which in turn controls a variable number of memory units among which the video (frame buffer) image is distributed. An interleaved addressing organization of the video memories guarantees both an even workload distribution as well as maintenance of image coherence for each processing element. Execution speed and image resolution can be independently altered (at any time) by varying the number of processing and memory units. Sample applications of the system—for rapid line drawing and “electronic scene generation” (visible surface algorithms)—are described. Variations of the design for low cost and for powerful, real-time configurations are outlined.
