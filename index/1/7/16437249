Immediately or soon after an introductory course in programming, traditional computer science education usually includes a course on data structures. Such courses, however, have suffered from a lack of non-textual materials for classroom and non-classroom use. Consequently, it is difficult for students to comprehend the abstractions involved in implementing and applying fundamental data structures without laboriously employing printed materials.
The work discussed herein addresses the problem by developing software for the IBM PC that will allow data structure users to view graphically the effects of primitive operations and application programs on basic data structures. Several such structures and applications are examined and plans for a program interface are discussed.
