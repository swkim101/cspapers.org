This paper describes a method for finding structural matching between parallel sentences of two languages, (such as Japanese and English). Parallel sentences are analyzed based on unification grammars, and structural matching is performed by making use of a similarity measure of word pairs in the two languages. Syntactic ambiguities are resolved simultaneously in the matching process. The results serve as a useful source for extracting linguistic and lexical knowledge.
