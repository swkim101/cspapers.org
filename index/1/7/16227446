The major problems associated with LSI design include those of design complexity, documentation, mapping, design verification both functional and physical, physical implementation, and the manufacturing interface. The Design Aids group at Burroughs, Cumbernauld, have developed an integrated LSI design system, CELTIC, which solves these problems with a polycell design approach, direct graphics entry of logic diagrams, and automatic generation of LSI layouts. The system reduces the time required to lay out LSI's from months to weeks.
