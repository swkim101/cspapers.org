The standard Support Vector Machine formulation does not provide its user with the ability to explicitly control the number of support vectors used to define the generated classifier. We present a modified version of SVM that allows the user to set a budget parameter B and focuses on minimizing the loss attained by the B worst-classified examples while ignoring the remaining examples. This idea can be used to derive sparse versions of both L1-SVM and L2-SVM. Technically, we obtain these new SVM variants by replacing the 1-norm in the standard SVM formulation with various interpolation-norms. We also adapt the SMO optimization algorithm to our setting and report on some preliminary experimental results.
