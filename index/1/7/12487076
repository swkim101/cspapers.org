We investigate multi-agent epistemic modal logic with common knowledge modalities for groups of agents and obtain van Benthem style model-theoretic characterisations, in terms of bisimulation invariance of classical first-order logic over the non-elementary classes of (finite or arbitrary) common knowledge Kripke frames. The fixpoint character of common knowledge modalities and the r√¥le that reachability and transitive closures play for the derived accessibility relations take our analysis beyond classical model-theoretic terrain and technically pose a novel challenge to the analysis of model-theoretic games. Over and above the more familiar locality-based techniques we exploit a specific structure theory for specially adapted Cayley groups: through the association of agents with sets of generators, all epistemic frames can be represented up to bisimilarity by suitable Cayley groups with specific acyclicity properties; these support a locality analysis at different levels of granularity as induced by distance measures w.r.t. various coalitions of agents.
