In this demo, we present some exemplary applications for INGA, a new and affordable wireless sensor node for general applications. INGA's hardware design is completely under open source license and it runs the open source operating system Contiki "out of the box". Several up-to-date sensors are included in the basic design and we developed it for research, medical applications and universal usage.
