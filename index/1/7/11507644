A well-known bottleneck of contemporary mobile devices is the inefficient and error-prone touchscreen keyboard. In this paper, we propose UbiK, an alternative portable text-entry method that allows user to make keystrokes on conventional surfaces, e.g., wood desktop. UbiK enables text-input experience similar to that on a physical keyboard, but it only requires a keyboard outline printed on the surface or a piece of paper atop. The core idea is to leverage the microphone on a mobile device to accurately localize the keystrokes. To achieve fine-grained, centimeter scale granularity, UbiK extracts and optimizes the location-dependent multipath fading features from the audio signals, and takes advantage of the dual-microphone interface to improve signal diversity. We implement UbiK as an Android application. Our experiments demonstrate that UbiK is able to achieve above 95% of localization accuracy. Field trial involving first-time users shows that UbiK can significantly improve text-entry speed over current on-screen keyboards.
