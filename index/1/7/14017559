Conceptual programming means having programmers work directly with their models of how their system is put together. It means providing them with the means for designing, coding and maintaining systems on a computer using the pictures and text they normally use on paper. An environment for conceptual programming requires flexibility to support a wide range of languages and graphics to support languages based on pictures. The GARDEN system is a prototype conceptual programming environment that uses an object-oriented framework to meet these requirements.
