The work presented in this research paper concentrates on the issues of determining the way of schema integration and knowledge organization to support interoperation in multidatabase systems (MDBSS). In particular the structure of the Data Correspondence Descriptor (DCD) is addressed aa the part of the knowledge base of each database to store schema correspondences and conflict resolutions. We also describe an experimental CABLE system, which demonstrates a configurable approach for object sharing among multiple database systems based their associated knowledge base. organizing inter-schema correspondences and object sharing. To demonstrate the methodology and techniques, we have developed a software prototype called CABLE a configurable approach for object sharing among multiple objectoriented database systems. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section â€˜2 gives an overview of our multidatabase structure. In Section 3, we outline the classification of correspondence between types, attributes and methods. Section-4 proposes a way to organize the inter-schema correspondences using data correspondence descriptor (DCD) approach. Section 5 explains the CABLE prototype to demonstrate our methodology discussed in this paper. Finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions and future research direct ions.
