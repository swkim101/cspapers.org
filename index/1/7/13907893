In this work, we investigate the problem of automatically inferring the lattice structure of near-regular textures (NRT) in real-world images. Our technique leverages the PatchMatch algorithm for finding k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) correspondences in an image. We use these kNNs to recover an initial estimate of the 2D wallpaper basis vectors, and seed vertices of the texture lattice. We iteratively expand this lattice by solving an MRF optimization problem. We show that we can discretize the space of good solutions for the MRF using the kNNs, allowing us to efficiently and accurately optimize the MRF energy function using the Particle Belief Propagation algorithm. We demonstrate our technique on a benchmark NRT dataset containing a wide range of images with geometric and photometric variations, and show that our method clearly outperforms the state of the art in terms of both texel detection rate and texel localization score.
