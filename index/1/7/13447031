Most of the current recommender systems heavily rely on explicit user feedback such as ratings on items to model users' interests. However, in many applications, it is very hard to collect the explicit feedback, while implicit feedback such as user clicks may be more available. Furthermore, it is often more suitable for many recommender systems to address a ranking problem than a rating predicting problem. This paper proposes a latent pairwise preference learning (LPPL) approach for recommendation with implicit feedback. LPPL directly models user preferences with respect to a set of items rather than the rating scores on individual items, which are modeled with a set of features by analyzing clickthrough data available in many real-world recommender systems. The LPPL approach models both the latent variables of group structure of users and the pairwise preferences simultaneously. We conduct experiments on the testbed from a real-world recommender system and demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively improve the recommendation performance against several baseline algorithms.
