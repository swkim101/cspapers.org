This paper reports on theoretical investigations about the assumptions underlying the inverse document frequency (idf). We show that an intuitive idf-based probability function for the probability of a term being informative assumes disjoint document events. By assuming documents to be independent rather than disjoint, we arrive at a Poisson-based probability of being informative. The framework is useful for understanding and deciding the parameter estimation and combination in probabilistic retrieval models.
