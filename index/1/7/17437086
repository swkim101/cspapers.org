Query length has generally been regarded as a query-specific constant that does not affect document ranking. In this paper, we reveal that query length actually interacts with term frequency (TF) normalization, a key component of all effective retrieval models. Specifically, the longer the query is, the smaller the TF decay speed should be. In order to study the impact of query length, we present a desirable formal constraint to capture the heuristic of query length for retrieval. Our constraint analysis shows that current state-of-the-art retrieval functions, including BM25 and language models, fail to satisfy the constraint, and that, in order to solve this problem, the TF normalization component in a retrieval function should be adapted to query length. As an application, we develop a simple regression algorithm to adapt BM25 to query length, and demonstrate its effectiveness on several representative TREC collections.
