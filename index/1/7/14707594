Co-training, a popular semi-supervised learning technique, is severely limited as it applicable only to datasets which have a natural division of the feature space into two or more distinct views. In this paper, we investigate techniques to apply co-training to single-view data sets. We develop a view learning technique which takes a single view dataset and learns multiple views. These learned views balance the available discriminatory information in the dataset, while still meeting Blum's co-training criteria. In addition, we constrain the views such that pairs of learned view embedding functions exhibit sparsity in a complementary pattern, which aid in increasing diversity. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach via experimental means on several real-world datasets from different domains.
