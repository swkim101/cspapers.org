At large-scale urban earthquake disaster, human search is the most important process in rescue activities. This research develops a parallel cable-driven robot focusing on information acquisition from sky at crushed structures at landslide caused by huge earthquake. This robot is driven by multiple cables to move a sensor head with 6 degrees of freedom. This paper proposes the concept of this new search system, and illustrates usefulness of the human body searching strategy by several experimental results.
