Recent workshops have explored commonality among the points of view of AL, DBMS and programming language researchers. On the surface, it would appear that DBMS researchers are building smarter data base systems and that AL researchers are building expert systems containing a knowledge base. However, it appears that there is minimal commonality to the points of view expressed by these communities. Therefore, the author is dubious of any significant cross fertilisation. He illustrates a few differences in points of view in the two communities by 3 examples.
