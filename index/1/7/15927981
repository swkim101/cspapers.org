In this paper we propose a new hierarchical structure for describing 5-0 objects, called the Prism Tree. This ternar tree structure, inspired from the planar Strip Tree, is built from an initial trianguiation of the object by using a polyhedral approximation algorithm. Different properties of this representation are shown, as well as algorithms for intersecting objects and neighbor finding techniques.
