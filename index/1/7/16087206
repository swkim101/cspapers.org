This report describes experiences in porting the Perfect Benchmarks programs to the Alliant FX/8 and Cedar machines. Although there is much to learn before we can really say we know how to optimize programs successfully for parallel computers in general and for hierarchical shared-memory architectures in particular, it is hoped that this report will be helpful to those who are beginning to port and transform programs for parallel machines. Perhaps it is even an interesting reference for experts. In addition, this paper summarizes our experience with the programming tools we used and discusses tools that could have helped to increase the productivity of the optimization process. This information is believed to be a useful basis for future tool development projects.
