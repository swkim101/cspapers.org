This paper reports on an experience in using the inverted-lecture model ("flipping the classroom") in computer architecture. The first author concurrently taught two courses in computer architecture. One of these courses was CSC/ECE 506: Architecture of Parallel Computers, an introductory Graduate-level course, taught via lecture both residentially and distance-ed. The other was the CSC 456: Computer Architecture and Multiprocessing, a senior-level undergraduate course which was "flipped." Students in the inverted-lecture class exhibited high levels of engagement. Their performance on exams was not quite up to the level of the students in the graduate class, but the difference was not wide. From this experience, we offer observations and suggestions about inverted classes in general.
