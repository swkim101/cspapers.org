In this paper, technology mapping algorithmsfor minimizing power consumption in FPGA design are studied.The technology mapping problem for power minimizationhas been shown to be NP-complete.Furthermore, thereare other important objectives, such as the number of PLBs(Programmable Logic Blocks), the number of levels and soon, that should also be optimized simultaneously.We proposea transformational approach in which we start with amapping solution which optimizes certain objective(s) (e.g., the number of PLBs.)The mapping solution is then transformedto reduce the power consumption while keeping thenumber of PLBs fixed.Our algorithm explores the possibilitiesof transforming the functionality of the PLBs so thatthe switching densities of the output edges of the PLBs willbe reduced, leading to a reduction in total power consumption.Our transformational approach can also be viewed as are-engineering approach in which power reduction is achievedthrough re-routing after the PLBs have been placed, utilizingeffectively the capability of a PLB to realize any booleanfunction of up to k variables.
