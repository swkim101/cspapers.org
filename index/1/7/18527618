We present some original automatic partitioning techniques for irregular sparse matrices arising from Finite-Element discretizations of PDE. We discuss their efficiency in terms of parallel computation, especially from the point of view of adaptive applications, that need rebalancing after small changes on the grid. Some parallel simulations are presented, along with practical experiments on a KSR and a SGI-Challenge.
