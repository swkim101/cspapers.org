This paper describes a novel approach that can be used to determine the focal object that a robot is looking at and introduces the unique robotic eye, AttractiveEye. Humans have the visual input mechanism but do not have the output mechanism concerning the visual signal except gestures. AttractiveEye can communicate information regarding the color of an object by changing its color to match that of the object. Thus, from the color of this robot, we can determine the focal object that it is looking at. We carry out a human-robot interaction experiment to show that human-robot interaction can be made easier by using AttractiveEye.
