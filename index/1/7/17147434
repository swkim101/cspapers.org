In this paper, we introduce a new time-memory-data trade-off attack which can perform better than existing ones by Biryukov-Shamir (BS-TMD [1]), Hong-Sarkar (HS-TMD [8]) and Dunkelman-Keller (DK-TMD [5]). Current Estream ciphers are resistant to these attacks because the state size is too big for the BS-TMD attack, while the pre-processing is at least as expensive as exhaustive search for the HS-TMD and DK-TMD attacks.
