Wikidata is one of most successful knowledge graphs ever created. It expresses knowledge in the form of subject-property-value statements accompanied by provenance information. A project of the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikidata is supported by a community of currently 19 thousand active users and 234 bots, who together are responsible for editing more than 45 million entities since the start of the project in 2012. This makes Wikidata a prime example for what human-in-the-loop technology can achieve. In this talk, we are going to present several studies that aim to understand the links between its socio-technical fabric and its success.
