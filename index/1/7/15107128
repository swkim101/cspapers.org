Suppose that <italic>f</italic> is computed by a constant depth circuit with 2<italic>m</italic> AND-, OR-, and NOT-gates, and <italic>m</italic> majority-gates. We prove that <italic>f</italic> is computed by a constant depth circuit with 2<supscrpt><italic>m</italic></supscrpt><supscrpt>o(1)</supscrpt> AND-, OR-, and NOT-gates, and a single majority-gate, which is at the root.
One consequence is that if <italic>f</italic> is computed by and AC<supscrpt>0</supscrpt> circuit plus polylog majority-gates, then <italic>f</italic> is computed by a probabilistic perceptron having polylog order. Another consequence is that if <italic>f</italic> agrees with the parity function of three-fourths of all inputs, then <italic>f</italic>cannot be computed by a constant depth circuit  with 2<supscrpt><italic>n</italic></supscrpt><supscrpt>o(1)</supscrpt> AND-, OR-, and NOT-gates, and <italic>n</italic><supscrpt>o(1)</supscrpt> majority-gates.
