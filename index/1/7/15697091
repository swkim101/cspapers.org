This paper investigates the running control problem for the 7-link, 6-actuator planar bipedal robot including ankle joints. The control strategy is based on the “synchronization structure” with the angular momentum of the pivot point. The synchronization not only follows the simplified joint angle dynamics of human running but also generates the uniform running speed from wide range of initial speed, which claims that the controller is robust for the error of initial speed. Moreover, it successfully verifies the acceleration of running speed from 0.1[m/s], which is almost zero speed, to a uniform running speed “without” switching controllers. Finally, the controller is applied for the running on an uneven terrain, and it successfully achieves running with the maximum slope angle 6[deg], which is highly steep terrain in the real situation.
