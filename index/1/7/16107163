In this paper, we discuss the modeling of the kinematics and dynamics of compliant contact between bodies moving in Euclidean space. First, we derive the kinematic equations describing the motion of the contact point when two rigid bodies are rolling on each other. Secondly, we extend these results to describe the motion of the closest points between two rigid bodies moving freely in space. Then, we use these results to model compliant contact between bodies, using a spatial spring and a damper to model energy stored and dissipated during contact.
