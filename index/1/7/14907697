Mobile robots with reconfigurable chassis are able to traverse unstructured outdoor environments with boulders or rubble, and overcome challenging structures in urban environments, like stairs or steps. Autonomously traversing rough terrain and such obstacles while ensuring the safety of the robot is a challenging task in mobile robotics. In this paper we introduce a two-phase motion planning algorithm for actively reconfigurable tracked robots. We first use the completeness of a graph search on a regular grid to quickly find an initial path in a low dimensional space, considering only the platform's operating limits instead of the complete state. We then take this initial path to focus the RRT* search in the continuous high-dimensional state space including the actuators of the robot. We do not rely on a detailed structure/terrain classification or use any predefined motion sequences. Hence, our planner can be applied to urban structures, like stairs, as well as rough unstructured environments. Simulation results prove our method to be effective in solving planning queries in such environments.
