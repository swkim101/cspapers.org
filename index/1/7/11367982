In semantic web, ontology mapping is the basis of the interoperation of heterogeneous ontologies. Ontologies are usually distributed and heterogeneous and thus it is necessary to find the mapping between them before processing across them. The current ontology mapping methods merely use massive web pages in the internet and they are unpractical to subsequent interoperation and integration of heterogeneous data sources. This paper proposes a method based on internet search engine and realizes it to a component of the framework for knowledge management system. Ontologies to be mapped and mapping results are all stored in the database. Finally we evaluate our approach with experiments which demonstrate that our solution yields a better performance.
