A functional simulator/editor for VLSI design has been implemented in the Smalltalk-801 system. Users can explore their designs in an highly interactive and graphical manner with “close-to-reality” tools. The traditional sequence of editing, compiling and simulating the circuit is avoided. During editing, functional Modules can immediately respond to new connections. The simulator, called INSIST, strongly supports hierarchical simulation and design up to gate level. Hardware descriptions of the design can be generated for other CAD systems. From these descriptions layout has been generated. A RISC chip was entered and simulated at three hierarchical levels containing more than 50 Modules.
