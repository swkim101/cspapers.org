This paper proposes a novel technique for segmenting the ground plane and at the same time estimating the occupancy probability of each point in a scene. Using a stereo camera rig, our system first calculates a disparity map and transforms it to a v-disparity map, which is then filtered and processed to generate a corresponding probability field. The probability field generated is then used for precise segmentation of ground planes as well as for the generation of occupancy grids. Unlike what is proposed in the prior art, our system requires minimal initialization and is independent of the stereo sensor characteristics as well as the parameters of the disparity algorithm. More importantly, our technique does not require any prior assumption about the terrain visual characteristics. Experimental results using sequences of images from two different data sets are presented to validate the proposed methods.
