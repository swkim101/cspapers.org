Despite its ubiquity in human 1bW1 1 fiapning, very little work has been done in artificial intellig pence on lea rning from natural language instructions. In this video, we present a system, Instructo-Soar, that can both behave and learn from natural language instructions. The system is described in papers elsewhere [Huffman and Laird, 1993a; Huffman and Laird, 1993b]. The type of instruction we particularly address is situated, interactive instruction. Situated means that the student is within the task domain, attempting to perform tasks, when instruction is given. Interactive means that the student can request instruction as needed. Instructo-Soar can learn completely new procedures from sequences of interactive instruction, and can also learn how to extend its knowledge of previously known procedures to new situations. The video demonstrates .* a. . . . . 1 .A., . -1 its applicatron in a simple robotic aomam. 1 ne system starts with a small set of primitive operators. Given instructions in the form of imperative natural language sentences, it is able to learn a hierarchy of complex operators. An example instruction scenario is shown in Figure 1. Learning procedures from instructions involves more than simply memorization of instruction sequences. Acquiring a new procedure involves learning both the procedureâ€™s goal concept, and a general implementation for the procedure. The instructed agent can learn the goal concept of a
