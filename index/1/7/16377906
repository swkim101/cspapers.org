In this work we introduce a low-level system that could be employed by a social robot like a robotic wheelchair or a humanoid, for approaching a group of interacting humans, in order to become a part of the interaction. Taking into account an interaction space that is created when at least two humans interact, a meeting point can be calculated where the robot should reach in order to equitably share space among the interacting group. We propose a sensor-based control task which uses the position and orientation of the humans with respect to the sensor as inputs, to reach the said meeting point while respecting spatial social constraints. Trials in simulation demonstrate the convergence of the control task and its capability as a low-level system for human-aware navigation.
