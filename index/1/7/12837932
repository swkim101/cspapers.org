In this paper, a problem, called "the density divergence problem" is explored. This problem is related to the phenomenon that the densities of the clusters vary in different subspace cardinalities. We take the densities into consideration in subspace clustering and explore an algorithm to adaptively determine different density thresholds to discover clusters in different subspace cardinalities.
