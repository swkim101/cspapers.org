This paper proposes a general framework, named Autopedia, to generate high-quality wikipedia articles for given concepts in any domains, by automatically selecting the best wikipedia template consisting the sub-topics to organize the article for the input concept. Experimental results on 4,526 concepts validate the effectiveness of Autopedia, and the wikipedia template selection approach which takes into account both the template quality and the semantic relatedness between the input concept and its sibling concepts, performs the best.
