Data acquisition in single-sink sensor networks might have issues in scalability. As the size of sensor networks grows, the distances between the sink and responding sensors become larger. This leads to greater energy consumption for queryflooding and data-collection between sensors and the single sink, leading to a reduction in the lifetime of the sensors. Hence, we need to design energy-efficient data acquisition mechanisms that scale with the size of the network. One solution is to simultaneously deploy multiple sinks in the sensor network. To reduce energy consumption, each sensor would then have an option of sending its data to any one of the sinks by diffusing its data toward its closest sink, as determined by an appropriate energy metric. In this abstract, we propose a logical-graph model to seamlessly adapt existing single-sink algorithms to multi-sink sensor networks. From the actual multi-sink sensor graph, we construct a new logical graph with a single virtual sink. In particular, we prove that shortest path tree creation in this logical-graph model is equivalent to that in the multi-sink sensor graph. We then analytically obtain the expected energy savings for data acquisition in a multi-sink network. We consider both a uniform random sink placement as well as a deterministic grid-based sink placement. While our analysis is restricted to one and two dimensional cases, we conjecture that, in general, the expected energy savings in a d-dimensional sensor region due to a random placement of k sinks and n sensors is proportional to k 1 d . We validate our analytical results with the help of simulations.
