Based on a resulting medial axis configuration of planar shapes, a new shape descriptor called the chain of circles (CoCs) is defined herein. The CoCs representation is directly extracted along the boundary contour of silhouette images, and can be controlled in a hierarchical manner which appeals to intuition. The coarsetofine hierarchy makes matching of shapes possible with less computational complexity and greater robustness to noise, spatial quantization and local deformation of shapes. The dissimilarity vector calculated in the matching, which is executed via the dynamic programming technique, may be used to facilitate the searching process in the digital library. The capability of the proposed method is shown by matching several complex shapes such as map images.
