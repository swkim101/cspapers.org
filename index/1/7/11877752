The paper describes major issues and problems in the use of packet satellite channels for real-time video images and suggests some solutions. The DARPA Wide Band Communication Network provides the testbed for this activity.
 The main idea in this paper is the automatic online tradeoff between the quality and the dynamics of the communicated images in order to optimally adapt to the changes of the channel performance and of the scene to be communicated.
 The paper discusses the problems of real-time packet video, suggests several techniques to cope with them, and describes some new approaches to the encoding of real-time video communication. The paper describes in more detail several encoding schemes based on this approach, using the 2-dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).
 Section-C describes issues which are arise in the application of packet satellite channels for real-time video communication. Section-D discusses a general approach which addresses these issues. Section-E describes a general methodology for signal coding and compression, and Section-F describes a scheme for the communication of video images using DCT of the raw images in an absolute way, unlike the four differential schemes which are described in Section-G. Section-H describes a scheme which self-corrects the accumulated quantization errors introduced by the encoding and compression. Such errors are totally eliminated for static images.
