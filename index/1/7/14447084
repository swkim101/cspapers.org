Web browsers are de facto clients for an ever-increasing range of web applications. At the same time, web users are accessing these applications from a wide range of devices. This paper presents a solution for runtime browser session migration and management, called BrowserCloud, which allows a user to securely manage multiple browsers from a personal or third-party Cloud service, migrate snapshots of active browser sessions between browsers over different devices, using a robust security module. The design of BrowserCloud is based on browser extensions/plugins that can preserve and restore browser session state, and a PHP server that stores browser sessions securely. We have tested our implementation over a range of increasingly complex web applications, including WebRTC and HTML5 video. To the best of our knowledge, our implementation is the most robust and secure approach to runtime browser session management to date.
