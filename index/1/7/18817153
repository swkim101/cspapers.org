This paper describes a lexicon organized around systematic polysemy: a set of word senses that are related in systematic and predictable ways. The lexicon is derived by a fully automatic extraction method which utilizes a clustering technique called tree-cut. We compare our lexicon to WordNet cousins, and the inter-annotator disagreement observed between WordNet Semcor and DSO corpora.
