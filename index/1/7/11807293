This video presents our preliminary work towards addressing the ladder climbing event in DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) using DRC-Hubo robot. A ladder-climbing motion planner is developed which generates a collision-free, stable quasi-static trajectory for execution. Compliance control is enabled on arm joints to compensate for the calibration error, modeling error and control error. We have demonstrated that DRC-Hubo can robustly climb a variety of ladders in simulation and successfully climb a ship ladder on the hardware.
