The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic approach to the conceptual schema design. The entity-relationship model is used as the conceptual schema model. The entity-relationship schema, a formal description of the model, is defined to explicitly state the dependency structures such as the functional dependencies, the transitive dependencies, and the hierarchical decompositions. Based upon the analysis of these structural properties, the schema is iteratively transformed into the refined form. The notion of the access weight matrix is also introduced as a measure to evaluate the schemas.
