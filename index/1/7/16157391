This is a report of the application of the Model Generation Theorem Prover developed at ICOT to problems in the theory of finite quasigroups. Several of the problems were previously open. In this paper, we discuss our theorem proving methods, related to those of the existing provers SATCHMO (Manthey, Bry) and OTTER (McCune), and note how parallel processing on the ICOT Parallel Inference Machines was used to obtain high speeds. We then present and discuss our machine-aided investigation of seven problems concerning the existence of types of quasigroup.
