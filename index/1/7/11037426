We study the label complexity of pool-based active learning in the agnostic PAC model. Specifically, we derive general bounds on the number of label requests made by the A2 algorithm proposed by Balcan, Beygelzimer & Langford (Balcan et al., 2006). This represents the first nontrivial general-purpose upper bound on label complexity in the agnostic PAC model.
