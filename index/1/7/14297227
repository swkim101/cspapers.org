However, when SIS proposal and target distributions are dissimilar, such procedures lead to biased estimates or require a prohibitive number of samples. We introduce ReBaSIS, a method that better approximates the target distribution by sampling variable by variable from existing importance samplers and accepting or rejecting each proposed assignment in the sequence: a choice made based on anticipating upcoming evidence. We relate the per-variable proposal and model distributions by expected weight ratios of sequence completions and show that we can learn accurate models of optimal acceptance probabilities from local samples. In a continuous-time domain, our method improves upon previous importance samplers by transforming an SIS problem into a machine learning one.
