The User Specialty Languages (USL) System is an applications independent natural language interface to a Relational Database System. It provides non DP-trained people with a tool to introduce, query, manipulate and analyse the data stored in a Relational Database via natural language. USL interfaces with different languages; in the present paper the grammar developed for Spanish is presented, and compared with the German grammar which was previously implemented and upon which it is based. Their main differences are pointed out, and the generality of the system to deal with other natural languages shown.
