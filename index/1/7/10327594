The design of an effective interactive documentation system is introduced by tracing a hypothetical development effort aimed at shifting information contained in printed volumes of documentation to a form suitable for interactive access. Taking this approach presents a view of online documentation systems as the result of the process of adapting information conveyed in printed volumes to the constraint of interactive software considered as an information medium. The resulting discussion necessarily involves consideration of the demands which interactive software makes on both the organization of information about interactive programs and on the cognitive capacities of people using it.Existing documentation is typically intended to serve all of the informational needs of any person who uses an interactive software system. The requirements of software systems for structure and precision demand a more detailed understanding than currently exists of exactly how to provide information to people of varying levels of experience with a particular program or with computing in general. The interaction between the purposes of existing documentation and the requirements of an online system provide an interesting context for discussion of the major issues facing the designer of an interactive documentation system.
