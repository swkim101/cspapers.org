Windowing has been proposed as a procedure for efficient memory use in the ID3 decision tree learning algorithm. However, it was shown that it may often lead to a decrease in performance, in particular in noisy domains. Following up on previous work, where we have demonstrated that the ability of rule learning algorithms to learn rules independently can be exploited for more efficient windowing procedures, we demonstrate in this paper how this property can be exploited to achieve noisetolerance in windowing.
