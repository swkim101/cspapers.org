With the fast growth of the knowledge bases built over the Internet, storing and querying millions or billions of RDF triples in a knowledge base have attracted increasing research interests. Although the latest RDF storage systems achieve good querying performance, few of them pay much attention to the characteristic of dynamic growth of the knowledge base. In this paper, to consider the efficiency of both querying and incremental update in RDF data, we propose a hAsh-based tWo-tiEr rdf sTOrage system (abbr. to AWETO) with new index architecture and query execution engine. The performance of our system is systematically measured over two large-scale datesets. Compared with the other three state-of-the-art RDF storage systems, our system achieves the best incremental update efficiency, meanwhile, the query efficiency is competitive.
