This paper presents an extension of the standard occupancy grid for 3D environment mapping. The presented approach adds a fusion process after the occupancy update which modifies the resolution of the grid cells in an incremental manner. Consequently, the proposed approach requires fewer grid cells for 3D representation in comparison to a standard occupancy grid. The resolution adaptation process is based on the occupancy probabilities of the grid cells and leads to the relaxation of the cubic grid cell assumption common to most 3D occupancy grids. The aim of this paper is to show the advantage of the proposed incremental fusion process which leads to the approximation of the 3D environment using rectangular cuboids. Evaluation on a large scale dataset and comparison to the state of the art shows that the proposed approach has faster access time for all occupied grid cells and requires a smaller number of cells for 3D environment representation.
