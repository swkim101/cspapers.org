We propose a novel approach supporting the Extract Class refactoring. The proposed approach analyzes the (structural and semantic) similarity of the methods in a class in order to identify chains of strongly related methods. The identified method chains are used to define new classes with higher cohesion than the original class. A preliminary evaluation reveals that the approach is able to identify meaningful refactoring operations.
