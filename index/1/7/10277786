In this paper, we target on the problem of estimating the statistic of pedestrian travel time within a period from an entrance to a destination in a crowded scene. Such estimation is based on the global distributions of crowd densities and velocities instead of complete trajectories of pedestrians, which cannot be obtained in crowded scenes. The proposed method is motivated by our statistical investigation into the correlations between travel time and global properties of crowded scenes. Active regions are created for each source-destination pair to model the probable walking regions over the corresponding source-destination traffic flow. Two sets of scene features are specially designed for modeling moving and stationary persons inside the active regions and their influences on pedestrian travel time. The estimation of pedestrian travel time provides valuable information for both crowd scene understanding and pedestrian behavior analysis, but was not sufficiently studied in literature. The effectiveness of the proposed pedestrian travel time estimation model is demonstrated through several surveillance applications, including dynamic scene monitoring, localization of regions blocking traffics, and detection of abnormal pedestrian behaviors. Many more valuable applications based on our method are to be explored in the future.
