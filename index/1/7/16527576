Internet is an easy medium for people to collaborate and crowdsourcing is an efficient feature of social web where people with common interest and expertise come together to solve specific problems by collective thinking and create a community. It can also be used to filter out important information from large data, remove spams, and gamification techniques are used to reward the users for their contribution and keep a sustainable environment for the growth of the community. Semantic web technologies can be used to structure the community data so it can be combined, decentralized and be used across platform. Using such tools knowledge can be enhanced and easily discovered and merged together. This paper discusses the concept of a purposive social network where people with similar interest and varied expertise come together, use crowdsourcing technique to solve a common problem and build tools for common purpose. The StackOverflow website is chosen to study the purposive network, different network ties and roles of user is studied. Linked Data is used for name disambiguation of keywords and topics for easier search and discovery of experts in a field and provide useful information that is otherwise unavailable in the website.
