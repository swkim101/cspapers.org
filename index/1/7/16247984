A mobile robot can use the walls or the pillars to localize itself when it navigates in indoor environment. However, in open space or outdoor environment there are few easy detectable and stable objects that the robot can use. In this paper, we propose a method for the detection of braille blocks, which are originally used for visually handicapped people, for autonomous mobile robot navigation. To recognize the braille block, a CCD camera and a laser fan beam projector are used as sensor to detect bumps on road surface. This paper also presents the experimental results of braille block following using the sensor system to detect the braille block position and orientation. This experiment shows effectiveness of the sensor system for the braille block recognition and implies the possibility of braille block based mobile robot navigation.
