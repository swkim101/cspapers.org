This paper considers the composition of tuples from two relations in order to derive additional tuples of one of these relations. Our purpose is to determine when the composition is plausible and for which relation the new tuples are derived. We first present a formal definition of composition and our extension to it. We next define conditions on the domains and ranges of the relations that are necessary for extended composition to occur. We then show how a set of underlying attributes, independently specified for each relation, is sufficient for determining plausible composition, when the primitives are combined according to an algebra. Finally, we apply our method for extended composition to a representative group of semantic relations and evaluate the results.
