Knowledge bases can be quickly accepted mto realistic settings if they are developed rapidly and they support critical tasks. Genetics is one area where knowledge management is necessary to prowde intelligent access to complex mtformatlon. Multiple reasoning systems accessing the same knowledge base can contribute directly to the progress of science. Genetics is a rapidly changing field and the rap]d development of intelligent systems is becommg cmcial for the analysis of information. Genetic data is also being generated at an exponentially growing rate and traditional techniques are being overwhelmed, A flexible knowledge base which stores the information and makes it available to a variety of reasoning systems will speed up the transition of laboratory research to medical practice. We have developed a process for designing data models for application-specific knowledge bases. This process is supported by a knowledge base design tool, which we call WEAVE, that creates a prototype knowledge base when given a data model definition by a knowledge base developer. The process is formalized using theoretical results from knowledge representation and programming language theory. This mix of theoretical results and-their integration in an implemented system has proven useful for a real-world application. We show how our knowledge base design process can be used to develop a data model for genetic markers, which are biological constructs used to search for genes associated with genetic diseases.
