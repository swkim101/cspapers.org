Gain control by divisive inhibition, a.k.a. divisive normalization, has been proposed to be a general mechanism throughout the visual cortex. We explore in this study the statistical properties of this normalization in the presence of noise. Using simulations, we show that divisive normalization is a close approximation to a maximum likelihood estimator, which, in the context of population coding, is the same as an ideal observer. We also demonstrate analytically that this is a general property of a large class of nonlinear recurrent networks with line attractors. Our work suggests that divisive normalization plays a critical role in noise filtering, and that every cortical layer may be an ideal observer of the activity in the preceding layer.
