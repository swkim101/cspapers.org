We describe a browser for the past web. It can retrieve data from multiple past web resources and features a passive browsing style based on change detection and presentation. The browser shows past pages one by one along a time line. The parts that were changed between consecutive page versions are animated to reflect their deletion or insertion, thereby drawing the user's attention to them. The browser enables automatic skipping of changeless periods and filtered browsing based on user specified query.
