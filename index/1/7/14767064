Conventions are shown for representing information in semantic networks in a linear form called semantic case relations. Representations of variables, truth functions, and quantified statements are provided. Methods for answering questions from the resulting semantic predicates are illustrated and a computational procedure for answering questions from quantified semantic predicates is described. Acknowiedgementg The ideas and procedures presented here are the result of many discussions with Gary Hendrix, and Michael K. Smith. We're particularly grateful to M.K. Smith for helping to implement the LISP procedures for question-answering.
