Our field is drowning in a sea of conference submissions. We assert that the sheer number of papers has begun to seriously hurt the quality of the work that the field is doing and that the field is going to implode unless we take action to remedy the situation. In order to improve the quality of the papers being published we must reduce the number being submitted. This will require a change in the culture of our field where "more" is being equated to "better" by both hiring and promotion committees. In this panel we will explore some ideas for correcting the situation.
