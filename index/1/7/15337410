When processing raw documents in Information Retrieval (IR) System, a term-weighting scheme is used to calculate the importance of each term which occurs in a document. However, most term-weighting schemes assume that a term is independent of the other terms. Term dependency is an indispensable consequence of language use [1]. Therefore, this assumption can make the information of a document being lost. In this paper, we propose new approach to refine term weights of documents using term dependencies discovered from a set of documents. Then, we evaluate our method with two experiments based on the vector space model [2] and the language model [3].
