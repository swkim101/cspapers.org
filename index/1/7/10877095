In this paper, we present a prototype tool that supports the systematic development of software architectures driven by quality requirements using architectural tactics. The tool allows one to configure architectural tactics based on quality requirements and compose the configured tactics to produce an initial architecture for the system. We demonstrate the tool for developing an architecture for a resource profiling system in the web environment and validate the results using a set of metrics.
