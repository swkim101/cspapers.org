Discovering Web services and clustering them based on their functionalities are important problems with few existing solutions. Users may search for Web services using keywords and receive services that semantically match the keywords. Semantic Web service matchmaking, proposed to enhance the precision of matchmaking using syntactical cues, is generally based upon semantic service descriptions in ontology markup languages as add-ons or replacements to the underlying WSDL descriptors. Ways to improve the performance of direct matchmaking in WSDL, however, remains less studied. In this paper, we introduce a novel corpus-based method to facilitate matchmaking in WSDL files. We show that our method can identify semantically similar Web services with satisfactory recall.
