Recommender systems are ecient tools that overcome the information overload problem by providing users with the most relevant contents. This is generally done through userâ€™s preferences/ratings acquired from log les of his former sessions. Besides these preferences, taking into account the interaction context of the user will improve the relevancy of recommendation process. In this paper, we propose a context-aware recommender system based on both user prole and context. The approach we present is based on a previous work on data personalization which leads to the denition of a Personalized Access Model that provides a set of personalization services. We show how these services can be deployed in order to provide advanced context-aware recommender systems.
