Much effort has been directed towards obtaining near peak performance for linear algebra operations on current high performance workstations. The large amounts of data accesses however, make performance highly dependent on the behavior of the memory hierarchy. Techniques such as Ivfttltilevel Blocking (Tiling), Data Precopying, Software Pipelining and Software Prefetching have been applied in order to improve performance. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no other work has been done considering the relation between these techniques when applied together. In this paper we analyze the behavior of matrix multiplication algorithms for large matrices on a superscalar and superpipelined processor with a multilevel memory hierarchy when these techniques are applied together. We study and model the performance and limitations of different codes. We also compare two different approaches to data prefetching, binding versus non-binding, and find the latter remarkably more effective than the former due mainly to its flexibility. Results are obtained on a workstation with 200 MFlops peak performance. The initial 15 MFlops of the simple jkzâ€™ form can be improved up to 128 MFlops when Multilevel Blocking (at the register level and 2 cache levels), Data Precopies and Software Pipelining techniques are used. Computations can be further speeded up to 166 MFlops when Nonbinding Prefetch is combined with all of the previous techniques.
