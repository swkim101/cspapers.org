This paper describes a novel Autonomous Surface Vehicle capable of navigating throughout complex inland water storages and measuring a range of water quality properties and greenhouse gas emissions. The 16 ft long solar powered catamaran can collect this information throughout the water column whilst the vehicle is moving. A unique feature of this ASV is its integration into a storage scale floating sensor network to allow remote mission uploads, data download and adaptive sampling strategies. This paper provides an overview of the vehicle design and operation including control, laser-based obstacle avoidance, and vision-based inspection capabilities. Experimental results are shown illustrating its ability to continuously collect key water quality parameters and compliment intensive manual monitoring campaigns.
