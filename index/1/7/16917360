We consider the problem of finding a maximal independent set in an independence system quickly in parallel when the independence system is presented as an explicit list of minimal dependent sets. An NC algorithm for the special case when the size of each minimal dependent set is at most two was given by Karp and Wigderson [KW] and has been substantially improved by Luby [Lull, by Alon, Babai and Itai [ABI] and by Goldberg and Spencer [GS]. On the other hand, no previous work on this problem extends even to the case when the size of each minimal dependent set is at most three. We provide a randomized NC algorithm for the case when the size of each minimal dependent set is at most a constant, and provide an algorithm which we conjecture is a randomized NC algorithm for the general case. *Computer Science Department, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195.
