We consider the problem of deploying robots in formations that ensure network connectivity between a fixed base station and a set of independent agents wandering in the environment. We adopt a communications model that requires line-of-sight and then solve for robot placements by finding mutually-visible configurations in a polygonal decomposition of the environment map. Both the static deployment case and the case of finding deployments that minimize total robot movement are considered. We provide algorithms for the moving agent case, consider their performance on various discretizations for a range of problem sizes, and discuss our experimental implementation of the presented ideas.
