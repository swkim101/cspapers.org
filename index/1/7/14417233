In order to generate high quality explanations in mathematical domains, the presentation must be adapted to the knowledge of the intended audience. Most proof presentation systems only communicate proofs on a fixed degree of abstraction independently of the addressee's knowledge. In this paper, we shall present the proof explanation system P.rex. Based on assumptions about the addressee's knowledge, its dialog planner chooses a degree of abstraction for each proof step to be explained. In reaction to the user's interactions, which are allowed at any time, it enters clarification dialogs to revise its user model and to adapt the explanation.
