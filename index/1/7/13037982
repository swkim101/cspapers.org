This paper proposes a novel data staging architecture of the relational data base machine (RDBM) using a memory hierarchy system and moving head disks as a data base store (DBS). From a realistic viewpoint of implementing RDBM to support large data bases, RDBM based on this configuration is the most practical approach. However, a crucial problem exists in RDBM of this type; namely, the total performance is restricted by poor throughput of the data movement between the processing subsystem and DBS. To solve the problem, we have designed a powerful architecture to enhance the capability of the data staging, taking the properties of a relational data base environment into consideration.
 This paper describes the design and implementation issues of the data staging subsystem for RDBM developed by the authors and confirms the advantages through simulation study with GPSS.
