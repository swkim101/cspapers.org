A polymorphic, constraint-based type inference algorithm for an object-oriented language is defined. A generalized form of type, polymorphic recursively constrained types, are inferred. These types are expressive enough for typing objects, since they generalize recursive types and F-bounded polymorphism. The well-known tradeoff between inheritance and subtyping is mitigated by the type inference mechanism. Soundness and completeness of type inference are established.
