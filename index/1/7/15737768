In this study, we conducted long-distance radio propagation experiments at 1mW/145 MHz to realize low-power long-distance communication for wildlife research and disaster prevention telemetry [1]. We successfully realized long-distance communications from a weather balloon (elevation: ~14,000 m) with 1 mW radio power. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our method can achieve such long-distance communication at 10 BPS/1mW with battery cell operation in the SSB mode and that the SNR in the SSB bandwidth is better than -10 dB.
