Our demonstration shows the hierarchy system working on a locally run search engine. Hierarchies are dynamically generated from the retrieved documents, and visualised on the menus. When a user selects a term from the hierarchy, the documents linked to the term are listed, and the term is then added to the initial query to rerun a search. Through the demonstration we illustrate how hierarchical presentation of expansion terms is achieved, and how our approach supports users to articulate their information needs using the hierarchy.
