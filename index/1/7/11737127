This paper investigates power conserving indexing techniques for data disseminated on a broadcast channel. A <italic>hybrid indexing</italic> method combining strengths of the <italic>signature</italic> and the <italic>index tree</italic> techniques is presented. Different from previous studies, our research takes into consideration two important data organization factors, namely, <italic>clustering</italic> and <italic>scheduling</italic>. Cost models for index, signature and hybrid methods are derived by taking into account various data organizations accommodating these two factors. Based on our analytical comparisons, the signature and the hybrid indexing techniques are the best choices for power conserving indexing of various data organizations on wireless broadcast channels.
