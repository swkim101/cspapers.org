Categorisation is a useful method for organising documents into subcollections that can be browsed or searched to more accurately and quickly meet information needs. On the Web, category-based portals such as Yahoo! and DMOZ are extremely popular: DMOZ is maintained by over 56,000 volunteers, is used as the basis of the popular Google directory, and is perhaps used by millions of users each day. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a machine-learning algorithm which has been shown to be highly effective for automatic text categorisation. However, a problem with iterative training techniques such as SVM is that during their learning or training phase, they require the entire training collection to be held in main-memory; this is infeasible for large training collections such as DMOZ or large news wire feeds. In this paper, we show how inverted indexes can be used for scalable training in categorisation, and propose novel heuristics for a fast, accurate, and memory efficient approach. Our results show that an index can be constructed on a desktop workstation with little effect on categorisation accu-racy compared to a memory-based approach. We conclude that our techniques permit automatic categorisation using very large train-ing collections, vocabularies, and numbers of categories.
