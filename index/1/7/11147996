We propose a new algorithm for finding the blocks (biconnected components) of an undirected graph. A serial implementation runs in 0[n+m] time and space on a graph of n vertices and m edges. A parallel implmentation runs in 0[log n] time and 0[n+m] space using 0[n+m] processors on a concurrent-read, concurrent-write parallel RAM. An alternative implementation runs in 0[n/sup 2/p] time and 0[n/sup 2/] space using any number p â©½ n/sup 2/log/sup 2/-n of processors, on a concurrent-read, exclusive-write parallel RAM. The latter algorithm has optimal speedup, assuming an adjacency matrix representation of the input. A general algorithmic technique which simplifies and improve computation of various functions on tress is introduced. This technique typically requires 0(log n) time using 0(n) space on an exclusive-read exclusive-write parallel RAM.
