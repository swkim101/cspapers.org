This paper presents a platform for virtual network (VN) provisioning across multiple domains. The platform decomposes VN provisioning into multiple steps to address the implications of limited information disclosure on resource discovery and allocation. A new VN embedding algorithm with simultaneous node and link mapping allows to assign resources within each domain. For inter-domain virtual link setup, we design and realize a signaling protocol that also integrates resource reservations for providing virtual links with Quality-of-Service guarantees. Experimental results show that small VNs can be provisioned within a few seconds.
