In this paper, we discuss our work in progress towards a scalable hierarchical classification system for books using the Library of Congress subject hierarchy. We examine the characteristics of this domain which make the problem very challenging, and we look at several appropriate performance measurements. We show that both Hieron and Hierarchical Support Vector Machines perform moderately well.
