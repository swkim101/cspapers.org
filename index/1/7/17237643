Content sharing in social networks is a powerful mechanism for discovering content on the Internet. The degree to which content is disseminated within the network depends on the connectivity relationships among network nodes. Existing schemes for recommending connections in social networks are based on the number of common neighbors, similarity of user profiles, etc. However, such similarity-based connections do not consider the amount of content discovered. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for recommending connections that boost content propagation in a social network without compromising on the relevance of the recommendations. Unlike existing work on influence propagation, in our environment, we are looking for edges instead of nodes, with a bound on the number of incident edges per node. We show that the content spread function is not submodular, and develop approximation algorithms for computing a near-optimal set of edges. Through experiments on real-world social graphs such as Flickr and Twitter, we show that our approximation algorithms achieve content spreads that are as much as 90 times higher compared to existing heuristics for recommending connections.
