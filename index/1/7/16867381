This paper deals with the stealth target-interception problem based on the active prediction planning execution (APPE) strategy. In order to cope with the evasive feature of the invader, we make the robot move stealthily by hiding behind obstacles. We adopt a roadmap-based decoupled approach, which plans the path and the trajectory separately by developing new concept; the detection map. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. It has an enough practical running time to be applied to the real-time situation.
