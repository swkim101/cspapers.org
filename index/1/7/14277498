In this paper we present a Markov random field model based approach to filter spam. Our approach examines the importance of the neighborhood relationship (MRF cliques) among words in an email message for the purpose of spam classification. We propose and test several different theoretical bases for weighting schemes among corresponding neighborhood windows. Our results demonstrate that unexpected side effects depending on the neighborhood window size may have larger accuracy impact than the neighborhood relationship effects of the Markov random field.
