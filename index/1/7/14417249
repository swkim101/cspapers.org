This poster presents GuideLoc, a highly efficient aerial wireless localization system that uses directional antennas mounted on a mini Multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), to enable detecting and positioning of targets. Taking advantage of angle and signal strength information of frames transmitted from targets, GuideLoc can directly fly towards the targets with the minimum flight route and time. We implement a prototype of GuideLoc using ArduCopter and evaluate the performance by simulations and experiments. Experimental results show that GuideLoc achieves an average location accuracy of 2.7 meters and reduces flight distance more than 50% compared with other known wireless localization approaches using UAV.
