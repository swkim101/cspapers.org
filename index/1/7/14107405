Specifically, we use, .:!tate-of-the-art concepts from morphology, n;,mely the ‘pattern spectrum’ of a shape, to map each shape to a point in n-dimensional space. Following [16, 301, we organize the n-d points in an R-tree. We show that the L, (= max) norm in the n-d space lower-bounds the actual distance. This guarantees no false dismissals for range queries. In addition, we present a nearest neighbor algorithm that also guarantees no false dismissals.
