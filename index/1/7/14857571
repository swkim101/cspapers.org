There are several advantages of multitenancy: the serving of multiple tenants, each with its own privileges, from the same instance of a software system. Although the naming convention in actor systems -- actor names cannot be guessed -- naturally supports multitenancy, there is no explicit way of managing the resource competition between tenants. There are models for coordinating resource use in actor systems; however, they are difficult to implement for efficient implementations of Actors. This paper presents our efforts in implementing resource coordination support for actor systems implemented using the Akka library.
