Stubborn sets and model unfolding are two well-known methods for sidestepping the complexity of state-space exploration based on formal models of concurrent programs, such as Labeled Transition Systems and Petri nets. Here we define a deadlock detection strategy that combines these two methods. We also show that the resulting method, stubborn unfoldings, can produce smaller state space representations than both previous methods.
