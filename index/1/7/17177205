The FDE has been designed to support multiple search strategies for logic programs. This machine represents the knowledge base in a strategy independent fashion as a predicate connection graph which encodes potential unifications between predicates. It facilitates knowledge representation in the language of full first order predicate calculus Immediate developments include implementation of various database access strategies and addition of evaluable predicates and functions to the language. Long-term research will focus on exploration of search strategies, especially for parallel logic machines.
