This paper explores the realization of robotic arm motion planning, especially Findpath Problem, which is a basic motion planning problem that arises in the development of robotics. Findpath means: Given the initial and desired final configurations of a robotic arm in 3- dimensional space, and given descriptions of the obstacles in the space, determine whether there is a continuous collision-free motion of the robotic arm from the one configuration to the other and find such a motion if one exists. There are several branches of approach in motion planning area, but in reality the important things are feasibility, efficiency and accuracy of the method. The topological method has shown great potentiality in practice compared with the others. Here a simulation system is designed to embody the topological Dimension Reduction Method (DRM) [1]-[2] and it is in sight that DRM can be adopted in the first overall planning of real robotic arm system in the near future.
