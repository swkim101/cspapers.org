The objective of this research project is to improve the reusability of object-oriented software. We have introduced anchored exception declarations to allow checked exceptions to be used conveniently in reusable software elements such as design patterns. We are now investigating an innovative inheritance mechanism based on existing inheritance mechanisms like that of Eiffel and on traits. The resulting mechanism should allow a programmer to construct a class from existing components with little effort.
