In this paper, we explore the exponential map and its inverse, the logarithm map, for the group SIM(n) of similarity transformations in ‚Ñùn which are the composition of a rotation, a translation and a uniform scaling. We give a formula for the exponential map and we prove that it is surjective. We give an explicit formula for the case of n = 3 and show how to efficiently compute the logarithmic map. As an application, we use these algorithms to perform motion interpolation. Given a sequence of similarity transformations, we compute a sequence of logarithms, then fit a cubic spline that interpolates the logarithms and finally, we compute the interpolating curve in SIM(3).
