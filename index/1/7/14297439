We prove the maximum number of geometric permutations, induced by line transversals to a set of <i>n</i> pairwise disjoint congruent spheres in <i>R<sup>d</sup></i> with <i>d</i> ⪈ 3, is no more than 4 when <i>n</i> is sufficiently large, achieving the best known upper bound for this problem. We also prove the maximum number of geometric permutations of a set of <i>n</i> noncongruent spheres of bounded radius ratio in R<sup>d</sup>, <i>d</i> ⪈ 3, is at most 2<sup>[√2<i>M</i>]+1</sup>, where <i>M</i> is the ratio or the largest radius and the smallest radius. Our result settles a conjecture in combinatorial geometry.
