This paper describes an integrated Computer-Aided Design, Manufacturing, Assembly and Test System to achieve increased productivity and quality. The term CADMAT which encompasses Automated Test also implies the integration of all design automated and computer augmented processes throughout the product and business organizations. In the design and test phase of electronics, Interactive Graphics (IAG), verification, automated board layout, and automatic test vector generation are discussed. In the mechanical area, the use of 2D and 3D graphics techniques, computerized finite element modeling, and structural analysis programs are described. The use of the design data base in N/C manufacturing, automated inspection and testing is examined as is the role of automated software development and the development and use of management information systems.
