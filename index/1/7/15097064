The proliferation of mobile computing has prompted navigation to be one of the most attractive and promising applications. Conventional designs of navigation systems mainly focus either indoor or outdoor navigation. However, people have a strong need for navigation from a large open indoor environment to an outdoor destination in real life. In this poster, we present a joint navigation system, named ioNavi. It can enable passengers to easily deploy indoor-outdoor navigation service for subway transportation systems in a crowdsourcing way, without comprehensive indoor localization systems. Any self-motivated passenger records and shares its individual walking trace and associated rich set of sensor readings, from a location inside a subway station to an uncertain outdoor destination within a given range, such as one kilometer. ioNavi further extracts navigation traces from shared individual traces, each of which is not necessary to be accurate and useful. A subsequent following user achieves indoor-outdoor navigation services by tracking a recommended navigation trace.
