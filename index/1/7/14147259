Soloman-Felder learning style index has been applied extensively in programming classes to ascertain the learning styles of students. This paper presents an approach showing how learning styles of students can be used to evaluate pedagogical resources. In specific, learning style can be used to help determine an appropriate textbook and an appropriate mixture of additional pedagogical devices such as virtual labs or 'clickers'. An example from a first undergraduate programming course is used to illustrate the approach.
