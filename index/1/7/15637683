The same application implemented on different systems will necessarily present different workloads to the systems. Characterizations of workloads intended to represent the same application, but input to models of different systems, must also differ in analogous ways. We present a hierarchical method for characterizing a workload at increasing levels of detail such that every characterization at a lower level still accurately represents the workload at higher levels.
We discuss our experience in using the method to feed the same application through a workload characterization “pipeline” to two different models of two different systems, a conventional relational database system and a logic-based distributed database system. We have developed programs that partially automate the characterization changes that are required when the system to be modeled changes.
