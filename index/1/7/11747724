We report the results of the analysis of website traffic logs and argue that both unique IP address and cookies vastly overestimate unique visitors, e.g. by factor of 8 in our studies. Google Analytics 'absolute unique visitors' measure is shown to produce similar 6x overestimation. To address the problem we present a new model for relating unique visitors to IP address or cookies.
