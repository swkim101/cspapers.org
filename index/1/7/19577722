ONION is the first system with rich interactive support for efficiently analyzing outliers. ONION features an innovative exploration model that offers an "outlier-centric panorama'' into big datasets. The ONION system is composed of an offline preprocessing phase followed by an online exploration phase that supports rich classes of novel exploration operations. As our demonstration illustrates, this enables analysts to interactively explore outliers at near real-time speed even over large datasets. We demonstrate ONION's capabilities with urban planning applications use cases on the Open Street Maps dataset.
