Being able to manipulate degrees of freedom of the environment, such as doors or drawers, is a requirement for most tasks a robot is supposed to perform. Often these external degrees of freedom depend on other ones, e.g., a drawer can only be opened if the lock is not locking the joint. We propose an approach to autonomously and efficiently explore and uncover joint dependency structures. We develop a probabilistic model for joint dependency structures which is the basis for active learning. Discontinuities in the dynamics of the joint, which often indicate key points of the joint, are used to segment the joint space into meaningful segments which then allows efficient exploration with the developed maximum cross-entropy (MaxCE) exploration strategy. Experiments in a simulated environment and on a real PR2 suggest that the proposed approach yields efficient exploration of joint dependency structures.
