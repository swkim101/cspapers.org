Dexterity in robot hand object manipulation is irrevocably connected with achieving and maintaining rolling motion and contact at the fingertips. The problem of controlling a robotic fingertip for contact rolling is in this work addressed via the generation of a rolling motion trajectory and the application of a prescribed performance controller that can guarantee contact maintenance and a predefined fast convergence of the rolling tracking error to zero under any contact conditions. A simulation of a five degrees of freedom robot show excellent contact rolling performance even at cases of low friction while alternative controllers lead to contact sliding.
