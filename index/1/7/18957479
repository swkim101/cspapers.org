The purpose of this paper is to describe an investigation into an ontology-based computational recognition of children's jokes. While humor has been studied for centuries computational humor has received very little attention: This may in part be due to the difficulty of the task: at the very least, it requires formal methods for humor generation/recognition and "being able to produce/interpret natural language, being capable of subtle and flexible inferences, and having a vast store of knowledge about the real world." [Ritchie, 2004]. There are some humor generators (see Ritchie [2004] for a review) and a handful of humor recognizers. Yet, "If computers are ever going to communicate naturally and effectively with humans, they must be able to use humor." [Binsted, 2006]. 
 
We are interested in recognition, not generation of humor. Recognition of all verbally expressed humor is an overly broad task. To narrow the task, only jokes for young children are considered. The reduction of the domain size to young children's jokes is expected to decrease the complexity and sophistication of the language to be analyzed. This in turn decreases the knowledge that needs to be captured for text interpretation.
