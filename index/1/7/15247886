The <underline>C</underline>ontext-<underline>A</underline>ddressed <underline>S</underline>egment-<underline>S</underline>equential <underline>S</underline>torage (CASSS) described in this paper provides a solution to the problem of data retrieval from a large, nonpreorganized file. It provides this capability entirely by hardware, eliminating the need for special data structuring solely for the purpose of reducing search time. The major features of the architecture of a character-oriented CASSS system are described, including the basic hardware configuration selected to implement such a system and the set of search instructions chosen to provide a wide variety of search operations useful in information retrieval. Of particular importance in this application is the method of quasi-parallel instruction execution, which allows a full string search of the entire data base in a single cycle of the sequential storage device used.
