Generally, the cables of a parallel cable-driven robot are considered to be massless and inextensible. These two characteristics cannot be neglected anymore for large dimension mechanisms in order to obtain good positioning accuracy. A well-known model which describes the profile of a cable under the action of its own weight allows us to take mass and elasticity into account. When designing a robot, and choosing actuator and cable characteristics, a calculation of maximal tension has to be done. However, because cable mass has a significant effect on cable tensions, a model including cable mass has to be included in the design step. This paper proposes two methods to determine the appropriate cable and hence the maximal tensions in the cables. Applied to a large dimension robot, taking cable mass into account is proved to be necessary in comparison with an equivalent method based on the massless cable modeling. In this paper, only moving platform static equilibria are considered (slow enough motions).
