This paper examines how progress in computer hardware and software may be applied to solve several serious problems in teaching computer science courses. It is concerned primarily with two such problems: 1) the lack of immediate reinforcement of computing concepts because of long delays between learning and practice, and 2) the difficulty instructors have motivating and explaining complex topics with currently available instruction tools and techniques. The paper first reviews the involvement of educational institutions in the evolution of computing. It then briefly surveys recent experiments in powerful personal computing. It describes an experiment in the application of new personal computer technology at Brown University which addresses the two educational problems noted above. It then outlines in detail the initial courseware for the environment. Finally, it discusses what changes in pedagogy will be needed to make such technology usable on a wide-scale.
