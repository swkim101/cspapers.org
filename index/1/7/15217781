The lack of diversity in the tech industry is a widely remarked phenomenon. The majority of workers in tech roles are either white or Asian men, with all other groups being under-represented. Some authors point to cultural factors influencing self-efficacy, leading to a lack of diversity at the start of the "pipeline" of IT talent. Others point to toxic workplace culture that can lead skilled tech workers to drop out of the industry. While these effects are very real and important, this paper focuses on a third concept contributing to lack of diversity, communal goal congruity. We present a growing body of evidence suggesting that working with others, and in the service of others, are important career goals that many believe tech careers lack. We describe prior work that shows that these beliefs also have a significant impact on the pipeline of tech talent. We then report on the first pieces of data out of the first long-term intervention designed with this communal goal congruity perspective in mind. We have created a cohort-based service-learning program in computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and software engineering. The result is a program with 26.3% women and 31.6% African American and/or Hispanic students, including 15.8% African American and/or Hispanic women, at an institution that has never previously seen this level of diversity in its computing majors.
