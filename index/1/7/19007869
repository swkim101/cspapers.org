In practical applications, the control tasks are often of a repetitive nature. For example, in indusmal manipulators executing operations of picking, placing or painting, machine tools and magnetic disk or CD drives, the control systems are usually required to track or reject periodic exogenous signals. With the increasingly high demand on the productivity and quality, high precision control of such systems has become a challenging task of significant theoretical and practical impoltance.
