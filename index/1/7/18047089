2 THE BASIC IDEA The Tools & Materials approach (see [2]) guides the developer through the entire process. To realize this, it provides an applicationand task-oriented methodology for software development. The main idea behind the approach is to realize high use quality of software. This involves the following aspects: • The functionality of the system is oriented to the tasks of the application domain. • Operation of the system is user-friendly. • The process and steps defined in the system can be easily adapted to actual requirements in accordance with the work situation. Based on object-oriented design and construction techniques, the T&M approach unifies various components such as a leitmotif with design metaphors, applicationoriented documents and an evolutionary approach using prototyping. Even the implementation is supported by a complete Java-based application framework, called JWAM (WAM is a German acronym for the Tools & Materials approach). The basic idea behind the approach is to achieve a structural similarity between the application domain and the software system. The benefit obtained is a close correspondence between the model of core application concepts and the software architecture. This structural similarity enhances maintainability, extensibility and other aspects of quality.
