This paper presents a method of learning to solve design problems by generalizing examples. The technique has been developed in the domain of logic circuit design. It involves the use of domain knowledge to analyze examples and produce generalized circuit designs. The method utilizes proofs of design correctness to guide the process of generalization. Our approach is illustrated by showing it can generalize a rotational shift register into a schema describing devices capable of computing arbitrary permutations.
