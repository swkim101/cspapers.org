This paper describes a new music-playback interface for trial listening, SmartMusicKIOSK. In music stores, short trial listening of CD music is not usually a passive experience -- customers often search out the chorus or "hook" of a song using the fast-forward button. Listening of this type, however, has not been traditionally supported. This research achieves a function for jumping to the chorus section and other key parts of a song plus a function for visualizing song structure. These functions make it easier for a listener to find desired parts of a song and thereby facilitate an active listening experience. The proposed functions are achieved by an automatic chorus-section detecting method, and the results of implementing them as a listening station have demonstrated their usefulness.
