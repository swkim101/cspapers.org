Onboard vision sensing is a current challenge in micro-scale robotics. Small flapping-wing robots such as the RoboBee present significant constraints on power, weight, and image quality for an onboard vision sensor. Here we report the integration of a 1 × 1 × 1.7 mm camera capable of video capture in flight. Inspired by gaze stabilization in insects, we designed and fabricated a one degree of freedom mechanism attached to the top of the RoboBee that achieves output angles of −41° to +60°. We perform open-loop roll maneuvers and demonstrate initial control of the gaze angle during flight. This represents the first use of a camera in free flight at this scale.
