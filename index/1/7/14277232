Function decomposition can be used as a machine learning method that, given a set of training examples, induces a de nition of the target concept in terms of a hierarchy of intermediate concepts and their de nitions. We present a new approach that allows function decomposition to learn from noisy data, where a discovery of new concepts is guided by the aim to reduce the estimated error of the resulting classi er. The method was implemented within the program HINT. The experimental evaluation of HINT demonstrates its ability to e ectively decompose the problem into smaller, less complex problems, and by this discover data models of high classi cation accuracy that include potentially relevant and interpretable concepts.
