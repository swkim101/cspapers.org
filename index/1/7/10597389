Squeezing sensations are one of the most common and intimate forms of human contact. In this paper, we investigate HapticClench, a device that generates squeezing sensations using shape memory alloys. We define squeezing feedback in terms of it perceptual properties and conduct a psychophysical evaluation of HapticClench. HapticClench is capable of generating up to four levels of distinguishable load and works well in distracted scenarios. HapticClench has a high spatial acuity and can generate spatial patterns on the wrist that the user can accurately recognize. We also demonstrate the use of HapticClench for communicating gradual progress of an activity, and for generating squeezing sensations using rings and loose bracelets.
