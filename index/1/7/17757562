This paper describes a graduate seminar given by the authors at Stanford University in the Department of Psychology in the Spring of 1980. Although the seminar was also listed as a Computer Science course and was attended by students and faculty from Computer Science and other departments, the course was addressed to Ph.D. students in cognitive psychology. The seminar assumed that the students were familiar with modern cognitive psychology, but did not assume that they necessarily had much experience with interactive computing.
