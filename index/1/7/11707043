Although the image representation methods of the hierarchical data structures have many merits and applications, they put too much emphasis upon the symmetry of segmentation. Therefore, they are not the optimal representation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel gray image representation method by using the direct non-symmetry and anti-packing model with K-lines (DNAMK). Also, we present an algorithm of the DNAMK for gray images and analyze the storage structure and the total data amount of the algorithm. By comparing the representation algorithm of the DNAMK with those of the triangle non-symmetry and anti-packing model (TNAM) and the classic linear quadtree, the experimental results presented in this paper show that the former can greatly reduce the numbers of subpatterns or nodes and simultaneously save the data storage much more effectively than the latter, and therefore it is a better method to represent gray images.
