This paper describes the methods used for our submission to the KDD 2007 Challenge on Time Series Classification. For each dataset we selected from a pool of methods (individual classifiers or classifier ensembles) using cross validation (CV). Three types of classifiers were considered: nearest neighbour (using DTW), support vector machines (linear and perceptron kernel) and decision forests (boosting, random forest, rotation forest and random oracles). SVM and decision forests used extracted features of two types: similarity-based and interval-based. Two feature selection approaches were applied: FCBF or SVM-RFE. Where the minimum CV errors of several classifiers tied, the labels were assigned through majority vote. We report results with both the practice and the contest data.
