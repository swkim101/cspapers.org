We have formulated a method and implemented a device for magnetic levitation with a translation range which is at least twice as large as the dimensions of the levitated body in all directions. The motion range can be extended to any distance in the horizontal plane by adding more coils to the actuator array, and the rotation is potentially unlimited in all directions.
