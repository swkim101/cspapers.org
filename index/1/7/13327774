Representing the information need is the greatest challenge for opinion retrieval. Typical queries for opinion retrieval are composed of either just content words, or content words with a small number of cue "opinion" words. Both are inadequate for retrieving opinionated documents. In this paper, we develop a general formal framework--the opinion relevance model--to represent an information need for opinion retrieval. We explore a series of methods to automatically identify the most appropriate opinion words for query expansion, including using query independent sentiment resources. We also propose a relevance feedback-based approach to extract opinion words. Both query-independent and query-dependent methods can also be integrated into a more effective mixture relevance model. Finally, opinion retrieval experiments are presented for the Blog06 and COAE08 text collections. The results show that, significant improvements can always be obtained by this opinion relevance model whether sentiment resources are available or not.
