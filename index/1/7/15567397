The idea of Open Data states that by making data sets freely available on the Internet, data owners can beneﬁt from a huge community. In this paper, we extend The DataTank framework, a data adapter for publishing local Open Data as a Web API, to produce semantic output. A data set and its content are identiﬁed by a unique URI, exploiting the REST interface and diﬀerentiating between IR and NIR. Also, a data set can be requested as RDF in multiple notations. Furthermore, ontology information can be added to a data model, thus creating machine-understandable RDF. This ontology information is made externally reusable and changeable. The DataTank now produces semantic output, while the original architecture remains unchanged.
