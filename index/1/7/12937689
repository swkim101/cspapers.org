Smart services concern the core element of a smart city, since they support the realization of urban "intelligence" in terms of people, economy, governance, environment, mobility and leaving. Smart services aim to enhance quality of life within a city and in this respect to improve "livability". The types and purposes of smart services cannot be easily pre-defined, since they are the outcome of innovation, which cannot be pre-defined either, but instead it is the product of citizens' and businesses' creativity. However, standard bodies that work on smart city definition have described smart city portfolios, which are suggested to city policy makers and potential entrepreneurs. The aim of this paper is to validate whether standardized smart service portfolios are being followed by smart cities in practice. In this regard, a set of more than 70 smart cities are examined and their smart services are matched to these portfolios. The outcomes are extremely important and leave space for future research in this regard.
