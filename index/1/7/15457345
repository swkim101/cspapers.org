A laboratory exercise for CS2 is presented. In the exercise, students are given seven different implementations of an operator to insert an item into an ordered list. After estimating the time to insert 1000 random integers into an initially empty list for each implementation, students determine the times experimentally and then answer some related questions. The exercise enables students to gain insight into several important dichotomies: linked vs. contiguous, recursive vs. iterative, and dynamic vs. static.
