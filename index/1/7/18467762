A Matlab based software package to design control algorithms, such as LQG, for systems with general noise models, and to study the performance of control loops, is presented. It is argued that a digital control course should be taught from scratch. The advantages of the polynomial approach are highlighted. The use of the control design package for the proposed course is illustrated along with a schedule of lectures and a summary of experience at two different institutions
