A novel three axis force sensor, based on magnetic flux measurements, was used in the fingers of a gripper. The force sensor uses three Hall Effect sensors orthogonally placed at the base of a hemisphere made of silicon rubber. A neodymium permanent magnet was inside the hemisphere. When a force was applied to the perimeter of hemisphere, it compressed the hemisphere displacing the magnet. This displacement caused change in the magnetic field around the Hall-effect sensors. By analysing these changes, we calculated the force in three directions using a lookup table. This sensor can be used in robot grippers to manipulate objects dexterously with tactile feedback. The cheap construction, robustness and reliability are few advantages of this sensor for it to be used in industrial applications. The sensor design, simulation and its characterization are presented in this work. Furthermore, as an application, a peg in a hole experiment was carried out to present the ability of the sensors to be used in robot grippers for manipulation tasks.
