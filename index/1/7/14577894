Web Applications (WA) are developed and maintained under tight schedules. Much similarity across WAs creates opportunities for cutting development cost and easing evolution via reuse. This tutorial shows a practical way to exploit similarity patterns - at architecture and code levels - to simplify the design of WAs, helping to meet the unique challenges of Web engineering.
