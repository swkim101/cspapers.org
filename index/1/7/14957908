The whole DNA sequences of many organisms are being determined by international collaborations, and some of them have already been made public at various ftp sites. Now the main topic of researches on such organisms has shifted to the systematic functional analysis of the genes. Our research group has installed a systematic experimental method which allows both multiple gene disruptions and multiple gene overexpressions. By using this method, we have launched a project whose purpose is to reveal the gene regulatory networks between the 6,200 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae while many laboratories have also started similar projects. This project consists of two different tasks in addition to the task of experiments. One is to develop algorithms (strategies) for constructing gene regulatory networks from experimental data and testing the consistency of data with already known gene regulatory networks. The second is to construct a knowledge base of gene regulatory networks which have been already known for various organisms. By combining the results of these two tasks, our project will determine a rough figure of the gene regulatory network. For the first task, we have developed several strategies. In this short abstract, we briefly describe the theoretical results implied by these strategies. Although the developed strategies are not yet practical, we believe that they give a foundation for developing practical strategies. Readers interested in details may refer Ref. [1].
