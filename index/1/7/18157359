Pervasive computing aims to build an aggregated environment around a user by knitting diverse computing and communicating devices and software services into a single homogeneous unit. Our work is to develop a Pervasive computing framework which harnesses the power of Semantic Web and Web Services, facilitating the development of effective and intelligent Pervasive environments. This paper presents a high level view of the framework and how different Pervasive services can be built on this framework.
