As a first step, we introduce PlaceAvoider, a technique for owners of first-person cameras to ‘blacklist’ sensitive spaces (like bathrooms and bedrooms). PlaceAvoider recognizes images captured in these spaces and flags them for review before the images are made available to applications. PlaceAvoider performs novel image analysis using both fine-grained image features (like specific objects) and coarse-grained, scene-level features (like colors and textures) to classify where a photo was taken. PlaceAvoider combines these features in a probabilistic framework that jointly labels streams of images in order to improve accuracy. We test the technique on five realistic firstperson image datasets and show it is robust to blurriness, motion, and occlusion.
