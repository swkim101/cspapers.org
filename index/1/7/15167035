Satisfying the basic requirements of accuracy and understandability of a classifier, decision tree classifiers have become very popular. Instead of constructing the decision tree by a so F histicated al orithm, in eractive met od K we introduce a fully based on a multidimensional visualization techni interaction capabilities. T R ue and appropriate us domam knowledge of an expert can be prof&ably included in the tree construction phase. Furthermore, after the interactive construction of a decision tree the user has a much deeper understandin o$ the data than just knowm f the decision f ree generated by an arbitrary a active a gorithm. The interof most ii preach also overcomes the limitation ecision trees which are fixed to binary s a low to backtrack in the tree construction Ii lits for numeric attributes and which do not phase. Our performance evaluation with several well-known datasets demonstrates that even users with no a priori knowledge of the data construct a decision tree with an accuracy similar to the tree algorithms. enerated by state of the art Addi tonally, visual interactive F classification significant1 reduces the tree size and improves the un erstandibility of the B resulting decision tree.
