This paper presents an overview of the current state of the PSI automatic program synthesis system and discusses the design considerations. The PSI system allows a user to specify a desired program in a dialogue using natural language and traces. PSI then synthesizes a program meeting these specifications. The target programs are simple symbolic computation programs in LISP.
 PSI may be described as a knowledge-based program understanding system. It is organized as a collection of closely interacting modules, or experts in the areas of natural language, discourse, traces, application domain, high-level program modelling, coding, and efficiency. An implementation effort is underway and several modules are now working.
