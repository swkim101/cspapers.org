The success of recommender systems has made them the focus of a massive research effort in both industry and academia. Recent work has generalized recommendations to suggest packages of items to single users, or single items to groups of users. However, to the best of our knowledge, the interesting problem of recommending a package to a group of users (P2G) has not been studied to date. This is a problem with several practical applications, such as recommending vacation packages to tourist groups, entertainment packages to groups of friends, or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper, we formulate the P2G problem, and we propose probabilistic models that capture the preference of a group towards a package, incorporating factors such as user impact and package viability. We also investigate the issue of recommendation fairness. This is a novel consideration that arises in our setting, where we require that no user is consistently slighted by the item selection in the package. We present aggregation algorithms for finding the best packages and compare our suggested models with baseline approaches stemming from previous work. The results show that our models find packages of high quality which consider all special requirements of P2G recommendation.
