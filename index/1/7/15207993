Anonymous Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption (AIBBE) allows a sender to broadcast a ciphertext to multi-receivers, and keeps receivers' anonymity. The existing AIBBE schemes fail to achieve efficient decryption or strong security, like the constant decryption complexity, the security under the adaptive attack, or the security in the standard model. Hence, we propose two new AIBBE schemes to overcome the drawbacks of previous schemes in the state-of-art. The biggest contribution in our work is the proposed AIBBE scheme with constant decryption complexity and the provable security under the adaptive attack in the standard model. This scheme should be the first one to obtain advantages in all above mentioned aspects, and has sufficient contribution in theory due to its strong security. We also propose another AIBBE scheme in the Random Oracle (RO) model, which is of sufficient interest in practice due to our experiment.
