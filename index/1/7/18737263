The use of a satellite graphics system is presented as an approach to preprocessing finite element analysis data. The paper discusses the use of curved isoparametric shape functions as the basis of finite element mesh generation and the effects this approach has on the design of a system to support these activities. A minicomputer based design system is presented and its application to a practical three dimensional mesh generation problem is demonstrated.
