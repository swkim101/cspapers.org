This paper proposes a method for evaluating the validity of partial parse trees constructed in incremental parsing. Our method is based on stochastic incremental parsing, and it incrementally evaluates the validity for each partial parse tree on a word-by-word basis. In our method, incremental parser returns partial parse trees at the point where the validity for the partial parse tree becomes greater than a threshold. Our technique is effective for improving the accuracy of incremental parsing.
