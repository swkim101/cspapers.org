We prove two results about the value of Delsarte 's linear program for binary codes. Our main result is a new lower bound on the value of the program, which, in particular, is nearly tight for low rate codes. We also give an easy proof of a (known) upper bound, which coincides with the best known bound for a wide range of parameters.
