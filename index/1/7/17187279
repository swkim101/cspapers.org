We present a static analysis algorithm for detecting security vulnerabilities in PHP, a popular server-side scripting language for building web applications. Our analysis employs a novel three-tier architecture to capture information at decreasing levels of granularity at the intrablock, intraprocedural, and interprocedural level. This architecture enables us to handle dynamic features of scripting languages that have not been adequately addressed by previous techniques. 
 
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on six popular open source PHP code bases, finding 105 previously unknown security vulnerabilities, most of which we believe are remotely exploitable.
