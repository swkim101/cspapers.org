The problem of localizing occlusions between consecutive frames of a video is important but rarely tackled on its own. In most works, it is tightly interleaved with the computation of accurate optical flows, which leads to a delicate chicken-and-egg problem. With this in mind, we propose a novel approach to occlusion detection where visibility or not of a point in next frame is formulated in terms of visual reconstruction. The key issue is now to determine how well a pixel in the first image can be "reconstructed" from co-located colors in the next image. We first exploit this reasoning at the pixel level with a new detection criterion. Contrary to the ubiquitous displaced-framedifference and forward-backward flow vector matching, the proposed alternative does not critically depend on a precomputed, dense displacement field, while being shown to be more effective. We then leverage this local modeling within an energy-minimization framework that delivers occlusion maps. An easy-to-obtain collection of parametric motion models is exploited within the energy to provide the required level of motion information. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods on the challenging MPI Sintel dataset.
