In this paper we analyse how noise can affect Knowledge Acquisition from a Machine Learning perspective. We present some methods to detect and treat noise that goes beyond modulating numerical coefficients and show that noise cannot be viewed as a single entity. There are several different types of noise and noise is not only wrong information.
