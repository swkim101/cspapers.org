We study parallel computational methods for integer linear programming problem with two variables. Applying several novel techniques, we prove that this problem is NC-equivalent to computing the continued fraction expansion of a rational number, that is, to computing all the intermediate remainders in the Euclidean algorithm applied to two integers, plus to computing the output of an iterated modulo function, with the remainder sequence from the Euclidean algorithm (that is, with the continued fraction expansion of a rational number) as its input arguments. The best previously known results are special cases of our theorem.
