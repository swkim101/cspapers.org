In this paper, we provide a new passive model order reduction algorithm on interconnects, which is based on the Chebyshev expansion of their impulse response. The Chebyshev coefficient matrices of the impulse response of the reduced order model up to a given order remain the same as those of the original network, so that the time domain transient response of the reduced order model matches that of the original network well. Compared with the model order reduction algorithms based on the frequency domain response, it is more efficient in dealing with complicated transient waveforms of interconnects where strong inductance effects are involved.
