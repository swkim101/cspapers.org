In this paper, a computational approach for resolving zero-pronouns in Spanish texts is proposed. Our approach has been evaluated with partial parsing of the text and the results obtained show that these pronouns can be resolved using similar techniques that those used for pronominal anaphora. Compared to other well-known baselines on pronominal anaphora resolution, the results obtained with our approach have been consistently better than the rest.
