The problem of gas detection is relevant to many real-world applications, such as leak detection in industrial settings and surveillance. In this paper we address the problem of gas detection in large areas with a mobile robotic platform equipped with a remote gas sensor. We propose a novel method based on convex relaxation for quickly finding an exploration plan that guarantees a complete coverage of the environment. Our method proves to be highly efficient in terms of computational requirements and to provide nearly-optimal solutions. We validate our approach both in simulation and in real environments, thus demonstrating its applicability to real-world problems.
