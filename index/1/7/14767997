Rules provide the functionality for constraint enforcement and view maintenance. A provably correct mplementation of both issues based on rules, requires onfluent and terminating behaviour of the rule set. Iowever, little work has been done so far on the static letection of these properties. In this paper, a design heory for rule sets in an 00DBMS is developed. This paper introduces two predicates, viz., Terninat e(n) and Independent, which imply respectively ermination and confluence. Both predicates are char~cterised under two kinds of rule execution seman,ics: set and instance based. The decidability of he predicates is proven and it is shown that set and nstance based semantics coincide whenever the rule let is independent and terminates. Moreover, sufficient conditions of low algorithmic complexity for both 17erminate(n) and Independent under both kinds of senantics are given.
