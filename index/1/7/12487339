Although community discovery has been studied extensively in the Web environment, limited research has been done in the case of free text. Co-occurrence of words and entities in sentences and documents usually implies connections among them. In this paper, we investigate the co-occurrences of named entities in text, and mine communities among these entities. We show that identifying communities from free text can be transformed into a graph clustering problem. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is then proposed. Our experiment shows that the algorithm is effective to discover named entity communities from text documents.
