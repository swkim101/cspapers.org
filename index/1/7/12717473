This work focuses on the modeling and control of robotic manipulators powered by compliant actuation systems equipped with clutches for providing friction torque on demand. A novel control scheme is proposed for modulating the clutch friction torque in this particular class of compliant actuators to make the robot operate in “Rigid mode” when it does not interact with the environment to achieve high accuracy, bandwidth and controllability; meanwhile ensuring that the robot maximum static force is constrained to a maximum threshold permitting flexible reactions in potentially risky scenarios. The robot autonomously switches to “Compliant mode” (clutches off) when it interacts with external agents to exploit the advantages of compliance during contacts. Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of proposed approach in improving the robot performance (tracking accuracy) while still guaranteeing an interaction-friendly behavior when contact occurs.
