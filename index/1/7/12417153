Energy efficiency is one of the most important design considerations in running modern datacenters. Datacenter operating systems rely on software techniques such as execution migration to achieve energy efficiency across pools of machines. Execution migration is possible in datacenters today because they consist mainly of homogeneous-ISA machines. However, recent market trends indicate that alternate ISAs such as ARM and PowerPC are pushing into the datacenter, meaning current execution migration techniques are no longer applicable. How can execution migration be applied in future heterogeneous-ISA datacenters? In this work we present a compiler, runtime, and an operating system extension for enabling execution migration between heterogeneous-ISA servers. We present a new multi-ISA binary architecture and heterogeneous-OS containers for facilitating efficient migration of natively-compiled applications. We build and evaluate a prototype of our design and demonstrate energy savings of up to 66% for a workload running on an ARM and an x86 server interconnected by a high-speed network.
