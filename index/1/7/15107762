Knowledge bases and the Web of Linked Data have become important assets for search, recommendation, and analytics. Natural-language questions are a user-friendly mode of tapping this wealth of knowledge and data. However, question answering technology does not work robustly in this setting as questions have to be translated into structured queries and users have to be careful in phrasing their questions. This paper advocates a new approach that allows questions to be partially translated into relaxed queries, covering the essential but not necessarily all aspects of the user's input. To compensate for the omissions, we exploit textual sources associated with entities and relational facts. Our system translates user questions into an extended form of structured SPARQL queries, with text predicates attached to triple patterns. Our solution is based on a novel optimization model, cast into an integer linear program, for joint decomposition and disambiguation of the user question. We demonstrate the quality of our methods through experiments with the QALD benchmark.
