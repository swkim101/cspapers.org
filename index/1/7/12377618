This paper argues that the reuse of domain knowledge must be complemented by the reuse of problem-solving methods. Problem-solving methods (PSMs) provide a means to structure search, and can provide tractable solutions to reasoning with a very large knowledge base. We show that PSMs can be used in a way which complements large-scale representation techniques, and optimisations such as those for taxonornie reasoning found in Cyc. Our approach illustrates the advantages of task-oriented knowledge modelling and we demonstrate that the resulting ontologies have both task-dependent and task-independent elements. Further, we show how the task ontology can be organised into conceptual levels to reflect knowledge typing principles.
