Three examples using mixed language programming in Maple and C are provided for the express purpose of highlighting, in a practical way, various issues normally discussed in a traditional programming languages class only as theoretical concepts. The three examples highlight concepts in parameter passing techniques, storage order choices, native machine types and sizes, and the handling of single and multi-dimensional arrays when dealing with legacy code.
