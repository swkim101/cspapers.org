Ravel is a software framework for developing sensor network applications that follow the eMbedded-Gateway-Cloud architecture. Developers describe a Ravel application as a data processing pipeline in terms of two abstractions: models and transforms between models. This pipeline generates code for controllers that can compile to and run on any element of the architecture, from embedded devices to cloud servers. Developers also specify views, that represent the data set on a particular device. Therefore, each device type is a space where data flows via transform. The framework automatically handles moving data between spaces using appropriate network protocols. Compile-time tools verify that the code, once modified by the developer, still follows application specification as defined by the data pipeline.
