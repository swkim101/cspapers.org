In this paper, we propose an in-situ Crowd-aware Sensing Platform, called "CrowdMon", which envisions the cooperation among mobile users in highly crowded urban areas such as metro and square. CrowdMon establishes a spontaneous connection from co-located users in a semantic proximity and enables them to share contextual information such as location, ambient music, and mood of places. To the best of our knowledge, CrowdMon is the first attempt to support crowd-aware services at a platform level. We show interesting use cases of CrowdMon and an initial system design to realize the crowd-based context sharing.
