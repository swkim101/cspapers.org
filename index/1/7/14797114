When is the volume of a convex polytope in Râ€™ close to the number of lattice points in the polytope? We show that if the polytope contains a ball of radius n-, where m is the number of facets, then the volume approximates the number of lattice points to within a constant factor. This general condition is then specialized to derive polynomial time sampling and counting algorithms for various combL natorird problems whose solutions can be viewed as lattice points of convex polytopea. We also show, via tight examples, that our condition is essentially the beat possible.
