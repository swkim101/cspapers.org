As service robots become more and more capable of performing useful tasks for us, there is a growing need to teach robots how we expect them to carry out these tasks. However, learning our preferences is a nontrivial problem, as many of them stem from a variety of factors including personal taste, cultural background, or common sense. Obviously, such factors are hard to formulate or model a priori. In this paper, we present a solution for tidying up objects in containers, e.g., shelves or boxes, by following user preferences. We learn the user preferences using collaborative filtering based on crowdsourced and mined data. First, we predict pairwise object preferences of the user. Then, we subdivide the objects in containers by modeling a spectral clustering problem. Our solution is easy to update, does not require complex modeling, and improves with the amount of user data. We evaluate our approach using crowdsoucing data from over 1,200 users and demonstrate its effectiveness for two tidy-up scenarios. Additionally, we show that a real robot can reliably predict user preferences using our approach.
