The development of component based software applications is dependent on tools and environments that support the design and deployment of software components. In this paper a selection of Integrated Development Environments (IDE) for creating J2EE applications have been analyzed and the assessment criteria for their efficient use have been proposed. The purpose of this work is to make a correct choice of the IDEs, which facilitates the delivery of software development modules within the information systems curriculum of a university environment.
