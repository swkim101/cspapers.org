Finding a tight upper bound of the worst-case response time in a distributed real-time embedded system is a very challenging problem since we have to consider execution time variations of tasks, jitter of input arrivals, scheduling anomaly behavior in a multi-tasking system, all together. In this paper, we translate the problem as an optimization problem and propose a novel solution based on ILP (Integer Linear Programming). In the proposed technique, we formulate a set of ILP formulas in a compositional way for modeling flexibility, but solve the problem holistically to achieve tighter upper bounds. To mitigate the time complexity of the ILP method, we perform static analysis based on a scheduling heuristic to reduce the number of variables and confine the variable ranges. Preliminary experiments with the benchmarks used in the related work and a real-life example show promising results that give tight bounds in an affordable solution time.
