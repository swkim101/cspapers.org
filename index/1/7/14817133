In an antenna duplexer, one antenna is used by switching transmission signals and reception signals having different frequencies. The antenna duplexer includes a high-frequency switching circuit and a band-pass filter. The high-frequency switching circuit supplies the transmission signals from a transmission part to the antenna. The band-pass filter outputs the reception signals outputted from the antenna to the predetermined receiving circuit. In the band-pass filter, the frequency characteristic is selected and set to impress the frequency of the transmission signals, and simultaneously the reflected wave generated at the input end so that impedance increases at the frequency band of the transmission signals.
