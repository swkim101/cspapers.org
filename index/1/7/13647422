In this paper, a strategy to attenuate tremor based on co-contraction of antagonist muscles using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is fully presented. Both methods to track tremor features in real-time, while filtering voluntary motion, and to identify a suitable joint model are described. Using this information, the stimulation controller modulates joint stiffness based on tremor intensity, while preventing the generation of undesirable joint torque. An experimental evaluation of the system, which confirmed the effectiveness of the approach, is also presented.
