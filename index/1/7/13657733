Many fields of human endeavour, such as biology and the theory of complex systems, are now embracing the concept of self-organization based on local actions leading to a desirable global emergent behavior. While many examples, both natural and artificial, can be found of such self-organized systems, the relationship between the local rules and the global behavior remains elusive and no systematic procedure is known to engineer a specific global result. Given the increasing pervasiveness of wireless networks of all sorts, including ad hoc networks competing within narrow unlicensed bands and wireless sensor networks, self-organization could constitute the next defining paradigm in wireless communications. It can be shown that a set of heuristic principles can be leveraged to engineer a self-organized connection-oriented wireless network with minimal complexity. Such a system requires no centralization of information, yet achieves a nearly optimal global state with only a modest amount of local signaling. It will naturally and jointly balance the many parameters related to radio resource management, exhibiting great adaptability, fault tolerance and scalability.
