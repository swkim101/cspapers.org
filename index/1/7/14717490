Finding all occurrences of a non-rectangular pattern of height m and area a in an n×n text with no more than k mismatch, insertion, and deletion errors is an important problem in computer vision. It can be solved using a dynamic programming approach in time O(an2). We show a O(kn2 √ m logm √ k log k + k2n2) algorithm which combines convolutions with dynamic programming. At the heart of the algorithm are the Smaller Matching Problem and the k-Aligned Ones with Location Problem. Efficient algorithms to solve both these problems are presented.
