In the software engineering industry the technique of pair programming can be used as a means of enhancing programmer productivity and the quality of the software development process. Pair programming has also been used in computer science education as a mechanism to address some of the educational challenges faced by students learning to program. An action research study is described in which pair programming is used as part of the learning and assessment regime in introductory programming. Module data has been used over a three year cycle to evaluate the impact of pair programming on student performance and confidence in programming, and to gain insights into its practical application. Within-subject analysis confirms previously reported observations of overall improved student performance. Qualitative analysis identifies areas for refinement in the practical application of pair programming for learning and assessment, particularly in relation to pairwise communication, establishing protocols for conflict resolution and development of professional competencies.
