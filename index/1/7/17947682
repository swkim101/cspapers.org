Abstract : Triton is one of the first attempts to provide comprehensive object management support for process-centered environments. It provides a behavioral object-oriented type model capable of supporting process programming languages. Triton also provides explicit support for heterogeneous interoperability in the form of multi-language access as well as shared data using a common type model. Implementing Triton has increased the authors' understanding of the requirements for such object managers, and they are now in a better position to determine which new object managers are appropriate candidates for inclusion in a process-centered environment.
