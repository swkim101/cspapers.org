LPL [5], or BoX-MAC in its TinyOS implementation, is arguably the most common MAC protocol for WSNs. Its extensive use in real world deployments is justified by a simple implementation, available online, that meets the requirements of a vast majority of monitoring applications. Despite the plethora of competitors, it still remains the reference in the MAC scheduling world. However, its random nature inherently hampers its possibility to support effectively any application driven Quality of Service requirement.
