Radio spectrum has turned into a precious natural resource from free goods due to the rapid development of wireless communication technology. In order to efficiently utilize radio spectrum, a spectrum policy should be enough appropriate to create new industries and new technologies. From this point of view, we have developed a distributed spectrum sensing system which collects dense information of spectrum usage over large area. In this work, we discuss the requirements and the design of the distributed spectrum sensing system.
