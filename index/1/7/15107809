With this paper we describe a well suited, scalable problem for reinforcement learning approaches in the field of mobile robots. We show a suitable representation of the problem for a reinforcement approach and present our results with a model based standard algorithm. Two different approximators for the value function are used, a grid based approximator and a neural network based approximator.
