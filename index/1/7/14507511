Much research in learning to rank has been placed on developing sophisticated learning methods, treating the training set as a given. However, the number of judgments in the training set directly aff ects the quality of the learned system. Given the expense of obtaining relevance judgments for constructing training data, one often has a limited budget in terms of how many judgments he can get. The major problem then is how to distribute this judgment e ffort across diff erent queries. In this paper, we investigate the tradeo ff between the number of queries and the number of judgments per query when training sets are constructed. In particular, we show that up to a limit, training sets with more queries but shallow (less) judgments per query are more cost effective than training sets with less queries but deep (more) judgments per query.
