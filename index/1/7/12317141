The emerging three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) is beneficial for various applications from both area and performance perspectives. While the general trend in processor design has been shifting from multi-core to many-core, questions such as whether 3D integration should be adopted, and how to choose among various design options must be addressed at the early design stage. In order to guide the final design towards a cost-effective direction, system-level cost evaluation is one of the most critical issues to be considered. In this paper, we propose a 3D many-core multiprocessor cost model, which includes wafer, bonding, package, and cooling cost analysis. Using the proposed cost model, we evaluate the optimal partitioning strategies for 16−, 32− and 64-core multiprocessors from the cost point of view.
