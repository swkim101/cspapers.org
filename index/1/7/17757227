In this paper, the global RAC-measure is proposed to a redundant manipulator mounted on a flexible body for a task-space feedback control. The tip control should be carefully designed when the dynamics of the manipulator and the flexible body are coupled such as humanoids. The measure is used to determine the redundant degrees of freedom of the manipulator based on the RAC (robust arm configuration) concept. The proposed measure evaluates the global robustness of arm configuration by mixing each RAC-measure for individual vibration mode. The redundancy of the manipulator is determined for a desired tip trajectory based on the proposed measure. As a result, a high-gain tip position control can be applied without considering the base flexibility. The validity is confirmed by a feedback-based continuous tracking for a 4 DOF human-like redundant manipulator mounted on a 3 DOF flexible body.
