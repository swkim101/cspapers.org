This paper presents a new approach to computer science education by proposing a model curriculum that presents computer science fundamentals and software engineering concepts in the context of an application domain. This domain-centered model is discussed in terms of its philosophy and structure, and emphasizes curriculum features that enhance the ability of a graduate to be part of a team that develops software in the application domain. In particular, the curriculum model proposes integration of software engineering education with the application domain. The undergraduate computer science curriculum at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University is used to illustrate the principle features of the model and to advance arguments about the model's viability.
