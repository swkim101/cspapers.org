This paper proposes a novel algorithm for extracting informative motion features in daily life action recognition based on support vector machine (SVM). The main advantage of the proposed method is not only to extract remarkable motion features, which fit into human intuition, but also to improve the performance of the recognition system. Concretely speaking, the main properties of the proposed method are 1) optimizing kernel parameters so as to minimize its generalization error, 2) extracting remarkable motion features in response to the sensitivity of the kernel function. Experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm improves the accuracy of the recognition system and enables human to identify informative motion features intuitively.
