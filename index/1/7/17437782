The PTIDEJ project started in 2001 to study code generation from and identification of patterns. Since then, it has evolved into a complete reverse-engineering tool suite that includes several identification algorithms. It is a flexible tool suite that attempts to ease as much as possible the development of new identification and analysis algorithms. Recently, the module D<scp>ECOR</scp> has been added to P<scp>TIDEJ</scp> and allows the detection of design defects, which are recurring design problems. In this demonstration, we particularly focus on the creation and use of identification algorithms for design patterns and defects.
