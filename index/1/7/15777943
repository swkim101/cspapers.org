In this paper, we describe the use of similarity metrics in anovel visual environment for storing and retrieving favorite webpages. The similarity metrics, called Implicit Queries, areused to automatically highlight stored web pages that are relatedto the currently selected web page. Two experiments explored howusers manage their personal web information space with and withoutthe Implicit Query highlighting and later retrieve their stored webpages. When storing and organizing web pages, users with ImplicitQuery highlighting generated slightly more categories. ImplicitQueries also led to faster web page retrieval time, although theresults were not statistically significant.
