Linear hashing with partial expansions is a file organization intended for dynamic files. In this paper an improved version of the method is presented. Instead of having a separate overflow area, the storage area for overflow records is incorporated into the main file. Hence, all the records are stored in one file which grows and shrinks according to the number of records stored. By using several overflow chains per page, the retrieval performance is further improved. The expected performance of the new scheme is studied by means of a few examples.
