The TEST (Troubleshooting Expert System Tool) architecture greatly aided the development of TDE (TEST Development Environment). In particular, the choice of a schematic as opposed to rule-based representation led to a knowledge base characterized by the use of domain-familiar concepts, and sufficient conceptual structure to facilitate several TDE features, including knowledge base development through both directecfinterviews and the direct manipulation of icons; multiple knowledge-based browsing strategies; heuristic error analysis; and easily-unaerstooa debugging techniques.
