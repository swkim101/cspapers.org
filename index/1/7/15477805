Human-machine interaction is a process that we generally take to involve a person with a piece of technology, human factors being the problem of designing an interface to the technology that will al low the person to use it effectively. In contrast, the research reported in this panel takes a step back from the problem of human factors narrowly construed, to look at the use of machines in a wider context of ongoing human activities. The panelists report the results of four studies in the relation of human-machine interaction to the organization of practical, albeit highly specialized activities, in real-world settings. The activities studied comprise high energy physics, laboratory science, aircraft flight piloting and navigation, and obstetrics. These activities have several things in common. First, each is undertaken not by a single individual, but as a collaborative effort. Second, the requirement for the effort is not only that the activity be done, but that it be done in a particular way; that is, there are welldeveloped criteria for success and failure and, in two cases at least, the consequences of failure may actually be fatal. Third, success in each case includes the competent use of technology, as a crucial element in what the activity is understood to be, and how it is carried out. The problem addrsssed by these studies is: How do the activities in question organize, and how are they organized by, their respective technologies? The emphasis in each case is on the relation of technology to the production and distribution of relevant information, and on the relation of specialization among participants, and of conventionally defined standard practices, to the use of the technology. The studies all use rigorous qualitative methods, where the priority is on understanding how technology affects and is effected by the real-time organization of events. In each case the general issues are presented through concrete examples.
