Policy Routing (PR) is a new area of development that attempts to incorporate policy related constraints on inter-Administrative Domain (AD) communication into the route computation and forwarding of inter-AD packets.
Proposals for inter-AD routing mechanisms are discussed in the context of a design space defined by three design parameters: location of routing decision (i.e., source or hop-by-hop), algorithm used (i.e., link state or distance vector), and expression of policy in topology or in link status. We conclude that an architecture based upon source routing, a link state algorithm, and policy information in the link state advertisements, is best able to address the long-term policy requirements of inter-AD routing. However, such an architecture raises several new and challenging research issues related to scaling.
