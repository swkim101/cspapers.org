Ontology, an explicit specification of shared conceptualization, has been increasingly used to define formal data semantics and improve data reusability and interoperability in enterprise information systems. In this paper, we present and demonstrate SOR (Scalable Ontology Repository), a practical system for ontology storage, reasoning, and search. SOR uses Relational DBMS to store ontologies, performs inference over them, and supports SPARQL language for query. Furthermore, a faceted search with relationship navigation is designed and implemented for ontology search. This demonstration shows how to efficiently solve three key problems in practical ontology management in RDBMS, namely storage, reasoning, and search. Moreover, we show how the SOR system is used for semantic master data management.
