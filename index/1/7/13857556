The popularity of high-density flash memory as data storage media has increased steadily for a wide spectrum of computing devices such as PDA's, MP3 players, mobile phones and digital cameras. More recently, computer manufacturers started launching new lines of mobile or portable computers that did away with magnetic disk drives altogether, replacing them with tens of gigabytes of NAND flash memory. Like EEPROM and magnetic disk drives, flash memory is non-volatile and retains its contents even when the power is turned off. As its capacity increases and price drops, flash memory will compete more successfully with lower-end, lower-capacity disk drives. It is thus not inconceivable to consider running a full database system on the flash-only computing platforms or running an embedded database system on the lightweight computing devices. In this paper, we present a new design called in-page logging (IPL) for flash memory based database servers. This new design overcomes the limitations of flash memory such as high write latency, and exploits unique characteristics of flash memory to achieve the best attainable performance for flash-based database servers. We show empirically that the IPL approach can yield considerable performance benefit over traditional design for disk-based database servers. We also show that the basic design of IPL can be elegantly extended to support transactional database recovery.
