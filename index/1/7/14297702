We propose a distributed simulation method which is particularly well suited for the simulation of large synchronous networks. In general, distributed simulation has significant potential for alleviating the time and memory constraints often encountered when using conventional simulation techniques. Currently proposed methods for distributed simulation suffer performance degradation due to the employment of strategies for preventing deadlock and due to artificial blocking of processes. We describe a new method for doing distributed simulation which is deadlock free whenever the physical system being simulated is deadlock free. Furthermore, our method does not suffer from artificial blocking of processes.
