1. Introduction Functional languages are known primarily for their elegance, clarity, and expressive power. Unfortunately, this same elegance and power has been a bottleneck to building efficient implementations for such languages, especially those with fully "lazy" evaluation semantics. David Turner in his seminal paper [19] showed how the language SASL, a functional language with lazy evaluation , could be implemented simply and elegantly using
