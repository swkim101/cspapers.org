It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 8th International Workshop on Location and the Web (LocWeb2018) at WWW 2018. LocWeb 2018 will continue a successful workshop series at the intersection of location-based services and Web architecture. It focuses on Web-scale services and systems facilitating location-aware information access as well as on Spatial Social Behavior Analytics on the Web as part of social computing. The location topic is seen as a cross-cutting issue equally concerning information access, semantics and standards, social analysis and mining, and Web-scale systems and services. The workshop is an integrated venue where location and spatio-social aspects can be discussed in depth with an interested community. New application areas for Web architecture, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Web of Things (WoT), will lead to increasingly rich and large sets of applications for which location is highly relevant as the connection to the physical world. Location has high importance in Web-based designs, and it continues to provide challenging research questions.
