In this paper, touch typing enabled virtual keyboard system using depth sensing on arbitrary surface is proposed. Keystroke event detection is conducted using 3-dimensional hand appearance database matching combined with fingertip's surface touch sensing. Our prototype system acquired hand posture depth map by implementing phase shift algorithm for Digital Light Processor (DLP) fringe projection on arbitrary flat surface. The system robustly detects hand postures on the sensible surface with no requirement of hand position alignment on virtual keyboard frame. The keystroke feedback is the physical touch to the surface, thus no specific hardware must be worn. The system works real-time in average of 20 frames per second.
