Words are polysemous. However, most approaches to representation learning for lexical semantics assign a single vector to every surface word type. Meanwhile, lexical ontologies such as WordNet provide a source of complementary knowledge to distributional information, including a word sense inventory. In this paper we propose two novel and general approaches for generating sense-specific word embeddings that are grounded in an ontology. The first applies graph smoothing as a postprocessing step to tease the vectors of different senses apart, and is applicable to any vector space model. The second adapts predictive maximum likelihood models that learn word embeddings with latent variables representing senses grounded in an specified ontology. Empirical results on lexical semantic tasks show that our approaches effectively captures information from both the ontology and distributional statistics. Moreover, in most cases our sense-specific models outperform other models we compare against.
