This paper examines the problem of balancing the job load in a network of processors, and introduces an online algorithm for scheduling a sequence of jobs in a competitive manner. The algorithm is shown to be polylog (n)-competitive according to a strict definition that forces the online algorithm to be competitive even when considering any bounded area of the network and bounded period of time.
We also analyze the common greedy feedback-based approach, and provide matching lower and upper bounds (up to a polylogarithmic factor) for the tradeoff between the costs of searches and updates under this approach.
