Recently, a new image appearance model called iCAM06 was designed for high dynamic range (HDR) image rendering. Most of the HDR rendering algorithms include many color space transformations from RGB of input image to RGB of output devices for HDR rendering. The iCAM06, the representative HDR rendering algorithm, also contains several color space conversion steps during the processes of chromatic adaptation, tone compression, and etc. However, frequent color space changes of the iCAM06 cause hue shift and color distortion of the output image. To solve these problems, we propose the hue shift correction step using the rotation matrix and reduce the hue change of the output images in the iCAM06. In this paper, the rotation matrix for the hue shift correction is calculated on relationship between the input and output tristimulus value. And experimental results show that the proposed method has high hue accuracy compared to the default iCAM06.
