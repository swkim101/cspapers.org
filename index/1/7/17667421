A number of agile practices are included in software engineering curricula, including test-driven development. Continuous integration often is not included, despite it becoming increasingly common in industry to code, test, and integrate at the same time. This paper describes a study whereby software engineering undergraduates were given a short intensive experience of test-driven development with continuous integration using an environment that imitated a typical industrial circumstance. Assessment was made of students' agile experience rather than of project deliverables, using a novel set of process measures that examined students' participation and performance in agile testing. Results showed good participation by student pairs, and clear understanding of agile processes and configuration management. Future work will investigate automation of the assessment of continuous integration and configuration management server data.
