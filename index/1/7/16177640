For a biped robot to keep walking, basic walking patterns are needed. One method to generate these patterns is to use an extrapolated center of mass (XcoM) concept and constant zero-moment point (ZMP) patterns. However, center of mass (CoM) patterns generated from such a method have discontinuous ZMP and CoM accelerations. For solving this problem, we propose a method in which continuous ZMP patterns can be simply generated from constant ones. In addition, experimental results of forward walking are presented. The results demonstrate that this pattern generation method can give a starting point for walking robots.
