This paper discusses a new kind of electronic books, hyperbooks, which are structured based on semantical content and relations, and whose structure is explicitly modeled by sets of structural and semantical abstractions based on book content, as well as on didactical and adaptation aspects. The paper extends current hypertext modeling and meta modeling approaches by integrating the notion of meta modeling with the notion of multiple perspectives, and describes the design and implementation of such a book using the KBS Hyperbook System for a CS1 course \Intro-duction to Programming".
