The Sun Network Software Environment (NSE) is a net- work-based object manager for software development. The NSE supports parallel development through an optimistic concurrency control mechanism, in which developers do not acquire locks before modifying objects, Instead, developers copy objects, modify the copies, and merge the modified objects with the originals. Objects managed by the NSE are typed, and the set of types can be extended by tool builders. The NSE is designed to work with heterogeneous implementations and poor communication.
