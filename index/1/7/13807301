It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the WWW 2018 Augmenting Intelligence with Humans-in-the-loop (HumL@WWW2018), http://w3id.org/huml/HumL-WWW2018/ The workshop program includes two invited talks. Praveen Paritosh (Google Research) explores the right incentives to motivate human contribution to create knowledge resources. Elena Simperl (University of Southampton) surveys how humans and bots contribute together to the development of the Wikidata knowledge graph. Seven full papers and one short paper were accepted, covering a wide range of topics related to the efficient and effective combination of the strong sides of both machine and crowd computation. Empirical results were provided and discussed with respect to (1) methods for data quality ensurance and labeling task efficiency, (2) the role of gamification elements for improving crowd performance as well as the role of quantum mathematics to simulate human behavior.
