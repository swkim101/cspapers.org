We demonstrate the infrastructure used in the TREC 2015 Total Recall track to facilitate controlled simulation of "assessor in the loop" high-recall retrieval experimentation. The implementation and corresponding design decisions are presented for this platform. This includes the necessary considerations to ensure that experiments are privacy-preserving when using test collections that cannot be distributed. Furthermore, we describe the use of virtual machines as a means of system submission in order to to promote replicable experiments while also ensuring the security of system developers and data providers.
