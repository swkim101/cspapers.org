To investigate how top-down (TD) and bottom-up (BU) information is weighted in the guidance of human search behavior, we manipulated the proportions of BU and TD components in a saliency-based model. The model is biologically plausible and implements an artificial retina and a neuronal population code. The BU component is based on feature-contrast. The TD component is defined by a feature-template match to a stored target representation. We compared the model's behavior at different mixtures of TD and BU components to the eye movement behavior of human observers performing the identical search task. We found that a purely TD model provides a much closer match to human behavior than any mixture model using BU information. Only when biological constraints are removed (e.g., eliminating the retina) did a BU/TD mixture model begin to approximate human behavior.
