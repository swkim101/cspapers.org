In this work, a benchmark to evaluate the retrieval performance of soundtrack recommendation systems is proposed. Such systems aim at finding songs that are played as background music for a given set of images. The proposed benchmark is based on preference judgments, where relevance is considered a continuous ordinal variable and judgments are collected for pairs of songs with respect to a query (i.e., set of images). To capture a wide variety of songs and images, we use a large space of possible music genres, different emotions expressed through music, and various query-image themes. The benchmark consists of two types of relevance assessments: (i) judgments obtained from a user study, that serve as a ``gold standard'' for (ii) relevance judgments gathered through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We report on the performance of two state-of-the-art soundtrack recommendation systems using the proposed benchmark.
