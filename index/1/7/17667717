In retrieval experiments, an effectiveness metrics is used to generate a score for each system-topic pair being tested. It is then usual to average the system-topic scores to obtain a system score, which is used for the purpose of system comparison. In this paper we explore the ramifications of using the geometric mean (GMAP), rather than the arithmetic mean (MAP) when computing an aggregate system score from a set of system-topic scores. We find that GMAP does indeed handle variability in topic difficulty more consistently than does the usual MAP aggregation method.
