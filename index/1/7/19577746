In food-related services, image information is as important as text information for users. For example, in recipe search services, users find recipes based not only on text but also images. To promote studies on food images, many datasets have recently been published. However, they have the following three limitations: most of the datasets include only thousands of images, they only take account of images after cooking not during the cooking process, and the images are not linked to any recipes. In this study, we construct the Cookpad Image Dataset, a novel collection of food images taken from Cookpad, the largest recipe search service in the world. The dataset includes more than 1.64 million images after cooking, and it is the largest among existing datasets. Additionally, it includes more than 3.10 million images taken during the cooking process. To the best of our knowledge, there are no datasets that include such images. Furthermore, the dataset is designed to link to an existing recipe corpus and thus, a variety of recipe texts, such as the title, description, ingredients, and process, is available for each image. In this paper, we described our dataset's features in detail and compared it with existing datasets.
