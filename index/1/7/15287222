We propose a personal workflow management service as part of a social network that enables private users to construct personal workflows according to their specific needs and to keep track of the workflow execution. Unlike traditional workflows, such personal workflows aim at supporting processes that contain personal tasks and data. Our proposal includes a process-oriented case-based reasoning approach to support private users to obtain an appropriate personal workflow through sharing and reuse of respective experience.
