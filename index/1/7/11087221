"Why doesn't my code work?" Instructors and TAs hear this question day in and day out during introductory computer science courses, and beyond. Students arguably have a harder time learning how to debug their own (and others') code than they do in learning how to plan and write the code in the first place. Debugging strategies are difficult to teach, and there are pros and cons to different debugging methods (e.g., print statements vs. gdb vs. Googling). This BoF will elicit strategies for teaching debugging to CS students, and we will discuss the benefits of introducing certain tools earlier or later in the curriculum. We will also discuss how to assess whether students are able to debug code effectively. All suggestions will be posted on CSTeachingTips.org for dissemination (See tinyurl.com/CSTT-TAs for tips from SIGCSE 2015). We welcome attendance from seasoned and novice instructors, and from teaching assistants.
