Algorithm visualizations (AVs) are widely viewed as having the potential for improving computer science education. However, the rate of AV use and overall impact on education does not match the positive interest in their use that instructors report. Surveys of CS faculty show that impediments to successful use of AVs in the classroom include difficulties in finding quality AVs on desired topics, difficulties in adapting AVs to a given classroom setting, and lack of knowledge on the best way to deploy AVs. This indicates a need for better support for instructors, to get them past these barriers. We seek to provide this support through an online educational community that relies on a new model based less on the "digital library" approach of information gained by going to a site and searching. Instead, the focus is on community-added content through members' discussions, reviews, and ratings of content items. The AlgoViz community effort will better focus the future direction of AV development and use.
