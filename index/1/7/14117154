Scalability and sustainability are two fundamental requirements in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Inch scale sensor nodes can operate unattended for long periods if they have sufficient energy sources. In this work, a Self-Powered Sensor Network (SPSN) testbed is introduced. SPSN is cost-efficient and has large-scale deployability. It combines cognitive networking principles with efficient routing approaches and energy harvesting techniques. SPSN is used for indoor CO2 monitoring as well as for outdoor gas leak detection. The performance of the system for channel estimation at an outdoor environment is examined. Experimental results show that SPSN can be used for a plethora of other applications as well.
