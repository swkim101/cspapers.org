This paper attempts to accomplish a novel task of mining competitive information with respect to an entity (such as a company, product, person) from the web. An algorithm called "CoMiner" is proposed, which first extracts a set of comparative candidates of the input entity and then ranks them according to the comparability, and finally extracts the competitive fields. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm drafts a complete picture of competitive relation of a given entity effectively.
