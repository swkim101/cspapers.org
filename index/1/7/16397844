An approach to teaching computability theory is presented. The method used capitalizes on the students' knowledge of programming, while recognizing their orientation toward results and performance. A subset of Pascal, limited in expressive power yet free of implementation restrictions, is the principal tool. This subset is described, along with several applications and their effect in the classroom.
