Computational algorithmic thinking (CAT) is the ability to design, implement, and assess the implementation of algorithms to solve a range of problems. It involves identifying and understanding a problem, articulating an algorithm or set of algorithms in the form of a solution to the problem, implementing that solution in such a way that it solves the problem, and evaluating the solution based on some set of criteria. Supporting Computational Algorithmic Thinking (SCAT) is a research project that explores how African-American middle-school girls develop CAT capabilities over time in the context of game design. SCAT is also a free enrichment program designed to expose middle school girls to game design. Spanning three years, participants, also called SCAT Scholars, develop CAT capabilities as they design more and more complex games. This poster presents the Supporting Computational Algorithmic Thinking (SCAT) project, which is an on-going longitudinal between-subjects research project whose goals are: 1) to guide African-American middle school girls through the iterative game design cycle over three years resulting in a set of complex games around broad themes, and 2) to expose them to the broad range of opportunities that exist for them in all types of industries and areas if they develop their CAT capabilities.
