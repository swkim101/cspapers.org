We present a computationally tractable account of the interactions between sentence markers and focus marking in Somali. Somali, as a Cushitic language, has a basic pattern wherein a small 'core' clause is preceded, and in some cases followed by, a set of 'topics', which provide scene-seting information against which the core is interpreted. Some topics appear to carry a 'focus marker', indicating that they are particularly salient. We will outline a computationally tractable grammar for Somali in which focus marking emerges naturally from a consideration of the use of a range of sentence markers.
