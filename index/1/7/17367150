We present here an overview of a research project aimed at reducing information overload for individual computer users. High-precision information filtering software has been developed to disseminate onâ€“line electronic information. While the robustness and scalability of statistical approaches to information retrieval were a major influence on our design, we looked to the AI literature to supply the necessary techniques for the creation of an adaptive system. The system, called INFOrmer, is based on art intelligent agent approach and embodies machine learning, adaptation and relevance feedback techniques in its construction. A weighted graph representation is used for documents, and graph manipulation algorithms are used in the processing.
