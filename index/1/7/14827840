The aim of this article is to describe the specifications of an Information Retrieval Expert System (IRES). The resort to expert systems is a recent way which seems to be very convenient to realize performant and convivial systems. In fact the capabilities provided by classical Information Retrieval Systems (IRS) are not adequate. This inadequacy comes from some important restrictions : limited indexing vocabulary, very often designed a priori. the search terms have to belong to this vocabulary and only some simple semantical relations (as synonymy for example) can be used during the search. Consequently, if the terms used in the query are not those used for indexing we do not have a good answer. The problem is that a user does not know the indexing vocabulary so that he needs an information retrieval expert for search assistance. This expert can then formulate the query with proper terms and possibly reformulate it, This approach is, of course, very restrictive and different studies are actually undertaken (2, 6, ii) to free the user from these constraints. Cur work is also in this direction and our goals are the following : free language of interrogation, implies a syntactical analysis to recognize the important concepts of the query. Our hypothesis is that these concepts are noun proups.
