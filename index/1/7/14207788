As an essential approach to understanding human interactions, emotion classification is a vital component in the design of human-computer interaction (HCI) systems. Speech contains rich information about emotion, but the impact of noise on the classification performance is still not well studied, especially for applications used in noisy mobile environments. For an emotion classification system using support vector machine with a threshold-based fusion mechanism, we study the impact of noisy speech data on the performance of emotion classification for a standard emotion database.
