Any execution of a parallel program must satisfy the program’s control dependence3 [FOW87] and data d’rpendences [KKP*81]. Broadly speaking, the mechanisms available for satisfying dependences fall into two classes-control seqzLencing and data synchronization. In control sequencing, dependences are satisfied by using parallel or sequential control structures like fork-join, doall, cobegincoend, and even sequential begin-end. In data synchwnization, dependences are satisfied by using synchrcnization objects like binary semaphores, counting seamphores and I-structures. It is desirable for the compiler to automatically generate parallel code that correctly and efficiently satisfies all the proigram’s dependences, using whatever control sequencing and data synchronization mechanisms are available for the target architecture. In this paper, we investigate the problem of generating
