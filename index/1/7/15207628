Software-based attestation schemes aim at proving the integrity of code and data residing on a platform to a verifying party. However, they do not bind the hardware characteristics to the attestation protocol and are vulnerable to impersonation attacks. We present PUFatt, a new automatable method for linking software-based attestation to intrinsic device characteristics by means of a novel processor-based Physically Unclonable Function, which enables secure timed (and even) remote attestation particularly suitable for embedded and low-cost devices. Our proof-of-concept implementation on FPGA demonstrates the effectiveness, applicability and practicability of the approach.
