My role as interlocutor for this ACL Forum on Connectionism is to promote discussion by asking questions and making provocative comments. I will begin by asking some questions that I will attempt to answer myself, in order to define some terms. I will then pose some questions for the panel and the audience to discuss, if they are interested, and I will make a few critical comments on the abstracts submitted by Waltz and Sejnowski, intended to provoke responses from them.
