We consider dictionaries of size n over the finite universe U = {0, 1} and introduce a new technique for their implementation: error correcting codes. The use of such codes makes it possible to replace the use of strong forms of hashing, such as universal hashing, with much weaker forms, such as clustering. We use our approach to construct, for any > 0, a deterministic solution to the dynamic dictionary problem using linear space, with worst case time O(n ) for insertions and deletions, and worst case time O(1) for lookups. This is the first deterministic solution to the dynamic dictionary problem with linear space, constant query time, and non-trivial update time. In particular, we get a solution to the static dictionary problem with O(n) space, worst case query time O(1), and deterministic initialization time O(n1+ ). The best previous deterministic initialization time for such dictionaries, due to Andersson, is O(n2+ ). The model of computation for these bounds is a unit cost ∗Supported by the ESPRIT Long Term Research Programme of the EU under project number 20244 (ALCOM-IT). †Basic Research in Computer Science, Centre of the Danish National Research Foundation
