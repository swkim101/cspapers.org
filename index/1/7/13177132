The filing system for the CAP is based on the idea of preservation of capabilities: if a program has been able to obtain some capability then it has an absolute right to preserve it for subsequent use. The pursuit of this principle, using capability-oriented mechanisms in preference to access control lists, has led to a filing system in which a preserved capability may be retrieved from different directories to achieve different access statuses, in which the significance of a text name depends on the directory to which it is presented, and in which filing system 'privilege' is expressed by possession of directory capabilities.
