As the cost of both hardware and software falls due to technological advancements and economies of scale, the cost of ownership for database applications is increasingly dominated by the cost of people to manage them. Databases are growing rapidly in scale and complexity, while skilled database administrators (DBAs) are becoming rarer and more expensive. The scope of responsibility of DBAs is indeed daunting. This paper describes the self-managing technology in IBM DB2 Universal Database to illustrate how self-managing technology can enhance the usability of enterprise middleware and reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO).
