Recently, Dielectric Elastomer Actuator(DEA) comes to the market successfully by introducing commercial products such as tactile interfaces for mobile applications. As an advanced application, we present a tactile display device actuated with dielectric elastomer actuator(DEA) in this paper. By employing fluid coupling between the touch spot and the actuator, the device ensures the comfort of touch and the safety of operation from the high driving voltage while contacting with the human skin. In addition, it is compatible with SMT(Surface Mount Technology), which can be easily plugged into PCB(Printed Circuit Board)s like semiconductor chips and extend to the arrayed tactile display, easily. In this paper, its working principle is overviewed and the actual design with fabrication procedures are described in details. Finally, a prototype is made and its performance is evaluated experimentally.
