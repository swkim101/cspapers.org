We show how the problem can be formulated as a non-linear integer program and devise an AI algorithm to solve it. In particular, we introduce a new type of extreme resource constraint and develop a practically efficient propagation algorithm for it. Experiments show several orders of magnitude improvements over existing approaches, allowing us to close an existing real-world benchmark and to solve to optimality other, more challenging benchmarks.
