We prove that for any positive integer k, there is a constant c<sub>k</sub> such that a randomly selected set of c<sub>k</sub> n<sup>k</sup> log n Boolean vectors with high probability supports a balanced k-wise independent distribution. In the case of k ≤ 2 a more elaborate argument gives the stronger bound c<sub>k</sub> n<sup>k</sup>. Using a recent result by Austrin and Mossel this shows that a predicate on t bits, chosen at random among predicates accepting c<sub>2</sub> t<sup>2</sup> input vectors, is, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, likely to be approximation resistant. These results are close to tight: we show that there are other constants, c<sub>k</sub>', such that a randomly selected set of cardinality c<sub>k</sub>' n<sup>k</sup> points is unlikely to support a balanced k-wise independent distribution and, for some c>0, a random predicate accepting ct<sup>2</sup>/log t input vectors is non-trivially approximable with high probability. In a different application of the result of Austrin and Mossel we prove that, again assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, <i>any</i> predicate on t bits accepting at least (32/33) • 2<sup>t</sup> inputs is approximation resistant. The results extend from the Boolean domain to larger finite domains.
