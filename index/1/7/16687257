Production-grid users experience many system faults as well as high and variable latencies due to the scale, complexity and sharing of such infrastructures. To improve performance, they adopt different submission strategies, that are potentially aggressive for the infrastructure.
 This work studies the impact of three different strategies. It is based on a probabilistic modeling of these strategies which are evaluated according to their performance, measured as the reduction of the latency expectation, and the infrastructure overhead, measured as the additional number of submitted jobs. A strategy cost criterion is then derived.
 Experiments are performed using real workload traces collected from the EGEE production infrastructure. Under these conditions, a good balance between high performance and low overhead can be found.
