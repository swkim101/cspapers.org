This paper is concerned with utilizing regularity information of data path modules in placement and shows outstanding results. Similarity Extraction is applied first on a data path module given a set of slice numbers, a column number, and IO pin ordering followed by a three-level Force-Oriented Placement for determining relative locations of cells in the form of a cell matrix. exact pin locations, cell flipping, and row/column spacing are then estimated based on the cell placement. Experiments on cell-based designs demonstrate its performance over various generate-purpose approaches at far less CPU time on data path module designs.
