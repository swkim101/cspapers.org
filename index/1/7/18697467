We present ICARUS for intonation, an interactive tool to browse and search automatically derived descriptions of fundamental frequency contours. It offers access to tonal features in combination with other annotation layers like part-ofspeech, syntax or coreference and visualizes them in a highly customizable graphical interface with various playback functions. The built-in search allows multilevel queries, the construction of which can be done graphically or textually, and includes the ability to search F0 contours based on various similarity measures.
