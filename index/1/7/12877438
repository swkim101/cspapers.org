Nominals frequently surface without overtly expressed arguments. In order to measure the potential benefit of nominal SRL for downstream processes, such nominals must be accounted for. In this paper, we show that a state-of-the-art nominal SRL system with an overall argument F1 of 0.76 suffers a performance loss of more than 9% when nominals with implicit arguments are included in the evaluation. We then develop a system that takes implicit argumentation into account, improving overall performance by nearly 5%. Our results indicate that the degree of implicit argumentation varies widely across nominals, making automated detection of implicit argumentation an important step for nominal SRL.
