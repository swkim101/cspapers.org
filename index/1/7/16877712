We present an empirical routing delay model for estimating interconnection delays in FPGAs. We assume that the routing delay is a function of interPLC distances, circuit size, fanout of the net and routing congestion in the channel. We performed extensive simulations of various circuits to generate a sufficiently large dataset. Our method estimates delays by reading the average value tables and interpolating the values, if necessary. We present a rigorous statistical justification of this delay model. Our results show that our method predicts the delays within 20% of actual and it far outperforms all other existing techniques.
