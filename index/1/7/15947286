Nowadays embedded systems in many application areas such as automotive, medical and industrial automation are designed with well-defined hardware and software components which are not meant to be exposed for user modifications. Adding or removing components to/from such systems is not permitted and sometimes not even possible since the systems often have to be up and running in a 24/7 manner. However due to the well-known nature of these types of embedded platform configuration the effort an attacker has to invest usually is reduced. The proposed publication presents a defense in depth strategy for application specific embedded devices by combining hardware-based security enhancements of modern processors with hardware security modules.
