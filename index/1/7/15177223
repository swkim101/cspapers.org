We used eye-tracking equipment to observe 36 participants as they performed three search tasks using three graphically-enhanced web search interfaces (Kartoo, SearchMe and Viewzi). In this poster we describe findings of the study focusing on how the presentation of SERP results influences how the user scans and attends to the results, and the user satisfaction with these search engines.
