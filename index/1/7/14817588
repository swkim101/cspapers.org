The Planar Package Planner is a design aid aimed at helping to form a package layout plan, given only the information available during project initiation to digital system logic and package designers. A hierarchical approach is adopted, and a clustering program makes possible use of the layout scheme for bottom-up as well as top-down design. The layout plan for an experimental microprocessor is worked out as an example of the method.
