A large body of recent work has proposed analytical and empirical techniques for quantifying the data consistency properties of distributed data stores. In this demonstration, we begin to explore the wide range of new database functionality they enable, including dynamic query tuning, consistency SLAs, monitoring, and administration. Our demonstration will exhibit how both application programmers and database administrators can leverage these features. We describe three major application scenarios and present a system architecture for supporting them. We also describe our experience in integrating Probabilistically Bounded Staleness (PBS) predictions into Cassandra, a popular NoSQL store and sketch a demo platform that will allow SIGMOD attendees to experience the importance and applicability of real-time consistency metrics.
