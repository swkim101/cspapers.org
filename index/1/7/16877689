Developing an efficient server-based real-time scheduling solution that supports dynamic task-level parallelism is now relevant to even the desktop and embedded domains and no longer only to the high performance computing market niche. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines the constant bandwidth server abstraction with a work-stealing load balancing scheme which, while ensuring isolation among tasks, enables a task to be executed on more than one processor at a given time instant.
