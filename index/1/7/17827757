We present a system which automatically reduces the ringtone volume as soon as users start picking up their mobile devices to answer incoming phone calls. Our system uses multiple sensors already in mobile phones (e.g. accelerometer, gyroscope, and proximity sensor) to extract 47 features, and uses supported vector machine (SVM) as the classifier to identify the act of picking up a phone. We have collected data under several typical conditions: including walking vs stationary and picking up the phone from inside a bag vs pockets. Our results show that the system can correctly identify users picking up their mobile phones 95% of the time on average.
