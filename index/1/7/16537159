Mining frequent patterns from data streams has drawn increasing attention in recent years. However, previous mining algorithms were all focused on a single data stream. In many emerging applications, it is of critical importance to combine multiple data streams for analysis. For example, in real-time news topic analysis, it is necessary to combine multiple news report streams from dierent media sources to discover collaborative frequent patterns which are reported frequently in all media, and comparative frequent patterns which are reported more frequently in a media than others. To address this problem, we propose a novel frequent pattern mining algorithm Hybrid-Streaming, H-Stream for short. H-Stream builds a new Hybrid-Frequent tree to maintain historical frequent and potential frequent itemsets from all data streams, and incrementally updates these itemsets for efficient collaborative and comparative pattern mining. Theoretical and empirical studies demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.
