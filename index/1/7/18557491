A summary of mathematical results developing a theory of consistency in ambiguous labelings is presented. This theory allows the relaxation labeling algorithm, introduced in [Rosenfeld, Hummel, Zucker, 1976], to be interpreted as a method for finding consistent labelings, and allows specific applications to be tailored in accordance with intended design goals. We discuss, with a couple of examples, a design methodology for using this theory for practical applications.
