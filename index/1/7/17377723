Weakly-hard time constraints have been proposed for applications where occasional deadline misses are permitted. Recently, a new approach called Typical Worst-Case Analysis (TWCA) has been introduced which exploits similar constraints to bound response times of systems with sporadic overload. In this paper, we extend that approach for static priority preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling to determine the maximum number of deadline misses for a given deadline. The approach is based on an optimization problem which trades off higher priority interference versus miss count. We formally derive a lattice structure for the possible combinations that lays the ground for an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation. The ILP solution is evaluated showing effectiveness of the approach and far better results than previous TWCA.
