In my research I try to de.ne a framework which can beused to provide semantics for non-functional specificationsof component-based systems. Some of the key questionsdriving my work are:What is the fundamental difference between functionaland non-functional specifications? What formal apparatusis required to provide for this difference?What effects need to be taken into consideration whencomposing components with non-functional properties?What is the dependency between functional and nonfunctionalspecifications?What evaluation or analysis algorithms will be appliedto a non-functional specification? What informationmust be extractable from the semantics of a nonfunctionalspecification?
