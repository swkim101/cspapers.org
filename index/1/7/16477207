We consider the k-traveling repairman problem, a generalization of the metric traveling repairman problem, also known as the minimum latency problem, to multiple repairmen. We give an 8.497α-approximation algorithm for this generalization, where α denotes the best achievable approximation factor for the problem of finding the least cost rooted tree spanning i vertices (i-MST) problem. This can be compared with the best known approximation algorithm for the case k = 1, which is 3.59α. We are aware of no previous work on the approximability of the present problem.In addition, we give a simple proof of the 3.59αapproximation result which can be extended to the case of multiple repairmen.
