Moderator: John Cohn IBM Corp., Essex Junction, VT In the beginning, CAD tools were written by designers to reduce the tedium of jobs like cutting out photomask data from plastic film. We've come a long way since the first designer put down the Xacto knife and picked up a light pen. CAD is now a multi-billion dollar industry with its own conferences, its own heroes, and its own ideas. No one can deny that CAD innovation has been one of the prime drivers of the microelectronics revolution. Still, a common criticism today is that CAD has drifted away from its design roots. We live in a time when few CAD engineers have ever designed a chip. Should we be taking more direction from the design community... or is our job to lead them? Remember some innovations such as logic synthesis were initially met with fierce resistance from designers.
