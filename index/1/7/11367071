It is well known that after placing n balls independently and uniformly at Ž . random into n bins, the fullest bin holds Q log nrlog log n balls with high probability. More recently, Azar et al. analyzed the following process: randomly choose d bins for each ball, and then place the balls, one by one, into the least full bin from its d choices. Azar et al. They show that after all n balls have been placed, the fullest bin contains only Ž . log log nrlog dqQ 1 balls with high probability. We explore extensions of this result to parallel and distributed settings. Our results focus on the tradeoff between the amount of Correspondence to: M.
