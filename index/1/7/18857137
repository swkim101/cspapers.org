This paper presents the Integrated Designer's Activity Support System for Architecture (IDAS-A), a man-machine system experimentally developed for use by a designer/engineer in the preliminary building design area. New concepts introduced in organizing this system are those of “Status and Flow” and “Milestone”, which allow the designer to perform a full latitude of design activities. For effective storage of the building data which is designed in 2 dimensional space, the relational data base is adopted. Also, special supervisor has been developed to handle many application programs dynamically and to control the interaction between man and machine flexibly.
