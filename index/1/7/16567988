Set associative page mapping algorithms have become widespread for the operation of cache memories for reasons of cost and efficiency. In this paper we show how to calculate analytically the effectiveness of set associative paging relative to full associative (unconstrained mapping) paging. For two miss ratio models, Saltzer's linear model and a mixed geometric model, we are able to obtain simple, closed form expressions for the relative LRU fault rates. Trace driven simulations are used to verify the accuracy of our results. We suggest that as electronically accessed third level memories, such as electron beam memories, magnetic bubbles or charge coupled devices become available, algorithms currently used only for cache paging will be applied to main memory, for the same reasons of efficiency, implementation ease and cost.
