Over the past decades, numerous techniques have been developed to forecast the temporal evolution of epidemic outbreaks. This paper proposes an approach that combines high resolution agent-based models using realistic social contact networks for simulating epidemic evolution with a particle filter based method for assimilation based forecasting. Agent-based modeling using realistic social contact networks provides two key advantages: (i) they capture the causal processes underlying the epidemic and hence are useful to understand the role of interventions on the course of the epidemics – typically time series models cannot capture this and as a result often do not perform well in such situations; (ii) they provide detailed forecast information – this allows us to produce forecast at high levels of temporal, spatial and social granularity. We also propose a new variation of particle filter technique called beam search particle filtering. The modification allows us to more efficiently search the parameter space which is necessitated by the fact that agent-based techniques are computationally expensive. We illustrate our methodology on the synthetic dataset of Ebola provided as a part of the NSF/NIH Ebola forecasting challenge. Our results show the efficacy of the proposed approach and suggest that agent-based causal models can be combined with filtering techniques to yield a new class of assimilation models for infectious disease forecasting.
