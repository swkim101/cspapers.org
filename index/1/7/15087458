Disjunctive constraints are widely used to en­ sure that the time intervals over which two ac­ tivities require the same resource cannot over­ lap: if a resource is required by two activities A and B, the disjunctive constraint states that ei­ ther A precedes B or B precedes A. The "prop­ agation" of disjunctive constraints consists in determining cases where only one of the two orderings is feasible. It results in updating the time-bounds of the two activities. The stan­ dard algorithm for propagating disjunctive con­ straints achieves arc-B-consistency. Two types of methods that provide more precise time-bounds are studied and compared. The first type of method consists in determining whether an activity A must, can, or cannot be the first or the last to execute among a set of activi­ ties that require the same resource. The second consists in comparing the amount of "resource energy" required over a time interval [t 1 t 2) to the amount of energy that is available over the same interval. The main result of the study is an implementation of the first method in ILOG SCHEDULE, a generic tool for constraint-based scheduling which exhibits performance in the same range of efficiency as specific operations research algorithms. 1 Introduction Disjunctive constraints are widely used to ensure that the time intervals over which two activities require the same resource do not overlap in time If a resource is required by two activities A and B, the disjunctive constraint states that either A precedes B (i.e., ends before B starts) or B precedes A. The "prop­ agation" of disjunctive constraints consists in determin­ ing that only one of the two orderings is feasible. It results in updating the time-bounds (earliest start times and latest end times) of the two activities.
