Role playing exercises are one of many teaching techniques commonly employed to drive home lessons about computer science. Most of the specific role playing described in the literature, however, relates to algorithm or hardware design. More recently, the Pedagogical Patterns Project has published patterns involving role playing in a general sense. In this paper, we draw on three separate role playing exercises that we have developed to show that scripted role playing is a natural and effective way to introduce concepts of object-oriented design.
