Need to develop human body's posture supervised robots, gave the push to researchers to think over dexterous design of exoskeleton robots. It requires to develop quantitative techniques to assess motor function and generate the command for the robots to act accordingly with complex human structure. In this paper, we present a new technique for the upper limb power exoskeleton robot in which load is gripped by the human subject and not by the robot while the robot assists. Main challenge is to find non-biological signal based human desired motion intention to assist as needed. For this purpose, we used newly developed Muscle Circumference Sensor (MCS) instead of electromyogram (EMG) sensors. MCS together with the force sensors is used to estimate the human interactive force from which desired human motion is extracted using adaptive Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). Developed Upper limb power exoskeleton has seven degrees of freedom (DOF) in which five DOF are passive while two are active. Active joints include shoulder and elbow in Sagittal plane while abduction and adduction motion in shoulder joint is provided by the passive joints. To ensure high quality performance model reference based adaptive impedance controller is employed. Exoskeleton performance is evaluated experimentally by a neurologically intact subject which validates the effectiveness.
