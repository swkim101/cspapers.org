Peer-to-peer e-commerce networks exemplify online lemon markets. Trust is key to sustaining these networks. We present a reputation system named RepRank that approaches trust with an intuition that in the peer-to-peer e-commerce world consisting of buyers and sellers, good buyers are those who buy from good sellers, and good sellers are those from whom good buyers buy. We propagate trust and distrust in a network using this mutually recursive definition. We discuss the algorithms and present the evaluation results.
