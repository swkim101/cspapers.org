A micro-processor based Interface Unit and Teacher Utility have been developed at the Hugh MacMillan Medical Centre that will facilitate physically disabled users' access to the Icon educational microcomputer. The Interface Unit allows a variety of alternate input devices to be used with the Icon computer. Evaluations of the use of the Icon by physically disabled students without and with the Interface Unit were completed. The Teacher Utility offers on-line instruction and support for teachers with physically disabled students who have problems accessing the Icon. The design of the Teacher Utility is presented from three perspectives: the teacher, the physically disabled student, and the developers.
