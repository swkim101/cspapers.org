As Unified Modeling Language (UML) provides most of the concepts and notations that are essential for documenting object-oriented models, it has been widely accepted in the software engineering area. However, UML does not have an explicit format for exchanging its models intentionally. The ability to exchange the models is quite important, because it is likely that a development team resides in separate places on the network environment, and because most current development tools donâ€™t provide the interconnectivity of the model information. This paper addresses this problem and proposes UXF (UML eXchange Format), which is an exchange format for UML models, based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). It is a format powerful enough to express, publish, access and exchange UML models and a natural extension from the existing Internet environment. It serves as a communication vehicle for developers, and as a well-structured data format for development tools. UXF shows an important step in sharing and exchanging the model information, and indicates a future direction of the interconnectivity between UML compliant tools.
