In this paper we present a perception assistant system named BlueView. Aim of the system is to assist visually impaired people in improving their perception of points of interest (POIs) in the nearby surrounding. The system allows users to perceive POIs, and accurately locate them with an audio prompting approach. BlueView contains two components: Viewer device and Beacon point. Viewer device is a Bluetooth-enabled mobile phone. Beacon point is a Bluetooth tag with a speaker. Using a within-subject design, six participants (i.e. blind people) were involved in the experiment with the system. Preliminary results suggest that BlueView effectively assist users in perceiving and locating POIs in both single and multi user scenarios.
