There have been significant advances in Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) in recent years. One of the major remaining reasons that CLIR does not perform as well as monolingual retrieval is the presence of out of vocabulary (OOV) terms. Previous work has either relied on manual intervention or has only been partially successful in solving this problem. We use a method that extends earlier work in this area by augmenting this with statistical analysis, and corpus-based translation disambiguation to dynamically discover translations of OOV terms. The method can be applied to both Chinese-English and English-Chinese CLIR, correctly extracting translations of OOV terms from the Web automatically, and thus is a significant improvement on earlier work.
