In order to fuse camera and odometer measurements, we first need to estimate their relative transformation through the so-called odometer-camera extrinsic calibration. In this paper, we present a two-step analytical least-squares solution for the extrinsic odometer-camera calibration that (i) is not iterative and finds the least-squares optimal solution without any initialization, and (ii) does not require any special hardware or the presence of known landmarks in the scene. Specifically, in the first step, we estimate a subset of the 3D relative rotation parameters by analytically minimizing a least-squares cost function. We then back-substitute these estimates in the measurement constraints, and determine the rest of the 3D transformation parameters by analytically minimizing a second least-squares cost function. Simulation and experimental results are presented that validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.
