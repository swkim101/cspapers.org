The initial results of the iterative Arnoldi-Tchebychev procedure for the eigensolutions of large scale nonsymmetric matrices are discussed. The procedure uses an accurate algorithm for the identification of the optimal Tchebychev ellipse relative to a complex reference eigenvalue in a complex eigenspectrum. The analysis of the procedure shows that the algorithm is vector intensive. Test run affirms that more than 80% of the sampling time involves matrix and vector operations. The procedure can be easily vectorized to take advantage of the storage hierarchy structure of the IBM 3090 System and its Vector Facility.
