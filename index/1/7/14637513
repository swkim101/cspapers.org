This paper describes the STAMPS software workbench that supports Honours level computer architecture teaching. STAMPS was developed in response to a need perceived from experience of such teaching. It is a hierarchically structured CPU simulator that can be customised to any architecture and implementation of that architecture.STAMPS is written as a Tcl/wish application. Tcl facilitates interaction with the file system, simple naming conventions and highly flexible user interaction. STAMPS runs on any Unix platform.
