Hypermedia API design is a method of creating APIs using hyperlinks to represent and publish an API's functionality. Hypermedia-based APIs bring theoretical advantages over many other designs, including the possibility of self-updating, generic API client software. Such hypermedia API clients only lately have come to exist, and the existing hypermedia client space did not compare favorably to custom API client libraries, requiring somewhat tedious manual access to HTTP resources. Nonetheless, the limitations in creating a compelling hypermedia client were few. This paper describes the design and implementation of HyperResource, a fully generic, production-ready Ruby client library for hypermedia APIs. The project leverages the inherent practicality of hypermedia design, demonstrates its immediate usefulness in creating self-generating API clients, enumerates several abstractions and strategies that help in creating hypermedia APIs and clients, and promotes hypermedia API design as the easiest option available to an API programmer.
