We extend the relational model of data to allow classes as attribute values, thereby permitting the representation of hierarchies of objects. Inheritance, including multiple inheritance with exceptions, is clearly supported. Facts regarding classes of objects can be stored and manipulated in the same way as facts regarding object instances. Our model is upwards compatible with the standard relational model.
