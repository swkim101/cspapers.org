We introduce a particle filter-based approach to representing and actively reducing uncertainty over articulated motion models. The presented method provides a probabilistic model that integrates visual observations with feedback from manipulation actions to best characterize a distribution of possible articulation models. We evaluate several action selection methods to efficiently reduce the uncertainty about the articulation model. The full system is experimentally evaluated using a PR2 mobile manipulator. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed system allows for intelligent reasoning about sparse, noisy data in a number of common manipulation scenarios.
