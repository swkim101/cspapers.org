This study proposes on the development concerning a best treatment interface of motion trajectory as a conceptual construct to understand the spatial sense for children with learning disabilities. 20 children with learning disabilities participated in the study. They are studied in the resource class. There are two factors in the study, one is “reference object” and the other is “reference landmark”. Each factor has two levels, using “ maze ” as a spatial sense conceptual tool. The maze is constructed by 3d models as virtual environment to design 4 different treatments. In this study, the focus is to find the level of factor to reduce the cognition load. In the result, the factor of reference object is significant, with reference object is better than without reference object in the maze, but the factor of reference landmark is not significant.
