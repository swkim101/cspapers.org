How to modelthe dependence and independence between differentbehaviors is critical for them. In this paper, we proposea novel recommendation model, the Group-Sparse MatrixFactorization (GSMF), which factorizes the ratingmatrices for multiple behaviors into the user and itemlatent factor space with group sparsity regularization.It can (1) select out the different subsets of latent factorsfor different behaviors, addressing that users’ decisionson different behaviors are determined by differentsets of factors;(2) model the dependence and independencebetween behaviors by learning the sharedand private factors for multiple behaviors automatically; (3) allow the shared factors between different behaviorsto be different, instead of all the behaviors sharingthe same set of factors. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that our model can integrate users’multiple types of behaviors into recommendation better,compared with other state-of-the-arts.
