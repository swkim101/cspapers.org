This paper proposes a novel type of rescue robot which is aimed to open narrow spaces, move under heavy debris, and search and save out survivors at disastrous site. Unlike most of the conventional mobile robots to move through opened spaces, the proposed robot has the ability of cultivating spaces by its own so as to be able to pass through. The key of the robot is the step structure on its head which enables it to open 10 mm gap up to 250 mm gradually under 600 kg load by oil hydraulic power, synchronizing with the mobile behavior to go forward. Such kind of mobile method with jack-up function can be realized by switching two modes alternately discussed in this paper. The validity of the proposed design and behavior is experimentally verified by the developed model named Bari-bari-II.
