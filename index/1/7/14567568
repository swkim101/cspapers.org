Traditionally, a form is either a paper document or an electronic object. It is used to describe, to structure and to facilitate the information flow inside an organization, or at the user interface level. From this well known concept, we propose an advanced form model. This model integrates three main areas of current database research: (1) Multimedia aspects, (2) Structural aspects related to the non first normal form models and (3) Dynamic aspects related to the Object Oriented approach. The form paradigm that we propose offers a formal and homogeneous approach for describing and manipulating structural, dynamic and interface aspects of new database applications (Office Automation, Medical, CAD,. ..). This approach provides a better control over object integrity and allows for the integration of various database objects: flat relations, multimedia documents and other forms. A formal definition of our model has been done and a prototype is currently under implementation on a workstation using a relational DBMS as a basic data manager.
