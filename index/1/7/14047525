Recent years have witnessed an increasing threat from kernel rootkits. A common feature of such attack is hiding malicious objects to conceal their presence, including processes, sockets, and kernel modules. Scanning memory with object signatures to detect the stealthy rootkit has been proven to be a powerful approach only when it is hard for adversaries to evade. However, it is difficult, if not impossible, to select fields from a single data structure as robust signatures with traditional techniques. In this paper, we propose the concepts of inter-structure signature and imported signature, and present techniques to detect stealthy malware based on these concepts. The key idea is to use cross-reference relationships of multiple data structures as signatures to detect stealthy malware, and to import some extra information into regions attached to target data structures as signatures. We have inferred four invariants as signatures to detect hidden processes, sockets, and kernel modules in Linux respectively and implemented a prototype detection system called DeepScanner. Meanwhile, we have also developed a hypervisor-based monitor to protect imported signatures. Our experimental result shows that our DeepScanner can effectively and efficiently detect stealthy objects hidden by seven real-world rootkits without any false positives and false negatives, and an adversary can hardly evade DeepScanner if he/she does not break the normal functions of target objects and the system.
