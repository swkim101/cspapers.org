Understanding the dynamics of the interdomain routing system is challenging. One reason is that a single routing or policy change can have far reaching and complex effects. Connecting observed behavior with its underlying causes is made even more difficult by the amount of noise in the BGP system. In this paper we address these challenges by presenting PathMiner, a system to extract large scale routing events from background noise and identify the AS or link responsible for the event. PathMiner is distinguished from previous work in its ability to identify and analyze large-scale events that may re-occur many times over long timescales. The central idea behind PathMiner is that although a routing change at one AS may induce large-scale, complex responses in other ASes, the correlation among those responses (in space and time) helps to isolate the relevant set of responses from background noise, and makes the cause much easier to identify. Hence, PathMiner has two components: an algorithm for mining large scale coordinated changes from routing tables, and an algorithm for identifying the network element (AS or link) responsible for the set of coordinated changes. We describe the implementation and validation of PathMiner. We show that it is scalable, being able to extract significant events from multiple years of routing data at a daily granularity. Finally, using PathMiner we study interdomain routing over past 9 years and use it to characterize the presence of large scale routing events and to identify the responsible network elements.
