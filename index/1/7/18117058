We attached a small LCD display and video camera to a surgical drill. The LCD shows the tool position with respect to a planned trajectory, overlaid on video captured by the camera. We performed a user study to determine whether such a tool-mounted guidance display yields faster and more accurate tool placement than the conventional guidance display on a separate computer monitor. Our study showed that the tool-mounted display provides better positional and angular accuracy than the conventional display but that the video camera provides no significant improvement in error.
