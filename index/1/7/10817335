State of the art web search systems enable aggregation of information from many sources. Users are challenged to assess the reliability of information from different sources. We report on an empirical user study on the effect of displaying credibility ratings of multiple cultural heritage sources (e.g. museum websites, art blogs) on users' search performance and selection. The results of our online interactive study (N=122) show that when explicitly presenting these ratings, people become significantly more confident in their selection of information from aggregated results.
