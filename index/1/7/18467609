Program debugging is one of the crucial activities within this process. Modern ASP debugging approaches allow efficient computation of possible explanations of a fault. However, even for a small program a debugger might return a large number of possible explanations and selection of the correct one must be done manually. In this paper we present an interactive query-based ASP debugging method which extends previous approaches and finds the preferred explanation by means of observations. The system automatically generates a sequence of queries to a programmer asking whether a set of ground atoms must be true in all (cautiously) or some (bravely) answer sets of the program. Since some queries can be more informative than the others, we discuss query selection strategies which - given user's preferences for an explanation - can find the most informative query reducing the overall number of queries required for the identification of a preferred explanation.
