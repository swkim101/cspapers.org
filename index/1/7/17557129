We propose a method by which a micro air vehicle (MAV) can hover without propulsion power. In this paper, we describe the design of a magnetic adhesion mechanism and a winch mechanism for an MAV that is used to perform search operations inside buildings. An MAV equipped with these mechanisms can adhere to an iron ceiling and search for a long time from an appropriate position. We designed a magnetic adhesion mechanism with an adhesion force of over 20 N. The magnetic adhesion mechanism comprises a magnet, dual coil springs, and a switching mechanism. Using models of MAV and the adhesion mechanism, we determined the parameters of the mechanism. The magnetic adhesion mechanism can be detached easily by a force less than the magnetic adhesion force. The winch mechanism comprises a structure to retrieve the adhesion mechanism, a strong, lightweight tether and a servo-motor that produces enough torque to lift the MAV by the tether. We confirmed that the MAV can hover without propulsion power by using these mechanisms.
