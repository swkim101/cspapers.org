Algorithms for Cache Sharing Daniel Greene * Arvind Raghunathan t A single physical computer memory may be used for more than one type of page, with the amount of memory devoted to each type under software control. For example, the effective size of memory can be increased by storing some pages in compressed form and decompressing on demand. This introduces another level to the memory hierarchy, and the sizes of two adjacent levels may be varied dynamically. We present an algorithm for varying the mixture of pages in a two-type cache, and then analyze the “competitiveness” of our algorithm. We also report progress in partially automating the design and analysis of on-line algorithms.
