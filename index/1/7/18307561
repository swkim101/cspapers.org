In this paper, an optimization method for designing MR clutches is studied. The proposed method optimizes the geometrical dimensions of an MR clutch, hence its mass, for given output torque and electrical input power. The main idea behind this optimization is that the input power and output torque are two parameters that are normally known to the designer prior to the design of an MR clutch and considering these parameters in the optimization as fixed values has a practical significance. Having presented the optimization method, we compare the characteristics of three different MR clutch configurations in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. A comparison between the drum, single-disk and multi-disk configurations of MR clutches is performed. Using the proposed method one can select a suitable configuration as well as the geometrical dimensions for an MR clutch that best suits the requirements of each individual design.
