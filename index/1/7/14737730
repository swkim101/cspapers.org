In this paper, we discuss the representation of pronouns in logical form for the purpose of handling verb phrase ellipsis. In particular, we discuss two factors which influence the representation of pronouns in a computational model. The first is computational, the other linguistic. Both factors must be attended to in order to construct a good representation for pronouns in logical form. We review past attempts to represent pronouns in logical form for the purpose of handling verb phrase ellipsis, and show how these approaches do not meet the computational constraints outlined in this paper. We also show that they do not handle a rather simple example of verb phrase ellipsis. We develop a representation for pronouns in logical form which both meets the computational criteria outlined in this paper and handles the verb phrase ellipsis example.
