This paper illustrates the analysis of locomotion in the gastrointestinal tract obtainable by a legged capsule for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. A preliminary simulation of the legged locomotion onto slippery and deformable substrates has been performed and -simultaneously - mechanisms for on board actuation of the legs have been developed and tested. Moreover, an engineering translation of medical needs in endoscopy is presented, with some ad hoc solutions for improving diagnostic capabilities.
