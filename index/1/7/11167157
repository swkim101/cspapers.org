In this paper, we have studied some important statistical properties of error sequences of M-ary orthogonal frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation schemes over Nakagami-m fading channels. We have derived the joint probability density function (PDF) of error sequences of arbitrary length. From the joint PDF, we have found an analytical solution for the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the error sequences. The correctness of the analytical expression for the ACF of error sequences has been confirmed by simulations, where the simulation results are obtained by using the sum-of-sinusoids principle. The derived joint PDF of error sequences is useful for the development of first-order and higher-order Markov models for burst channels.
