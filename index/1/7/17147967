In this paper, we present the first attempt to analyse differing levels of social involvement in free standing conversing groups (or the so-called F-formations) from static images. In addition, we enrich state-of-the-art F-formation modelling by learning a frustum of attention that accounts for the spatial context. That is, F-formation configurations vary with respect to the arrangement of furniture and the non-uniform crowdedness in the space during mingling scenarios. The majority of prior works have considered the labelling of conversing group as an objective task, requiring only a single annotator. However, we show that by embracing the subjectivity of social involvement, we not only generate a richer model of the social interactions in a scene but also significantly improve F-formation detection. We carry out extensive experimental validation of our proposed approach by collecting a novel set of multi-annotator labels of involvement on the publicly available Idiap Poster Data, the only multi-annotator labelled database of free standing conversing groups that is currently available.
