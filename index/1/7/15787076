Nowadays, since each sensor network is managed within a single organization, sensor data cannot be obtained externally. When these sensor networks are virtualized that means everyone is able to obtain data anywhere without minding which sensor network the data belongs, two features will be required. One of these is geographical range query. This research realizes it using Z-order in the same way with related works [1][2][3][4]. The other requirement is distributed sensor data management. Current systems adapt the way that stores the data in a (or some) centralized server(s), or that stores the data in many servers, having one centralized server to store indexes of the address of the data. This research proposes a method not relating real space geographical information and relative position of peer in ID space. By using this method, in the place where density of people and smart phones with many sensors increase suddenly such as Super Bowl and new year countdown in NY, by using DHT, sensor data don't concentrate on a specified peer on managing the data. This research simulates and evaluates this method.
