We present a new compositional tense-aspect deindexing mechanism that makes use of tense trees as components of discourse contexts. The mechanism allows reference episodes to be correctly identified even for embedded clauses and for discourse that involves shifts in temporal perspective, and permits deindexed logical forms to be automatically computed with a small number of deindexing rules.
