K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (K-NNG) construction is a primitive operation in the field of Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems. However, existing approaches to K-NNG construction do not perform well as the number of nodes or dimensions scales up. In this paper, we present greedy filtering, an effcient and scalable algorithm for selecting the candidates for nearest neighbors by matching only the dimensions of large values. The experimental results show that our K-NNG construction scheme, based on greedy filtering, guarantees a high recall while also being 5 to 6 times faster than state-of-the-art algorithms for large, high-dimensional data.
