This paper presents the experience of the Software Development Laboratory of Raytheon Company, Submarine Signal Division, in applying modern software management control techniques to the development of software for real-time embedded computer systems. The paper initially describes the characteristics of the software projects during the period 1969-1979, and the ultimate use of the systems. The software is developed for embedded computers of many types and for systems requiring from one to eleven racks of electronics, and it is programmed in many languages. The systems are installed in submarines, surface ships, aircraft, shore-based facilities and weapons. The paper then summarizes development methodologies and follows with a detailed description of the software management and control techniques, which include: manpower forecasting; tailored status reports for financial, module, and cost-milestone-schedule; cost estimating; support librarian and configuration management; policies and procedures; training; and staffing and organization.
