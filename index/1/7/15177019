Computing the set of optimal solutions for a multiobjective constraint optimisation problem can be computationally very challenging. Also, when solutions are only partially ordered, there can be a number of different natural notions of optimality, one of the most important being the notion of Possibly Optimal, i.e., optimal in at least one scenario compatible with the inter-objective tradeoffs. We develop an AND/OR Branch-and-Bound algorithm for computing the set of Possibly Optimal solutions, and compare variants of the algorithm experimentally.
