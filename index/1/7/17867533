This video provides a preliminary report of the use of a rescue robot from Aug. 24, to Sept. 2, 2007, at the Crandall Canyon, Utah, mine disaster. The customized Inuktun teleoperated robot was able to traverse over 1,400 feet through an 8 7/8" uncased borehole drilled, enter the mine and travel approximately 7 feet. The robot showed that the walls had deteriorated, indicating that a major collapse had occurred. The large debris combined with dense mud created unfavorable navigational conditions for the robot. The robot was lost on the ascent, approximately 52 feet from the surface, due to eroding borehole conditions. The video identifies open research questions.
