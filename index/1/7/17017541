Distributed toolkits like Isis provide means of replicating data but not means for making it persistent. This makes the use of transactions desirable, even in non-database applications. Using Isis can alleviate the programming cost of distributed transaction processing the multi-phase commit protocols. Using the Isis transaction tool, however, imposes additional cost, and we examine the effect of group formation strategies on the overhead. The paper presents three different group formation mechanisms in Isis and compares the costs associated with them.
