The most common method for handling transmission errors in computer networks is through the detection of errors and retransmission of the erroneous messages. This strategy has been called Automatic Repeat Repvest (ARQ). Various protocols have been established to achieve maximum possible utilization of avilable bandwidth in the most efficient manner possible. Previous works on ARQ schemes were done by Sastry [l], Towsley [2], Yu and Lin [3] [4], Weldon [5], and Miller and Lin [6]. Yu and Lin [4] present a Selective Repeat ARQ scheme that assumes a limited receiver buffer size which makes the scheme a practical one to implement. Reference [4] also presents a lower bound on the throughput efficiency of this scheme. Here, the receiver bufl’er size has been considered to be N, where N is the numher of packets that can be sent in one round trip delay period. In [5], Weldon presents an improved Selective Repeat ARQ strategy that is more efficient than Yu and Lii’s scheme. The point-to-point
