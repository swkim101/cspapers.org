Spanner of an undirected graph <i>G</i> = <i>(V, E)</i> is a sub graph which is sparse and yet preserves all-pairs distances approximately. More precisely, a spanner with <i>stretch t</i> ∈ IN is a subgraph <i>(V, E<sub>S</sub>), E<sub>S</sub></i> ⊆ <i>E</i> such that the distance between any two vertices in the subgraph is at most <i>t</i> times their distance in <i>G</i>. We present two fully dynamic algorithms for maintaining a sparse <i>t</i>-spanner of an unweighted graph. Our first algorithm achieves expected <i>O</i>(7 t/4) time per update independent of the size of the graph. This algorithm is particularly of interest for maintaining small stretch spanners. Our second algorithm achieves expected <i>O</i>(polylog |<i>V</i>|) time per update irrespective of the stretch.
