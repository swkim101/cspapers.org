Paid Search (PS) ads are one of the main revenue sources of online advertising companies where the goal is returning a set of relevant ads for a searched query in search engine websites such as Bing. Typical PS algorithms, return the ads which their Bided Keywords (BKs) are a subset of searched queries or relevant to them. However, there is a huge gap between BKs and searched queries as a considerable amount of BKs are rarely searched by the users. This is mostly due to the rare BKs provided by advertisers. In this paper, we propose an approach to rewrite the rare BKs to more commonly searched keywords, without compromising the original BKs intent, which increases the coverage and depth of PS ads and thus it delivers higher monetization power. In general, we first find the relevant web documents pertaining to the BKs and then extract common keywords using the web doc title and its summary snippets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of proposed algorithm in rewriting rare BKs and consequently providing us with a significant improvement in recall and thereby revenue.
