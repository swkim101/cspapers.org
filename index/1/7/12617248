Exploiting interaction with the environment is a promising and powerful way to enhance stability of humanoid robots and robustness while executing locomotion and manipulation tasks. Recently some works have started to show advances in this direction considering humanoid locomotion with multi-contacts, but to be able to fully develop such abilities in a more autonomous way, we need to first understand and classify the variety of possible poses a humanoid robot can achieve to balance. To this end, we propose the adaptation of a successful idea widely used in the field of robot grasping to the field of humanoid balance with multi-contacts: a whole-body pose taxonomy classifying the set of whole-body robot configurations that use the environment to enhance stability. We have revised criteria of classification used to develop grasping taxonomies, focusing on structuring and simplifying the large number of possible poses the human body can adopt. We propose a taxonomy with 46 poses, containing three main categories, considering number and type of supports as well as possible transitions between poses. The taxonomy induces a classification of motion primitives based on the pose used for support, and a set of rules to store and generate new motions. We present preliminary results that apply known segmentation techniques to motion data from the KIT whole-body motion database. Using motion capture data with multi-contacts, we can identify support poses providing a segmentation that can distinguish between locomotion and manipulation parts of an action.
