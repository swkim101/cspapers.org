In this paper we describe and analyze a three week assignment that was given in a Machine Learning course at Columbia University. The assignment presented students with an introduction to machine learning research. The assignment required students to apply Genetic Programming to evolve algorithms that play the board game Othello. The students were provided with an implemented experimental approach as a starting point. The students were required to perform their own experimental modifications corresponding to research issues in machine learning. The results of student experiments were good both in terms of research and in terms of student learning.
