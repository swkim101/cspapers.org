We address a spatial conservation planning problem in which the planner purchases a budget-constrained set of land parcels in order to maximize the expected spread of a population of an endangered species. Existing techniques based on the sample average approximation scheme and standard integer programming methods have high complexity and limited scalability. We propose a fast combinatorial optimization algorithm using Lagrangian relaxation and primal-dual techniques to solve the problem approximately. The algorithm provides a new way to address a range of conservation planning and scheduling problems. On the Red-cockaded Woodpecker data, our algorithm produces near optimal solutions and runs significantly faster than a standard mixed integer program solver. Compared with a greedy baseline, the solution quality is comparable or better, but our algorithm is 10-30 times faster. On synthetic problems that do not exhibit submodularity, our algorithm significantly outperforms the greedy baseline.
