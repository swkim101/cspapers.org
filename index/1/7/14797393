We demonstrate a data-driven approach for representing, compressing, and indexing human-motion databases. Our modeling approach is based on piecewise-linear components that are determined via a divisive clustering method. Selection of the appropriate linear model is determined automatically via a classifier using a subspace of the most significant, or principle features (markers). We show that, after offline training, our model can accurately estimate and classify human motions. We can also construct indexing structures for motion sequences according to their transition trajectories through these linear components. Our method not only provides indices for whole and/or partial motion sequences, but also serves as a compressed representation for the entire motion database. Our method also tends to be immune to temporal variations, and thus avoids the expense of time-warping.
