A method is proposed for automatic diagnosis of a dynamic system. It basically uses only the knowledge on system description and does not require any knowledge concerning failure causality. The diagnosis consists of the four steps: expectation value computation, suspects computation, suspects discrimination using observable data and suspects discrimination by test generation. Linear input resolution is used with explicit meta-level control. This method can diagnose in principle all kinds of failures that are logically diagnosable if the system description is appropriate. The capability of the method is demonstrated by an application example of a nuclear reactor feed-water system.
