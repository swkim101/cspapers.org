A prototype of a temporal database management system was built by extending Ingres. It supports the temporal query language TQuel, a superset of Quel, handling four types of database static, rollback, historical and temporal. A benchmark set of queries was run to study the performance of the prototype on the four types of databases. We analyze the results of the benchmark, and identify major factors that have the greatest impact on the performance of the system. We also discuss several mechanisms to address the performance bottlenecks we encountered.
