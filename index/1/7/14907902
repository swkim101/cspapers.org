We have been engaged in work about the propagation of temporal constraints in the domain of job-shop scheduling. Many systems have been or are currently used to propagate temporal constraints. However, very few attempts have been made to build systems in which the amount of computational effort spent in constraint propagation is not fixed once for all. We do believe various pieces of knowledge can be used to dynamically adjust the amount of propagation. Consequently, we advocate the use of a flexible propagation system. We describe such a system and discuss control knowledge enabling dynamic adaptation of the amount of propagation to the needs of a problem solver. We also provide examples in the domain of job-shop scheduling.
