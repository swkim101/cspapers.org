Many URLs on the Internet point to identical contents, which increase the burden of web crawlers. Techniques that detect such URLs (known as URL de-duping) can greatly save resources such as bandwidth and storage for crawlers. Traditional de-duping methods are usually limited to heavily engineered rule matching strategies.In this work, we propose a novel URL de-duping framework based on sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) neural networks. A single concise translation model can take the place of thousands of explicit rules. Experiments indicate that a vanilla Seq2Seq architecture yields robust and accurate results in detecting duplicate URLs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency of this framework in the real large-scale web environment.
