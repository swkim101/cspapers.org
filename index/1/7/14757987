This work presents a 10 kg tensegrity ball probe that can quickly and precisely deliver a 1 kg payload over a 1 km distance on the Moon by combining cable-driven rolling and thruster-based hopping. Previous research has shown that cable-driven rolling is effective for precise positioning, even in rough terrain. However, traveling large distances using thruster-based hopping, which is made feasible by the lightweight and compliant nature of the tensegrity structure, has not been explored. To evaluate the feasibility of a thruster-based tensegrity robot, a centrally-positioned cold gas thruster with nitrogen propellant was selected, and the system was simulated using the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit (NTRT) for four hopping profiles on hilly terrains. Optimizing energy efficiency and mechanical capabilities of the tensegrity robot, hopping profiles with a long flight distance per hop, followed by the higher accuracy rolling, are recommended. Simulations also show that thrust regulation can improve energy efficiency. Regulation of thrust magnitude can be achieved using a pressure regulator, but regulation of thrust orientation calls for additional control effort. In this paper, it is demonstrated that gimbal systems as well as shape-shifting control of the tensegrity structure have the potential to regulate thrust orientation. Finally, algorithms for localization and path planning that combine hopping and rolling for energy-efficient navigation are presented.
