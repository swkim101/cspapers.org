Swoogle is an implemented system that discovers, analyzes and indexes knowledge encoded in semantic web documents on the Web. Swoogle reasons about these documents and their constituent parts (e.g., terms and triples) and records meaningful metadata about them. Swoogle provides webscale semantic web data access service, which helps human users and software systems to find relevant documents, terms and triples, via its search and navigation services. Swoogle also provides a customizable algorithm inspired by Google's PageRank algorithm but adapted to the semantics and use patterns found in semantic web documents.
