In multirobot exploration under centralized control, communication plays an important role in constraining the team exploration strategy. Recurrent connectivity is a way to define communication constraints for which robots must connect to a base station only when making new observations. This paper studies effective multirobot exploration strategies under recurrent connectivity by considering a centralized and asynchronous planning framework. We formalize the problem of selecting the optimal set of locations robots should reach, provide an exact formulation to solve it, and devise an approximation algorithm to obtain efficient solutions with a bounded loss of optimality. Experiments in simulation and on real robots evaluate our approach in a number of settings.
