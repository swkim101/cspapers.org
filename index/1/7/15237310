This paper proposes a system called "RerankEverything", which enables users to rerank search results in any search service, such as a Web search engine, an e-commerce site, a hotel reservation site, and so on. This system helps users explore diverse search results. In conventional search services, interactions between users and systems are quite limited and complicated. By using RerankEverything, users can interactively explore search results in accordance with their interests by reranking search results from various viewpoints. Experimental results show that our system potentially help users search more proactively. When using our system, users were more likely to click search results that were initially low ranked. Users also browsed through more diverse search results by reranking search results after giving various types of feedback with our system.
