This research deals with the methodology of integrating a data base management system (DBMS) into a distributed network system. The focus of concern is upon the interfaces and communications among a DBMS, an operating system with associated network interface features, and other such components at distributed nodes. The environment of a generalized data base management system is extended to a distributed generalized data base management system. The definition of this system by the authors allows the DBMS, schema, subschema, and application program to be distributed individually throughout nodes in the network and for the data base itself to be distributed.
 A network interface is defined consisting of a command interpreter and a command handler to effect and coordinate the communication of the units of the system (e.g., applications program with schema, etc.). The message transmission is studied for the various topological distributions, and for a restricted set of these topologies a selection algorithm is developed with considers simple priorities and estimated costs.
 The distribution of a generalized data base management system with the flexibility of locating the schema, subschema, application programs and data appears technically possible, and for some topologies and environments, economically feasible. Further study is indicated.
