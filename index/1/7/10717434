The inherent dynamism of JavaScript (e.g., runtime code generation, prototyping, and function variadicity) renders static analyses inadequate. To address this shortcoming, we analyze JavaScript programs by means of blended analysis, a technique combining dynamic and static analyses. Our empirical findings indicate that blended analysis can effectively analyze realistic JavaScript applications.
