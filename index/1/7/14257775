Analytical results describing the optimal trajectories for general classes of robot systems have proven elusive, in part because the optimal trajectories for a complex system may not exist, or may be computed only numerically from differential equations. This paper studies a simpler optimization problem: finding an optimal sequence and optimal durations of motion primitives (simple preprogrammed actions) to reach a goal. By adding a fixed cost for each switch between primitives, we ensure that optimal trajectories exist and are well-behaved. To demonstrate this approach, we prove some general results that geometrically characterize time-optimal trajectories for rigid bodies in the plane with costly switches (allowing comparison with previous analysis of optimal motion using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle), and also present a complete analytical solution for a problem of moving a heavy park bench by rotating the bench around each end point in sequence.
