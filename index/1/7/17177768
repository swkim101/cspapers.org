This demo presents a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) service platform running on an OpenStack cloud environment. Access to this platform is secured with authentication based on 3GPP standardized Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA). The M2M network in this testbed consists of Raspberry Pi gateways and resource-constrained devices such as Arduinos. These devices have associated sensors, that report physical data such as temperature, and actuators such as LEDs, that respond to actuation commands. In this demo, the sensor data is authenticated and integrity protected end-to-end with public-key elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA). Lastly, the demo testbed includes a web-based cloud management interface referred to as the "IoT Portal". This portal allows a system administrator to specify pre-configured Virtual Machine (VM) images with custom applications. As an example, a M2M Web service is installed into the VMs. This web service collects and displays authenticated and verified sensor data and can also be used to send actuator commands.
