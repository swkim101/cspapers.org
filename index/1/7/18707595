This paper describes a system for sharing information in the form of objects among users of the Smalltalk-80 programming environment. The system, called Coral3, is pragmatic in that it was developed to meet the needs of specific applications. This paper describes the expectations for the system, presents factors influencing the design, outlines the implementation of Coral3, and raises questions about object-oriented database systems in general.
