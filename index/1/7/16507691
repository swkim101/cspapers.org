This paper describes an approach to object location based on matching model regions to surface image regions. These matches, together with object models, provide hypotheses about the 3D location of the objects containing the recognized surfaces. When a hypothesis is complete, the program describes the matched data and model surface boundaries in terms of the raw model. These descriptions are used used to verify the physical consistency of the hypotheses and to explain extra or hypothesize missing features caused by obscured components.
