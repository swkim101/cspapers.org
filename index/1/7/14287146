To enhance scalability of replicated services a large number of mobile agents attempt to access in mobile agent systems, we present a new strategy to apply an appropriate passive replication mechanism to each replicated service according to its execution behavior because deterministic services require weaker constraints to ensure their consistency than non-deterministic ones. For this goal, two passive replication mechanisms are introduced for non-deterministic services and for deterministic services respectively. They both allow visiting mobile agents to be forwarded to and execute on any node performing a service agent, not necessarily the primary agent. Especially, in case of the mechanism for deterministic services, after a backup service agent has received a mobile agent request and obtained the delivery sequence number of the request from the primary service agent, the backup agent, not the primary one, is responsible for processing the request and coordinating with the other replica service agents.
