A general analytical compliance model is presented for symmetric flexure hinges formed of serial segments of known compliances and with thicknesses defined analytically. Serial combination, mirroring, and translation of individual segments yield the flexure compliances. As an illustration, the compliances of a right elliptical corner-filleted flexure hinge are studied. For an aluminum sample with dimensions of l = 0.0254 m, a = 0.006 m, b = 0.008 m, t = 0.0015 m, and w = 0.00635 m, experimental testing, finite element simulation, and analytical results are very close. Results of this study include plots of the rotary compliance in terms of geometric parameters.
