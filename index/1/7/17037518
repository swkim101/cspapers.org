Information extraction is usually approached as an annotation task: Input texts run through several analysis steps of an extraction process in which different semantic concepts are annotated and matched against the slots of templates. We argue that such an approach lacks an efficient control of the input of the analysis steps. In this paper, we hence propose and evaluate a model and a formal approach that consistently put the filtering view in the focus: Before spending annotation effort, filter those portions of the input texts that may contain relevant information for filling a template and discard the others. We model all dependencies between the semantic concepts sought for with a truth maintenance system, which then efficiently infers the portions of text to be annotated in each analysis step. The filtering view enables an information extraction system (1) to annotate only relevant portions of input texts and (2) to easily trade its run-time efficiency for its recall. We provide our approach as an open-source extension of Apache UIMA and we show the potential of our approach in a number of experiments.
