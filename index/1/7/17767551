St(p,t+l) = Tranr(.9(V,(P),f), ’ . . Sf(v,(p:,t)) where Tram : Qd +Q is the transition function. Such objects are called celhhr spaces, tessalations, iterative arrays of finite automata, systolic arrays, or networks of computers. They have been extensively studied [vN] [HI IK] [‘E!) as they are a natural model of parallel universal computers, and of many physical and biologicxl phenomena. We will examine the cluestion of how to make such networks resistant to errors. ’ Supported in part by National Science Foundation ~;rants DCR 8407256. CCR 87-10078.
