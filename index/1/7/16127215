Tool support for automatically constructing analysis models from the natural language specification of requirements (NLR) is critical to model driven development (MDD), as it can bring forward the use of precise formal languages from the coding to the specification phase in the MDD lifecycle. TRAM provides such a support through a novel approach. By using a set of conceptual patterns to facilitate the transformation of an NLR to its target software model, TRAM has shown its potential as an automated tool to support the earliest phase of MDD. This paper describes TRAM and evaluates the tool against three benchmark approaches.
