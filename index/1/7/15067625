A system has been designed in which explanation-based learning is applied to classical mechanics. An overview of the fully-implemented system and an example run by it are presented. From the example the system acquires a general formula describing how the momentum of a collection of objects changes over time. The derivation of this formula is prompted by the analysis of a human's solution to a simple two-body, one-dimensional collision. The human's solution is based on the principle of momentum conservation. The acquired formula serves to solve a three-dimensional collision in the presence of external forces, a situation where momentum is not conserved.
