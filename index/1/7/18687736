In this paper we study a novel type of network formed by mentor-apprentice relationships in a massively multiplayer online role playing game. We observe that some of the static and dynamic laws which have been observed in many other real world networks are not observed in this network. Consequently well known graph generators like Preferential Attachment, Forest Fire, Butterfly, RTM, etc., cannot be applied to such mentoring networks. We propose a novel generative model to generate networks with the characteristics of mentoring networks.
