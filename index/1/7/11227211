The scientific interaction of game theory with computer science and operations research is broad and fundamental. It covers a large variety of applications in all three fields, and it transfers concepts, language, and results across IYields. Listing all the areas of overlap will be long and tedious. I will therefore restrict myself to discuss a few, easy to present examples, where the crossfertilization of ideas was successful, and point to a need for further research.
