Many existing LDA algorithms are not efficient enough to incrementally update with samples that sequentially arrive in various manners. First, we propose a new fast batch LDA (FLDA/QR) learning algorithm that uses the cluster centers to solve a lower triangular system that is optimized by the Cholesky-factorization. To take advantage of the intrinsically incremental mechanism of the matrix, we further develop an exact incremental algorithm (IFLDA/QR). The Gram-Schmidt process with reorthogonalization in IFLDA/QR significantly saves the space and time expenses compared with the rank-one QR-updating of most existing methods. IFLDA/QR is able to handle streaming data containing 1) new labeled samples in the existing classes, 2) samples of an entirely new (novel) class, and more significantly, 3) a chunk of examples mixed with those in 1) and 2). Both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments have demonstrated much lower space and time costs (2~10 times faster) than the state of the art, with comparable classification accuracy.
