We propose a novel control framework to demonstrate a unique foot tilting maneuver based on ankle torque control for humanoid balance recovery. The framework consists of the variable impedance regulation at the center of mass of the robot based on the ankle torque control, the virtual stoppers to prevent over tilting of the feet, and the body attitude control. The scope of our paper focuses on the sagittal scenario as the first proof of concept on the balance recovery by means of active foot tilting without losing stability. Our study demonstrates the success of the control implementation for the humanoid push recovery and the feasibility of having actively controlled foot tilting. The experimental data are presented and analyzed.
