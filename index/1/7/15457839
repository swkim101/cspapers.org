This paper proposes building knowledge-based systems using a programming system based on a very-high-level language. It gives an overview of such a programming system, BC, and shows how BC can be used to implement knowledge representation features, providing as examples, automatic maintenance of inverse links and property inheritance. The specification language of BC can be extended to include a knowledge representation language by describing its knowledge representation features. This permits a knowledge-based program and its knowledge base to be written in the same very-high-level language which allows the knowledge to be more efficiently incorporated into the program as well as making the system as a whole easier to understand and extend.
