Curriculum '78 [3] describes a course in Operating Systems and Computer Architecture. In the course outline it is stated, “The laboratory for this course would ideally use a small computer where the students could actually implement sections of operating systems and have them fail without serious consequence to other users”. Also in the recommendations for the Software Engineering Subject Area [8], there is a description for two courses in Operating Systems and Architecture. These include suggested projects that could be implemented on a microcomputer system. In the Spring of 1981 an Operating Sytems Course offered at La Salle College used small, stand alone computers. This paper describes the content and motivation for this course.
