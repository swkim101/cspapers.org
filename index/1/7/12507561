One of the major problems in developing new computer applications is specifying the user's requirements such that the Requirements Specification is correct, complete and unambiguous. Although prototyping is often considered too expensive, correcting ambiguities and misunderstandings at the specification stage is significantly cheaper than correcting a system after it has gone into production. This paper describes how a prototype was used to help specify the requirements of a computer system to manage and control a semiconductor processing facility. The cost of developing and running the prototype was less than 10% of the total software development cost.
