This paper introduces a file directory structure which provides an efficient access path for document retrieval. The directory structure is based on the multi-B-tree structure. This directory structure is compatible with current automatic retrieval and query processing techniques. Weights that are assigned to index terms can be included in the directory with the terms at no additional cost . In addition, it provides for indexing a secondary attribute within a primary attribute with no additional cost . Updates are achieved with a high degree of efficiency as well. It is shown that this structure achieves a better overall performance than inverted files, standard B-trees, and other directory structures.
