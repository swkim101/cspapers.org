Mobile robots are nowadays used in a wide variety of missions especially for exploring environments and allowing scientists who study these environments to gather data about them. However the monolithic design of control laws is often a hindrance to adapting control solutions from a robotic application to another. We thus propose a new control description paradigm strongly focused on modularity as well as integrating constraints coming both from the system capabilities and from the concerns of control engineering (such as stability). In this paper, we present the main ideas behind our approach and illustrate it through Hardware-In-the-Loop simulation.
