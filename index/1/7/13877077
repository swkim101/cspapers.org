Ontology-mediated query answering can be used to access large data sets through a mediating ontology. It has drawn considerable attention in the Description Logic (DL) community where both the complexity of query answering and practical query answering approaches based on rewriting were investigated in detail. Surprisingly, there is still a gap in what is known about the data complexity of query answering w.r.t. ontologies formulated in the inexpressive DL FL0. While it is known that the data complexity of answering conjunctive queries w.r.t. FL0 ontologies is coNP-complete, the exact complexity of answering instance queries was open until now. In the present paper, we show that answering instance queries w.r.t. FL0 ontologies is in P for data complexity. Together with the known lower bound of P-completeness for a fragment of FL0, this closes the gap mentioned above.
