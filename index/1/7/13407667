A typical IDE based exploration of an OOP system will often involve multiple searches through class hierarchies, field accesses, method calls, regular expression matches and more. Developers who must follow connections between these disconnected views may find great difficulty in combining the capabilities of each view and may as well suffer significant disorientation due to loss of context while switching. toolname is a flexible, query-based source code browser that alleviates this disorientation by allowing the user to explore the various types of structural relationships between elements of the code without the distraction of switching tools. Using toolname, a developer can define his or her own top-level browsers on-the-fly by formulating logic queries and running them against the source code. Elements in the tree can then be queried individually in the same manner, allowing further exploration of the complex web of relationships that exist between scattered elements of code.
