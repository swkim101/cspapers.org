OmpSs is a programming model that provides an environment to develop parallel applications for cluster environments with heterogeneous architectures. Based on OpenMP and StarSs, it offers a set of compiler directives that can be used to annotate a sequential code. Additional features have been added to support the use of accelerators like GPUs. This schema offers a high productivity environment due to its simplicity compared to other models like MPI. Our current implementation has shown a good performance when running different benchmarks.
