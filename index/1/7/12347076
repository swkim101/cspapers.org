The POSSLT is a Korean to English spoken language translation (SLT) system. Like most other SLT systems, automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech (TTS) are coupled in a cascading manner in our POSSLT. However, several novel techniques are applied to improve overall translation quality and speed. Models used in POSSLT are trained on a travel domain conversational corpus.
