Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) research explores the development of algorithms to detect novel events and track their development over time for online reports. Development of these methods requires careful evaluation and analysis. Traditional reductive methods of evaluation only represent some of the available information of algorithm behaviour. We describe a visualisation tool for topic tracking which makes it easy to analysis and compare the temporal behaviour of tracking algorithms.
