The user interface building blocks of any User Interface Management System (UIMS) have built-in assumptions about what information about application programs they need, and assumptions about how to get that information. The lack of a standard to represent this information leads to a proliferation of different assumptions by different building blocks, hampering changeability of the user interface and portability of applications to different sets of building blocks. This paper describes a formalism for specifying the information about applications needed by the user interface building blocks (i.e. the UIMS/Application interface) so that all building blocks share a common set of assumptions. The paper also describes a set of user interface building blocks specifically designed for these standard UIMS/Application interfaces. These building blocks can be used to produce a wide variety of user interfaces, and the interfaces can be changed without having to change the application program.
