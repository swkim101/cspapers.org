Software-Defined Wireless Networking (SDWN) is being considered an appealing paradigm to design and operate wireless networks through higher-level abstractions and programmatic interfaces such as the OpenFlow protocol. Identified benefits include cost savings, service velocity and customization, resource optimization through novel approaches to user mobility, traffic offloading, multi-layer and multi-path routing, and so on. This demonstration features Mininet-WiFi as a SDWN emulator with the ability to run realistic experiments in hybrid physical-virtual environments, where users attending the conference are able to experience first hand by connecting their devices and interacting with virtual WiFi stations in a wireless mesh network or reach the Internet through the emulated SDWN infrastructure. OpenFlow 1.3 metering and IP header re-writing actions will showcase HTTP flow redirection and rate limitation of real users' wireless traffic.
