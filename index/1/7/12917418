In this paper, we focus on the role that photo viewing plays within a large distributed enterprise. We describe the results of an analysis of users' viewing behavior through log activity and semi-structured interviews with respect to a photo sharing application embedded within an internal social networking site. Specifically, we investigate how these forms of expression can assist in the transmission of the norms and values associated with the culture of the organization through impression formation. We conclude by discussing how photos might act as a resource for newcomers to learn about the various aspects of the organizational culture and offer design suggestions for photo viewing systems within organizations.
