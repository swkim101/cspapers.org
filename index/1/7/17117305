conclusions about how scientific problems are examined. Therefore, the main tool for implementing a case study is the creation and availability o f several high quality illustrative examples. These examples are rich in context and data and yet allow students to recognize the commonalties o f the approach and the similarities in the use o f IT across disciplines. 5.2 Role o f the computer The case study should demonstrate that the use of the computer is a repeatable experience in which ideas about causes for phenomena can be tested and refined. Moreover, the notion that a computer is a tool that one regards as a natural way of extending how one operates needs to be reinforced. It is a "tool o f choice" in a variety of domains and in a number o f different contexts (e.g. statistical analysis, visualizations, etc.) 5.3 Template Table 1 presents a template that we have created and will continue to refine that an instructor will use to prepare a particular case study. Examples of proposed case studies are provided in Appendix A. the case studies and on specific IT modules. The course coordinator will, in a manner agreed with the other participants, act as host and commentator for the other participants. In different terms the role o f course coordinator will be rotated among co-PIs in an effort to arrive at a course format and assessment that is not totally dependent on the personality o f the course
