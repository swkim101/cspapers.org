Attaching a flexible tactile skin to an existing robotic system is relatively easy compared to integrating most other tactile sensor designs. In this paper we show that material classification purely based on the spatio-temporal signal of a flexible tactile skin can be robustly performed in a real world setting. We compare different classification algorithms and feature sets, including features adopted and extended from previous works in tactile material classification and that are based on the signal's Fourier spectrum. Our convolutional deep learning network architecture, which we also present here, is directly fed with the raw 24000 dimensional sensor signal and performs best by a large margin, reaching a classification accuracy of up to 97.3%.
