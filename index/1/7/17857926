This paper presents a static mapping optimization technique for fault-tolerant mixed-criticality MPSoCs. The uncertainties imposed by system hardening and mixed criticality algorithms, such as dynamic task dropping, make the worst-case response time analysis difficult for such systems. We tackle this challenge and propose a worst-case analysis framework that considers both reliability and mixed-criticality concerns. On top of that, we build up a design space exploration engine that optimizes fault-tolerant mixed-criticality MPSoCs and provides worst-case guarantees. We study the mapping optimization considering judicious task dropping, that may impose a certain service degradation. Extensive experiments with real-life and synthetic benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique.
