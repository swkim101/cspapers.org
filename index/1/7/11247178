We present new techniques for efficient garbage collection in a large persistent object store. The store is divided into partitions that are collected independently using information about inter-partition references. This information is maintained on disk so that it can be recovered after a crash. We use new techniques to organize and update this information while avoiding disk accesses. We also present a new global marking scheme to collect cyclic garbage across partitions. Global marking is piggybacked on partitioned collection; the result is an efficient scheme that preserves the localized nature of partitioned collection, yet is able to collect all garbage.
We have implemented the part of garbage collection responsible for maintaining information about inter-partition references. We present a performance study to evaluate this work; the results show that our techniques result in substantial savings in the usage of disk and memory.
