This paper introduces the first design that enables full-duplex communication on battery-free backscatter devices. Specifically, it gives receivers a way to provide low-rate feedback to the transmitter on the same frequency as that of the backscatter transmissions, using neither multiple antennas nor power-consuming cancellation hardware. Our design achieves this goal using only fully-passive analog components that consume near-zero power. We integrate our design with the backscatter network stack and demonstrate that it can minimize energy wastes that occur due to collisions and also correct for errors and changes in channel conditions at a granularity smaller than that of a packet. To show the feasibility of our design, we build a hardware prototype using off-the-shelf analog components. Our evaluation shows that our design cancels the self-interference down to the noise floor, while consuming only 0.25 μW and 0.54 μW of transmit and receive power, respectively.
