Many aspects of time-based media—complex data encoding, compression, “quality factors,” timing—appear problematic from a data modeling standpoint. This paper proposes timed streams as the basic abstraction for modeling time-based media. Several media-independent structuring mechanisms are introduced and a data model is presented which, rather than leaving the interpretation of multimedia data to applications, addresses the complex organization and relationships present in multimedia.
