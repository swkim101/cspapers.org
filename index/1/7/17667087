Neural Machine Translation (NMT) based on the encoder-decoder architecture has recently become a new paradigm. Researchers have proven that the target-side monolingual data can greatly enhance the decoder model of NMT. However, the source-side monolingual data is not fully explored although it should be useful to strengthen the encoder model of NMT, especially when the parallel corpus is far from sufﬁcient. In this paper, we propose two approaches to make full use of the source-side monolingual data in NMT. The ﬁrst approach employs the self-learning algorithm to generate the synthetic large-scale parallel data for NMT training. The second approach applies the multi-task learning framework using two NMTs to predict the translation and the reordered source-side monolingual sentences simultaneously. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods obtain signiﬁcant improvements over the strong attention-based NMT.
