This paper proposes a new adaptive repetitive visual-servo control system for a moving high-flying vehicle (HFV) with an uncalibrated camera to monitor, track, and precisely control the movements of a low-flying vehicle (LFV) or mobile ground robot. When deployed, a remote operator of the HFV defines the desired trajectory for the LFV in the HFV's camera frame (image frame). Due to the circulatory motion of the HFV, the resulting motion trajectory of the LFV in the image frame is periodic in time, thus an adaptive repetitive control system is exploited to improve the tracking precision from one operating period to the next. Not only is the adaptive control law able to deal with uncertainties in the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, but it can also tolerate uncertainties in the localization of the LFV. The design and stability analysis of the closed-loop control system is presented, where the Lyapunov approach is used to show stability. Simulations and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for controlling the movement of a low-flying quadcopter vehicle. Results show good tracking performance for three simulated test cases, where the average maximum tracking error is reduced by approximately 75% compared to the performance of a standard adaptive visual-servo controller.
