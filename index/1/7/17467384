Model-to-Model mapping offers several advantages over relational mapping. In model-to-model mapping an active correspondence is kept between two pairs of models. This is facilitated if visual models are used. UML 2 activities are based on Petri net like semantics and substantial literature exists explaining the conversion process. This paper explains how UML 2 activities can be formally mapped into Petri nets or Petri net semantics from a theoretical and practical and operational point of view adding on previous work of Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs). UML activity constructs have been classified and identified for creating a basic set of TGG rules. The concepts presented can easily be developed further and even extended to other visual models or notations.
