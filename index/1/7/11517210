The technology of document image processing has the possibility of automatic document input. By utilizing it, the flow chart in document image as the alternate expression of FORTRAN source statements is automatically input into the computer. The paper reports the algorithm and the experimental results of field segmentation and classification in document image, the recognition of flow chart including control lines and blocks, and hand-written alpha-numerical characters in the blocks and the explanatory fields, the conversion of flow chart into program functions and the generation of FORTRAN source statements. It showed the possibility that program functions such as initialization, input/output format and branch address were determined by the analysis of flow chart and explanatory description under the writing rule of it and also the restriction that the flow chart should have the good quality in order to recognize the flow and characters and be subject to the writing rule.
