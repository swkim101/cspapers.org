Many people use public computers to browse the Web and perform important online activities. However, public computers are usually far less trustworthy than peoples' own computers because they are more vulnerable to various security attacks. In this paper, we propose SessionMagnifier, a simple approach to secure and convenient kiosk browsing. The key idea of SessionMagnifier is to enable an extended browser on a mobile device and a regular browser on a public computer to collaboratively support a Web session. This approach simply requires a SessionMagnifier browser extension to be installed on a trusted mobile device. A user can securely perform sensitive interactions on the mobile device and conveniently perform other browsing interactions on the public computer. We implemented SessionMagnifier for Mozilla's Fennec browser and evaluated it on a Nokia N810 Internet Tablet. Our evaluation and analysis demonstrate that SessionMagnifier is simple, secure, and usable.
