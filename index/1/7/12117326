In realistic environments, mismatches between the calculated angle-TDOA map with its real exact values are the major reason of performance degradation in sound localization. Usually, those mismatches come from some certain configuration errors or deviations caused by the change of environments. To reduce those mismatches, in this paper we proposed an angle-TDOA map adaptation method which can achieve the robust sound localization in various robot platforms (i.e., various types of microphone array configuration). Especially, the proposed method can be easily applied to the sound localization system by using only several sound sources which generated from some known directions. As a result, the proposed method not only showed a good localization performance, but also saved processing time.
