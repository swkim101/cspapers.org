Despite the increasing importance of graphics in the design of information systems, we have only a partial understanding of how people perceive and process graphic information. This paper describes a computer program, UCIE, that simulates graphical perception. The goal of the program is to model the underlying perceptual and cognitive processes people use to decode information from a graph. The model predicts reaction time from assumptions about eye movements, STM capacity and duration limitations, and the relative level of difficulty to acquire information in each glance. The model summarizes a large body of empirical results and can be the core of an expert advisor for the construction of graphs.
