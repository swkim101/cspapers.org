We give algorithms and data structures that maintain the 2-edge and 2-vertex- connected components of a graph under insertions and deletions of edges and vertices, where dele- tions occur in a backtracking fashion (i.e., deletions undo the insertions in the reverse order). Our algorithms run in (logn) worst-case time per operation and use (n) space, where n is the number of vertices. Using our data structure we can answer queries, which ask whether vertices u and v belong to the same 2-connected component, in (log n) worst-case time.
