For verifying the timing performance of synchronous MOS circuits a path analysis facility has been developed in the MOTIS (MOS Timing Simulator) system. This path analysis traces the clock signals to the latches in the circuit, computes the clock skews and then performs a path search analysis between all latches. For the paths between clocked latches, the timing constraints are determined using the clock skews and the operating frequency. The paths that do not satisfy these constraints are identified as problem paths. Such an analysis does not require a prior generation of circuit stimuli that are necessary for simulation. In terms of complexity also, it is simpler than simulation.
