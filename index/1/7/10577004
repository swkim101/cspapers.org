Modern approaches to monocular SLAM retain all observations and repeatedly perform bundle adjustment in order to overcome the inconsistency problem that arises in approaches that marginalise out camera positions. Bundle adjustment is inherently an expensive operation and so sparse matrix techniques and double window optimisation on sparsely sampled key-frames are employed to minimize the computational cost.
