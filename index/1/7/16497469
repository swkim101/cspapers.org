Slumbot NL is a heads-up no-limit hold'em poker bot built with a distributed disk-based implementation of counterfactual regret minimization (CFR). Our implementation enables us to solve a large abstraction on commodity hardware in a cost-effective fashion. A variant of the Public Chance Sampling (PCS) version of CFR is employed which works particularly well with our architecture.
