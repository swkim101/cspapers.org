In order to process the non-stationary vibration signals during run-up of gearbox, the method based on angle domain average and autoregressive spectrum analysis is presented. This new method combines angle domain average with angle domain average technique. Firstly, the vibration signal is sampled at constant time increments and then uses software to resample the data at constant angle increments.Secondly, the angle domain signal is preprocessed using angle domain average technique in order to eliminate the unrelated noise. In the end, the averaged signals are processed by autoregressive spectrum analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect the gear crack faults.
