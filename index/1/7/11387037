We propose a novel shape-changing technique called Filum, which makes it possible to alter the shapes of textiles to better suit the requirements of people and the environment. Using strings and various sewing methods, ordinary textiles can be automatically shortened or shrunk into curved shapes. We demonstrate a series of novel interactions between people and textiles via three applications.
