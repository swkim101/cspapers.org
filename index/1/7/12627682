The word integration has been used with different 
meanings in the ontology field. This article 
aims at clarifying the meaning of the word “integration” 
and presenting some of the relevant work 
done in integration. We identify three meanings of 
ontology “integration”: when building a new ontology 
reusing (by assembling, extending, specializing 
or adapting) other ontologies already available; 
when building an ontology by merging several 
ontologies into a single one that unifies all of 
them; when building an application using one or 
more ontologies. We discuss the different meanings 
of “integration”, identify the main characteristics 
of the three different processes and proposethree words to distinguish among those meanings:integration, merge and use.
