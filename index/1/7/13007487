In this paper, we first identify the potential violations of control assumptions inherent in standard real-time scheduling approaches (because of the presence of jitters) that causes, degradation in control performance and may even lead to instability. We then develop practical approaches founded on control theory to deal with these violations. Our approach is based on the notion of compensations wherein controller parameters are adjusted at runtime for the presence of jitters. Through time and memory overhead analysis, and by elaborating on the implementation details, we characterize when offline and on-line compensations are feasible. Our experimental results confirm that our approach does compensate for the degraded control performance when EDF and FPS algorithms are used for scheduling the control tasks. Our compensation approach provides us another advantage that leads to better schedulability of control tasks. This derives from the potential to derive more flexible timing constraints, beyond periods and deadlines necessary to apply EDF and FPS. Overall, our approach provides guarantees offline that the control system will be stable at runtime-if temporal requirements are met at runtime-even when actual execution patterns are not known beforehand. With our approach, we can address the problems due to (a) sampling jitters, (b) varying delays between sampling and actuation, or (c) both-not addressable using traditional EDF and FPS based scheduling, or by previous real-time and control integration approaches.
