Languages that have no explicit word delimiters often have to be segmented for statistical machine translation (SMT). This is commonly performed by automated segmenters trained on manually annotated corpora. However, the word segmentation (WS) schemes of these annotated corpora are handcrafted for general usage, and may not be suitable for SMT. An analysis was performed to test this hypothesis using a manually annotated word alignment (WA) corpus for Chinese-English SMT. An analysis revealed that 74.60% of the sentences in the WA corpus if segmented using an automated segmenter trained on the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) will contain conflicts with the gold WA annotations. We formulated an approach based on word splitting with reference to the annotated WA to alleviate these conflicts. Experimental results show that the refined WS reduced word alignment error rate by 6.82% and achieved the highest BLEU improvement (0.63 on average) on the Chinese-English open machine translation (OpenMT) corpora compared to related work.
