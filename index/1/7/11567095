The research on the development of musical performance robots has been particularly intensified on the last decades. In fact, the development of anthropomorphic robots able of playing musical instruments have been served as a mean for understanding the human motor control from an engineering point of view as well as understanding how to enable the communication between human and robots from an emotional point of view. In particular, our research aims in the development of an anthropomorphic saxophonist robot which is able not only of performing a musical score; but also to interact with other musical performance robots (i.e. Waseda Flutist Robot) at the emotional level of perception. In this year, we have focused on the mechanical design of an anthropomorphic robot Waseda Saxophonist Robot No. 1 (WAS-1); which has been designed for playing an alto saxophone. WAS-1 has a total of 15-DOFs which mechanically reproduces the following organs involved during the saxophone playing: lips (1-DOF), tongue (1-DOF), oral cavity, lungs (air pump: 1-DOF and air valve: 1-DOF) and fingers (11-DOFs). In order to verify the effectiveness of the production of sound, a set of experiments have been proposed. In particular, the characteristics of air flow-pressure, level of mechanical noise, and the ripple effect ratio are presented. Finally, a qualitative evaluation of the sound produced by WAS-1 is presented and discussed. From the experimental results, we have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms to produce the saxophone sound.
