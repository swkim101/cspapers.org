One open problem in the fields of place recognition and mapping is to be able to recognise a revisited place when its appearance and layout have changed between visits. In this paper, we investigate this problem in the context of RGB-D mapping in indoor environments. We propose to segment the scene in juts (neighbourhood of 3D points with normals that stick out from the surroundings) and look at low-level features, like textureness or entropy of the normals. These could differentiate those zones of the scene that change or move along time from those that are likely to remain static. We also present a method which improves the matching between images of the same place taken at different times by pruning details basing on these features. We evaluate on a number of communal areas and also on some scenes captured 6 months apart. Experiments with our approach, show an increase up to 70% in inlier matching ratio at the cost of pruning only less than 20% of correct matches, without the need of performing geometric verification.
