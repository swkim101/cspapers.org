The proliferation of XML and its set tlement as the de facto standard for information interchange in Internet as well as the development of query languages like XPath have lead to a paradigm transition in the Inter net database world in favor of tech niques based on semistructured data models At the same time there has been an increase in the deployment of implementations of the LDAP proto col to store the most varied informa tion Its data model characteristics lie closer to the semistructured model than to the relational or object model used in traditional database systems while also o ering additional bene ts for the distribution parallelization and o site processing of queries In this paper we present the internal data representation and query model of an LDAP based system used for the stor age of XML documents and processing of XPath queries The feasibility of our approach as well as its practical rel evance is backed up by experimental data
