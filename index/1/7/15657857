The traditional way to teach Prolog is to have students start by writing recursive mathematical definitions of the problems they are trying to solve. While this is an effective technique, it does not fit well into a Programming Languages course that uses a single demonstration language to illustrate the different paradigms. Thus, we have developed an approach to introduce students to Prolog via our demonstration language, Scheme. Additionally, we performed an experiment to determine if the Scheme to Prolog approach is as effective at introducing Prolog as the more traditional recursive mathematical definition approach.
