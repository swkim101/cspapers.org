When approximating a black-box function, sampling with active learning focussing on regions with non-linear responses tends to improve accuracy. We present the FLOLA-Voronoi method introduced previously for deterministic responses, and theoretically derive the impact of output uncertainty. The algorithm automatically puts more emphasis on exploration to provide more information to the models.
