This paper presents VideoCittà, a system for sharing videos about physical locations. It promotes interaction between users engaged in cultural activities or that are interested in a given location. The system lets users upload their own videos, annotate and hyperlink content that was previously uploaded. It provides different modes of access including the Web and PDAs for mobile access. The system explores several new research directions, namely the generation of hypermedia structures from the existing materials as a way to provide personalized movie structures, the collaborative annotation of multimedia materials and the mobile access to georeferenced contextual information. The paper describes the objectives, the overall architecture of VideoCittà with emphasis on the personalization and collaborative aspects and the results that were obtained so far with the development of the system
