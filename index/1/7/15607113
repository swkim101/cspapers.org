In Android system, black box testing has risen to three key issues: S1: There is no source code and for tester to know the internal logic of the testing App. S2: There is no testing criterion for tester to know the correct behavior and testing scope of the testing App. S3: It is difficult to measure the testing coverage without instrumentation the testing App. In this paper, we provide a approach to analyze the GUI model during the testing process, implement the a black-box based android GUI testing system and select 7 Apps for evaluation. Finally we compare our result of our system with the monkey tool and discuss the inner App's properties that influence on the testing result.
