Static analysis methods are given for determining whether arbitrary sets of database production rules are (1) guaranteed to terminate; (2) guaranteed to produce a unique final database state; (3) guaranteed to produce a unique stream of observable actions. When the analysis determines that one of these properties is not guaranteed, it isolates the rules responsible for the problem and determines criteria that, if satisfied, guarantee the property. The analysis methods are presented in the context of the Starburst Rule System; they will form the basis of an interactive development environment for Starburst rule programmers.
