Traditional image stitching using parametric transforms such as homography, only produces perceptually correct composites for planar scenes or parallax free camera motion between source frames. This limits mosaicing to source images taken from the same physical location. In this paper, we introduce a smoothly varying affine stitching field which is flexible enough to handle parallax while retaining the good extrapolation and occlusion handling properties of parametric transforms. Our algorithm which jointly estimates both the stitching field and correspondence, permits the stitching of general motion source images, provided the scenes do not contain abrupt protrusions.
