How to quickly and cheaply construct Web ontologies has become a key technology to enable the Semantic Web. Classical ontologies are not sufficient for handling imprecise and uncertain information that is commonly found in many application domains. In this paper, we propose an approach for constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy UML models, in which the fuzzy ontology consists of fuzzy ontology structure and instances. Firstly, the fuzzy UML model is investigated in detail, and a kind of formal definition of fuzzy UML models is proposed. Then, a kind of fuzzy ontology called fuzzy OWL DL ontology is introduced. Furthermore, we consider the fuzzy UML model and the corresponding fuzzy UML instantiations (i.e., object diagrams) simultaneously, and translate them into the fuzzy ontology structure and the fuzzy ontology instances, respectively. In addition, since a fuzzy OWL DL ontology is equivalent to a fuzzy Description Logic f-SHOIN(D) knowledge base, how the reasoning problems of fuzzy UML models (e.g., consistency, subsumption, equivalence, and redundancy) may be reasoned through reasoning mechanism of f-SHOIN(D) is investigated, which can help to construct fuzzy ontologies more exactly.
