Few endeavors are successful without the proper preparation. For students to learn successfully, they must be prepared for the task; they must be motivated. In the past, much of this motivation has come from sources beyond the classroom. The instructor has had to do little to motivate the students as long as he did not discourage them. Those external motivational factors are not as prominent as they once were and this circumstance places more of the responsibility for motivating the students on the instructor. This paper, which suggests procedures for motivating students, is intended to emphasize the importance of motivation in learning and to foster an awareness of it. The paper also notes the need for greater recognition for those who provide the motivation, that is, the instructors.
