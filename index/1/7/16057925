Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) has created a high speed wireless network, known as Wireless Andrew. This network uses wireless local area network technology, utilizing spread spectrum in the ISM band. The purpose is not only to support wireless research but also to create a campus-wide mobile computing laboratory. The paper shows the challenge of designing and managing large scale wireless networks. The examples show the differences experienced in wireless vs. wireline networks due to the nature of mobility vs. static components, the nature of RF propagation vs. wireline connection, and the difference in sophistication of tools because of the different place in the product development cycle. The paper describes the lessons learned at completion of the first three year phase including: installation design issues, issues of RF interference and data throughput, the unique problems of wireless network management, and the release of the system.
