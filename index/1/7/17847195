This paper describes the application of a weight estimation method for emergency patients in clinical environments. The approach applies established algorithms for point cloud processing and filtering to data from a low-cost, structured light sensor. A patient's volume is estimated on the basis of their visible front surface. The approach is currently being tested in the workflow of the emergency room at the UniversitaÌˆtsklinikum Erlangen, Germany. Preliminary results show the accuracy of the approach in relation to other conservative means of weight measurements, for example, by physicians and anthropometric measurements.
