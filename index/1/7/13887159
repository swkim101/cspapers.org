We present JANUS, a speech-to-speech translation system that utilizes diverse processing strategies, including connectionist learning, traditional AI knowledge representation approaches, dynamic programming, and stochastic techniques. JANUS translates continuously spoken English and German into German, English, and Japanese. JANUS currently achieves 87% translation fidelity from English speech and 97% from German speech. We present the JANUS system along with comparative evaluations of its interchangeable processing components, with special emphasis on the connectionist modules.
