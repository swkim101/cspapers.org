Early identification of individuals at risk for complications after being diagnosed with T2DM is of significant clinical value. In this paper, we present a new data-driven predictive approach to predict when a patient will develop complications after the initial T2DM diagnosis. We propose a novel survival analysis method to model the time-to-event of T2DM complications designed to simultaneously achieve two important metrics: 1) accurate prediction of event times, and 2) good ranking of the relative risks of two patients. Moreover, to better capture the correlations of time-to-events of the multiple complications, we further develop a multi-task version of the survival model. To assess the performance of these approaches, we perform extensive experiments on patient level data extracted from a large electronic health record claims database. The results show that our new proposed survival analysis approach consistently outperforms traditional survival models and demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-task framework over modeling each complication independently.
