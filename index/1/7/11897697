This paper presents the results of automatically inducing a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) lexicon from a Turkish dependency treebank. The fact that Turkish is an agglutinating free wordorder language presents a challenge for language theories. We explored possible ways to obtain a compact lexicon, consistent with CCG principles, from a treebank which is an order of magnitude smaller than Penn WSJ.
