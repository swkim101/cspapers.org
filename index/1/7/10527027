Weaver is a high-level framework that enables researchers to integrate distributed computing abstractions into their scientific workflows. Rather than develop a new workflow language, we built Weaver on top of the Python programming language. As such, Weaver takes advantage of users' familiarity with Python, minimizes barriers to adoption, and allows for integration with existing software. In this paper, we introduce Weaver's programming model, which consists of datasets, functions, and abstractions that users combine to organize and specify large-scale scientific workflows. We also explain how these specifications are compiled into a directed acyclic graph used by a workflow manager that dispatches the work to a variety of distributed computing engines. To examine how Weaver is used in scientific research, we present three example applications that demonstrate Weaver's ability to integrate into existing workflows and incorporate optimized distributed computing abstraction tools.
