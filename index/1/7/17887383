In this type-II demo, we introduce SIDE (the Summarization Integrated Development Environment), an infrastructure that facilitates construction of summaries tailored to the needs of the user. It aims to address the issue that there is no such thing as the perfect summary for all purposes. Rather, the quality of a summary is subjective, task dependent, and possibly specific to a user. The SIDE framework allows users flexibility in determining what they find more useful in a summary, both in terms of structure and content. As an educational tool, it has been successfully user tested by a class of 21 students in a graduate course on Summarization and Personal Information Management.
