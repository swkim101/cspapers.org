We present a framework for addressing several problems on weighted planar graphs and graphs of bounded genus. With that framework, we derive polynomial-time approximation schemes for the following problems in planar graphs or graphs of bounded genus: edge-weighted tree cover and tour cover; vertex-weighted connected dominating set, max-weight-leaf spanning tree, and connected vertex cover. In addition, we obtain a polynomial-time approximation scheme for feedback vertex set in planar graphs. These are the first polynomial-time approximation schemes for all those problems in weighted embedded graphs. (For unweighted versions of some of these problems, polynomial-time approximation schemes were previously given using bidimensionality.)
