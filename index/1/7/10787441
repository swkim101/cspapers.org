We consider the classical geometric problem of determining a shortest path through a weighted domain. We present approximation algorithms that compute e-short paths, i.e., paths whose costs are within a factor of 1 + e of the shortest path costs, for an arbitrary constant e > O, for the following geometric configurations: SPPS Problem: We are given a polyhedron 79 consisting of n convex faces 1 and each face has a positive non-zero real valued weight. The shortest path on polyhedral surface problem (SPPS) is to compute a path of least cost that remains on the surface of 79 between any two vertices, where the cost of the path is defined to be the weighted sum of Euclidean lengths of the sub-paths within each face. Our algorithm runs in O(~ lo 1, 1 g ;t~ + logn)) time for 0 _ 1 and to O(~ log ~ log n) when all weights are equal.
