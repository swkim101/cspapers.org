The development of new mobile microrobotic swimmers, limited by low Reynolds dynamics and stiction effects in confined environments, should aim for efficient propulsion mechanisms in wet confined environments and more elaborated manipulation strategies. We first introduced a novel type of microrobots called MagPol (Magnetic Polarizable) integrated in a microfluidic chip controlled through magnetic waves. We developed a simple method analyzing rotational dynamics to characterize swimming performances inside microfluidic environments and provide experimental criteria to improve hydrodynamics of future designs. Magpols demonstrated their in-plane mobilities, with a maximum speed up-to 566 millimeters per second (1390 body lengths per second), and the completions of sophisticated trajectory through the microchannels, forward or backward. In addition to their enhanced planar mobilities, we newly demonstrated a backward towing technique by reversing intrinsic magnetic moment.
