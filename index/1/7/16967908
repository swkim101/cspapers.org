Ubiquitous robotics is an emerging paradigm in which smart environments are augmented with robots to provide physical and information added-value services to the citizen. We discuss the challenges and opportunities in extending this paradigm from a single environment (home, factory floor) to the scale of a community of homes, a town, or even a network of towns. To this aim, we introduce the concept of multiple robotic ecologies. This poster is a first step in defining a scalable architecture for a hierarchy of robotic smart-home ecologies, and a framework to provide autonomous services in it.
