Ultra-small smart devices, such as smart watches, have become increasingly popular in recent years. Most of these devices rely on touch as the primary input modality, which makes tasks such as text entry increasingly difficult as the devices continue to shrink. In the sole pursuit of entry speed, the ultimate solution is a shorthand technique (e.g., Morse code) that sequences tokens of input (e.g., key, tap, swipe) into unique representations of each character. However, learning such techniques is hard, as it often resorts to rote memory. Our technique, Swipeboard, leverages our spatial memory of a QWERTY keyboard to learn, and eventually master a shorthand, eyes-free text entry method designed for ultra-small interfaces. Characters are entered with two swipes; the first swipe specifies the region where the character is located, and the second swipe specifies the character within that region. Our study showed that with less than two hours' training, Tested on a reduced word set, Swipeboard users achieved 19.58 words per minute (WPM), 15% faster than an existing baseline technique.
