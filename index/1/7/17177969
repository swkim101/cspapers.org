Starting from the 80â€™s, the research in Artificial Intelligence (AI ) has proposed different valuable approaches to cope with temporal constraints and temporal reasoning. Although most of these approaches are domain-independent, their application to specific domains/tasks involves an in-depth analysis, and, in many cases, also an extension of the approaches themselves. In this paper, we investigate the case of clinical guidelines. We first analyze the different types of temporal constraints that are involved in the description of clinical guidelines, and then propose a new temporal reasoning approach to represent such constraints and reason with them. We propose a temporal representation formalism and two constraint propagation algorithms operating on it, and we show how they can be exploited in order to provide clinical guideline systems with different types of temporal facilities. We thus demonstrate that the adoption of AI techniques provides crucial benefits in the domain of clinical guidelines.
