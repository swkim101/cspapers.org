We state and prove a weighted version of Janson inequalities (JI ) [2]. Consider a sequence of m independent random variables Xl,. . . .X, where each Xi takes values from a totally ordered finite set Si. Suppose, for each i in some index set I, we axe given a subset A; C { 1, . . . , m} and an event &i which depends only on the values of {Xl : 1 E Ai}, where each E; satisfies some properties. The generalized inequalities helps us to obtain exponential lower and upper bounds on Pr(V i E I, E). Such estimates are needed in analyzing the lengths of paths in a randomly weighted graph and have applications in the average case analysis of algorithms like shortest paths algorithms. The Janson inequalities deal with the unweighted case in which each Xi is a O,l-variable and we want to obtain bounds on Pr(V i E I, c,,,. XI < IAil). The proof of the weighted version is similarâ€™to the proof of JI obtained by Boppana and Spencer [5] and is based on the FKG inequalities [7]. Applying these weighted inequalities, we analyze and estimate the lengths of shortest paths in a randomly weighted random graph. In such a graph, each edge is randomly chosen (or not) and a random weight is assigned to every chosen edge. This estimate immediately leads to 0(n2(logn)) average time algorithms for all-pairsshortest-paths and all-pairs-bottleneck-paths problems.
