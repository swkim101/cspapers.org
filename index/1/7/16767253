We introduce an extended naive Bayes model for word sense induction (WSI) and apply it to a WSI task. The extended model incorporates the idea the words closer to the target word are more relevant in predicting its sense. The proposed model is very simple yet effective when evaluated on SemEval-2010 WSI data.
