In a futuristic scenario, a conversational agent may occasionally be asked for its own opinion or suggestion based on its own thought, feelings, or experiences as if it is an individual with identity, personality, and social life. In moving towards that direction, in this paper, a brain inspired model of self-awareness is presented that allows an agent to learn to attend to different aspects of self as an individual with identity, physical embodiment, mental states, experiences, and reflections on how others may think about oneself. The model is built and realized on a NAO humanoid robotic platform to investigate the role of this capacity of self-awareness on the robot's learning and interactivity.
