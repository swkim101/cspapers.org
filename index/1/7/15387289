Query expansion by word alterations (alternative forms of a word) is often used in Web search to replace word stemming. This allows users to specify particular word forms in a query. However, if many alterations are added, query traffic will be greatly increased. In this paper, we propose methods to select only a few useful word alterations for query expansion. The selection is made according to the appropriateness of the alteration to the query context (using a bigram language model), or according to its expected impact on the retrieval effectiveness (using a regression model). Our experiments on two TREC collections will show that both methods only select a few expansion terms, but the retrieval effectiveness can be improved significantly.
