Inverse currying transformation of an attribute grammar moves a context condition to places in the grammar where the violation of the condition can be detected as soon as the semantic information used in the condition is computed. It thereby takes into account the evaluation order chosen for the attribute grammar. Inverse currying transformations can be used to enhance context sensitive parsing using predicates on attributes, to eliminate sources of backtrack when parsing according to ambiguous grammars, and to facilitate semantics-supported error correction.
