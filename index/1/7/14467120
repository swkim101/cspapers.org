This paper presents a planning algorithm for a 2-DOF robotic arm to bat a flying 2D object to a targeted location. Impact dynamics are combined with trajectory kinematics and manipulator dynamics to compute the evolving set of states (poses and velocities) of the arm able to achieve the task as the object is flying. Planning is conducted under the arm's dynamic and kinematic constraints. At the time of hit, the robot executes an action to minimize its total energy. Simulation and Experiments have been conducted using a Whole Arm Manipulator (WAM) from Barrett Technology, Inc.
