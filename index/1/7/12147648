Search tasks in users' query sequences are dynamic and interconnected. The formulation of search tasks can be influenced by multiple latent factors such as user characteristics, product features and search interactions, which makes search task identification a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to identify search tasks via topic membership along with topic transition probabilities, thus it becomes possible to interpret how user's search intent emerges and evolves over time. Moreover, a novel hidden semi-Markov model is introduced to model topic transitions by considering not only the semantic information of queries but also the latent search factors originated from user search behaviors. A variational inference algorithm is developed to identify remarkable search behavior patterns, typical topic transition tracks, and the topic membership of each query from query logs. The learned topic transition tracks and the inferred topic memberships enable us to identify both small search tasks, where a user searches the same topic, and big search tasks, where a user searches a series of related topics. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach and compare with several state-of-the-art search task identification methods on both synthetic and real-world query log data, and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.
