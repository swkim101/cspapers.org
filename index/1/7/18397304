We show how to construct a suffix tree of a text string t in linear time, after sorting the characters in the text, so that a search for pattern p take time O(p + log t), independent of the alphabet size, thereby matching the asymptotic performance of suffix arrays. Using these suffix trees or suffix arrays we then give linear time algorithms for pattern matching in any fixed dimension.
