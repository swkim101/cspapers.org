This paper is a summary of an effort to develop a powerful motion planning algorithm for the mobile manipulator. The mobile manipulator is expected to work in partially defined or unstructured environments. In our global/local approach to path planning, joint trajectories are generated for a desired Cartesian space path, designed by the global path planner. For local path planner, inverse kinematics for a redundant system is used. Obstacle avoidance and joint displacement limits for the manipulator links are considered in the motion planner. In an event of failure to obtain feasible trajectories, the task can not be accomplished. In the case of the joint constraint violation, use of Jacobian matrix element as gradient is proposed. At the point of failure, a derivation in the Cartesian space path is obtained and the re-planner gives a new path that would achieve the goal position. To calculate the deviation, a non-linear optimization problem is formulated and solved by standard sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method.
