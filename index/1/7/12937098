With the exponential growth of the usage of web map services, the geo data analysis has become more and more popular. This paper develops an online Spatial Data Analysis System, TerraFly GeoCloud, which facilitates the end user to visualize and analyze spatial data, and to share the analysis results. Built on the TerraFly Geo spatial database, TerraFly GeoCloud is an extra layer running upon TerraFly map supporting many different visualization functions and spatial data analysis models. TerraFly GeoCloud also enables the MapQL technology to create maps using SQL-like statements. The TerraFly GeoCloud system is available at http://terrafly.fiu.edu/GeoCloud/.
