Models of temporal planning are complex, due to the possibility of multiple concurrent and mutually interacting actions. This work compares two modeling languages, one with a PDDL-style action exclusion mechanism, and another with an explicit notion of resources, and investigates their implications on constraint-based search. The first mechanism forces temporal gaps in action schedules and have a high performance penalty. The second mechanism avoids the gaps, with dramatically improved performance.
