When restricted to proving Sigma<sub>i</sub> <sup>q</sup> formulas, the quantified prepositional proof system G<sub>i</sub>* is closely related to the Sigma<sub>i</sub> <sup>b</sup> theorems of Buss's theory S<sub>2</sub> <sup>i</sup>. Namely, G<sub>i</sub>* has polynomial- size proofs of the translations of theorems of S<sub>2</sub> <sup>i</sup>, and S<sub>2</sub> <sup>i</sup> proves that G<sub>i</sub>* is sound. However, little is known about G* when proving more complex formulas. In this paper, we prove a witnessing theorem for G<sub>i</sub>* similar in style to the KPT witnessing theorem for T<sub>2</sub> <sup>i</sup>. This witnessing theorem is then used to show that S<sub>2</sub> <sup>i</sup> proves G* is sound with respect to prenex Sigma<sub>i+1</sub> <sup>q</sup> formulas. Note that unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses S<sub>2</sub> <sup>i</sup> is the weakest theory in the S<sub>2</sub> <sup>i</sup> hierarchy for which this is true. The witnessing theorem is also used to show that G<sub>1</sub>* is p-equivalent to a quantified version of extended-Frege. This is followed by a proof that Gi p-simulates G*<sub>i+1</sub>. We finish by proving that S<sub>2</sub> can be axiomatized by S<sub>2</sub> <sup>1</sup> plus axioms stating that the cut-free version of G* is sound. All together this shows that the connection between G<sub>i</sub>* and S<sub>2</sub> <sup>i</sup> does not extend to more complex formulas.
