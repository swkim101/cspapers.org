We propose in this paper a method to enhance the performance of a coupled global positioning/inertial navigation system (GPS/INS) for both air and land navigation applications during the GPS signal loss. Our method is based on using an artificial neural network (ANN) to intelligently aid the GPS/INS coupled navigation system in the absence of GPS signals. The proposed enhanced GPS/INS is used in the very dynamic environment of a tour of an autonomous van on the METU campus and we provide the results here. Our GPS/INS+ANN system performance is thus demonstrated with the land trials.
