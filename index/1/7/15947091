The use of bad names --- names that are wrong, inconsistent or inconcise --- hinder program comprehension. The root of the problem is that there is no mechanism for aligning the name and implementation of a method. We believe that judgment on the suitability of a chosen name can be passed automatically by comparing the actual implementation of a method to what we would expect from the name itself. The gist of our approach is to understand how programmers use language in their programs, by analysing a large corpus of Java applications.
