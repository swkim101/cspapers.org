Many data mining techniques have been proposed for mining useful patterns in databases. However, how to effectively utilize discovered patterns is still an open research issue, especially in the domain of text mining. Most existing methods adopt term-based approaches. However, they all suffer from the problems of polysemy and synonymy. This paper presents an innovative technique, pattern taxonomy mining, to improve the effectiveness of using discovered patterns for finding useful information. Substantial experiments on RCV1 demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves encouraging performance.
