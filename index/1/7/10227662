We present a fast and robust system for estimating structure and motion using a stereo pair, with straight lines as features. Our first set of contributions are efficient algorithms to perform this estimation using a few (two or three) lines, which are well-suited for use in a hypothesize-and-test framework. Our second contribution is the design of an efficient structure from motion system that performs robustly in complex indoor environments.
