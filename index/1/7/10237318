The problem of super-resolution involves generating feasible higher resolution images, which are pleasing to the eye and realistic, from a given low resolution image. This might be attempted by using simple filters for smoothing out the high resolution blocks or through applications where substantial prior information is used to imply the textures and shapes which will occur in the images. In this paper we describe an approach which lies between the two extremes. It is a generic unsupervised method which is usable in all domains, but goes beyond simple smoothing methods in what it achieves. We use a dynamic tree-like architecture to model the high resolution data. Approximate conditioning on the low resolution image is achieved through a mean field approach.
