HCI researchers lack low latency and robust systems to support the design and development of interaction techniques using finger identification. We developed a low cost prototype using piezo based vibration sensors attached to each finger. By combining the events from an input device with the information from the vibration sensors we demonstrate how to achieve low latency and robust finger identification. Our prototype was evaluated in a controlled experiment, using two keyboards and a touchpad, showing recognition rates of 98.2% for the keyboard and, for the touchpad, 99.7% for single touch and 94.7% for two simultaneous touches. These results were confirmed in an additional laboratory style experiment with ecologically valid tasks. Last we present new interactions techniques made possible using this technology.
