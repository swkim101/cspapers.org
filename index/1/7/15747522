Temporal analysis on dynamic networks has become a popularly discussed topic today, with more and more emerging data over time. In this paper we investigate the problem of detecting and tracking the variational communities within a given time period. We first define a metric to measure the strength of a community, called the normalized temporal community strength. And then, we propose our analysis framework. The community may evolve over time, either split to multiple communities or merge with others. We address the problem of evolutionary clustering with requirement on temporal smoothness and propose a revised soft clustering method based on non-negative matrix factorization. Then we use a clustering matching method to find the soft correspondence between different community distribution structures. This matching establishes the connection between consecutive snapshots. To estimate the variational rate and meanwhile address the smoothness during continuous evolution, we propose an objective function that combines the conformity of current variation and historical variational trend. In addition, we integrate the weights to the objective function to identify the temporal outliers. An iterative coordinate descent method is proposed to solve the optimization framework. We extensively evaluate our method with a synthetic dataset and several real datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which is greatly superior to the baselines on detection of the communities with significant variation over time.
