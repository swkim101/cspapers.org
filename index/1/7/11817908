In this paper we present an open-source design for the development of low-complexity, anthropomorphic, underactuated robot hands with a selectively lockable differential mechanism. The differential mechanism used is a variation of the whiffletree (or seesaw) mechanism, which introduces a set of locking buttons that can block the motion of each finger. The proposed design is unique since with a single motor and the proposed differential mechanism the user is able to control each finger independently and switch between different grasping postures in an intuitive manner. Anthropomorphism of robot structure and motion is achieved by employing in the design process an index of anthropomorphism. The proposed robot hands can be easily fabricated using low-cost, off-the-shelf materials and rapid prototyping techniques. The efficacy of the proposed design is validated through different experimental paradigms involving grasping of everyday life objects and execution of daily life activities. The proposed hands can be used as affordable prostheses, helping amputees regain their lost dexterity.
