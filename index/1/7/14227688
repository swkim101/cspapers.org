In this paper we report some of the research endeavors we are embarking on as part of the Doctoral research of the first author. We have already completed an investigation of some of the existing algorithms in the areas of Network Routing and Traffic Engineering, and we propose superior algorithms that would adapt to the changes in the environment in which they operate. In this attempt, we intend to use the theory of Learning Automata (LA) (Narendra and Thathachar, 1989; Obaidat et al. 2002) to address the problems we are investigating.
