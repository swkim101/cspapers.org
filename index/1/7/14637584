We describe a new data structure, the Lst@ix tree, which is a generalization to a souare matrix of McCreieht’s suffix tree ‘ior a string ordered alohabet . All-matrices have entries ii a totally . Based on the Lsuffix tree. we eive efficient algorithms for the static and dynamic ver&ns of the following problems that arise in many important applications in low-level image processing [19] and in visual databases [1S]: Two-Dimensional Pattern Retrieval: We have a library of texts S = {TEXT’, . . . ,TEXT’}, where TEXT’ is an ni x ni matrix, 1 < i < r. In the static version, we may preprocess the.libr&y. -Given an m x m pattern matrix PAT, we want to find all occurrences of PAT in TEXT (query), for all TEXT E S. In th e d ynamic version, we can update the librarv S bv insertine in it or deletine from it some TEXT. The query is as i; the static versi& but is intermixed with update operations. Two-Dimensional Dictionary Matching: We have a dictionary of patterns DC = {PAZ, ... , PAT,}, where PAZ is of dimension mi x mi, 1 < i < s. In the static case, we may preprocess the dictionary. liven an n x n text matrix TEXT, we want to search for all occurrences of patterns in the dictionary in the text (search step). In the dynamic version, we can update DC by inserting or deleting some matrix (pattern) from it.
