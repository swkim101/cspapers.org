An important factor for the success of industrial manufacturers is a cost-efficient, robust and thus failsafe production. In this context a topic of increasing interest is the continuous monitoring of machine tools to be able to proactively react to signs of degeneration of single components and ensure the technical availability of the whole plant.
 The focus of this paper lies on the condition monitoring of ball screw drives (BSD) that are one of the main components of modern feed axes in machine tools. A low cost and easy installable wireless sensor network (WSN) concept for the monitoring of solid borne sound via MEMS acceleration sensors is proposed for this application.
