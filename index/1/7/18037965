In this, paper we report the results of a preliminary survey of how people go about developing simulation models of software processes. The survey was conducted at ProSim03 Workshop. The main objective of this study is to identify current practices and issues in software process simulation modelling. We discuss the need for a formal process of software process simulation modelling. Moreover, we discuss potential critical issues in software process simulation modelling.
