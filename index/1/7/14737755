A procedure is described for obtaining the description of solid bodies from a set of pictures taken from different vantage points. The bodies are assumed to be bounded by faces which are planar or quadric, and to have vertices formed by exactly three faces. The line and junction information provided to the program by the preprocessor is assumed to contain defects such as missing lines or wrongly classified junction types. The procedure is able to build a description of the bodies in spite of a moderate number of such imperfections. Use is made of a set of new grammar rules for line-drawing projections of curved and planar bodies.
