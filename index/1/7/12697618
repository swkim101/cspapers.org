In this paper we examine WikiProjects, an emergent, community-driven feature of Wikipedia. We analysed 3.2 million Wikipedia articles associated with 618 active Wikipedia projects. The dataset contained the logs of over 115 million article revisions and 15 million talk entries both representing the activity of 15 million unique Wikipedians altogether. Our analysis revealed that per WikiProject, the number of article and talk contributions are increasing, as are the number of new Wikipedians contributing to individual WikiProjects. Based on these findings we consider how studying Wikipedia from a sub-community level may provide a means to measure Wikipedia activity.
