As adults we take for granted our capacity to express our information needs verbally and textually. However, young children also have preferences and information needs, but are just learning to be able to express themselves effectively. Consequently they encounter many barriers when trying to spell, type, and communicate their needs to a 'faceless' search engine text box. Junior Search (JuSe) is an interface that enables preschoolers and young children to search and find consumable online content (such as games for kids, videos, etc.) through adaptable picture dictionaries. Inspired by educational children's toys, rather than search engines designed for adults, JuSe incorporates a learning element by combining audio-visual and textual cues to improve written word recognition and vocabulary skills. JuSe provides an interactive learning environment that allows parents to introduce new words and concepts into the child's lexicon, as well as controlling the content and search queries.
