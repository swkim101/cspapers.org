We present a linear-time algorithm for bounded-type programs that builds a directed graph whose transitive closure gives exactly the results of the standard (cubic-time) Control-Flow Analysis (CFA) algorithm. Our algorithm can be used to list all functions calls from all call sites in (optimal) quadratic time. More importantly, it can be used to give linear-time algorithms for CFA-consuming applications such as:&bull; effects analysis: find the side-effecting expressions in a program.&bull; k-limited CFA: for each call-site, list the functions if there are only a few of them (&le; k) and otherwise output "many".&bull; called-once analysis: identify all functions called from only one call-site.
