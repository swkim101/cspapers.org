The concept of an integrated data base has great appeal for design automation system developers (Fig. 1). A single repository for all data on a given design has many advantages, though it can be argued there are severe disadvantages also.
 It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss the pros and cons of integrated data bases, but to look at the process through which the concept becomes a reality in a DA system. This process is described as an evolution through various stages of integration and system structure.
