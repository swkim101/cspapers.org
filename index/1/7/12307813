We present a prototype of a novel technology for second language instruction. Our learn-by-reading approach lets a human learner acquire new words and constructions by encountering them in context. To facilitate reading comprehension, our technology presents mixed native language (L1) and second language (L2) sentences to a learner and allows them to interact with the sentences to make the sentences easier (more L1-like) or harder (more L2-like) to read. Eventually, our system should continuously track a learnerâ€™s knowledge and learning style by modeling their interactions, including performance on a pop quiz feature. This will allow our system to generate personalized mixed-language texts for learners.
