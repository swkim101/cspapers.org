Recently, 360-degree panorama and spherical displays have received more and more attention due to their unique panoramic properties. Compared with existing works, we plan to utilize omnidirectional cameras in our spherical display system to enable omnidirectional panoramic image as input and output. In our work, we present a novel movable spherical display embedded with omnidirectional cameras. Our system can use embedded cameras to shoot 360-degree panoramic video and project the live stream from its cameras onto its spherical display in real time. In addition, we implemented an approach to achieve the dynamic spherical projection mapping in order to project to moving spherical devices. We have also been creating applications utilizing system's features by using 360-degree panoramic image as input and output.
