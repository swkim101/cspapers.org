Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) allows the identification and location of items using passive electronic labels. However, current RFID techniques do not locate objects precisely. The monopulse system allows to locate objects with higher accuracy using a combination of Radio Frequency (RF) beams. In this work, we present a two-antenna monopulse system implementation using RFID technologies. By combining RF beams we obtained a focused beam. We also investigated the multipath effect in this work. Our results show a monopulse system using RFID technologies with an accuracy of 84%. It can be applied in the retail industry for applications such as fitting rooms, inventory, customers' location and others.
