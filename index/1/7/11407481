Recent industry trends suggest a new phenomenon in the mobile market: mobile virtual network operators or MVNOs that operate on top of existing cellular infrastructures. While MVNOs have shown significant growth in the US and elsewhere in the past two years and have been successful in attracting customers, there is anecdotal evidence that users are concerned about cellular performance when choosing MVNOs over traditional cellular operators. In this paper, we present the first systematic measurement study to shed light on this emerging phenomenon. We study the performance of 3 key applications: web access, video streaming and voice, in 2 popular MVNO families (a total of 8 carriers) in the US, where each MVNO family consists of a major base carrier and 3 MVNOs running on top of it. We observe that some MVNOs do indeed exhibit significant performance degradation and that there are key differences between the two MVNO families.
