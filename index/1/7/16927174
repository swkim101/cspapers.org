Public safety organizations need robust communication networks to transmit different kind of sensor information. These networks must be reliable even when all infrastructure has been destroyed. Wireless multi-hop networks (such as Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), and Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs)) are supposed to meet the requirements of (1) spontaneous deployment, (2) being independent of any kind of existing infrastructure, and (3) robustness in the sense of self-organization and self-healing by their very definition. These networks have been a topic in research for more than a decade now. Recently, real-world tests and deployments provide valuable insights concerning challenges and future research directions. There are different mesh and WSN testbeds (e.g., [4, 9, 10]) enabling the research community to run tests in static real-world networks. However, concerning public safety requirements, there are significant differences: (1) No spontaneous deployment, (2) no or at least no mobility typical for public safety, (3) no typical applications and traffic for public safety scenarios. Due to these characteristics, developing algorithms and protocols for public safety scenarios and deploying public safety networks is a huge challenge.
 To overcome this challenge, we developed a prototype based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. The prototype comprises typical public safety application and is spontaneously deployable. Furthermore, this prototype enables us to perform evaluations with real public safety endusers, e.g. by deploying the prototype in maneuvers. In our demo, we will demonstrate our COTS-based prototype.
