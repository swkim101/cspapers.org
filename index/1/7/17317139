The WorkingMan’s MOO extends a text-based virtual environment through a small command server which sits on the user’s workstation. The extended virtual environment can offer the power of a command line, but embedded within a virtual community, enabling the creation of new interface metaphors that connect the virtual/MOO space with the desktop space.
