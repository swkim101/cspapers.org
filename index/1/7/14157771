In order to find the optimal control of continuous state-space and time reinforcement learning (RL) problems, we approximate the value function (VF) with a particular class of functions called the barycentric interpolators. We establish sufficient conditions under which a RL algorithm converges to the optimal VF, even when we use approximate models of the state dynamics and the reinforcement functions.
