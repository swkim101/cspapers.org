In this paper we study usefulness of users' gender information for improving ranking of ambiguous queries in personalized and non-contextual settings. This study is performed as a sequence of offline re-ranking experiments and it demonstrates that the proposed gender-aware ranking features provide improvements in ranking quality. It is also shown that the proposed personalized features exhibit performance superior to non-contextual ones.
