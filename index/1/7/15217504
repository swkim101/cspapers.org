Digital Fingerprinting is a technique for the merchant who can embed unique buyer identity marks into digital media copy, and also makes it possible to identify "traitors" who redistribute their illegal copies. At present, the fingerprinting scheme generally have many difficulties and disadvantages for large-size uses problems involve in the code construction with shorter length and effective traitor tracing. To resolve these problems, this paper presents the definition of Fingerprinting Information Code and a practical construction method by composing of convolutional codes and generally fingerprinting codes based on Boneh-Shaw model. Its decoding algorithm is presented by introducing the ideal of 'Optional Code Subset' and improving Viterbi algorithm. The security properties and performance are proved and analyzed by theory and example. As the results, the proposed scheme has shorter information encoding length and achieves optimal traitor searching in larger number of buyers.
