Markov-based strength meters provide more accurate estimate of password strength as opposed to rule-based strength meters. However, we observed that these meters assign very high scores to slightly altered weak passwords. It is important to score modified variants of weak passwords more conservatively as the existing password cracking tools generate such guesses much more quickly. In this paper, we propose a simple greedy algorithm to detect small alterations and improve the scoring mechanism of Markov strength meters.
