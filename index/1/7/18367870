The performance of a contention-based TDMA technique is studied in this paper. The frame structure of the time-axis is similar to [1] and [2]. The protocols proposed in [1],[2] and here are all active multiaccess techniques. The protocol in [1] is contention free and suitable for heavy traffic while a contention-based protocol suitable for light traffic is considered in [2]. The protocol to be studied in this paper is also contention in nature and performs considerably better than [2]. This protocol is less complicated than [1] and out-performs [1] unless traffic is very high. Performance analyses, both transient and steady-state, have been successfully completed. Results obtained include average queue length and packet delay, etc. The validity of analysis is also verified by computer simulations.
