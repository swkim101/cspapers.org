User-created live video streaming is marking a fundamental shift in the workload of live video delivery. However, live-video-specific challenges and the viral nature of user-created content makes it difficult for current CDNs to deliver 1) high-quality, 2) highly-scalable, and 3) highly-responsive service. We present the design and implementation of VDN, a new control plane for CDNs designed to optimize the delivery of live streams within the CDN. VDN satisfies these requirements by using two approaches: 1) optimizing directly for video quality (not just throughput) and 2) combining centralized control with local control, allowing VDN to adapt to traffic dynamics and network failures at fine timescales.
