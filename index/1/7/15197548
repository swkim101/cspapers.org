In order to improve energy efficiency of transport systems, eco-driving strategies are studied world-widely. However, most literatures on eco-driving based on traditional traffic flow models, are greatly simplified, and can not evaluate the effects on detailed driving behaviors. By referring to robot motion planning approaches, in this research a microscopic vehicle model is developed and it can represent different driving behaviors, such as aggressive or conservative driving; a collision detection algorithm is proposed that takes O(1) time to check for a trajectory's collision, enabling realtime planning; and a traffic simulation system is developed by incorporating traffic rules, so that the driving behaviors such as observing or not observing traffic rules can also be represented. Experiments are conducted on the simulation platform, and the performance of different driving behaviors on travel time, mileage, comfort and eco is studied.
