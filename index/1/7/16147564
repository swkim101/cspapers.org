There are many kinds of deformable objects in our living life. Some of them exhibit rheological behaviors when they are subject to external force, such as human tissues, human organs, and food. If we want to simulate or control such behaviors, we have to know the physical parameters of the object in advance. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify these parameters based on 2D finite element (FE) simulation and measurement of deformation and force. At first, 2D FE model used to simulate rheological deformation was described. Then, identification method was presented according to the analysis of simulation results. Identification results for simulation were also given. Finally, this method was applied to a object made of clay. Deformation and force were measured by camera and tactile sensor respectively. The identification results show the validity and effectiveness of this method.
