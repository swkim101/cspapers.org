Using case-based reasoning and an author level planning system, Minstrel models human creative processes. However, the algorithmic and representational commitments made in Minstrel were never subject to principled and quantitative analysis. By rationally reconstructing Minstrel, we are able to investigate Turner's computational model of creativity and learn new lessons about his architecture. We find that Minstrel's original performance was tied to a well-groomed case library, but by modifying several components of the algorithm we can create a more general version which can construct stories using a sparser and less structured case library. Through a rational reconstruction of Minstrel, we both learn new architectural and algorithmic lessons about Minstrelâ€™s computational model of creativity as well as make his architecture available to the contemporary research community for further experimentation.
