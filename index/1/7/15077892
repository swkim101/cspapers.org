Also, they are almost exclusively based on regression. In this paper, we propose a first-order interpreter for knowledge-based Golog with sensing based on exact progression and limited reasoning. We assume infinitely many unique names and handle first-order disjunctive information in the form of the so-called proper+ KBs. Our implementation is based on the progression and limited reasoning algorithms for proper+ KBs proposed by Liu, Lakemeyer and Levesque. To improve efficiency, we implement the two algorithms by grounding via a trick based on the unique name assumption. The interpreter is online but the programmer can use two operators to specify offline execution for parts of programs. The search operator returns a conditional plan, while the planning operator is used when local closed-world information is available and calls a modern planner to generate a sequence of actions.
