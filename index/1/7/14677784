The incrementally extensible hypercube (IEH) network, a variant of the hypercube, is defined for every positive number and has been widely discussed. However, some properties of the IEH network are incorrect and have been misused. Moreover, no deterministic fault-tolerant routing has been proposed. In this paper, we first simplify the construction of an IEH network. Then we point out the mistakes in the topology of the number of edges, the diameter, and the shortest paths. We present the correct results and propose a novel optimal routing algorithm. Moreover, a deterministic fault-tolerant routing algorithm for the IEH network is proposed.
