An active data model is one that not only stores data, but also acts upon changes to the data in ways that reflect application domain semantics. This paper introduces an active object-oriented model based on incremental attribute evaluation (one-way constraints) and discusses how it can be used to support a number of tasks in a User Interface Management System. It is shown how this model can provide unified support for lexical, syntactic, and semantic feedback, how the model supports the specification and implementation of dynamically changing graphical layouts, and how the model can be used as the basis for support of user extensible interfaces.
