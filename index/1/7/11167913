In the past, we presented tutorials called "Introduction to Statistical Machine Translation", aimed at people who know little or nothing about the field and want to get acquainted with the basic concepts. This tutorial, by contrast, goes more deeply into selected topics of intense current interest. We aim at two types of participants: 
 
1. People who understand the basic idea of statistical machine translation and want to get a survey of hot-topic current research, in terms that they can understand. 
 
2. People associated with statistical machine translation work, who have not had time to study the most current topics in depth.
