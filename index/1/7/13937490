The capability to interconnect directly with neighboring wireless devices coupled with improvements in high-speed wireless connections, and the wide distribution of high-quality multimedia has led to the design of standards such as the WiFi-based Miracast [1], which allows handheld mobile devices to share their screen contents with larger-sized display devices (e.g., smart TVs). Such screen sharing capabilities allow various multimedia files to be easily accessed through mobile platforms, and played (in real-time) through larger screens; thus, has the potential to enable a variety of attractive entertainment applications. While widely available on all Android-based mobile devices (4.2 or recent), the Miracast standards introduce a significant level of inefficiency as it deals with different types of multimedia contents.
