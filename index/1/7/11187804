The real world of design automation is overflowing with innovative ideas, challenges, and accomplishments. In this fast-moving world, however, there are also many frustrations, tedious tasks, limitations of machines, inadequacy of languages, and scarcity of human resources. This panel session has been designed to bring into focus some of the key issues which we face today as managers, software designers, and system users.
 At the 1978 Design Automation Conference, there was a panel discussion entitled “The Real World of Design Automation or A Funny Thing Happened on the the Way to Implementation.” In that session we brought to light several topics covering various phases of implementation in the system design process. Some of the areas discussed were: Justification vs Reality, Batch vs Interaction, Design of a DA System, User-Oriented Systems, Data Base Management, and Portability.
