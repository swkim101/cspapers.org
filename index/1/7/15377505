The paper deals with the problem of development the multilevel control algorithms for six-legged automatic walker, which provide the walker with the possibility to analyse the terrain, profile before it while moving over rough terrain, and to synthesize adequate, rather reasonable kinematics of body and legs for walker's locomotion along the route and climbing over obstacles on its way. DC simulation and analysis of walker's model moving image on DC display screen make it possible to evaluate the algorithms developed and to find ways for their improvement.
