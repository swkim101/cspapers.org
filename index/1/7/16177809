Friction along the Bowden-cable transmission degenerates control performance unless it is properly compensated. Friction is produced when the bending angle of the Bowden-cable changes as the relative position of the actuator and the end-effector changes. This study proposes a method, termed loop routing, to compensate friction along the Bowden-cable. Loop routing involves making a one-round loop along the sheath that continuously maintains the sheath's bending angle at 2Ï€ regardless of the end-effector's position in 2-D space. This minimizes the bending angle change of the sheath as the end-effector translates in a 3-D workspace, which minimizes the friction change and enables feedforward friction compensation of the Bowden-cable without employing a sensor. An experiment in open-loop tension control of the Bowden-cable was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that the output tension follows the reference tension well, with an RMS error of 4.3% and a peak error of 13.3% of maximum reference.
