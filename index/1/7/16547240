This paper presents a new approach to control gaits of humanoid bipedal robots in the operational space. This strategy based on the homogeneous transformation matrices integrates, in a unified representation, the structural aspects of the robot, the reference trajectories based on motion capture, the measures given by the robot sensors, the locomotion constraints and the high-level control using desired trajectories modified at each sample time. This approach is applied on a biped with flexible feet walking with an average speed equal to 1.2 m/s.
