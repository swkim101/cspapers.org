Multi-disciplinary shared care is based around a single, patient-centred health record. A key driver for storing that record electronically is the need to gather data once (for clinical care) and to reuse it for secondary purposes, including clinical studies. However, physicians working in different specialties may have different perspectives on that record, both when entering new data for clinical use and when reusing those data in clinical studies. The ORCHID classification scheme in use at the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the UK, is an ontology-based model which supports multiple, simultaneous clinical perspectives yet allows data to be stored as standard HL7 CDA documents in an immutable, patient-centred record. This paper describes the basic mechanisms used to support those multiple perspectives and the solution to specific problems of recording diagnosis with co-morbidities and recording different levels of detail in disease phenotypes.
