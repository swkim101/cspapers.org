While UIMSs and other tools are advancing as cost-effective ways of producing interfaces, attention to usability is rarely incorporated. Producing interfaces more rapidly without addressing their quality is of limited worth. We present a tool, IDEAL (Interface Design Environment and Analysis Lattice), that encourages and enables user-centered design as an integral part of the interface development process. IDEAL integrates usability engineering techniques and behavioral task representations with a graphical hierarchy of associated benchmark tasks to support formative evaluation of an evolving user interface. Empirical evaluation showed IDEAL to be useful for managing the formative evaluation techniques currently performed manually.
