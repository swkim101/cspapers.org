This paper presents a system of multiple coordinating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) that can localize and track a shark tagged with an acoustic transmitter. Each AUV is equipped with a stereo-hydrophone system that provides measurements of the relative bearing to the transmitter, as well as an acoustic modem that allows for inter-AUV communication and hence cooperative shark state estimation and decentralized tracking control. Online state estimation of the shark's state is performed using a Particle Filter in which measurements are shared between AUVs. The decentralized control system enables the AUVs to circumnavigate a dynamic target, (i.e. the estimated shark location). Each AUV circles the target by tracking circles of different radii and at different phase angles with respect to the target so as to obtain simultaneous sensor vantage points and minimize chance of AUV collision. A series of experiments using two AUVs were conducted in Big Fisherman's Cove in Santa Catalina Island, CA and demonstrated the ability to track a tagged leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata). The performance of the tracking was compared to standard manual tracking performed using an directional hydrophone operated by a researcher in a boat. In an additional experiment, the AUVs tracked an acoustic tag attached to the tracking boat to quantify the error of the state estimation of the system.
