This paper presents an implemented approach to robotic tasks involving intermittent contact and changing dynamics in uncertain environments. The approach is to use global planning to find paths in a tesselated representation of the environment, and a set of local controllers to take into account possibly time varying dynamics. The important difference from conventional path-planning in robotic tasks is how this approach uses local sensory information, and the important difference from reactive or behavior-based approaches is that the local controllers are learnt from simulation models or actual trials and are not programmed in a-priori.
