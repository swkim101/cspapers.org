Text classification is the process of classifying documents into predefined categories based on their content. Existing supervised learning algorithms to automatically classify text need sufficient labeled documents to learn accurately. Applying the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to this problem is an alternative approach that utilizes a large pool of unlabeled documents to augment the available labeled documents. Unfortunately, the time needed to learn with these large unlabeled documents is too high. This paper introduces a novel parallel learning algorithm for text classification task. The parallel algorithm is based on the combination of the EM algorithm and the naive Bayes classifier. Our goal is to improve the computational time in learning and classifying process. We studied the performance of our parallel algorithm on a large Linux PC cluster called PIRUN Cluster. We report both timing and accuracy results. These results indicate that the proposed parallel algorithm is capable of handling large document collections.
