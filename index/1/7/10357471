Communication complexity has al~vays been an important issue Ivhen designing group key distribution systems. This paper systematically studies \vhat can be achieved for the most common measures of protocol complexity. Lo\ver bounds for the total number of messages, the total number of exchanges, and the number of necwsary rounds are established, ~vherebymodels that allo~vbroadcasting have to be distinguished from those that do not. For every measure of protocol complexity, we furthermore show that the corresponding bound is realistic for DiffieHellmau-based prot~ COISby referring to or introducing protocols that match the bound or exceed it by only one.
