In this paper we outline the design and implementation of the eDialogos Consensus process and platform to support wide-scale collaborative decision making. We present the design space and choices made and perform a conceptual alignement of the domains this space entails, based on the use of the eDialogos Consensus ontology as a crystallization point for platform design and implementation as well as interoperability with existing solutions. We also present a metric for calculating agreement on the issues under debate in the platform, incorporating argumentation structure and user feedback.
