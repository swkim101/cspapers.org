Omnidirectional cameras are well suited for maneuvering tasks due to to their large field of view. We mounted two catadioptric cameras on a vehicle and provide the driver with a bird's-eye view of the surrounding area behind the vehicle as well as the area on the left and right hand side. In order to enlarge the field of view of the bird's-eye view image, we will show an extension to the bird's-eye view image that provides a larger field of view and thus simplifies challenging maneuvering tasks. An overlay onto the resulting image shows the motion path of the vehicle while reversing. This motion path is connected to the steering angle. The driver can easily see where the vehicle will move when the steering angle is not changed throughout the movement.
