Haptic modality is one of the most important considerations in man-machine communication. The present paper introduces a personal identification technique based on force information of finger tracing that can be used for advanced man-machine communication systems. Calculation time is evaluated to determine whether the method is appropriate for real-time systems. Compared to other biometric methods, the proposed method has the advantage of high security due to the non-visible nature of force information. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.
