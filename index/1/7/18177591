As we are well aware, there has been a significant nationwide decline in enrollment for computer science programs, as well as other STEM fields. One of the primary reasons the lack of participation and diversity in the STEM fields is becoming increasingly important is the potentially adverse effect it may have on the U.S. work force. Many successful programs have been put in place to combat this decline. But how do the small regional universities with limited resources and a limited "audience" (with limited resources) contribute to the field? In this paper we will discuss the mechanisms that may be implemented for smaller schools to address the decline in CS enrollment. This includes the ability to put in place programs which could allow more educators to become a part of the solution.
