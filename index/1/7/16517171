Traversability analysis is an important aspect of autonomous navigation in robotics. In this paper, we relate the idea of traversability to safety and ease of road usage by defining a novel sensor-data driven metric called Road Traversability Index (RTI). The RTI translate the geometric interaction of vehicle with road into a distance modulated index that can be used as advice for a human driver or an autonomous agent intending to traverse a particular road segment using a specific vehicle. We present a framework in which 3D sensor data is converted into a road model, which in turn is converted into a roadmap based motion planning graph to represent the underlying configuration space. The RTI is defined as a function of the roadmap by axiomatically satisfying all required properties of road traversability. We have tested our algorithmic framework on simulated scenarios to explore safety; and real-world data sets to discover aspects of traversability for vehicles of various types. Experimental results show that RTI is a practical tool that reveals information that may be hidden to human inspection or other methods of assessment that do not explicitly model a vehicle.
