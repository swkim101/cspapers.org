The problem of time series prediction is studied within the uniform convergence framework of Vapnik and Chervonenkis. The dependence inherent in the temporal structure is incorporated into the analysis, thereby generalizing the available theory for memoryless processes. Finite sample bounds are calculated in terms of covering numbers of the approximating class, and the tradeoff between approximation and estimation is discussed. A complexity regularization approach is outlined, based on Vapnik's method of Structural Risk Minimization, and shown to be applicable in the context of mixing stochastic processes.
