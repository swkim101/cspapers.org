The new interdisciplinary field of Data Mining emerged in the early 1990s as a response to the profusion of digital data generated in numerous fields such as biology, chemistry, astronomy, advertising, banking and finance, retail market, stock market, and the WWW. In this paper, I describe an undergraduate course in Data Mining offered at the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University in Spring of 2007 as a CSCI-317-upper-division "Topics in Computer Science"- course, entitled "Data Intelligence." One of the main objectives of the course was to engage students in experimental computing research through a number of carefully planned research activities resulting in better understanding of the course contents and deeper insights into the challenges faced by the data mining community.
