Recently, embedded sensor usage has increased thanks to the proliferation of hardware and software addressing resource constraints. While the increased usage is a good start, it is important to adopt good software engineering principles early for many reasons: simplified programming and deployment, improved reuse, and added efficiency. This poster presents SASSI, the Sliverware Architecture for Sensor System Integration, which provides a unique embedded sensor application architecture.
