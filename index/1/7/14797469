Today, pressured air and gas leaks are typically detected using in-situ sensor technology. In this contribution the application of passive IR-thermography is proposed to permit remote leak detection by assessing the resulting temperature profile disturbance due to expansion of pressured gas. Remote measurements are advantageous as they are easier and safer to conduct. Scanning high-rise objects can be achieved using a ground-bound system without requiring complex climbing. In the paper a novel method for automated leak detection by feature extraction and pattern recognition is presented. This enables autonomous mobile robots with remote leak detection capability.
