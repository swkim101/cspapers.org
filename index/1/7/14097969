A theory of indexing is presented and is based on viewing a document as constituted of components. A component may be chosen as any run of text unit that can be: (a) judged as to its relevancy property; and (b) considered as independent within the document. By looking at the constituent components of a document in relation to the universe of all components from the collection, we have been able to apply Bayes' decision theory to derive the index term representation for the document, as well as attaching an initial probabilistic weight for each term based on a Principle of Document Self-Recovery. It turns out that different choices of document components, such as a word or a whole abstract, can lead to different term weighting schemes that have been introduced before and are based on probability considerations; specifically, Edmundson and Wyllys' term significance formula, Sparck Jones' inverse document frequency, and later modified by Croft and Harper into the 'combination match' formula. Thus, a unified interpretation of various probabilistic term weighting schemes appears possible.
