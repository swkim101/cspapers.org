The purpose of our research is to investigate the feasibility of this methodology for distributed application development by examining possible approaches to carrying out such developments. In particular, our emphasis lies in transformation technology, wherein user-invoked source-to-source transformations are applied to the partitioned system for the purpose of optimizing the transactions required to effect the distributed behavior. In this way, the application downloading system need only produce a correct partitioning of the original program, not an efficient one. The user, with system guidance, optimizes the partitioned program by applying transformations chosen from the system library. Thus, application downloading can be viewed as a narrow domain in which to apply the transformation technology we have developed elsewhere in a broader context(1).
