We present a method for setting the pressure of multiple chambers using a single pressure source when they are interconnected via band-pass valves. These valves can be constructed from simple passive devices that behave like leaky check valves. We present the theory of operation and design parameters for individual valves, give a control strategy for serial connections of pressure chambers, and demonstrate the approach by building prototype valves and using them to control serially connected soft-robotic actuators from a single pressure source.
