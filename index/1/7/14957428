For the purpose of ergonomic human-machine interaction and geometrical design of hand held haptic devices, a kinematic model that represents the functional anatomy of different human hands is desired. It is the goal of this paper to present a kinematic hand model that is based on human physiology and that is easily adaptable to represent various real human hand sizes. This is achieved by exploiting body proportions to derive finger segment lengths from the hand length. A partial hand model validation, involving index- and middle finger validation using a group of subjects, indicates that the use of body proportions offers a good estimate of finger length from a given hand length. Model estimated fingertip positions over a motion trajectory remain within reasonable limits when compared with experimental data for this subject group. The model is promising for usage in practical situations since only hand length, which is easy to measure or to obtain from literature, is required as an input. Phalange lengths, which are sparsely available from literature and difficult to measure, are generated by the model.
