The problem finds numerous applications in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing settings where only partial or distant supervision is available. We present a novel method for optimizing multivariate performance measures in the MIML setting. Our approach MIML-perf uses a novel plug-in technique and offers a seamless way to optimize a vast variety of performance measures such as macro and micro-F measure, average precision, which are performance measures of choice in multi-label learning domains. MIML-perf offers two key benefits over the state of the art. Firstly, across a diverse range of benchmark tasks, ranging from relation extraction to text categorization and scene classification, MIML-perf offers superior performance as compared to state of the art methods designed specifically for these tasks. Secondly, MIML-perf operates with significantly reduced running times as compared to other methods, often by an order of magnitude or more.
