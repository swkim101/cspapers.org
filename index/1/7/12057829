This paper contains a description of MODeLeR, a Multimedia Object Design Learning Resource. The impetus for the creation of MODeLeR was to provide an authentic learning environment for the study of object-oriented design to augment intermediate level programming classes. The Resource affords active, collaborative learning experiences in object modeling with the goal of helping students to gain design capabilities in UML and to appreciate the need for design that they often do not perceive since the programs they write are relatively small. Students typically create several different UML diagrams. This paper describes the MODeLeR environment and a pilot study in its use. This paper contains results of both a quantitative study and a qualitative evaluation of the Resource.
