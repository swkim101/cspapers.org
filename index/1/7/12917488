Question answering (Q&A) websites are now large repositories of valuable knowledge. While most Q&A sites were initially aimed at providing useful answers to the question asker, there has been a marked shift towards question answering as a community-driven knowledge creation process whose end product can be of enduring value to a broad audience. As part of this shift, specific expertise and deep knowledge of the subject at hand have become increasingly important, and many Q&A sites employ voting and reputation mechanisms as centerpieces of their design to help users identify the trustworthiness and accuracy of the content.
 To better understand this shift in focus from one-off answers to a group knowledge-creation process, we consider a question together with its entire set of corresponding answers as our fundamental unit of analysis, in contrast with the focus on individual question-answer pairs that characterized previous work. Our investigation considers the dynamics of the community activity that shapes the set of answers, both how answers and voters arrive over time and how this influences the eventual outcome. For example, we observe significant assortativity in the reputations of co-answerers, relationships between reputation and answer speed, and that the probability of an answer being chosen as the best one strongly depends on temporal characteristics of answer arrivals. We then show that our understanding of such properties is naturally applicable to predicting several important quantities, including the long-term value of the question and its answers, as well as whether a question requires a better answer. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the design of Q&A sites.
