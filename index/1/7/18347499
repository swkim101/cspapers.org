Personal construct theory is one of the important tools for knowledge acquisition. It provides an expert’s opinion of the relationship between objects and their properties in the form of a repertory grid. The current techniques provide the repertory grid in the form of a matrix of integers. This paper describes the preliminary attempts for elicitation and analysis of repertory grid using a range of integers for each relationship. Such an elicitation leads to a more natural description of the expert’s knowledge in addition to a better user interface.
