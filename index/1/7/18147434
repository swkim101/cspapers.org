Mid-air gestures offer a promising way to interact with large public displays. User representations are important to attract people to such displays, convey interactivity and provide meaningful gesture feedback. We evaluated two forms of user representation, an abstract skeleton and a silhouette, at a large public information display. Results from 56 days, with 190 sessions involving 483 detected people, indicate the silhouette attracted more passers-by to interact and, of these, more engaged in serious browsing interactions. By contrast, the skeleton representation had more playful interactions. Our work contributes to the understanding of the implications of these choices of user representation.
