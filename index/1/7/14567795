Kuratowski’s Theorem states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a homeomorph of K3,3 or K5. For this reason, homeomorphs of either K3,3 or 1{5 are called Kuratowski homeomorphs. Because of the connection with planarity, there haa been much interest in algorithms that find Kuratowski homeomorphs in non-planar graphs. One can check whether a graph contains a Kuratowski homeomorph in linear time by well-known planarity testing algorithms [HT74]. Williamson [Wi184] provided a linear-time algorithm to extract a Kuratowski homeomorph from a non-planar graph. Asano [Asa85] (see also Kaschube [Kas84]) provided a linear-time algorithm to test whether a graph contains a homeomorph of K3,3. Fellows and Kaschube [FK] have obtained a linear algorithm that constructs a K3,3 homeomorph when one is present. Khuller, Mitchell, and Vazirani [KMV89] describe parallel algorithms to find Kuratowski homeomorphs and K3,3 homeomorphs, when such homeomorphs are present. In this paper, we present both sequential and parallel algorithms to find a K5 minor. If a K5 minor exists, the algorithm returns the branch sets of a K5 minor. The sequential algorithm runs in 0(n2) time, while the parallel algorithm uses 0(n3a(n, n)/ log n) processors and 0(log2 n) time on a CRCW PRAM. The sequential algorithm complements Asano’s K3,3 homeomorph algorithm, while the parallel algorithm uses the parallel algorithms of Khuller et al. [KMV89]. Although Robertson and Seymour [RS86] have presented a general 0(n3) fixed-H minor-testing algorithm, their algorithm cent ains large constants and so is far from practical. There is much interest in finding practical algorithms to test for minors, and it is an interesting open question whether general fixed-graph minor-testing is in NC. We present practical and efficient algorithms. This suggests that there are indeed practical sequential and parallel algorithms for minor-
