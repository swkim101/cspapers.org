A system of computer programs which aid in generating and validating logic circuit tests is described. Easy to use and available on a time-share computer, the system includes: 1) a preprocessor that translates a logic topology from a simple input language to binary (machine readable) form and determines indistinguishable fault sets, 2) an automatic test sequence generator for combinational circuits, and 3) a fault simulator for asynchronous sequential circuits. The faults considered are those causing any single wire branch to be fixed at logic 0 or fixed at logic 1. Wires which fan-out are simulated with independent faults on each fan-out branch as well as with faults common to all the fan-outs. Gates are simulated with unit delay and are allowed three possible logic values—0, 1 and “don't know”. “Don't know” is the starting value on every gate, representing the uncertainty of internal states when power is applied to a circuit. “Don't know” is also used to settle critical races and oscillations.
