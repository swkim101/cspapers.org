Most telepresence robots have a fixed-size body, and are unable to change the camera or display position. Therefore, although making eye contact is important in human expression, current fixed-size telepresence robots fail to achieve this. We propose a novel telepresence robot called ScalableBody, which enables users to make eye contact during conversations by changing its height. ScalableBody extends its body to modify the position of its camera or display. This approach provides eye contacts in remote conversations, thus creating almost same situation when the remote and local users make conversation like a real meeting. As for the remote users, this approach also enables them to experience having a conversation from different heights, such as being a giant or a dwarf. This technique extends the possibilities of remote communication by telepresence robots.
