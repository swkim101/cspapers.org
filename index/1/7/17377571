Recently, there has been a trend towards developing low level vision models based on an analysis of the mapping of a three dimensional scene into a two dimensional image. Emphasis has been placed on recovering precise metric spatial information about the scene. While we agree with this approach, we suggest that more attention be paid to what should be computed. Pschophysical scaling, adaptation, and direct determination of higher order relations may be as useful in the perception of spatial layout as in other perceptual domains. When applied to computer vision systems, such processes may reduce dependance on overly specific scene constraints.
