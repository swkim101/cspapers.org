Given the ubiquity of multimedia technology, it is important that Computer Science students not only learn the basics of multimedia design, but also gain hands-on experience with applications of the technology. This paper describes the integration of multimedia concepts and tools into a Computer Science curriculum. An NSF-sponsored Multimedia Laboratory was established and used to support three senior-level courses: software engineering, computer graphics, and computer networks. Curriculum development, laboratory exercises, and the role of projects are described.
