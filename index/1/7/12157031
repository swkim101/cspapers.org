In this experiment, seven software teams developed versions of the same small-size (2000-4000 source instruction) application software product. Four teams used the Specifying approach. Three teams used the Prototyping approach.
 The main results of the experiment were:
 Prototyping yielded products with roughly equivalent performance, but with about 40% less code and 45% less effort.
 The prototyped products rated somewhat lower on functionality and robustness, but higher on ease of use and ease of learning.
 Specifying produced more coherent designs and software that was easier to integrate.
 The paper presents the experimental data supporting these and a number of additional conclusions.
