A Compiler Directed Memory Management Policy for numerical programs is described in this paper. The high level source codes of numerical programs contain useful information which can be used by a compiler to determine the memory requirements of a program. Using this information, the compiler can insert some directives into the operating system for effective management of the memory hierarchy. During the program's execution the operating system dynamically allocates to a program the space it requires as specified by the received directive. The new policy is compared with LRU and WS policies. Empirical results presented in this paper sliow that the CD policy can out-perform LRU and WS by a wide margin.
