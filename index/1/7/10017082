This paper introduces the KyotoEBMT Example-Based Machine Translation framework. Our system uses a tree-to-tree approach, employing syntactic dependency analysis for both source and target languages in an attempt to preserve non-local structure. The effectiveness of our system is maximized with online example matching and a flexible decoder. Evaluation demonstrates BLEU scores competitive with state-of-the-art SMT systems such as Moses. The current implementation is intended to be released as open-source in the near future.
