Previous works on buflcx allocation are based f~il$lwr exclusively on the availability of buffers at r{ll)timc or on the access pat t eras of queries. In this paper We p repose a unified approach for buffer allocation in which both of these considerations are taken into accou at. Our approach is based on the notion of marginal y~~ins which specify the expected reduction cm page faults in allocating extra buffers to a query. Simulation results show that our approach is promising, and allocation algorithms based on marginal gains perform cousidwably better than existing onâ€™es.
