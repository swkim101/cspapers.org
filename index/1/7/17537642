Bringing mechanically compliant joints to robots is in the focus of interest world wide, especially in the humanoid robotics community. Variable Stiffness Joints (VSJ) promise to gain a high performing and robust robotic system. The presented DLR Floating Spring Joint (FSJ) is a VSJ module designed for the first 4 axes of the anthropomorphic DLR Hand Arm System. The DLR Hand Arm System aims to match the skills of its natural archetype. For this purpose, the joints have to be extremely compact to fit into the arm. At the same time they require a high power density in order to approximate the human arm skills. The new DLR FSJ is designed completely from an energy based point of view. This addresses not only energy efficient components and low friction design, but also that the potential energy of the spring is used as good as possible. A demonstration of robustness is given by the investigation of a blunt impact to the tip of the arm.
