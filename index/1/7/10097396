We present a new release of OpenDial, an open-source toolkit for building and evaluating spoken dialogue systems. The toolkit relies on an information-state architecture where the dialogue state is represented as a Bayesian network and acts as a shared memory for all system modules. The domain models are specified via probabilistic rules encoded in XML. OpenDial has been deployed in several application domains such as human‚Äêrobot interaction, intelligent tutoring systems and multi-modal in-car driver assistants.
