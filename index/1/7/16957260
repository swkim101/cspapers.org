Waiting in a long queue is a cause of stress which affects people's life, work, and so on. The purpose of this paper is to avoid queues of restaurant during lunch time. To achieve the purpose, we develop a Qviz system which is able to visualize queues of remote restaurants. Users can ask for queue information of any restaurants by using a Qviz client which is implemented on smartphones. By applying a Markov process on historical movement, Qviz server predicts futuristic movement of users and selects potential reporters for the requested restaurant. We have implemented the Qviz system to validate the feasibility as well as usefulness of the system.
