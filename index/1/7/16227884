Memoryless inference controls are an important class of inference control methods for on-line statistical databases. Other inference controls are usually too complex to use in on-line systems. A subclass of memoryless inference controls which have been shown to require a reasonable level of computation are table level controls. Table level controls described in the literature make some assumptions about the structure of the database OH which they are used. We formalize these assumptions as database restrictions, and formally prove that these table level controls provide an accurate measure of the identification risk of a query. In addition we extend Lhcse controls to account for interdependence among attributes.
