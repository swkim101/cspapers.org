In recent years, the growing belief that the current IP-based Internet is becoming obsolete prompted several research efforts that aim to design potential next-generation Internet architectures. Named Data Networking (NDN), an instantiation of the content-centric approach, is one such effort. In contrast with their IP counterparts, NDN routers maintain a significant amount of state information. In this paper, we investigate the use of this feature for covert ephemeral communication (CEC). CEC allows two or more parties to covertly exchange ephemeral messages, i.e., messages that become unavailable after a certain amount of time. Our techniques rely only on network-layer services. This makes our protocols robust, and stealthy communication -- difficult to detect. We show that users can build high-bandwidth CEC channels by exploiting features unique to NDN: in-network caches, routers' forwarding state and name matching rules. We assess feasibility and performance of identified CEC channels using a local setup and the official NDN testbed.
