Classification is a famous branch of machine learning. We have tried many ways to invent and improve algorithms to get better results from given data. However, few have been done on how to revise data to adapt machine learning. In this paper, the same classifiers are implemented on same object sets which are different in the granularity of classification to show different classification can make great difference in the quality of classification first. Then the development of knowledge-base is studied. At last, a progressive knowledge acquisition method is advanced inspired by humanâ€™s cognition behavior.
