Integrating a distributed software system using publically available software services saves effort, time, and cost. One key step in this process is the service selection which identifies a relevant set of services for this integration. In an open service marketplace, it is hard to judge the trust of software services using a static view (consisting of service specifications) published by their developers. Instead, the concepts of trust in the context of services needs to be properly quantified, specified, negotiated, and then used in the selection process. Prevalent service selection and negotiation approaches do not consider the trust aspect of services. Trustworthy service representation, selection, and negotiation are challenging tasks due to the subjective and temporal nature of trust, lack of standards, and associated uncertainty. This proposal defines the trust of a service, quantifies the trust by monitoring and aggregating various evidences, represents the trust in the service specification and improves the service selection and negotiation process using this representation. Publically available software objects (from Java collection framework library) and mobile app services (from the Android marketplace) are used as datasets to empirically evaluate this proposal.
