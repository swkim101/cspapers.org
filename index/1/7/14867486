In a recent paper, Gould and Lewis (1983a) argued for the importance of four key principles in computer system design. These principles are: early focus on users, interactive design, empirical measurement, and iterative design. Gould and Lewis also express their belief that these principles are essential to successful design and refer to an example of their use (Gould and Lewis, 1983b). It is the purpose of this paper to report another example of how these principles played a major role and proved their worth in the design of a successful system.
