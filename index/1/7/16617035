A conjecture by Bollobás and Komlós states that for every γ > 0 and integers <i>r</i> ≥ 2 and Δ, there exists β > 0 such that for sufficiently large <i>n</i> the following holds: If <i>G</i> is a graph on <i>n</i> vertices with minimum degree at least (r-1/r+γ)<i>n</i> and <i>H</i> is an <i>r</i>-chromatic graph on <i>n</i> vertices with bandwidth at most Β<i>n</i> and maximum degree at most Δ, then <i>G</i> contains a copy of <i>H</i>. This conjecture generalises several results concerning sufficient degree conditions for the containment of spanning subgraphs. We prove the conjecture for the case <i>r</i> = 3. Our proof yields a polynomial time algorithm for embedding <i>H</i> into <i>G</i> if <i>H</i> is given together with a 3-colouring and vertex labelling respecting the bandwidth bound.
