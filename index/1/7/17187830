The highly dynamic nature of online commenting environments makes accurate ratings prediction for new comments challenging. In such a setting, in addition to exploiting comments with high predicted ratings, it is also critical to explore comments with high uncertainty in the predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm called LOGUCB that balances exploration with exploitation when the average rating of a comment is modeled using logistic regression on its features. At the core of our LOGUCB algorithm lies a novel variance approximation technique for the Bayesian logistic regression model that is used to compute the UCB value for each comment. In experiments with a real-life comments dataset from Yahoo! News, we show that LOGUCB with bag-of-words and topic features outperforms state-of-the-art explore-exploit algorithms.
