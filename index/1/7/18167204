Sliding is one of the basic touchscreen operations, but is mainly used for scrolling in mobile touchscreen GUIs. As a way to share sliding operations among scrolling and other GUI functions, we propose Slack-Scroll. We implemented two application scenarios of Slack-Scroll, and asserted their feasibility in a user study. All participants could accept and adapt well to the new techniques enabled by Slack-Scroll.
