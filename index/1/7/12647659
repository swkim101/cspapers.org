The spectacular success of MIMO systems may be attributed to the fact that the MIMO capacity increases linearly with the number of transmit antennas, provided that the number of receive antennas is equal to the number of transmit antennas. With the further proviso that the total transmit power is increased proportionately to the number of transmit antennas, a linear - rather than logarithmic - capacity increase is achieved upon increasing the transmit power [1, 2]
