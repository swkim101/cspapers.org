Static computation of the worst-case reaction time (WCRT) is required for the real-time execution of synchronous programs. Existing approaches use model checking or integer linear programming. we formulate this as an abstraction-based reachability analysis yielding a lower worst case complexity. Benchmarking shows a significant overall speed-up of 64-times over existing approaches.
