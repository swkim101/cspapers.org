We introduce a waveband cross-connect architecture that utilizes small-scale waveband selective switches to make the best use of present optical switch technologies and exploit coarse granular optical routing for large capacity optical path networks. We then propose an appropriate network design algorithm for the coarse granular routing optical path networks utilizing the developed node architecture. Numerical experiments proved that applying the small-scale waveband selective switch-based node architecture offers a significant switch scale reduction. Impact of waveband capacity selection on the overall switch scale reduction also investigated.
