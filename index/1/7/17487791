Recent work has shown that average precision can be accurately estimated from a small random sample of judged documents. Unfortunately, such "random pools" cannot be used to evaluate retrieval measures in any standard way. In this work, we show that given such estimates of average precision, one can accurately infer the relevances of the remaining unjudged documents, thus obtaining a fully judged pool that can be used in standard ways for system evaluation of all kinds. Using TREC data, we demonstrate that our inferred judged pools are well correlated with assessor judgments, and we further demonstrate that our inferred pools can be used to accurately infer precision recall curves and all commonly used measures of retrieval performance.
