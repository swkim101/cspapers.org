We present a new method of fitting an element-free volumetric model to a sequence of deforming surfaces of a moving object. Given a sequence of visual hulls, we iteratively fit an element-free elastic model to the visual hull in order to extract the optimal pose of the captured volume. The fitting of the volumetric model is acheived by minimizing a combination of elastic potential energy, a surface distance measure, and a self-intersection penalty for each frame. A unique aspect of our work is that the model is mesh free - since the model is represented as a point cloud, it is easy to construct, manipulate and update the model as needed. Additionally, linear elasicity with rotation compensation makes it possible to handle local deformations and large rotations of body parts much more efficiently than other volume fitting approaches. Our experimental results for volume fitting and capture in a multi-view camera setting demonstrate the robustness of element-free elastic models against noise and self-occlusions.
