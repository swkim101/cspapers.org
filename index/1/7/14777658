In organized health care, primary care is the first level. It is characterized by the wide span of health problems managed as well as remote location from traditional medical information and knowledge sources. The LIMEDS project has formulated the special requirements for integrated knowledge and data base management in primary care. This paper presents Gösta's book, a hypertext knowledge base implemented in LINCKS, an object oriented, networked database system. Firstly, aspects which make integrated hypermedia systems particularly suitable for application in primary health care are explored. We then describe the hypertext knowledge base, consisting of 500 basic text objects and 3000 links, and current implementations using the NODE data model. NODE is implemented on a SUN III fileserver, and the user interface for the hypertext context on Apple Macintosh (TM). Combination of design methods towards a parallel means-ends strategy was found to be necessary to achieve Gösta's book. Design groups need to be composed of computer science, medical, psychological and organizational competences.
