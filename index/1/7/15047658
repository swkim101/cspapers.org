RAPID is a design environment to support human factors specialists in designing user interfaces for small control panels. RAPID permits modeling of both the appearance and behavior of operator interfaces. Its main goal is to allow exploration of a greater number of design alternatives by decreasing the time and effort required to generate and evaluate those alternatives. It is a graphically-based system intended to be used by non-programmers. RAPID is implemented in Smalltalk-80.
