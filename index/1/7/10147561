We present a new estimator for counting the number of solutions of a Boolean satisfiability problem as a part of an importance sampling framework. The estimator uses the recently introduced SampleSearch scheme that is designed to overcome the rejection problem associated with distributions having a substantial amount of determinism. We show here that the sampling distribution of SampleSearch can be characterized as the backtrack-free distribution and propose several schemes for its computation. This allows integrating Sample-Search into the importance sampling framework for approximating the number of solutions and also allows using Sample-Search for computing a lower bound measure on the number of solutions. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our new approximate counting schemes against recent competing approaches.
