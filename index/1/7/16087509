This paper addresses the problem of state assignment for large Finite State Machines (FSM). This is an important problem in the high performance digital system design where added functionality often comes at the expense of a larger (and slower) FSM to control the system. We present a new method to solve the graph embedding problem which is the main step in the state assignment process. The basic idea is to place the state adjacency graph in a two-dimensional grid while minimizing the total wire length. The grid is then mapped into an n-dimensional hypercube while nearly preserving the adjacency relations that is with dilation at most 2. Experimental results are presented and compared with those of NOVA.
