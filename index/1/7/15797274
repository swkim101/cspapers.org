The retrieval of sentences is a core task within Information Retrieval. In this poster we employ a Language Model that incorporates a prior which encodes the importance of sentences within the retrieval model. Then, in a set of comprehensive experiments using the TREC Novelty Tracks, we show that including this prior substantially improves retrieval effectiveness, and significantly outperforms the current state of the art in sentence retrieval.
