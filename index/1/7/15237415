Learners use software for different reasons and with differentskills and motivations than other users. Using concepts of learner-centered design (LCD), we developed a user interface for supporting learners as they use digital information resources in inquiry-based science classrooms. Learner needs are categorized in five areas: content knowledge, technology knowledge, strategic and metacognitive lmowledge, and motivation Results of research on problems encountered by students as they engage in information seeking are used as the basis for applying LCD, by identifying some specific problem areas learners encounter engaging in a process, generating search terms, staying on task, and evahmting information. Solutions offered through the Artemis interface are described.
