Most previous MIL algorithms, which tackle classification problems, consider each instance as a represented feature. Although the algorithms work well in some prediction problems, considering diverse features to represent an instance may provide more significant information for learning task. Moreover, since each instance may be mapped into diverse feature spaces, encountering a large number of irrelevant or redundant features is inevitable. In this paper, we propose a method to select relevant instances and concurrently consider multiple features for each instance, which is termed as MIL-MFS. MIL-MFS is based on multiple kernel learning (MKL), and it iteratively selects the fusing multiple features for classifier training. Experimental results show that the MIL-MFS combined with multiple kernel learning can significantly improve the classification performance.
