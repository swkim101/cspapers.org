Public displays are becoming increasingly commonplace, yet recent studies place the effectiveness and user acceptance of them into doubt. This paper motivates the need for a new class of display technology that can more effectively blend with its environment and introduces the concept of self-organizing emergent displays as a vehicle to achieving this. The paper goes on to briefly describe Firefly, a prototype emergent display system, and evaluate its scalability, effectiveness, and user acceptance through experimental analysis and a field trial.
