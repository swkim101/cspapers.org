Power line inspection and maintenance are fields of application where robotics has yet to be introduced. However, as in many other hostile environments, substantial benefits in terms of workers safety and quality of inspection results could arise. This paper describes one of the latest initiatives toward that goal by presenting the design of a teleoperated robot called the "LineScout". This moving platform has the capacity to cross obstacles found on the line. Special care was taken early in the design phase to account for the context of power utility operation and to customize the geometric parameters to the specific features of the electric power network. The final prototype incorporates several key mechanical design features, which are briefly described. The LineScout is now validated, fully tested and ready to undertake pilot projects.
