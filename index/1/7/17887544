This paper deals with three aspects of algebraic complexity. The first section is concerned with lower bounds on the number of operations required to compute several functions. Several theorems are presented and their proofs sketched. The second section deals with relationships among the complexities of several sets of functions. In the third section, several matrices of general interest are examined and upper bounds on the number of operations required to multiply by them are constructively derived.
