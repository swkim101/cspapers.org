Let M be a matroid on m elements and let r be its rank. We show that any vector in the integer cone of the incidence vectors of bases of M can be written as nonnegative integer combination of at most r e + r 1 incidence vectors of bases of M, and these can be determined in oracle-polynomial time. 1 P r o b l e m S p e c i f i c a t i o n Let H be a set of vectors in ~,n. Let cone(H), la t(H), and hat.cone(H) denote the cone, the lattice, and the integer cone generated by the vectors in H, respectively. We have the following containment: hat.cone(H ) C_ cone(H) n iat(H). The set H is called a Hilbert base if equality holds. Thus, a set of vectors forms a Hilbert basis if any vector which can be written both as their nonnegative combination and their integer combination can also be written as their nonnegative integer combination. The Carathgodory rank of a Hilbert base H is the least integer t such that any vector ha the integer cone generated by the vectors in H can be written as a nonnegative integer combination of at most t vectors in H. Tutte [14] and, independently, Nash-Williams [11] established a necessary and sufficient condition under which a given graph has k edge-disjoint spanning trees. I t is a consequence of this condition that incidence vectors of spanning trees of a graph form a Hilbert Base. THEOREM 1. (TUTTE [14], NASH-WILLIAMS [11]) A graph G = (V, E) has k edge-disjoint spanning trees if and only if, for every partition (V1,V2, . . . ,Vs) of V , the number of edges joining vertices in distinct parts is at least k(s 1). | If M is a matroid on a set E, we denote the rank of a subset S C_ E by r(S) . It follows from Edmonds' generalization of Theorem 1, the so-called Matroid Partit ion Theorem, that incidence vectors of the bases of a Matroid do form a Hilbert Base. ~ a r c h partially supported by FAPESP (96/045052), MCT/FINEP (PRONEX project 107/97), and CNPq (Proc. 300805/94-2). tInstituto de Matem~.tica e Estatfstica, Universidade de S~o Paulo Rua do MatZo 1010, 05508-900 SÂ£o Paulo Brazil.

II The problem we consider is related to a question posed by Cunningham [5]. Let M be a matroid. What is the least integer t such tha t any vector w in the integer cone of incidence vectors of bases of M can be written as a nonnegative integer combination of at most t incidence vector of bases of M? Cunningham [5] showed that his algorithm for testing membership in matroid polyhedra gives an upper bound of m 4 + 1 for t, where m is the number of elements in M. Cook, Fonlupt and Schrijver [4] have proved the following integer analogue of Carath~odory's Theorem (for undefined terms see Schrijver [12]). THEOREM 3. (COOK, FONLUPT, AND SCHRIJVER [4]) Let H C 7/, m be a Hibert base generating a pointed cone. I f w E int.cone(H) then w is the nonnegative integer combination of at most 2m 1 vectors in H. | The previous theorem implies that the Carath~odory rank of any Hilbert base H generating a pointed cone is at most 2m 1. Seb6 [13] has shown that this upper bound of 2 m 1 can be improved to 2m 2 and conjectured tha t the actual upper bound is m (this bound is the best possible). Seb6's conjecture is also called the Integral Carathdodory Conjecture and it has recently been disproved by Bruns, Gubeladze, Henk, Martin, and Weismantel [3]. (For an updated discussion on this and others related conjectures see also Bouvier and Gonzalez-Sprinberg [1], Bruns and Gubeladze [2], and Firla and Ziegler [9].) In particular, as the incidence vectors of the bases of a matroid form a Hilbert base generating a pointed cone, Seb6's result implies the upper bound of 2m 2 for Carath~odory rank of any Hilbert bases arising from bases of a matroid. We present the following result. THEOREM 4. Let M be a matroid on a set E with m elements and let w be a vector in the integer cone generated by the incidence vectors of the bases of M . Then w can be written as a nonnegative integer combination
