As a result of analyzing the art of computer program development, new skills are being suggested to improve programming efficiency. Two of these skills are the use of structured programming and the ability to work as a member of a team (Khailany and Saxon, 1978). The benefits gained from employing these skills in an educational setting (Cheney, 1977; Lemos, 1978; Weinberg, 1971) and in commercial areas (Baker and Mills, 1973; Schonberger and Franz, 1978) have been discussed in the literature.
 Team programming involves the process of one's peers inspecting one's work for errors, ideas, and design methods in order to improve productivity and learning. The group technique is being applied to programming in industrial settings and is advocated for educational settings as one approach to improving programming.
