The MultiModal Interface Language formalism (MMIL) is a modalityindependent high-level semantic representation language. It has been used in different projects, related to different domains, and with distinct tasks and interaction modes. MMIL is a metamodel that enables the definition of generic and domain specific descriptors to dialogue management, offering flexibility and high reusability. This paper presents the results of our experimentation with MMIL in diverse projects as well as the recent specifications that cover extensible thematic roles and complex linguistic phenomena.
