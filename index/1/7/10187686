Can new interfaces contribute to social and environmental improvement? For all the care, wit and brilliance that UIST innovations can contribute, can they actually make things better - better in the sense of public good - not merely lead to easier to use or more efficient consumer goods? This talk will explore the impact of interface technology on society and the environment, and examine engineered systems that invite participation, document change over time, and suggest alternative courses of action that are ethical and sustainable, drawing on examples from a diverse series of experimental designs and site-specific work Natalie has created throughout her career.
