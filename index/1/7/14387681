A one semester, upper-division undergraduate course in compiler techniques is described. The course is based upon the material contained in Chapter 5 of the text Algorithms + Data Structures &equil; Programs, by Niklaus Wirth. The goals of the course are (1) to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of the design and translation of higher level languages, and (2) to provide an introductory exposure to the related literature. A compiler-writing project of about nine weeks duration is required of all students. Simulators supporting generated code for static and dynamic run-time environments are provided for student use.
