A precise and efficient tracking technique is essential for an intelligent vehicle to interact with the surrounding vehicles on the road. In this paper, we propose a model-based vehicle tracking method using the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) and scaling series particle filter (SSPF). To ensure that the accuracy and speed of the proposed method are better than those standard particle-based tracking methods, we introduce the latest sensor measurement into the motion estimate. A dynamic Bayesian network and its theoretical base are derived to support this improvement. To track the high-dimensional states of the target vehicle including its position, orientation, motion, and geometry in the proposed general tracking method, we use the SSPF for the motion estimate and geometry fitting and the RBPF for the geometry estimate. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our tracking method, we conduct an evaluation experiment using two intelligent vehicles around Nagoya University, Japan. The total distance traveled by the vehicles in this experiment is approximately 10 km, and the experimental environment contains flat roads, narrow streets, and steep ramps. To demonstrate the accuracy and speed of our tracking method, we extract the ground-truth from our intelligent vehicles and compare its performance with that of state-of-art RBPF-based approach.
