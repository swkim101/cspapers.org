The subject of this work is evaluation methods of student software development team projects. Over a two year period in three courses, we study student preferences for team evaluation methods, the reasons behind their preferences, the changes in preference that occur within a single course and across courses, and misconceptions that educators hold about student preferences. Data was collected from peer evaluations and surveys. We find evidence that students' preferences for evaluation method are influenced by their year of study, familiarity with teammates, and overall happiness with the team experience. Other factors we explored, including gender and perceived ability, did not appear to influence evaluation preferences in our courses.
