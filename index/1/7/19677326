Protecting users' privacy when transmitting a large amount of data over the Internet is becoming increasingly important nowadays. In this paper, we focus on the streaming choice-based information and propose a novel anonymization technique for providing a strong privacy protection to safeguard against privacy disclosure and information tampering. Our technique utilizes an innovative two-phase encoding-and-decoding approach which is very easy to implement, highly efficient in terms of speed and communication, and is robust against possible tampering from adversaries. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the promising performance of our technique.
