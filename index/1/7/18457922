In this paper, we proposed a simple yet novel multicast scheduling scheme for IEEE 802.16e wireless metropolitan area networks. Specifically, we want to solve the problem that how the base station schedules the data in a multicast superframe such that mobile stations can receive their required multicast data and the total awake time of mobile stations is minimal. We first prove that this problem is NP-complete, and then propose a greedy k-approximation algorithm, named G-EEMS, whose running time is O(n2), where n is the total number of multicast data messages and k is the size of MBS (Multicast and Broad-cast Service) zone in a superframe. Simulation results show that, in terms of energy throughput, G-EEMS significantly outperforms the existing scheme, called SMBC-D [4].
