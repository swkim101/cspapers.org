Modern industries, e.g., semiconductor packaging, imposes increasing stringent requirement on equipment with very high acceleration and high precision. Traditionally, arm linkage and drive mechanism are first designed followed by control design. The integrated design method is proposed as a preferable technique of the traditional one. In this paper, a general framework of the integrated design method for a point-to-point control is presented. The dynamic model for a flexible planar two-link manipulator is derived by the finite element method. The PD control strategy is applied in the closed-loop system. The structural parameters and control parameters are optimized simultaneously by solving the integrated design problem. The differential evolution (DE) technique, a global optimization technique, is used to solve the optimal design problem. A simulation shows the integrated design method gives improved system performance.
