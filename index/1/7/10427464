Research on entity linking has considered a broad range of text, including newswire, blogs and web documents in multiple languages. However, the problem of entity linking for spoken language remains unexplored. Spoken language obtained from automatic speech recognition systems poses different types of challenges for entity linking; transcription errors can distort the context, and named entities tend to have high error rates. We propose features to mitigate these errors and evaluate the impact of ASR errors on entity linking using a new corpus of entity linked broadcast news transcripts.
