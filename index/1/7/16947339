Unsupervised learning algorithms are designed to extract structure from data samples. Reliable and robust inference requires a guarantee that extracted structures are typical for the data source, i.e., similar structures have to be inferred from a second sample set of the same data source. The overfitting phenomenon in maximum entropy based annealing algorithms is exemplarily studied for a class of histogram clustering models. Bernstein's inequality for large deviations is used to determine the maximally achievable approximation quality parameterized by a minimal temperature. Monte Carlo simulations support the proposed model selection criterion by finite temperature annealing.
