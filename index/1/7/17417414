Three automatic test case generation algorithms intended to test the resource allocation of telecommunications software systems are introduced. Although these techniques were specifically designed for testing telecommunications software, they can be used to generate test cases for any software system that is modelable by a Markov chain. In addition, three new stochastic measures of effectiveness are presented to be used to assess these algorithms. Each of these measures is a variant of a mutation score, but incorporates the association of a probability y coefficient with each mutant, These algorithms have been used successfully to perform load testing for some real industrial software systems. We present empirical results for five such systems. Early experience with the algorithms indicate that they are highly effective at detecting subtle faults that would have been likely to be missed if load testing had been done in the more traditional way, using hand-crafted test cases.
