Nowadays Passive Optical Network (PON) requires that Optical Network Units (ONUs) wake up periodically to check if the Optical Line Terminal (OLT) has any message directed to them. This implies that ONUs change from sleeping mode in which they just consume 1 W to active mode in which the consumption goes up to 10 W. In many cases, the OLT does not have any packets for the ONU and it goes to sleep again, what supposes a waste of energy. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid ONU that relies on a low-cost and low-energy technology, IEEE 802.15.4, to wake up those ONUs that are going to receive a packet. Our first estimations demonstrates that our solution would save around 25000$ per year and OLT.
