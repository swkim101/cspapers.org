In the Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) representation a geometric solid is represented as the hierarchical combination of a number of primitive shapes using boolean operations, such as and, or, minus, and xor. We study the sequential Oimecomplexity of solving various classification problems for CSG representations. Specifically, we address the problems of determining the boundary of a CSG representation (CSG evaluation) and determining all intersections of a Iine with a CSG model (line classification). These problems have applications to VLSI design, computer graphics, and solid modeling. Our algorithms improve the previous worstcase bounds for solving these problems, and are based on the paradigm of applying techniques from parallel processing theory to quickly perform the classifications sequent.idly. Moreover, since the operations in our algorithms can be implemented using simple procedures, such as graph/tree traversal: plane-sweeping, and table look-up, our methods should also be competitive in practice.
