This paper presents a precise localization algorithm for vehicles in 3D urban environment with only one 2D LIDAR and odometry information. A novel idea of synthetic 2D LIDAR is proposed to solve the localization problem on a virtual 2D plane. A Monte Carlo Localization scheme is adopted for vehicle position estimation, based on synthetic LIDAR measurements and odometry information. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by performing real time localization in a 1.5 km driving test around the NUS campus area.
