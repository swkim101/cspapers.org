In this paper, we present a novel rule evaluation support method for post-processing of mined results with rule evaluation models based on objective indexes. Post-processing of mined results is one of the key issues to make a data mining process successfully. However, it is difficult for human experts to evaluate many thousands of rules from a large dataset with noises completely. To reduce the costs of rule evaluation procedures, we have developed the rule evaluation support method with rule evaluation models, which are obtained with objective rule evaluation indexes and evaluations of a human expert for each rule. Since the method is needed more accurate rule evaluation models, we have compared learning algorithms to construct rule evaluation models with the actual meningitis data mining result and actual rule sets from UCI datasets. Then we show the availability of our adaptive rule evaluation support method.
