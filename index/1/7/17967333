Several new results which contribute to the understanding of parallel merging networks are presented. First, a simple new explanation of the operation of Batcher's merging networks is offered. This view leads to the derivation of a modified version of Batcher's odd-even (<italic>m, n</italic>) network which has delay time [log(<italic>m</italic>+<italic>n</italic>)]. This is the same delay time as Batcher's bitonic (<italic>m, n</italic>) network, but it is achieved with substantially fewer comparators. Second, a correspondence is demonstrated between the number of comparators (and the delay time) for such networks and certain properties of binary number systems which have recently been extensively studied. Third, the [log(<italic>m</italic> + <italic>n</italic>)] delay time is shown to be optimal for a non-degenerate range of values of <italic>m</italic> and <italic>n</italic>.
