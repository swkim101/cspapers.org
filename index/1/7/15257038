We present full state feedback controllers for standing and walking balance of humanoid robot. The robot is simulated as a two-joint inverted pendulum for standing and a five-link model for walking, and is disturbed by a horizontal push with given size and location in the sagittal plane. We optimize the parametric controllers for different push sizes, locations, and directions. For standing balance, both impulsive and constant pushes are applied to simulate the hip strategy; for bipedal walking, instantaneous pushes are used as perturbations. The performance of optimized controllers are shown in handling different pushes for standing and walking balance.
