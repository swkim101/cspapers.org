Many enterprise systems are developed in C++ language and most of them are standalone. Because the standalone software can not follow the new market environment, reengineering the standalone legacy systems into distributed environment becomes a critical problem. Some methods have been proposed on related topics such as design recovery, the identification of the component, modeling the interfaces of components and components allocation. Up to now, there does not exist a reengineering process for partition distributed environment, which will offer distinct advantages on horizontal scalability and performance over normal distributed solutions. This paper presents a new process to reengineer C++ legacy systems into the J2EE partition distributed environment. The process consists of four steps: translation from C++ to Java code; extraction of components using the cluster technology; modeling component interfaces and partition of the components in J2EE distribute environment. It has been applied to a large equity-trading legacy system which has proved to be successful.
