The evolutionary trend toward a database-driven public communications network has motivated research into database architectures capable of executing thousands of transactions per second. In this paper we introduce the Datacycle architecture, an attempt to exploit the enormous transmission bandwidth of optical systems to permit the implementation of high throughput multiprocessor database systems. The architecture has the potential for unlimited query throughput, simplified data management, rapid execution of complex queries, and efficient concurrency control. We describe the logical operation of the architecture and discuss implementation issues in the context of a prototype system currently under construction.
