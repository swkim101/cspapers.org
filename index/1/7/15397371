Constraint based programming provides a versatile framework for combining several different constraints into a single robot control scheme. We take advantage of the redundancy of a robot manipulator to improve the execution of a reactive tracking task, in terms of a task-dependent measure which is a weighted sum of velocity transmissions along the current directions of motion. With inspiration from recent work, we provide analytical gradients and computable weights of the task-dependent measure, which enable us to include it in a reactive constraint based programming framework, without relying on inexact numerical approximations and manually tuning weights. The proposed approach is illustrated in a set of simulations, comparing the performance with a standard constraint based programming method.
