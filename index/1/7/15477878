This workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers to discuss the state of the art of software engineering practices and research challenges in designing and building pervasive computing systems and applications. Such systems are intended to support seamless mobility of users across different physical spaces by providing context-aware adaptation of their applications in regard to functionality, transparent resource discovery and access, and proactive actions. Context-based dynamic integration of distributed services and components in applications involving mobile users is an intrinsic characteristic of such environments. Building pervasive computing applications requires knowledge of many areas, such as programming models and software architectures, component based application integration, service-oriented architectures, middleware systems, security and privacy, sensor data aggregation for context management, database systems, policy-based system designs, fault-tolerant computing, application of formal methods, to name a few.
