It is known that memory-based collaborative filtering systems are vulnerable to shilling attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate that hubness, which occurs in high dimensional data, is exploited by the attacks. Hence we explore methods for reducing hubness in user-response data to make these systems robust against attacks. Using the MovieLens dataset, we empirically show that the two methods for reducing hubness by transforming a similarity matrix(i) centering and (ii) conversion to a commute time kernel-can thwart attacks without degrading the recommendation performance.
