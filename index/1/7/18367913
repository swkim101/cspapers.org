This paper proposes a walking behavior strategy for a spider-robot to realize 8-legged walking e.g. that of creatural spiders. A creatural spider responds to environmental information by adapting various walking forms, in cases of escaping from natural enemies or fear, wandering around for hunting game and so on. This research uses fuzzy and neural networks. The mechanisms of these walking behaviors are examined and verified through simulation and experiment.
