A description of techniques used for semantic modeling in a deductive question-answering system is given. The system maintains a dialog and is able to understand situations which can be expressed as a series of sequential time-frames. Specific relevant questions are asked by the system when it is unable to succeed in a given task. It can also provide reasons for its previous actions.
