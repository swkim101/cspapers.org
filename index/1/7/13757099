Modern cyber attacks consist of a series of steps and are generally part of larger campaigns. Large-scale field data provides a quantitative measurement of these campaigns. On the other hand, security practitioners extract and report qualitative campaign characteristics manually. Linking the two sources provides new insights about attacker strategies from measurements. However, this is a time-consuming task because qualitative measurements are generally reported in natural language and are not machine-readable. We propose an approach to bridge measurement data with manual analysis. We borrow the idea from threat intelligence: we define campaigns using a 4-stage model, and describe each stage using IOCs (indicators of compromise), e.g. URLs and IP addresses. We train a multi-class classifier to extract IOCs and further categorize them into different stages. We implement these ideas in a system called ChainSmith. Our system can achieve 91.9% precision and 97.8% recall in extracting IOCs, and can determine the campaign roles for 86.2% of IOCs with 78.2% precision and 80.7% recall. We run ChainSmith on 14,155 online security articles, from which we collect 24,653 IOCs. The semantic roles allow us to link manual attack analysis with large scale field measurements. In particular, we study the effectiveness of different persuasion techniques used on enticing user to download the payloads. We find that the campaign usually starts from social engineering and "missing codec" ruse is a common persuasion technique that generates the most suspicious downloads each day.
