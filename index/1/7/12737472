This poster illustrates how we use the Unified Modeling Language (UML) [1] to represent concepts from geographic data, and how we employ the associated Object Constraint Language (OCL) [4] to describe quality criteria as complex domain-specific constraints. We propose some adaptations to OCL which originated from the geographic domain, though reusable in other domains where complex constraints need to be expressed on a conceptual, knowledge-oriented model. Finally we briefly describe the Business-Rule Enabling Kernel, which is a module of a large distributed quality assurance system for the geographic data production process of our industrial partner Tele Atlas Data. This module is used to write the constraints, hereafter also referred to as OCL constraints, that are automatically checked against the persistent geographic data.
