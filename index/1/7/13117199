We present Quantized Contour Modeling (QCM), a Bayesian approach to the classification of acoustic contours. We evaluate the performance of this technique in the classification of prosodic events. We find that, on BURNC, this technique can successfully classify pitch accents with 63.99% accuracy (.4481 CER), and phrase ending tones with 72.91% accuracy.
