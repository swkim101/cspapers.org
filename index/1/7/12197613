We have begun the development of a new robotic pet that cansupport children in the storytelling process. Children can buildtheir own pet by snapping together the modular animal parts of thePETS robot. After their pet is built, children can tellstories using the My Pets software. These stories canthen be acted out by their robotic pet. This video paper describesthe motivation for this research and the design process of ourintergenerational design team in building the first PETSprototypes. We will discuss our progress to date and our focus forthe future.
