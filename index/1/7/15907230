The learner cannot store the data; it should learn from both labeled and unlabeled data, and it may also request labels for some of the unlabeled items. This setting is frequently encountered in real-world applications and has the characteristics of online, semi-supervised, and active learning. Yet previous learning models fail to consider these characteristics jointly. We present OASIS, a Bayesian model for this learning setting. The main contributions of the model include the novel integration of a semi-supervised likelihood function, a sequential Monte Carlo scheme for efficient online Bayesian updating, and a posterior-reduction criterion for active learning. Encouraging results on both synthetic and real-world optical character recognition data demonstrate the synergy of these characteristics in OASIS.
