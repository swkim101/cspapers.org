Programming games in computer science (CS) classes creates high levels of excitement and motivation [1]. Although there are potential pitfalls [2] and it has been argued that gender biasedgames can further alienate under-represented groups, it has also been shown that with careful design and articulation, combining CS classes with games at the introductory level can help recruit and retain students [3]. The focus of this panel is not the debate about whether games should be used in introductory computer science, but rather if they are going to be used what are some possible ways to do so. This panel presents four recent approaches at integrating computer gaming into introductory programming courses. At their core, these approaches can be broadly classified as either: experiences in which students create complete games of their own; or experiences in which students implement fundamental CS concepts to complete "skeleton" games that have been provided by the instructor. These approaches are based on different pedagogical philosophies and implementation platforms, yet all are designed to teach fundamental concepts via programming computer games. In all cases, the panelists will present examples and results from their recent work where CS concepts are learned while programming games. Faculty members who are interested in finding out more about gaming, or considering/interested-in adapting gaming related approaches/materials in their classes will find this panel especially relevant.
