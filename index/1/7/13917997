E-science communities face huge data management challenges due to large existing data sets and expected data rates from forthcoming projects. Community-driven data grids provide a scalable, high-throughput oriented data management solution for scientific federations by employing domain-specific partitioning schemes and parallelism. In this paper, we present how community-driven data grids can adapt their query coordination strategies in the face of different typical submission scenarios. We explore the impact of submitting queries uniformly or having submission hot spots. By an extensive evaluation of five strategies on simulated and distributed setups, we show that some coordination strategies are preferable to others, regardless of submission skew. Based on our results, we can improve the usability and scalability of community-driven data grids for data-intensive applications.
