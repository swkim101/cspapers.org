jUCMNav is an open-source Eclipse plug-in that supports the definition, analysis, transformation, and management of requirements engineering models expressed with the User Requirements Notation (URN). In November 2008, URN was approved as a standard by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T). URN is the first standard that combines modeling concepts and notations for goals and intentions (mainly for non-functional requirements, quality attributes, and reasoning about alternatives) and scenarios (mainly for operational requirements, functional requirements, and reasoning about scenario interactions, performance, and high-level architecture). jUCMNav has been instrumental in validating key concepts for the current standard as well as prototyping new concepts.
