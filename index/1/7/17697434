We present an approach of a distributed planning method to solve dynamically some typical tasks of a production planning system in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) at control level without using a fixed central component during planning and execution of orders received by one or several production planning systems above the control level. To achieve this, a flexible manufacturing system has been modelled as a multi-agent system, while the planning method we present uses the structure of manufacturing plans to coordinate properly their activities through negotiation among the agents. This has been implemented and tested in an object-oriented simulation environment.<<ETX>>
