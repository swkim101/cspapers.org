The information theoretic bound asserts that sorting N numbers requires NlogN comparisons in the worst case. The degree of universality of this bound has not been fully resolved. Paul and Simon [4] have established that any unit cost random access machine algorithm whose operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparison with 0 (but not division or bit-wise Boolean operations) requires Â£2 (NlogN) time to sort N numbers in the worst case. On the other hand, with the inclusion of division and Boolean operations, they obtain a linear time algorithm. This linear time algorithm, however, suffers from an abuse of the unit cost assumption. In particular, the algorithm generates operands during the course of its computation whose individual lengths are N 2 times the length of the largest of the N numbers to be sorted.
