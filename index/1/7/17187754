In distributed constraint optimization problems, dynamic programming methods have been recently introduced (e.g. DPOP [9]). These m thods group many valuations together in fewer (and also larger) messages, a s opposed to sending them individually. Therefore, they have the important advanta ge that they produce small communication overheads. However, the maximum m essage size is always exponential in the induced width of the constraint graph, lea ding to excessive memory/communication requirements for problems with large width. Many real problems contain hard constraints that significantly reduce the space of feasible assignments. The basic DPOP does not take advantage of the pruning power of these hard constraints; thus, it sends messages that explicitely represent all value combinations, including many infeasible ones. To address this problem, we introduce H-DPOP, a hybrid algorithm that is b sed on DPOP. H-DPOP uses Constraint Decision Diagrams (CDDs, see [2]) to rule out infeasible combinations, and thus compactly represent UTIL messa g . For highly constrained problems, CDDs prove to be extremely space-efficie nt when compared to the extensional representation used by DPOP: experimenta l results show space reductions of more than 99% for some instances.
