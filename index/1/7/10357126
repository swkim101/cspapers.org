This paper presents two novel approaches for accurate intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration. The rationale behind them is the widespread violation of the traditional assumption that the metric structure of the calibration object is perfectly known. A novel formulation parameterizes a checkerboard calibration pattern in such a way that the calibration performs optimally irrespective of its actual dimensions. Simulations and experiments show that it is very rare for traditional calibration methods to come by the accuracy readily attained by this approach.
