As demand for a first course in computer science increases, more efficient and effective approaches to such a course become increasingly desirable. This paper describes the development and use of a completely self-paced CAI course at The Evergreen State College. Use of behavioral objectives in designing the course is explained, the content of the course is outlined, the process used to develop the course is described, experiences with 256 students are reported, and some general observations on implementing CAI courses are offered.
