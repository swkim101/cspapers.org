Do requirements arise naturally from an obvious need, or do they come about only through diligent effortâ€”and even then contain problems? Data on two very different types of software requirements were analyzed to determine what kinds of problems occur and whether these problems are important. The results are dramatic: software requirements are important, and their problems are surprisingly similar across projects. New software engineering techniques are clearly needed to improve both the development and statement of requirements.
