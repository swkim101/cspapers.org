This research investigates how to provide automated analysis and decision-making support for adaptation of business processes and underlying software infrastructure, in the way that both maximizes business value metrics (e.g., profit, return on investment) and maintains alignment between business strategies and adaptation decisions. Among its expected contributions are improved modeling of business value metrics and business strategies in business process models and novel business value-driven techniques and algorithms that support primarily automatic and dynamic (runtime) adaptations, but also manual and static (designtime) adaptations. The proposed solutions will be implemented in software prototypes to demonstrate feasibility. Their usefulness will be evaluated through realistic case studies.
