Over the past 20 years, search engines have become emph{the} entry point of the WWW. Due to evolving needs for different and new kinds of information, the interfaces of search engine results pages (SERPs) change over time. Thus, their usability must be continuously evaluated to ensure user satisfaction and competitive edge. As no complete solution exists, we present emph{S.O.S.:} the emph{SERP Optimization Suite}. Our approach comprises (a) emph{WaPPU}, which is a near real-time tool for evaluating web interfaces based on usability scores, and (b) a emph{catalog of best practices} that maps bad scores to potential causes and corresponding adjustments for optimization. During a case study in which we assessed and optimized a real-world SERP, S.O.S. has proven its feasibility and effectiveness by significantly improving the SERP's usability.
