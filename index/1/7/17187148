Conventional instruction sets or directly interpretable languages (DILs) have not been designed with high-level languages (HLLs) in mind. The modern design problem is to derive a space-time efficient DIL for a HLL processing system. In this paper, we present our approach to the problem of designing well-matched, space-time efficient DILs. A systematic, syntax- and semantics-directed DIL design methodology is presented. It calls for an incremental transformation of the source HLL, until a suitable target DIL is obtained. At the heart of the methodology is a canonic set of language transformations. An experimental study, involving several systematically derived DILs is carried out in order to characterize the relative merits and disadvantages of various sequences of transformations. Various space, time and interpretability trade-offs implied by the transformations are studied.
