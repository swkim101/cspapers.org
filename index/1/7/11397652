For any set <italic>X</italic> of points (in any dimension) and any <italic>k</italic> &equil; 1,2, ..., we introduce the concept of the <italic>k</italic>-hull of <italic>X</italic>. This unifies the well-known notion of 'convex hulls' with the notion of 'centers' recently introduced by F.F. Yao. The concept is intimately related to some other concepts (<italic>k</italic>-belts, <italic>k</italic>-sets) studied by Edelsbrunner, Welzl, Lovász, Erdös and others.
 Several computational problems related to <italic>k</italic>-hulls are studied here. Some of our algorithms are of interest in themselves because of the techniques employed; in particular, the 'parametric' searching technique of Megiddo is used in a nontrivial way. We will also extend Megiddo's technique to Las Vegas algorithms. Our results have applications to a variety of problems in computational geometry: efficient computation of the 'cut' guaranteed by the classical 'Ham Sandwich theorem', faster preprocessing time for polygon retrieval, and theoretical improvements to a problem of intersecting lines and points posed by Hopcroft.
