The Loads-n-Limits (LNL) and Release-n-Sequence (RNS) modules are rule-based sub-systems designed to validate various configurations of aircraft stores loading and weapons release planning. LNL, in conjunction with verifying and validating the loads presented, returns usage restrictions and limitations of the aircraft and the weapons load. The RNS module evaluates user-selected weapons employment planning. Between the two modules, the planner can create legal and safe loads, determine flight restrictions, create safe weapon release sequences and determine weapons delivery restrictions throughout the entire flight scenario. This paper is a description of the two modules, the development environment, system growth, change management problems, and the scope of changes incorporated between the first release of Weapon Employment Planning Software (WEPS) in 2001 and the latest certified version.
