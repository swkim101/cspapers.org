Finding a solution to the frame problem that is robust in the presence of actions with indirect effects has proven to be a difficult task. Examples that feature the instantaneous propagation of interacting indirect effects are particularly taxing. This article shows that an already widely known predicate calculus formalism, namely the event calculus, can handle such examples with only minor enhancements.
