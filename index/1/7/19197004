With such streaming mobility data, the online prediction of short-term human mobility at the city level can be of great significance for transportation scheduling, urban regulation, and emergency management. In particular, when big rare events or disasters happen, such as large earthquakes or severe traffic accidents, people change their behaviors from their routine activities. This means people's movements will almost be uncorrelated with their past movements. Therefore, in this study, we build an online system called DeepUrbanMomentum to conduct the next short-term mobility predictions by using (the limited steps of) currently observed human mobility data. A deep-learning architecture built with recurrent neural networks is designed to effectively model these highly complex sequential data for a huge urban area. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model as compared to the existing approaches. Lastly, we apply our system to a real emergency scenario and demonstrate that our system is applicable in the real world.
