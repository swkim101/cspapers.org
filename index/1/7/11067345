We demonstrate that theorem provers using model elimination (ME) can be used as answer complete interpreters for disjunctive logic programming. More specifically, we introduce a mechanism for computing answers into the restart variant of ME. Building on this, we develop a new calculus called ancestry restart ME. This variant admits a more restrictive regularity restriction than restart ME, and, as a side effect, it is in particular attractive for computing definite answers. The presented calculi can also be used successfully in the context of automated theorem proving. We demonstrate experimentally that it is more difficult to compute (non-trivial) answers to goals, instead of only proving the existence of answers.
