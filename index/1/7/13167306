In this paper, a solution is proposed for n-Queen problem based on ACO (Ant Colony Optimization). The n-Queen problem become intractable for large values of ‘n’ and thus placed in NP (Non-Deterministic Polynomial) class problem. The n-Queen problem is basically a generalized form of 8-Queen problem. In 8-Queen problem, the goal is to place 8 queens such that no queen can kill the other using standard chess queen moves. So, in this paper, the proposed solution will be applied to 8-Queen problem. The solution can very easily be extended to the generalized form of the problem for large values of ‘n’. The paper contains the detail discussion of problem background, problem complexity, Ant Colony Optimization (Swarm Intelligence) and a fair amount of experimental graphs.
