Modern mobile devices are equipped with multiple network interfaces, including 3G/LTE and WiFi. Bandwidth aggregation over LTE and WiFi links offers an attractive opportunity of supporting bandwidth-intensive services, such as high-quality video streaming, on mobile devices. However, achieving effective bandwidth aggregation in mobile environments raises several challenges related to deployment, link heterogeneity, network fluctuation, and energy consumption. We present GreenBag, an energy-efficient bandwidth aggregation middleware that supports real-time data-streaming services over asymmetric wireless links, requiring no modifications to the existing Internet infrastructure and servers. GreenBag employs several techniques, including medium load balancing, efficient segment management, and energy-aware mode control, to resolve such challenges. We implement a prototype of GreenBag on Android-based mobile devices which hosts, to the best knowledge of the authors, the first LTE-enabled bandwidth aggregation prototype for energy-efficient real-time video streaming. Our experiment results in both emulated and real-world environments show that GreenBag not only achieves good bandwidth aggregation to provide QoS in bandwidth-scarce environments but also efficiently saves energy on mobile devices. Moreover, energy-aware GreenBag can minimize video interruption while consuming 14-25% less energy than the non-energy-aware counterpart in real-world experiments.
