Thanks to its less design complexity, less power consumption and service time, to avoid using virtual channel has became a very attractive approach to building future reliable and massively parallel many-core systems. Furthermore, less area of the light-weight router decrease the probability of failure. To this end, by constructing an acyclic channel dependency graph that breaks all cycles and preserves connectivity of the network, we propose a new deadlock-free fault-tolerant adaptive routing without virtual channel. Extensive experiments of 8Ã—8 2D-mesh network demonstrate 99.73% and 97.56% reliability under uniform random traffic when 10% and 20% of the links are failed.
