In recent years, opinion mining attracted a great deal of research attention. However, limited work has been done on detecting opinion spam (or fake reviews). The problem is analogous to spam in Web search [1, 9 11]. However, review spam is harder to detect because it is very hard, if not impossible, to recognize fake reviews by manually reading them [2]. This paper deals with a restricted problem, i.e., identifying unusual review patterns which can represent suspicious behaviors of reviewers. We formulate the problem as finding unexpected rules. The technique is domain independent. Using the technique, we analyzed an Amazon.com review dataset and found many unexpected rules and rule groups which indicate spam activities.
