As online applications gain popularity in today's E-Business world, surviving DBMS from an attack is becoming crucial because of the increasingly critical role that database servers are playing. Although a number of research projects have been done to tackle the emerging data corruption threats, existing mechanisms are still limited in meeting four highly desired requirements: near zero run time overhead, zero system down time. In this paper, we propose TRACE, a light weighted database Damage Tracking, Quarantine, and Recovery (DTQR) solution with negligible run time overhead.
