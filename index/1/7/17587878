A method and corresponding apparatus for monitoring high impedance failures in chip interconnects use monitoring circuitry on a chip to provide accurate and pro-active prediction of interconnect failures. The apparatus may include a resistance continuity monitoring circuit (RCMC), and a signal path connecting a representative set of pins to the RCMC. The RCMC measures the resistance of a connection of the representative set of pins with a circuit board during system operation and outputs a measured resistance data. The apparatus further includes additional analog-to-digital (A/D) hardware to perform an analog to digital conversion of the measured resistance data. The apparatus further includes a system interface for connecting the monitoring circuitry with other system management devices. The method then performs an algorithm on the measured resistance data, potentially warning of likely interconnect failures. The algorithm may include comparing the measured resistance data with a known threshold resistance value. Alternatively, the method displays and logs the measured resistance data for further study and analysis.
