from 2“d mobile systems fike GSM towards third generation mobile networks is focusing more and more on the provisioning of both classic voice-based services and an easy access to the rapidly spreading world of Internet app~cations. Mong this evolution path, it is mandatory to keep in mind that any new system architecture must be future-proof, i.e. looking forward towards the fu~ integration of telephony, multimedia and IT-based services in general. From this point of, new technologies such as the GSM/GPRS standards don’t fi~l completely this integration requirement, as they keep voice and data services separate. The ATM, due to its maturity, is sti~ the candidate technology for this goal, being able to provide a transport platform for circuit switched services that could easily evolve towards future users needs. In this paper we propose and vafidate an integrated solution using a common transport
