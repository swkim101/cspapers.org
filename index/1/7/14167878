In this work, we present the AGILE Spectrum Adaptation system that is able to dynamically tune the channel central frequency and bandwidth of wireless links in an adaptive to the interference and traffic conditions way. The developed system is able to detect under-utilised spectrum fragments and optimally adjust the occupied spectrum. Through the online execution of 3 specifically designed experimental scenarios, we demonstrate the ability to implement distributed spectrum adaptation in commercial WLAN deployments, along with the obtained performance benefits.
