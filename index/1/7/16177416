Many computer scientists recognize the adverse relationship between Microsoft Windows, a general purpose operating system, which by design does not support Real Time, a specific purpose feature. However, the boundary between a general-purpose system and a special-purpose feature has begun to blur and Microsoft and its partners have kept working on adding real-time services to Windows. In this paper, we will describe existing real-time solutions for Windows, the on-going projects for the next release of Windows and future trends lead by hardware evolution.
