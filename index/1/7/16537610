Algorithm animation has received much interest over the last few years. In this paper, we discuss the experiences gained in integrating animations into introductory computer science courses with large audiences of more than 200 students. After providing a short introduction to the animation tool we developed, we describe why and how we used animations in our lectures and present some example animations.
