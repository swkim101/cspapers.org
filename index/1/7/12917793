A "hand-eye" system for simulating robots on BESM-6 computer is described. Peculiarities of the special operating system, problem-oriented software and hardware are discussed. 
 
Elaborating of an "intelligent" robot is a versatile problem associated with the solution of various problems on information science, computing techniques, mechanics etc. The integrated investigation requires a special experimental system for physical and digital simulation of robot functioning.
