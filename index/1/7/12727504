The paradigm shift from device-oriented to serviceoriented management has also implications to the area of event correlation. Todayâ€™s event correlation mainly addresses the correlation of events as reported from management tools. However, a correlation of user trouble reports concerning services should also be performed. This is necessary to improve the resolution time and to reduce the effort for keeping the service agreements. We refer to such a type of correlation as service-oriented event correlation. For introducing service-oriented event correlation for an IT service provider, an appropriate modeling of the workflow and of the information is necessary. Therefore, we examine the process management frameworks ITIL and eTOM for their contribution to the workflow modeling in this area. The MNM Service Model, which is a generic model for IT service management proposed by the MNM Team, is used to derive an appropriate information modeling. The different kinds of dependencies that we find in our general scenario are used to develop a workflow for the serviceoriented event correlation.
