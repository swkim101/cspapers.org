Logistics network design problems are usually solved through experimental and intuitional approaches. These approaches are taken because of the complicated conditions that accompany problems associated with layout planning, stock analysis, network flow. In this study, the problem is divided into two parts: material flow and layout planning. An algorithm is examined in this study for a design that involves the formulation of material flow into the shape of mixed integer problems.
