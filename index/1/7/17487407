In order for peer-to-peer (P2P) content sharing network to be scalable, it is imperative to efficiently route queries through the network. Semantic based search should, with as little messages (traffic) as possible, return just those relevant documents stored throughout the network thus achieving precision and recall values comparable to those of correspondent centralized system. In this article we propose protocols for self-organizing P2P network that arranges links between peers according to peer's content. In proposed network peers organize themselves into "semantic communities" but without losing links to other semantic communities. Proposed network has no prior knowledge of the semantics of documents that are to be stored in the system.
