We present a non-grade-penalty late day policy used in many of the large lecture, required courses in our computer science department. We study the effectiveness of this late day policy in reducing student stress, distributing demand for teaching assistant resources in peak hours before the homework deadline, and in maintaining or improving student understanding and homework grades. A complex late day policy can be efficiently implemented and managed within our open-source homework submission system that utilizes automated testing and grading, allowing students to submit and resubmit homeworks as they make progress on the assignment.
