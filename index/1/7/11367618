Although undergraduate computer science enrollments are again on the upswing, increased enrollments do not seem to have led to increased diversity -- CS, at least in America, remains a field dominated by white males. A variety of evidence shows that many underrepresented groups, such as women and domestic students of color, are often motivated by course work that includes a clear societal benefit. The Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) approach suggests that working on FOSS projects that have humanitarian benefits provides such motivation. Unfortunately, adding new themes and topics to courses can be difficult. CS2, in particular, often feels packed enough that it's hard to envision adding something else. And, while HFOSS is attractive, it's sometimes hard for the particular needs of a project to help students develop course-specific knowledge (about data structures and algorithms). I've recently experimented with an idea that I call "HFOSS-lite". Rather than students contributing directly to an HFOSS project, they use an HFOSS project as a source of data for their data structures and algorithms. The Ushahidi crowdmapping platform has proven especially useful. Students can contribute data to Ushahidi sites and even build their own sites. The data can be used in a variety of exercises, from simple searching to sorting algorithms in which they use different criteria (not just alphabetical or by time, but also by distance from a location and a variety of hybrid approaches) and beyond. And, because they are using the HFOSS software, they think about societal impact.
