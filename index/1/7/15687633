Mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) are composed of many mobile devices with wireless interfaces. The networks operate well without any infrastructure. The source node can relay packets to the destination node through other nodes in MANET. However, the misbehaviors of nodes are common phenomenon in MANET. These misbehaviors of the selfish nodes will impact the efficiency, the reliability, and the fairness in MANET. In this paper, we propose a threshold-based method to increase the selfish nodes detection rate and decrease the false detection rate. Finally we will use the ns-2 simulator to observe the detection rate and the false detection rate at different moving rate of the nodes.
