We develop the algorithmic theory of vertex separators, and its relation to the embeddings of certain metric spaces. Unlike in the edge case, we show that embeddings into L1 (and even Euclidean embeddings) are insufficient, but that the additional structure provided by many embedding theorems does suffice for our purposes.We obtain an O(√log n) approximation for min-ratio vertex cuts in general graphs, based on a new semidefinite relaxation of the problem, and a tight analysis of the integrality gap which is shown to be Θ(√log n). We also prove various approximate max-flow/min-vertex-cut theorems, which in particular give a constant-factor approximation for min-ratio vertex cuts in any excluded-minor family of graphs. Previously, this was known only for planar graphs, and for general excluded-minor families the best-known ratio was O(log n).These results have a number of applications. We exhibit an O(√log n) pseudo-approximation for finding balanced vertex separators in general graphs. In fact, we achieve an approximation ratio of O(√log opt) where opt is the size of an optimal separator, improving over the previous best bound of O(log opt). Likewise, we obtain improved approximation ratios for treewidth: In any graph of treewidth k, we show how to find a tree decomposition of width at most O(k √log k), whereas previous algorithms yielded O(k log k). For graphs excluding a fixed graph as a minor (which includes, e.g., bounded genus graphs), we give a constant-factor approximation for the treewidth; this can be used to obtain the first polynomial-time approximation schemes for problems like minimum feedback vertex set and minimum connected dominating set in such graphs.
