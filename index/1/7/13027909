This paper introduces the process model as a way of incorporating the software life cycle into beginning computer science courses. This approach, patterned after a successful method for teaching English composition, provides students with an understanding of how all phases of programming can be accomplished. A five-step model of the process and some useful tools for each step are presented as an example and discussed.
