We interpret the time interval data obtained from periodically stimulated sensory neurons in terms of two simple dynamical systems driven by noise with an embedded weak periodic function called the signal: 1) a bistable system defined by two potential wells separated by a barrier, and 2) a FitzHugh-Nagumo system. The implementation is by analog simulation: electronic circuits which mimic the dynamics. For a given signal frequency, our simulators have only two adjustable parameters, the signal and noise intensities. We show that experimental data obtained from the periodically stimulated mechanoreceptor in the crayfish tailfan can be accurately approximated by these simulations. Finally, we discuss stochastic resonance in the two models.
