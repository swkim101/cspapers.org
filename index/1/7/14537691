THE SITE MACHINE is one of two prototype, graphics-based programs written to evaluate the potential of computer-aided instruction (CAI) programs in architectural education. Some CAI systems are now highly developed but almost no use has occurred in architectural education. The special characteristics and diverse nature of architectural education as well as the requirement for fast, high quality graphics, especially in the design areas, requires special applications and consideration.
 THE SITE MACHINE was a research attempt in open ended problem solving at the high end of a hierarchy of computer use in CAI in architecture. The major objectives of the test programs were:
 1. To determine the feasibility of implementing viable CAI programs using existing computing resources at reasonable development and user costs and to determine the useability of existing developed programs, techniques, capabilities and algorithms from CAI, computer graphics, mathematical and spatial modeling.
 2. Identify problems of acceptance and use by present faculty members, compatability and ease of integration in the curriculum, acceptance, use and motivation of student users.
 3. Develop test programs that will identify student differences in learning, recognize subject mastery and demonstrate that learning has occurred.
 4. Test initial ideas, concepts, instructional models and provide guidance and direction for future research and development efforts.
