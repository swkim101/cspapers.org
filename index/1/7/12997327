The SIGGRAPH Education Committee has been considering recommendations for inclusion of graphics in various curricula for higher education. Several issues of computer graphics in computer science or computer science/engineering curricula are identified here. In particular the course content and support facilities necessary and the status of graphics courses within programs are discussed. A basic premise is stated that Curriculum '78[1] and other guidelines[2, 3, 4, 5, 6] for educational programs are flawed in their lack of computer graphics content. The reasons for this are not immediately apparent, but might in part be attributed to the lower profile of graphics during the time of their initial development. Since that time the significant technical advancements and standardization of terms and concepts have not been incorporated as changes in recommended curricula designs.
