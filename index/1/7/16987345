In many biochemical protocols, such as polymerase chain reaction, a mixture of fluids in a certain ratio is repeatedly required, and hence a sufficient quantity of the mixture must be supplied for assay completion. Existing sample-preparation algorithms based on digital microfluidics (DMF) emit two target droplets in one pass, and costly multiple passes are required to sustain the emission of the mixture droplet. To alleviate this problem, we design a streaming engine on a DMF biochip, which optimizes droplet emission depending on the demand and available storage. Simulation results show significant reduction in latency and reactant usage for mixture preparation.
