A bigraphical reactive system (BRS) involves bigraphs, in which the nesting of nodes represents locality, independently of the edges connecting them. BRSs represent a wide variety of calculi for mobility, including λ-calculus and ambient calculus. A labelled transition system (LTS) for each BRS is here derived uniformly, adapting previous work of Leifer and Milner, so that under certain conditions the resulting bisimilarity is automatically a congruence. For an asynchronous λ-calculus, this LTS and its bisimilarity agree closely with the standard.
