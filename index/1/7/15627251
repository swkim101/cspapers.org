While there are many aspects to managing corporate knowledge, one key issue is how to organize corporate documents into categories of interest. In this paper, we focus on using user assisted text classification in conjunction with a web portal, multiple document management systems and an ontology, to provide a powerful solution for organizing information about a company's technology. We propose a system that interacts with an author using an automatic text classifier to suggest controlled keywords to be used as metadata. The proposed approach does not require professional librarians or that the end users have extensive training. The use of a controlled vocabulary allows for a more consistent description of corporate documents, and promotes easier access by people across the company. It is easier to find similar documents which use different nomenclature. Finally, the interactive nature of the system results in a more correct and precise description of each document than a fully automatic system would.
