With the social development, the demand of a natural remote communication platform for distributed families has greatly emerged. This work presents a Tele-Immersive Photograph system (TI-Photograph), which allows children and their remote parents to take pictures together in a virtual space with interactive behaviors. First, we propose a robust video object cutout method to segment the video of the child and the remote parent from their background surroundings. Second, we introduce a user behavioral intention driven video composition method to adaptively merge the segmented videos of the users into a same shared background customized by natural gesture interaction. Then we create an illusion that the child and the parent are immersed in the same environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the visual appearance in a shared interactive environment provides closer and efficient communication between remote family members.
