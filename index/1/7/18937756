Sensor network debugging is notoriously difficult because many bugs manifest themselves only when they encounter the real world -- exactly when most powerful debugging tools can no longer be applied. There are currectly two common approaches to source level debugging in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), (i) simulation-based debugging [3], and (ii) wire-based debugging via logic analyzers or in-circuit emulators [1]. The former do not capture the true dynamics of a real deployment while the latter do not scale with the number of nodes and geographic size of the network. Thus, existing source-level debugging approaches for WSNs cannot be used in many real deployment environments.
