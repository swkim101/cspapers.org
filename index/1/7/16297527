In this work we introduce a new concept of a search and rescue robotic system that is composed of an elephant trunk-like robot mounted on a mobile base. This system is capable not only of inspecting areas reachable by the mobile base but also to inspect unreachable areas such as small cracks, and pipes, using the camera mounted on its elephant trunk robot. In the report we describe the mechanical structure of the elephant trunk robot, the kinematic analysis of the structure, the robot control, and its human interface systems.
