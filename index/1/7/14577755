In this study, we analyze an educational search engine log for shedding light on K-12 students' search behavior in a learning environment. We specially focus on query, session, user and click characteristics and compare the trends to the findings in the literature for general web search engines. Our analysis helps understanding how students search with the purpose of learning in an educational vertical, and reveals new directions to improve the search performance in the education domain.
