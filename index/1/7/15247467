We consider prediction-model evaluation in the context of marketing-campaign planning. In order to evaluate and compare models with specific campaign objectives in mind, we need to concentrate our attention on the appropriate evaluation-criteria. These should portray the model's ability to score accurately and to identify the relevant target population. In this paper we discuss some applicable model-evaluation and selection criteria, their relevance for campaign planning, their robustness under changing population distributions, and their employment when constructing confidence intervals. We illustrate our results with a case study based on our experience from several projects.
