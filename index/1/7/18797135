We present HoloFlex, a 3D flexible smartphone featuring a light-field display consisting of a high-resolution P-OLED display and an array of 16,640 microlenses. HoloFlex allows mobile users to interact with 3D images featuring natural visual cues such as motion parallax and stereoscopy without glasses or head tracking. Its flexibility allows the use of bend input for interacting with 3D objects along the z axis. Images are rendered into 12-pixel wide circular blocks-pinhole views of the 3D scene-which enable ~80 unique viewports at an effective resolution of 160 Ã— 104. The microlens array distributes each pixel from the display in a direction that preserves the angular information of light rays in the 3D scene. We present a preliminary study evaluating the effect of bend input vs. a vertical touch screen slider on 3D docking performance. Results indicate that bend input significantly improves movement time in this task. We also present 3D applications including a 3D editor, a 3D Angry Birds game and a 3D teleconferencing system that utilize bend input.
