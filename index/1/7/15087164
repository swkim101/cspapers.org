Email is widely used as a means of communication, a task 
management system and an archive and it often seems impossible 
to live without it. Our always-online society expects us to be 
available 24/7 at the cost of potentially blurring the boundaries 
between work and personal life. Furthermore, mobile and handheld 
devices have made it even easier to be connected and 
therefore increased the sense of needing to be available to respond 
at any time. Whilst research to date has focused on identifying 
email practices on the desktop, little has been done to understand 
whether and how the introduction of mobile devices has changed 
our way of handling emails. In this paper, we describe preliminary 
results from an interview study that explored in particular the role 
of mobile devices in email management and work-home boundary 
management. We found that mobile technology impacts even on 
the most private of non-work moments. We provide examples of 
the ways in which technology supports frequent switching 
between work and non-work contexts, and demonstrate the 
strategies that people develop in order to manage these 
boundaries, by using what we call micro-boundaries (e.g. having 
two email apps on a phone).
