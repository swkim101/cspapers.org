We demonstrate multiagent control of modular self-reconfigurable (MSR) robots for object manipulation tasks and show how it provides a useful programming abstraction. Such robots consist of many modules that can move relative to each other and change their connectivity, thereby changing the robot's overall shape to suit different tasks. We illustrate this approach through simulation experiments of the TeleCube MSR robot system.
