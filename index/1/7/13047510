This research presents cognitive models of a person selecting anitem from a familiar, ordered, pull-down menu. Two different modelsprovide a good fit with human data and thus two different possibleexplanations for the low- level cognitive processes involved in thetask. Both models assert that people make an initial eye and handmovement to an anticipated target location without waiting for themenu to appear. The first model asserts that a person knows theexact location of the target item before the menu appears, but themodel uses nonstandard Fitts law coefficients to predict mousepointing time. The second model asserts that a person would onlyknow the approximate location of the target item, and the modeluses Fitts law coefficients better supported by the literature.This research demonstrates that people can develop considerableknowledge of locations in a visual task environment, and that morework regarding Fitts law is needed.
