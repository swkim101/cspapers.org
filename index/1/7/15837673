We introduce a novel task that arises in underwater search and inspection. In this task, an underwater vehicle must re-acquire and identify clusters of discrete objects. The challenge is to generate an efficient path for the vehicle given a probabilistic description of potential target locations. We propose an algorithm that generates an efficient path and show that the algorithm is superior to standard approaches.
