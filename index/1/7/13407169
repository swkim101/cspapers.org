A generic stochastic model with only two input parameters is introduced to evaluate the message delay in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where nodes may relay messages. The Laplace-Stieltjes transform (LST) of the message delay is obtained for two protocols: the two-hop and the unrestricted multicopy protocol. From these results we deduce the expected message delays. It is shown that, despite its simplicity, the model accurately predicts the message delay under both relay strategies for a number of mobility models (the random waypoint, random direction and the random walker mobility models).
