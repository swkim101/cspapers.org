The performance of an interleaved common memory accessed uniformly by multiple processors is modeled by queueing methods. The model includes access conflicts at the bank level while assuming an ideal access network.
A scaling relation is derived that is generally valid and indicates that memory access delays are given by the product of the bank reservation time and a function of the memory utilization, which is given by the average number of access requests arriving at a bank per bank reservation time. For light memory traffic, access delays are proportional to the square of the bank reservation time and the ratio of the number of active memory access streams to the number of memory banks.
Assuming random access patterns, an open and a closed queueing model are developed that are validated by simulations. Delay dependence on bank reservation time is quadratic for light loads and linear for very heavy loads.
A heuristic extension of our model for vector accessing of banks in sequential mode is proposed.
