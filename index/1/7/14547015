We propose a graph-based method for extractive single-document summarization which considers importance, non-redundancy and local coherence simultaneously. We represent input documents by means of a bipartite graph consisting of sentence and entity nodes. We rank sentences on the basis of importance by applying a graph-based ranking algorithm to this graph and ensure nonredundancy and local coherence of the summary by means of an optimization step. Our graph based method is applied to scientific articles from the journal PLOS Medicine. We use human judgements to evaluate the coherence of our summaries. We compare ROUGE scores and human judgements for coherence of different systems on scientific articles. Our method performs considerably better than other systems on this data. Also, our graph-based summarization technique achieves state-of-the-art results on DUC 2002 data. Incorporating our local coherence measure always achieves the best results.
