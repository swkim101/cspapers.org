The design of today's electronic systems involves the use of a growing number of complex CAD tools. Invoking and controlling these tools, independently or as part of a captured, multi-operation flow, remains an error-prone and largely unsolved problem. This problem is the focus of the Design Methodology Management Technical Subcommittee (DMMTSC) of the CAD Framework Initiative. This paper describes the DMM problem, establishes DMM requirements, and presents the state of the DMMTSC effort to define interface standards for proposed solutions.
