Conventional prefetching schemes regard prediction accuracy as important because useless data prefetched by a faulty prediction may pollute the cache. If prefetching requires considerably low read cost but the prediction is not accurate, it may or may not be beneficial depending on the situation. However, the problem of low prediction accuracy can be dramatically reduced if we efficiently manage prefetched data by considering the total hit rate for both prefetched data and cached data. To achieve this goal, we propose an adaptive strip prefetching (ASP) scheme, which provides low prefetching cost and evicts prefetched data at the proper time by using differential feedback that maximizes the hit rate of both prefetched data and cached data in a given cache management scheme. Additionally, ASP controls prefetching by using an online disk simulation that investigates whether prefetching is beneficial for the current workloads and stops prefetching if it is not. Finally, ASP provides methods that resolve both independency loss and parallelism loss that may arise in striped disk arrays. We implemented a kernel module in Linux version 2.6.18 as a RAID-5 driver with our scheme, which significantly outperforms the sequential prefetching of Linux from several times to an order of magnitude in a variety of realistic workloads.
