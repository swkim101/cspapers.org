A relational database machine Delta[2] has been developed at the Institute for New Generation Computer Technology (IOOT). The main component of Delta is an RDBE (relational database engine)[3] which performs relational database operations, such as projection and join. The RDBE consists of a sorting process hardware module called the sorter, a merging process hardware module called the merger, other special hardware modules called the IN module, a data input adapter, a data output adapter, and a CPU controlling these hardware modules. A special sorting cell was developed and implemented on LSI. The sorting process is based on a two-way merge-sort algorithm[l]. ~ne merging process is based on a hardware pipeline algorithm. In this paper, we describe the design considerations of the RDBE and these algorithms. Then, we describe the detailed design, implementation, and a performance evaluation of the RDBE.
