A major problem in any curriculum is to provide some sense of continuity among the various courses being taught. We are concerned that we teach proper structural concepts, that we cover all the syntactical rules for each programming language, and that we discuss the system life cycle. We provide courses in writing and speech. Despite our concern, many (if not most) students tend to think of each subject as a totally separate entity, completely unrelated to any other course taken previously or yet "to come in the foreseeable future. Lessons learned in programming courses are not considered pertinent to systems courses and vice versa. Even concepts learned in studying one programming language are not necessarily applied when learning another language.
