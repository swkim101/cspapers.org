This paper introduces a new gate sizing approach with accurate delay evaluation. The approach solves gate sizing problems by iterating local sizing results from linear programming within mall variable ranges of gate sizes. In each iterative step, variable ranges of gate sizes are updated according to the result from a previous step. Solutions with accurate delay evaluation which consider input signal slopes and separately evaluate rising and falling delays are obtained after several iterative steps. A speedup technique is used to pick out gates actually involved in each local sizing step so as to reduce CPU time. Experiments on sample circuits show that our approach can provide solutions with smaller circuit area than conventional approaches for the same circuit delay or provide solutions under tight delay constraints where conventional approaches can nor reach. Moreover, our approach is faster than the conventional approaches for most circuits, especially under loose delay constraints.
