Insects and geckos use claws and adhesive pads to negotiate both rough and smooth surfaces. Climbing robots have been designed to mimic various aspects of these and other biological systems to operate in specific vertical environments. Robots that adhere to the surface through suction cups, magnetic end-effectors, or adhesive pads can climb featureless, flat, or smoothly curved surfaces. Vortex-generating climbers do not require smooth surfaces. Robots have been designed with end-effectors that match specific features of the environment, such as peg-holes, handrails, climbing-wall footholds, and poles. Robots have also been fitted with insect-inspired spines to scale rough vertical surfaces.
