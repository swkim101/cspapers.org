These paper presents an approach for integrating UML with an ADL. The integration would encompass the advantages of both languages. It would give formal semantics to UML constructs and thus would provide UML with a theoretical foundation for architecture modeling. Furthermore, the integration would provide benefits for both ADL and UML users: it will enable ADL users to utilize general-purpose UML tools, and will enable UML users to utilize ADL validation capabilities. The result would be a rigorous software development process that is currently lacking.
