We describe a novel application for structured search in scientific digital libraries. The ACL Anthology Searchbench is meant to become a publicly available research tool to query the content of the ACL Anthology. The application provides search in both its bibliographic metadata and semantically analyzed full textual content. By combining these two features, very efficient and focused queries are possible. At the same time, the application serves as a showcase for the recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) research and language technology. The system currently indexes the textual content of 7,500 anthology papers from 2002--2009 with predicate-argument-like semantic structures. It also provides useful search filters based on bibliographic metadata. It will be extended to provide the full anthology content and enhanced functionality based on further NLP techniques.
