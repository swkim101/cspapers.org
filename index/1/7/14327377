It is challenge to maintain frequent items over a data stream, with a small bounded memory, in a dynamic environment where both insertion/deletion of items are allowed. In this paper, we propose a new novel algorithm, called hCount, which can handle both insertion and deletion of items with a much less memory space than the best reported algorithm. Our algorithm is also superior in terms of precision, recall and processing time. In addition, our approach does not request the preknowledge on the size of range for a data stream, and can handle range extension dynamically. Given a little modification, algorithm hCount can be improved to hCount*, which even owns significantly better performance than before.
