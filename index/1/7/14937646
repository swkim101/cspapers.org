This paper presents a system for querying treebanks. The system consists of a powerful query language with natural support for cross-layer queries, a client interface with a graphical query builder and visualizer of the results, a command-line client interface, and two substitutable query engines: a very efficient engine using a relational database (suitable for large static data), and a slower, but paralel-computing enabled, engine operating on treebank files (suitable for "live" data).
