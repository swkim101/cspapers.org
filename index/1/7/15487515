Qualitative spatial reasoning is important in large spatial databases. It is based on the manipulation of qualitative spatial relationships and used to derive new spatial knowledge. Spatial reasoning has so far been studied only for simple areal objects. Spatial databases usually consists of objects of difEerent types and complexity. Ln this paper, a general reasoning approach is proposed for deriving the composition of topological relationships between spatial o~ jects of arbitrary complexity in any space dimension. The reasoning rules proposed are used to derive a new composition table between diiferent types of spatial objects. The approach is a step towards the development of general spatial reasoning engine for handling difFerent types of spatial relations in‚Äù spatial databases.
