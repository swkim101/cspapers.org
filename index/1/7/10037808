The two major cost measures used in the past for grid embeddings are area (or the area of the smallest square or rectangle that contains the embedding) and total edge length. This paper is primarily concerned with a third measure, total number of nodes. To embed a graph on the planar grid, it may be necessary to “bend” edges. This can be modeled by allowing the insertion of nodes along edges of the graph and then insisting that the embedding may not bend edges.
