XML-based vocabularies have become more and more popular in application-to-application exchanges. Like traditional EDI standards, XML-based formats require an additional agreement on rules to access XML-based data structures. It is our goal to define a machine-readable format for these agreements to accompany XML DTDs or schemas. We present our approach by using a simplified state machine to define access rules. The semantics of the state machine will be expressed by the means of XML itself to be stored in a registry.
