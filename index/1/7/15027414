The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) requires common architectures that enable the collection, processing, analysis, seamless integration, dissemination, and reuse of information and technology in order to achieve its objectives of interoperability. We attempt to provide a high-level overview of some of the key DoD architectural standards and frameworks and illustrate how the NIST 4D/RCS relates to them.
