In the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) nowadays, there are a lot of wire and wireless communication standards. Therefore, heterogeneous network gateway plays an important role in IoT network. However, current management of the processing in data routing technique for heterogeneous network gateway is not efficient. Also, Modbus RTU is an industrial standard protocol used in physical layer network. Will cause the node ID conflict while slave nodes have the same identical number connected to the gateway. Furthermore, if traditional gateway is used in different network architecture, the adaptability will decrease because packet forwarding control plane and data plane have been in tight couple state. To deal with these problems, this paper uses software defined networking architecture to design the DNS-like heterogeneous network smart switch. Separating control and data plane through OpenFlow can make switch become more flexible. The Slave ID problem in Modbus heterogeneous network can be solved by using smart routing in smart switch. The node connected to smart switch has to be registered in smart switch first and managed by the node name. And use two methods the exchange data: Find Path by ID and Find Path by Name, proposed in this paper and unfixed string. It improves the connection experience substantially. Eventually, we implement the node registration flow, client connection flow and client data access through the OpenFlow module in NS3 and then show our algorithm result by using Wireshark.
