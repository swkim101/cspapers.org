As horizontal resolutions of global climate and numerical weather prediction applications increase beyond the hydrostatic limit of 10-km, the demand for efficient scalable applications becomes essential. Over the next decade global models will require scalability beyond hundreds of thousands to millions of processors. The current implementation of the finite-volume dynamical core (fvcore), a key component of global models at NASA, NOAA and NCAR, is limited in terms of scalability by the choice of computational grid (latitude-longitude based). To break through these scalability limitations the fvcore has been implemented on the quasi-uniform cubed-sphere grid with a 2-dimensional horizontal domain decomposition.The cubed-sphere fvcore scales well beyond the pure MPI limitations of the lat-lon core displaying ideal scaling on a full node of the SGI Altix (512 CPUs). This improved scalability will allow parent models to scale in excess of 10,000s of processors as we move toward petascale computing environments.
