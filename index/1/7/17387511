The article describes a system for describing and recognizing spatial and temporal patterns of events. The system is based on an ontology described through the Description Logics formalism and implemented in OWL DL. The approach is different from all other works in the literature since the system does not require an external reasoning engine, but relies only on the base mechanism for ontology classification. Experiments performed in two different scenarios are described, i.e., a Smart Home and a mobile robot for autonomous transportation operating within a partially automated building.
