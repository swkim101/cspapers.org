The use of asynchronous duty-cycling in wireless sensor network MAC protocols is common, since it can greatly reduce energy consumption and requires no clock synchronization. However, existing systems using asynchronous duty-cycling do not efficiently support broadcast-based communication that may be used, for example, in route discovery or in network-wide queries or information dissemination. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of ADB (Asynchronous Duty-cycle Broadcasting), a new protocol for efficient multihop broadcast in wireless sensor networks using asynchronous duty-cycling. ADB differs from traditional multihop broadcast protocols that operate above the MAC layer, in that it is integrated with the MAC layer to exploit information only available at this layer. Rather than treating the data transmission from a node to all of its neighbors as the basic unit of progress for the multihop broadcast, ADB dynamically optimizes the broadcast at the level of transmission to each individual neighbor of a node, as the neighbors asynchronously wakeup. We evaluate ADB both through ns-2 simulations and through measurements in a testbed of MICAz motes using TinyOS, and compare its performance to multihop broadcast based on X-MAC and on RI-MAC. In both evaluations, ADB substantially reduced energy consumption, network load, and delivery latency compared to other protocols, while achieving over 99% delivery ratio.
