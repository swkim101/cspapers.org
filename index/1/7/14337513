Ratnaparkhi (1996) introduced a method of inferring a tag dictionary from annotated data to speed up part-of-speech tagging by limiting the set of possible tags for each word. While Ratnaparkhi’s tag dictionary makes tagging faster but less accurate, an alternative tag dictionary that we recently proposed (Moore, 2014) makes tagging as fast as with Ratnaparkhi’s tag dictionary, but with no decrease in accuracy. In this paper, we show that a very simple semi-supervised variant of Ratnaparkhi’s method results in a much tighter tag dictionary than either Ratnaparkhi’s or our previous method, with accuracy as high as with our previous tag dictionary but much faster tagging—more than 100,000 tokens per second in Perl. 1 Overview
