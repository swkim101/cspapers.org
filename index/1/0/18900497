We discuss our experiences in integrating a commercial off-the-shelf ground-penetrating radar unit with an all-terrain rover. Straight-line subsurface surveys were generated in a fully autonomous manner using odometry and a simple visual servoing technique. Survey results for various terrains are presented. We discuss the configuration of the integrated system and make recommendations for both Martian and terrestrial applications.
