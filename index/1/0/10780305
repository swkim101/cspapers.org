Proposed here is an internal representation and mapping method for multimedia information in which retrieval is based on the impression documents are desired to make. A user interface design for a system using this method is also proposed.
The proposed internal representation and mapping method represents each desired document impression as an axis in a semantic space. Documents are represented as points in the space. Queries are represented as subspaces. The proposed user interface design employs a method of visual presentation of the semantic space.
For evaluation purposes, a prototype system has been developed. An image retrieval experiment shows that the proposed internal representation and mapping method and the user interface design provide effective tools for information retrieval.
