This paper proposes a novel set-point control method of a musculoskeletal system by combining a feedforward and feedback manner to complement each drawback each other. In our previous work, a feedforward positioning method of the musculoskeletal arm model was proposed which does not need any realtime sensory information. Its performance, however, depends on a muscular arrangement and an attitude of the arm, and thereby a large initial muscular internal force is necessary to make a good performance. On the other hand, it is well-known that a visual servoing is effective and versatile for the set-point control. However, there is a considerable time-delay due to a computational burden to acquire useful information from an image and an insufficient sampling period to capture each image when using a video frame rate camera. Thus in this paper, the feedforward and feedback signal are linearly combined into one in order to mutually complement each drawback. The combined control signal is newly designed and then numerical simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed method.
