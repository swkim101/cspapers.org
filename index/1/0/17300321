The Linear Temporal Logic MissiOn Planning (LTLMoP) toolkit is a software package designed to generate a controller that guarantees a robot satisfies a task specification written by the user in structured English. The controller can be implemented on either a simulated or physical robot. This video illustrates the use of LTLMoP to generate a correct-by-construction robot controller. Here, an Aldebaran Nao humanoid robot carries out tasks as a worker in a simplified grocery store scenario.
