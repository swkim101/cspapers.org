A memory may be regarded as a computer with input, output and storage facilities, but with no explicit functional capability. The only possible outputs are permutations of a multiset of its inputs. Thus the natural question to ask of a class of memories is, what permutations can its members compute? We are particularly interested here in switchyard networks studied by Knuth [1968], Even and Itai [1971], and Tarjan [1972], where the permutations are of the set of inputs, rather than of a multiset of them.
