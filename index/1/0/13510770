The closer distance between robots and human partners in the same space makes compliant robots essential in these days. While torque sensor based impedance control scheme suffers from insufficient bandwidth, musculoskeletal systems can achieve similar ability with smaller resources by using mechanically guaranteed dynamics. In this study, inspired by active stiffness mechanism of biological muscle, we developed a variable stiffness actuator which can realize precise joint stiffness without torque sensor based feedback control. The actuator consists of two antagonistically allocated DC motors with a variable radius gear transmission mechanism. The equilibrium position and joint stiffness can be independently controlled adjusting the activation level of motors by feedforward control. Theoretically predicted stiffness is realized well. In this paper, the design, functional principle and control of the actuator are introduced with analytical investigation.
