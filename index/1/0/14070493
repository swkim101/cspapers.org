This paper presents a demonstrational interface builder with improved reasoning capabilities. The system is comprised of two major components: an interactive display manager and a rule-based reasoner. The display manager provides facilities to draw the physical appearance of an interface and define interface behavior by graphical demonstration. The behavior is defined using a technique of stimulus-response demonstrations. With this technique, an interface developer first demonstrates a stimulus that represents an action that an end user will perform on the interface. After the stimulus, the developer demonstrates the response(s) that should result from the given stimulus. As the behavior is demonstrated, the reasoner observes the demonstrations and draws inferences to expedite behavior definition. The inferences entail generalizing from specific behavior demonstrations and identifying constraints that define the generalized behavior. Once behavior constraints are identified, the reasoner sends them to the display manager to complete the definition process. When the interface is executed by an end-user, the display manager uses the constraints to implement the run-time behavior of the interface.
