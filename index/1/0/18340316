We present an evaluation of a novel hierarchical text summarization method that allows users to view summaries of Web documents from small, mobile devices. Unlike previous approaches, ours does not require the documents to be in HTML since it infers a hierarchical structure automatically. Currently, the method is used to summarize news articles sent to a Web mail account in plain text format. Subjects used a Web-enabled mobile phone emulator to access the account's inbox and view the summarized news articles. They then used the summaries to complete several information-seeking tasks, which involved answering factual questions about the stories. In comparing the hierarchical text summary setting to that in which subjects were given the full text articles, there was no significant difference in task accuracy or the time taken to complete the task. However, in the hierarchical summarization setting, the number of bytes transferred per user request is less than half that of the full text case. Finally, in comparing the new method to three other summarization methods, subjects achieved significantly better accuracy on the tasks when using hierarchical summaries.
