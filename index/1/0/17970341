A five year project studying the diagnosis and remediation of children with reading problems is described. The discussion includes observational studies of reading diagnosticians at work, observations of diagnostician training programs and computer simulation of theories about decision making in reading diagnosis. The results of the observational studies are mentioned and the theories and systems for computer simulated diagnosis are described.
