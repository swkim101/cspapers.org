This paper describes current progress in the development of a robot for locating patches of chemical deposited on the ground. It is envisaged that this form of chemical location will be useful for such tasks as verifying the effectiveness of decontamination and finding spills of nonvolatile chemicals. In many cases the approximate location of the chemical is known and the search extends outwards from this point. A number of biologically inspired algorithms are available for conducting this kind of search. The aim of this project is to implement these algorithms using a specially designed robot and in particular to investigate ways in which physical obstacles can be accommodated. The design of the searching robot TASTI 2, its search algorithms and the modifications to allow obstacle avoidance are described. In addition, results of simulations and practical experiments are presented.
