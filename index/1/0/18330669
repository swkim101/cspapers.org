Optimization of the program to be stored in ROM in the microprocessor is an important issue in compiling for embedded processors like digital signal processors (DSPs). Offset assignment (OA) is a highly effective address code optimization technique for embedded processors with limited memory. The simple offset assignment (SOA) problem concerns the layout of variables for processors with only one address register and the general offset assignment (GOA) problem deal with multiple address registers. This paper concentrates on SOA based on specialized DSPs with Address Generation Units (AGUs). A number of SOA algorithms had been proposed to solve the SOA problem in the past years. In this paper, a new heuristic has been proposed for SOA which dynamic select the edge by re-sorting the edge array iteratively. A new technique for edge selection approach has been proposed to reduce the OA cost in advance. The experimental results on several benchmarks show our approach not only better than the previous works but also can be applied onto the other OA algorithms to have a significant improvement.
