To address this practical yet challenging problem, which is multi-modal and multi-task in nature, an end-to-end neural model is proposed. In particular, comprehensive meal representations are obtained from images, descriptions and user information. We further introduce a novel memory network architecture to store meal representations and reason over the meal representations to support predictions. Results on a real-world dataset show that our method outperforms two strong image captioning baselines significantly.
