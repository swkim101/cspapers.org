In recent years B-trees have become a common data structure for representing large data dictionaries. In this paper we investigate the often ignored relationship between routing schemes and the permissible operations in leaf-search B-trees. We show that among the many commonly used routing schemes in the literature, some are cleaner than others, making them more attractive for leaf-search B-trees supporting concurrency.
