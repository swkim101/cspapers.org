This paper introduces an exoskeleton assistive hand that supports human hand and wrist activities by using user's bioelectric potential to control the exoskeleton movement. The exoskeleton has three active joints for an index finger, three active joints for combination of a middle finger, a ring finger and a little finger and two active joints for a thumb. It also has two passive joints between the index finger part and the combined part of the three fingers. Our proposed poly-articular tendon drive mechanism simulates a mechanical compliance of a human finger so that the exoskeleton could realize comfortable and stable grasping. This paper proposes a new mechanism "dual sensing system" and a new control algorithm "bioelectric potential-based switching control" so that the exoskeleton could synchronize wearer's hand activities without any force sensor. A tendon-driven mechanism and a dual sensing system enable wearer's fingers to move freely when they does need power assist but precise position control or force control. A bioelectric potential-based switching control enables the exoskeleton to augment their grasping force only when wearer's fingers generate a relatively large grasping force. A five-parallel-link mechanism is used to assist wrist activities of a wearer. Through experiments it is confirmed that the exoskeleton does not disturb a wear's pinch of a small object and that it augments grasping force for a heavy work.
