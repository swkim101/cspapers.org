In this paper, the design of a multi-band circularly polarized stacked microstrip antenna for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications and precise global positioning system (GPS) is proposed. The microstrip antenna for multi-band frequency is constructed by stacking two different square patches and circular polarization is obtained by different approaches. The top patch has a pair of truncated square corners, and the bottom patch is fed with two pins placed symmetrically on the two main axes. The antenna is designed to operate at L1 (1.575 GHzÂ±12 MHz) and LEO at two frequency ranges uplink (148-150 MHz), downlink (137-139 MHz). All the design details and numerical results will be discussed in this context.
