In this paper we describe the design process of a via-configurable block for regular fabrics. The block consists of via-configurable functional cells, via-decomposable flip-flops, and via-configured sizable repeaters. The fabric has fixed layers up to M2. An M1-M2 via mask is used to define the block's functionality. The upper-level metals are customized. Compared to other structures based on LUTs or PLAs, and fixed flip-flops, our block has much smaller area, higher performance and lower power consumption.
