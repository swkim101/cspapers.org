Over the past years, the Object Technology community has seen the birth of a number of new technology ideas that have changed the way we do computing. These ideas have affected compiler design, analysis approaches, project management techniques, user interface design, deployment strategies and implementation tactics. But where do these ideas come from? And how do they evolve? Do they address the needs as specified by members of the Object Community? Is there a way we can nurture the introduction and assimilation of these ideas to and by the community at large? And what are the market forces that bend ideas to their will. This panel will look at new ideas in Object Technology from a variety of perspectives and will attempt to get to the heart of the way that we, as technologists, create, buy, sell and grow ideas.
