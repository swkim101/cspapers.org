With the aim to share and reuse conceptual design process knowledge, the paper proposed to apply one knowledge discovery approach-DFSSM in product conceptual design. According to the feature of conceptual design, one new approach of product conceptual design based on DFSSM was implemented, in which the DFSSM could mine design process knowledge from complex type data of conceptual design and the knowledge could be for the next conceptual design. So this method improved the automation degree of conceptual design, overcame the defects of expertise and achieved a cost-effective product innovation.
