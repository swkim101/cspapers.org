An autonomous trading agent is a complex piece of software that must operate in a competitive economic environment. We report results of an informal survey of agent design approaches among the competitors in the Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management (TAC SCM). We identify the problem of decision coordination as a crucial element in the design of an agent for TAC SCM, and we review the published literature on agent design to discover a wide variety of approaches to this problem. We believe that the existence of such variety is an indication that much is yet to be learned about designing such agents.
