Low-cost pen and ink digital plotters, interfaced with central processors and used in conversational environments, are providing solutions to design problems previously considered too expensive or otherwise unsuitable for on-site batch processing systems. Artwork generation, numerical control tape verification, and schematic layout problems are effectively handled with low-speed printing terminals working in conjunction with digital plotters. Graphics oriented time-sharing systems and graphics oriented computer terminals will provide significant advantages for many phases of the design process.
