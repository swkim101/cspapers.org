Matrix factorization is one of the most powerful techniques in collaborative filtering, which models the (user, item) interactions behind historical explicit or implicit feedbacks. However, plain matrix factorization may not be able to uncover the structure correlations among users and items well such as communities and taxonomies. As a response, we design a novel algorithm, i.e., hierarchical group matrix factorization (HGMF), in order to explore and model the structure correlations among users and items in a principled way. Specifically, we first define four types of correlations, including (user, item), (user, item group), (user group, item) and (user group, item group); we then extend plain matrix factorization with a hierarchical group structure; finally, we design a novel clustering algorithm to mine the hidden structure correlations. In the experiments, we study the effectiveness of our HGMF for both rating prediction and item recommendation, and find that it is better than some state-of-the-art methods on several real-world data sets.
