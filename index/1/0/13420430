Aiming at mimicking water strider's water-surface locomotion, this study proposes a new miniature surface tension-driven robot. A key feature of this robot is that its actuating legs possess ellipse-like spatial trajectories like water strider by using a cam-link mechanism, and never pierces water surface when rowing. A set of simple models and equations are proposed to analyze the interaction forces between leg and water as well as the critical condition for a leg penetrating a water surface. The final fabricated robot weights about 3.9 g with a load capacity of 5.6 g. By controlling the motions of actuating legs, the robot can freely and stably walk on water with different gaits. The maximum forward and turning speeds of the robot are measured as 16 cm/s and 23 Â°/s, respectively. Moreover, a similarity analysis with Bond Number and Weber Number reveals that the locomotion of this robot is quite analogous to that of a water strider: surface tension force dominates the lifting force and plays a major role in the propulsion.
