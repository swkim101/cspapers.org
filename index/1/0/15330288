We study inductive and second-order definability on finite structures with successor and relate these notions to complexity theory. We introduce the dimension d of an inductive definition, directly related to the Time complexity, representing the number of variables necessary to carry an induction. We will prove the following:
 Connectivity is not uniformly unary &Sgr;<supscrpt>1</supscrpt><subscrpt>1</subscrpt> definable on graphs with successor, generalizing a similar result of Fagin on graphs without successor.
 We will mention that similarly, Hamiltonicity is neither unary-&Sgr;<supscrpt>1</supscrpt><subscrpt>1</subscrpt> nor unary-Ï€<supscrpt>1</supscrpt><subscrpt>1</subscrpt> on graphs with successor. These results show that disconnectivity is not inductive of dimension 1 although it is inductive of dimension 2, and that Hamiltonicity is neither inductive nor co-inductive of dimension 1 on graphs with successor.
