This paper describes a broadcast bulk file transfer protocol and presents its performance characteristics. The protocol is for bulk file distribution over a single satellite channel. The transmitting site and multiple receiver sites share channel access time to send data and acknowledgements.
The protocol performance characteristics are investigated using a simulation model that includes modelling of the uplink and downlink error processes at both the transmitter and receivers. The results obtained show that this protocol offers efficient reliable bulk file transfer to multiple receivers using a single satellite channel.
