Community question answering (cQA) has become a popular service for users to ask and answer questions. In recent years, the efficiency of cQA service is hindered by a sharp increase of questions in the community. This paper is concerned with the problem of question routing. Question routing in cQA aims to route new questions to the eligible answerers who can give high quality answers. However, the traditional methods suffer from the following two problems: (1) word mismatch between the new questions and the users' answering history; (2) high variance in perceived answer quality. To solve the above two problems, this paper proposes a novel joint learning method by taking both word mismatch and answer quality into a unified framework for question routing. We conduct experiments on large-scale real world data set from Yahoo! Answers. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the traditional query likelihood language model (QLLM) as well as state-of-the-art cluster-based language model (CBLM) and category-sensitive query likelihood language model (TCSLM).
