Computer science is rapidly expanding across the United States, and as schools look for guidance about what constitutes developmentally appropriate topics, state education departments are looking for assistance in the creation of standards. The K--12 Computer Science (CS) Framework was developed to fit these needs. The framework is the first of its kind in the K--12 CS domain, filling a much-needed structural and definitional role in the field. The framework was created as part of a collaboration at multiple levels within the CS community across the United States. Following the footsteps of other disciplines, this framework provides definitions and guidelines on what students should know (concepts) and be able to do (practices) within certain grade bands in today's computing classrooms. This paper details why the framework was developed, how it was designed, and what impacts it could have on the future of K--12 computing education.
