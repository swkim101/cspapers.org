Walking gait based on actual machine elements that capture the major features of human locomotion may enhance the understanding of human leg morphology and control, and provide necessary background science for the design and control of human-robot exoskeleton interaction system. This paper describes an investigation into the biomechanical effects of human lower limb joints during different loaded walking. Healthy volunteers walked on a level with different loaded (0kg, 10kg, 20kg, 30kg). The experiment results of human walking motion may give the base which joint of power-assisted lower extremity robot should be actuated, and what driving method should be used. At the same time, the kinematics and kinetics data of human walking motion give some bases for the choose of the actuator.
