Precise manipulation of microparticles has received considerable attention for its great potential applications to clinical medicine. Among the existing manipulation techniques, the method of magnetic force based manipulation exhibits great advantages for its minimally-invasive feature and insensitivity to biological substance, making it ideally suitable to in vivo environment. On the other hand, increasing demand for accurate and high throughput magnetic manipulation highlights the need of incorporating automation technology in the manipulation. In this paper, we propose an automated control approach to manipulating a magnetic microparticle (bead) with a home-designed electromagnetic coil system. A simplified two-order dynamic model for a microparticle suspended in fluidic environment is established first. A closed-loop controller with utilizing visual feedback is then developed based on input-to-state stability and backstepping methodology. The proposed controller guarantees that the microparticle follows the desired trajectory even in presence of environmental uncertainties and disturbances. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
