Argus is a programming language and system developed to support the construction and execution of distributed programs. This paper describes the implementation of Argus, with particular emphasis on the way we implement atomic actions, because this is where Argus differs most from other implemented systems. The paper also discusses the performance of Argus. The cost of actions is quite reasonable, indicating that action systems like Argus are practical.
