In recent years, social media sites are witnessing an information explosion. Determining the reliability of such a large amount of information is a major area of research. Information provenance (aka, sources or origin) provides a way to measure the reliability of information in social networks. The main challenge in seeking provenance is the availability of suitable data consisting of sufficient unique propagation paths. Knowledge of the actual propagation paths for a piece of information will be a valuable asset in provenance search. This paper presents a tool for capturing the propagation network of a given tweet or URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in the Twitter network. Researchers can use this tool to collect information propagation data, design effective strategies for determining the provenance, and gain information about the tweet such as impact, growth rate and users influencing the spread. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system for seeking provenance information.
