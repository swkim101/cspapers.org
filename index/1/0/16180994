We describe how to improve the performance of MDP planning algorithms by modifying them to use the search-control mechanisms of planners such as TLPlan, SHOP2, and TALplanner. In our experiments, modified versions of RTDP, LRTDP, and Value Iteration were exponentially faster than the original algorithms. On the largest problems the original algorithms could solve, the modified ones were about 10,000 times faster. On another set. of problems whose state spaces were more than 14,000 times larger than the original algorithms could solve, the modified algorithms took only about 1/3 second.
