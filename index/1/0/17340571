Workflow management has gained increasing attention recently as an important technology to improve information system development in dynamic and distributed organizations. To develop a workflow application, selected business processes of an organization are modelled, optimized and specified as workflow schemas, using workflow languages [2]. Workflow schemas are used by workflow management systems to control the execution of workflow instances, i.e., representations of real-world business processes [3]. The first generation of workflow management systems (WFMS) were developed mainly to model and control the execution of business processes with fairly static structures, to be executed in homogeneous environments. Recently, the need for enhanced flexibility of workflow modeling and execution and the integration of applications in heterogeneous environments emerged in the workflow context [I]. The WASA project aims at supporting flexible and distributed workflows in heterogeneous environments [4]. This paper briefly overviews the conceptual design and implementation of the object-oriented workflow management system WASAZ, and sketches the proposed demo. References to work that relates to ours or that we started from are given in the cited WASA papers.
