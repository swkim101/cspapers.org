In this paper we show and evaluate the design of a novel telemanipulation system that maps proximity values, acquired inside of a gripper, to forces a user can feel through a haptic input device. The command console is complemented by input-devices that give the user an intuitive control over parameters relevant to the system. Furthermore, proximity sensors enable the autonomous alignment/centering of the gripper to objects in user-selected DoFs with the potential of aiding the user and lowering the workload. We evaluate our approach in a user study that shows that the telemanipulation system benefits from the supplementary proximity information and that the workload can indeed be reduced when the system operates with partial autonomy.
