A triangulation of a d-dimensional convex polytope is a set of d-simplices whose union is the polytope and any two simplices in it intersect in a common (possibly empty) face. The size of a triangulation is the number of its full-dimensional simplices. We discuss the problem of finding a minimal-size triangulation of a convex d-polytope. This optimization problem arises, in Computer Algebra and Mathematical Programming, and it is related to the problem of characterizing the f-vectors of triangulations of balls and polytopes (see [1, 3, 4, 5] for references). The interest on the computational complexity of this question goes back at least to the survey [3]. There it was asked whether there is a polynomial time algorithm to compute a minimal triangulation of a 3-dimensional convex polytope (open Problem 12 in section 3.2 of [3]). We provide evidence that such algorithm is impossible:
