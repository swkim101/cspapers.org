We present the design and fabrication of centimeter scale robots, which use inchworm-like motion and bidirectional claws. Two prototypes for different locomotion goals were built utilizing these two characteristics: Type I is designed particularly for horizontal surfaces utilizing two linear actuators and compliant claws. This robot is capable of steering and straight motion by utilizing directionally anisotropic friction. Type II is a variant of Type I that is designed for locomotion on ferromagnetic ceilings or vertical planes by using permanent magnets. The Smart Composite Microstructures (SCM) technique enables versatile and multi-jointed meso-scale devices suitable for such robots.
