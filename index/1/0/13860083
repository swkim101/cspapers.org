Bienvenue! It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the WWW 2018 International Workshop on Modeling Social Media (MSM'2018) - Applying Machine Learning and AI for Modeling Social Media. This is our 9th edition of our workshop. Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn have paved the way for generating huge amount of diverse, streaming bit data in a short period of time. Such social media data require the application of big data analytics to produce meaningful information to both information consumers and data generators. Machine learning and AI techniques are particularly effective in situations where deep and predictive insights need to be uncovered from such social media data sets that are large, diverse and fast changing. The workshop aims to address machine learning and AI methods, frameworks, algorithms, and the applications and evaluation of these approaches on social media, big data and the web. We received 11 papers from all around the world covering a broad range of topics, and we accepted 8 papers resulting in a 72% acceptance rate. We evaluated them regarding relevance, quality, and novelty, selecting 4 full papers and 4 short papers. Each paper was reviewed by 3 reviewers and then decisions were made from the reviews and the workshop chairs.
