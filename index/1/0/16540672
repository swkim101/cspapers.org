SPAL (Single Port Access Laparoscopy) could lead to improved surgical outcomes but demands functional and effective next-generation surgical tools. Various manual tools and robotic assistant systems have been developed in response to the unmet needs of SPAL. This paper presents the concept, design considerations and experimental characterizations of a foldable stereo vision unit with integrated illumination. The vision unit can be inserted into the abdomen through a Ã˜12mm trocar in a cylindrical laparoscope form. It can then unfold itself into a working configuration, providing 3D visualization of the surgical site as well as a remaining access port for manipulation arms or surgical tools. Given its standalone features, the vision unit could either be used for SPAL in a robotic assistant system or be applied in a surgical setting with standard manual tools.
