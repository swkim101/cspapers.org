The ParaScope Editor is a new kind of interactive parallel programming tool for developing scientific Fortran programs. It assists the knowledgeable user by displaying the results of sophisticated program analyses and by providing editing and a set of powerful interactive transformations. After an edit or parallelism-enhancing transformation, the ParaScope Editor incrementally updates both the analyses and source quickly. This paper describes the underlying implementation of the ParaScope Editor, paying particular attention to the analysis and representation of dependence information and its reconstruction after changes to the program.
