Metacognition refers to one's knowledge about one's cognitive processes, and is often associated with intelligence. Students who have good metacognition skills typically perform better in their cognitive tasks. For the Fall and Winter semesters in 2011-12, we incorporated metacognition into our computer science courses (both undergraduate and graduate level courses), so that the student becomes more aware of his/her own understanding of the various topics of the course. In this paper, we describe how we incorporated metacognition into our courses, and present results from our analysis of the data that we have gathered over the various courses.
