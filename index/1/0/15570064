A navigation system based on hybrid map for intelligent wheelchair is presented. The system is consisted of hybrid map building, localization, path planning and trajectory following. The hybrid map includes a series of small probabilistic grid maps (PGM) and a global topological map (GTM). They are built simultaneously and easily using the human-guided method. Then on the hybrid map, the localization and the real-time path planning algorithms are realized smartly and effectively. The experiments and applications results show that the human-guided method integrates both the computer's modeling ability and the human's sensory perception to the environment. The hybrid map is easy to solve the loop-closure and doorway problems that enhances the robustness against uncertainty of sensors. It also can improve the efficiency in large-scale SLAM. Further more, at an elderly home we did the activities of daily living (ADL) testing and at Shanghai Expo 2010 we demonstrated the wheelchair system by offering trial rides to visitors.
