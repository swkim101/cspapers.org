Optimizing exception handling is critical for programs that frequently throw exceptions. We observed that there are many such exception-intensive programs iin various categories of Java programs. There are two commonly used exception handling techniques, stack unwinding optimizes the normal path, while stack cutting optimizes the exception handling path. However, there has been no single exception handling technique to optimize both paths.
