The main goal of model-driven architecture is the generation of the full implementation of a systembased on a precise description of a platform-independent model and a platform model. Such a description must accurately specify the static structure as well as the dynamic behavior of the system. We present a tool -- called DEMOCLES -- that realizes a hybrid approach to platform-independent modeling. It describes the static structure using a modified UML class diagram that separates query operations from modifier operations. The former are defined in the class diagram via OCL constraints, while the latter are defined using a MOF-based metamodel that contains modifier operations and properties as first-class entities and augments them with associations and OCL expressions. The tool is an Eclipse-plugin that offers overlay views of the structure and behavior with visual editing capabilities and permits execution of a platform-independent system.
