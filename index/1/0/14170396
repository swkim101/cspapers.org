We present an experience report demonstrating the use a Domain-Specific Language, Nuterpea, in a general education music class. While the use of computing in music education is common, we demonstrate that {\em coding} allows students without a background in music or computing to explore topics in music form and theory. Coding supports a new style of music education, one that is focused on creating musical compositions rather that performance or appreciation of existing music. We focus on styles of music that can be built algorithmically from a structural description. With such music the use of coding allows students to define and use patterns in a way that makes it possible for complex compositions to be specified in a concise manner. This approach suits the context of general education; we have designed our curriculum around genres of music that are easily represented in an algorithmic manner. Our experience suggests that a well-designed DSL for describing musical compositions provides a unique way to introduce students to core concepts in music in way that is engaging for learners and pedagogically appropriate for topics in music theory and structure. In addition, students are exposed to computer science topics such as programming language syntax, functions, abstractions, and types. We have also used this approach with pre-college students and believe that this style of music education can be adapted to a K12 environment.
