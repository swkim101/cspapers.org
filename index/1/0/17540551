High speed DSP blocks present in the modern FPGAs can be used to implement prime field multiplication to accelerate Elliptic Curve scalar multiplication in prime fields. However, compared to logic slices, DSP blocks are scarce resources, hence its usage needs to be optimized. The asymmetric 25 Ã— 18 signed multipliers in FPGAs open a new paradigm for multiplier design, where operand decomposition becomes equivalent to a tiling problem. Previous literature has reported that for asymmetric multiplier, it is possible to generate a tiling (known as non-standard tiling) which requires less number of DSP blocks compared to standard tiling, generated by school book algorithm. In this paper, we propose a generic technique for such tiling generation and generate this tiling for field multiplication in NIST specified curves. We compare our technique with standard school book algorithm to highlight the improvement. The acceleration in ECC scalar multiplication due to the optimized field multiplier is experimentally validated for P-256. The impact of this accelerated scalar multiplication is shown for the key encapsulation algorithm PSEC-KEM (Provably Secure Key Encapsulation Mechanism).
