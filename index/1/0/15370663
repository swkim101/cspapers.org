On Saturday, May 30, one day before the start of the regular STOC 2009 program, a workshop was held in celebration of Leslie Valiant's 60th birthday. Talks were given by Jin-Yi Cai, Stephen Cook, Vitaly Feldman, Mark Jerrum, Michael Kearns, Mike Paterson, Michael Rabin, Rocco Servedio, Paul Valiant, Vijay Vazirani, and Avi Wigderson. The workshop was organized by Michael Kearns, Rocco Servedio, and Salil Vadhan, with support from the STOC local arrangements team and program committee. To accompany the workshop, here we briefly survey Valiant's many fundamental contributions to the theory of computing.
