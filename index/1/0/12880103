Online social networks have become an imperative channel for extremely fast information propagation and influence. Thus, the problem of finding a minimum number of seed users who can eventually influence as many users in the network as possible has become one of the central research topics recently. Unfortunately, most of related works have only focused on the network topologies and largely ignored many other important factors such as the users' engagements and the negative or positive impacts between users. More challengingly, the behavior of information propagation across multiple networks simultaneously remains an untrodden area and becomes an urgent need. Our work is the first attempt to tackle the above problem in multiple networks, considering these lacking important factors. In order to capture the users' engagement, we propose to targeting the set of interest-matching users whose interests are similar to what we try to propagate. Then, we develop our Iterative Semi-Supervising Learning based approach to identify the minimum seed users. We validate the effectiveness of our solution by using real-world Twitter-Foursquare networks and academic collaboration multiple networks.
