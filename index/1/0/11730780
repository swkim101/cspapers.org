A crucial component of an autonomous mine is the ability to infer rock types from mechanical measurements of a drill rig. The major difficulty lies in that there is not a clear one to one correspondence between the mechanical measurements and the rock type due to the mechanical noise as well as the variety of the rock geology. This paper proposes a novel wavelet feature space projection approach to robustly classify rock types from drilling data with Gaussian Process classification. Instead of applying Gaussian Process classifier directly to the given measurement pieces, a group of wavelet features are extracted from the neighboring region of a specific data point. Gaussian Process classification is then carried out on the new extracted wavelet features. By putting neighboring data points into consideration rather than dealing with each data point individually, the underlying pattern can be better captured and more robust to noise and data variations. Experimental results on synthetic data as well as varied real world drilling data have shown the effectiveness of our approach.
