Humans have always desired to guess the future in order to adapt their behavior and maximize chances of success. In this paper, we conduct exploratory analysis of future-related information on the web. We focus on the future-related information which is grounded in time, that is, the information on forthcoming events whose expected occurrence dates are already known. We collect data by crawling search engine index and analyze collective view of future time-referenced events discussed on the web.
