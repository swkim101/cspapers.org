We first present a protocol to elect a unique leader of a given cycle of the planar square lattice on vertices of which synchronous communicating finite automata are placed, which know the directions of its successor and its predecessor. Thereafter, we extend it to finite parts of the planar grid, giving in both cases the time complexity (twice the length of the cycle, and 12(number of cells)+2 time units).
