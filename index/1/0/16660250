A major challenge in software testing is adequately testing the effects of changes. The goal of my doctoral research is to provide a precise analysis of the effects of changes in software to effectively automate the testing of changes. In this proposal, I first describe my research problem and discuss related work. Then, I present my approach, research questions, work performed so far, and ongoing and future work. Finally, I list the expected contributions of my Thesis.
