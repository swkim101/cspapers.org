In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view learning method for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis, using neuroimaging and genetics data. Generally, there are several major challenges associated with traditional classification methods on multi-source imaging and genetics data. First, the correlation between the extracted imaging features and class labels is generally complex, which often makes the traditional linear models ineffective. Second, medical data may be collected from different sources (i.e., multiple modalities of neuroimaging data, clinical scores or genetics measurements), therefore, how to effectively exploit the complementarity among multiple views is of great importance. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Layer Multi-View Classification (ML-MVC) approach, which regards the multi-view input as the first layer, and constructs a latent representation to explore the complex correlation between the features and class labels. This captures the high-order complementarity among different views, as we exploit the underlying information with a low-rank tensor regularization. Intrinsically, our formulation elegantly explores the nonlinear correlation together with complementarity among different views, and thus improves the accuracy of classification. Finally, the minimization problem is solved by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data sets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
