This opinion paper discusses subjective natural language problems in terms of their motivations, applications, characterizations, and implications. It argues that such problems deserve increased attention because of their potential to challenge the status of theoretical understanding, problem-solving methods, and evaluation techniques in computational linguistics. The author supports a more holistic approach to such problems; a view that extends beyond opinion mining or sentiment analysis.
