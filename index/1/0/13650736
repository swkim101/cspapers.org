Author(s): Rundensteiner, Elke A. | Abstract: It has been widely recognized that object-oriented database (OODB) technology needs to be extended to provide a mechanism similar to views in relational database systems. We define an object-oriented view to be an arbitrarily complex virtual schema graph with possibly restructured generalization and decomposition hierarchies - rather than just one virtual class as has been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we propose a methodology, called MultiView, for supporting multiple such view schemata. MultiView breaks the schema design task into the following independent and well-defined subtasks: (1) the customization of type descriptions and object sets of existing classes by deriving virtual classes, (2) the integration of all derived classes into one consistent global schema graph, and (3) the definition of arbitrarily complex view schemata on this augmented global schema. For the first task of MultiView, we define a set of object algebra operators that can be used by the view definer for class customization. For the second task of MultiView, we propose an algorithm that automatically integrates these newly derived virtual classes into the global schema. We solve the third task of MultiView by first letting the view definer explicitly select the desired view classes from the global schema using a view definition language and then by automatically generating a view class hierarchy for these selected classes. In addition, we present algorithms that verify the closure property of a view and, if found to be incomplete, transform it into a closed, yet minimal, view. In this paper, we introduce the fundamental concept of view independence and show MultiView to be view independent. We also outline implementation techniques for realizing MultiView with existing OODB technology.
