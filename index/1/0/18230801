We present a reactive multi-agent push system for a large set of objects. The behavior for the pushing agents consists of: 1) selecting and updating an object set to push, 2) reaching positions near the objects to start influencing, 3) pushing the objects along a path to the goal region, and 4) regrouping when needed to ensure the group is packed tightly enough. The emergent properties of the behavior allow us to test how effectively a group of agents can push a set of objects through the environment with different strategies.
