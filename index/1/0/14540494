Finite element method (FEM) must be created the element mesh, it is very tedious and time-consuming. A novel meshless method doesn't require generating the element mesh, it reduces a large amount of computational and human time. The shape parameter plays a key role of meshless methods, the authors usually choose the shape parameter by trial and error or some other ad-hoc means. This study will propose LOOCV-GRBFCM to choose a "GOOD" shape parameter and solve problems automatically and practically. Performance evaluations will also be presented. We hope these results to support useful suggestions.
