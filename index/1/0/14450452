The environment desirable for the teaching of systems software programming is described, and after examining some current systems a need for a high level language available on a minicomputer with minimal hardware is exhibited. The OLGA language, designed to fill that need, is described. Included in the language are a form of data abstraction, type declarations, modules, and procedures, functions and operators. Access to objects, local or non-local, is controlled by explicit declaration. The compiler for OLGA is one-pass, and fits in 3K words of memory. A cluster of LSI-11s which makes use of the minimal hardware property of OLGA is described. The cluster is a very economical way of increasing access to a software development system.
