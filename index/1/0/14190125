A representation for robot plans is proposed. The representation of a given plan reflects the structure of the process which produced the plan. This information is useful in both the original construction of the plan and its subsequent modification if unforeseen events cause execution failures. A programmed system that constructs and executes (in simulation) plans for journeys using a large system of public transport is described to illustrate the advantages of the representation. It is also shown how the representation could be used for more typical robot-planning worlds.
