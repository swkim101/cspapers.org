We present a novel fine-grained semantic representation of text and an approach to constructing it. This representation is largely extractable by today's technologies and facilitates more detailed semantic analysis. We discuss the requirements driving the representation, suggest how it might be of value in the automated tutoring domain, and provide evidence of its validity.
