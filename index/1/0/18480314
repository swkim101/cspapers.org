We give two algorithms for hidden surface removal with respect to a moving viewpoint. The first algorithm preprocesses the set A of scene polygons to build a certain cylindrical partition H(A) of R3 of at most quadratic, but typically much smaller, size. After this any given viewpoiut v can be located in H(A) in poly-logarithmic time, and the view visible from v can be constructed in time proportional to the size of the complex View(o) n H(A) (up to a log factor), where View(v) is the star shaped polyhedron consisting of the visible points in R3. The second algorithm is designed to exploit coherence between successive scenes in case the view point is moving on a linear trajectory. Once the scene at the initial viewpoint is constructed, it generates all successive scenes on the the trajectory in time that is proportional to the number of â€œsemi-opaquen topological changes in the scene, as the viewpoint is moved on its trajectory continuously. The algorithm is based on a certain View Dependent Partition (VDP) of R3 that is induced by the scene polygons. It depends on the position as well as the trajectory of the view point. It is used to predict efficiently when and where the topological changes in the scene occur. A nice feature of the above algorithm, based on VDP, is that it can be easily extended to deal with moving scene polygons as well, assuming that the trajectories of the scene vertices are rationally parametrized by t and have a bounded degree.
