We present the first truly streaming cross document coreference resolution (CDC) system. Processing infinite streams of mentions forces us to use a constant amount of memory and so we maintain a representative, fixed sized sample at all times. For the sample to be representative it should represent a large number of entities whilst taking into account both temporal recency and distant references. We introduce new sampling techniques that take into account a notion of streaming discourse (current mentions depend on previous mentions). Using the proposed sampling techniques we are able to get a CEAFe score within 5% of a non-streaming system while using only 30% of the memory.
