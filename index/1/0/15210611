We consider the search and secure problem, where intruders are to be detected in a bounded area without allowing them to escape. The problem is tackled by representing the area to be searched as a traversability graph, which is reduced to a tree graph by placing stationary robots to remove loops. The search of the remaining tree is performed using two strategies that represent different trade-offs between the needed search time and the number of robots. Proof of correctness is provided for these two strategies. The proposed algorithm was implemented and demonstrated as part of an outfield experiment involving a team of Rotundus spherical robots.
