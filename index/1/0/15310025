Different from traditional information retrieval, both content and structure are critical to the success of Web information retrieval. In recent years, many relevance propagation techniques have been proposed to propagate content information between web pages through web structure to improve the performance of web search. In this paper, we first propose a generic relevance propagation framework, and then provide a comparison study on the effectiveness and efficiency of various representative propagation models that can be derived from this generic framework. We come to many conclusions that are useful for selecting a propagation model in real-world search applications, including 1) sitemap-based propagation models outperform hyperlink-based models in sense of both effectiveness and efficiency, and 2) sitemap-based term propagation is easier to be integrated into real-world search engines because of its parallel offline implementation and acceptable complexity. Some other more detailed study results are also reported in the paper.
