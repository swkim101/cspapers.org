We investigate the maximum number C(P) of arguments of P that must be tested in order to compute P, a Boolean function of d Boolean arguments. We present evidence for the general conjecture that C(P)=d whenever P(0d) @@@@ P(1d) and P is left invariant by a transitive permutation group acting on the arguments. A non-constructive argument (not based on the construction of an “oracle”) proves the generalized conjecture for d a prime power. We use this result to prove the Aanderaa-Rosenberg conjecture by showing that at least v2/9 entries of the adjacency matrix of a v-vertex undirected graph G must be examined in the worst case to determine if G has any given non-trivial monotone graph property.
