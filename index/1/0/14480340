This paper describes the teaching of computer design using a new and quite unusual hardware aid, macromodules. Of all the new areas emerging in Computer Science the teaching of computer structures, from an engineering viewpoint, has continually challenged the professional educator. This has in a sense presented a dilemma to him: for digital computer system design requires a broad look at a variety of configurations, but also seems to require a comprehensive examination of individual circuit details in order to remain in a practical atmosphere. As is well known, such detailed investigation of many systems is virtually impossible in the time allotted in most cirricula.
 Introduction of the macromodular concept, however, has permitted individual students, in one or two semesters, to achieve realizabledesigns of such devices as I/O channels, microprogrammed machines, complete small digital computers, floating point arithmetic systems and list processing hardware.
