We propose to use the microcomputer in a network to share I/O resources such as printers and archival memories. A model of a network is developed where computers correspond to edges of a graph. This model reflects the desired characteristics of the microcomputer organization. The advantage of virtual memory in these microcomputers is discussed. Herein, pages in the virtual memory are packets in the network. Packets and requests for packets are generated by page faults and packets are stored and forwarded by hardware like that to manage virtual memory pages. The paper discusses the strategy for a micronetwork and suggests an implementation of the hardware of such a network.
