Within the last three years, we have experimented a Master Program centered on object-oriented technology. This paper reports on the feasability of the approach and gives our first conclusions on this experiment. It suggests many ways to improve such a curriculum. We are now completely convinced that the pedagogical scheme we have choosen may be successfully applied in different contexts and we give some hints that may help to generalize this experiment. One of our main conclusions is that a complete program targeted towards object-oriented programming is probably not a good idea. On the contrary, a cursus on advanced software technology, completely based on various forms of the object model, is an efficient and promising way to produce highly skilled software professionals that will be immediatly operational in various domains and that will easily adapt to the forthcoming rapid software technology changes. The object model has been recognized as a natural guide to structure the various topics that constitutes a complete software engineering curriculum.
