We study the average case performance of the Best Fit algorithm for on-line bin packing under the distribution U{j, k}, in which the item sizes are uniformly distributed in the discrete range { l/lc, 2/k,. . . ,j/k}. Our main result is that, in the case j = k 2, the expected waste for an infinite stream of items remains bounded. This settles an open problem posed recently by Coffman et al (41. It is also the first result which involves a detailed analysis of the infinite multi-dimensional Markov chain underlying the algorithm.
