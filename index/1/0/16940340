Predicting the future has always been one of the main aims of human beings in order to adapt their behavior and max- imize their chances of success. With the advent of the Web, which indexes a wealth of temporal information, a great number of research have been proposed in the area of Tem- poral Information Retrieval, but Future Retrieval has re- mained a difficult problem to handle. In this paper, we pro- pose to understand what the future is about. In particular, we present an exploratory study to understand how the tem- poral features impact upon the classiffication and clustering of different \genres" of future-related texts.
