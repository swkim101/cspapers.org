Over the years, the notion of concept relatedness has attracted considerable attention. A variety of approaches, based on ontology structure, information content, association, or context have been proposed to indicate the relatedness of abstract ideas. We propose a method based on the cross entropy reduction between language models of concepts which are estimated based on document-concept assignments. The approach shows improved or competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods on two test sets in the biomedical domain.
