This video presents the complete procedure for the optimal setup of the DLR MiroSurge telerobotic system for minimally invasive surgery. Two key features are implemented. First, optimization algorithms preoperatively determine several setups that are then rated and selected by the surgeon. Second, the intraoperative situation is taken into account. The newly developed VR-Map device together with fast registration and optimization algorithms enable a quick procedure to assure the optimal patient-specific setup of the robotic system.
