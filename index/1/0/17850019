Identifying new intrusion exploits and developing effecti ve detection signatures for them is essential for protecting computer networks. We present Nemean, a system for automatic generation of intrusion signatures from honeynet packet traces. Our architecture i s distinguished by its emphasis on a modular design frameworkthat encourages independent development and modification o f system components and protocol semantic awareness which allows construction of signatures that greatly reduc e false alarms. The building blocks of our architecture include transport and s ervice normalization, intrusion profile clustering and automata learning that generates connection and sessio n aware signatures. We evaluate our architecture through a prototype implementation that demonstra tes the potential of semantic-aware, resilient signatures. For example, signatures generated by Nemean fo r NetBIOS exploits had a 0% false-positive rate and a 0.04% false-negative rate.
