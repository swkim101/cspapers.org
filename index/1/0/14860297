We address the development of efficient methods for performing data redistribution of arrays on distributed-memory machines. Data redistribution is important for the distributed-memory implementation of data parallel languages such as High Performance Fortran. An algebraic representation of regular data distributions is used to develop an analytical model for evaluating the communication cost of data redistribution. Using this algebraic representation and the analytical model, an approach to communication-efficient data redistribution is developed. Implementation results on the Intel iPSC/860 are reported.
