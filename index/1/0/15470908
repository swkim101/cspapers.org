We describe an approach to developing object-oriented applications that seeks to integrate the design of user tasks with the design of software implementing these tasks. Using the Scenario Browser an experimental environment for developing Small talk applications a designer employs a single set of task scenarios to envision and reason about user needs and concerns and to experiment with and refine object-oriented software abstractions. We argue that the shared context provided by the scenarios promotes rapid feedback between usage and software concerns, so that mutual constraints and opportunities can be recognized and addressed early and continuingly in the development process.
