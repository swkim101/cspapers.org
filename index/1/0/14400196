Two main performance measures of Web caching systems are cache hit rate and cache byte hit rate. Cache hit rate is calculated as the number of the user-requested Web objects that are answered by the cache divided by the total number of the requested objects. Cache byte hit rate is defined as the number of bytes served from cached content divided by the total number of bytes served. Achieving the highest hit rate and byte hit rate under given resource constraints is one of the primary goals of Web caching. Prefetching is a Web caching technique that caches Web objects in anticipation of usersâ€™ future needs [4]. This paper studies the problem of cache storage allocation in Web prefetching techniques. Cache storage allocation has been a central topic in Web caching, e.g., in replacement techniques. These techniques, however, are not applicable to prefetching. To the best of our knowledge, storage allocation in the prefetching context has not been studied in the literature despite its potentially significant impact on caching performance. In this paper, we intend to fill this gap by developing analytical models of this problem and examining the effectiveness of various allocation policies.
