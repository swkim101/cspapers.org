The FSA Simulator is a Java program created to allow computer science students to experiment with finite state automata. The program is able to simulate both deterministic and nondeterministic automata. Pre-defined automata can be loaded from files or students can create their own. Although this project is similar to others, it has its own unique features. The development history, features, and future plans for this program are discussed.
