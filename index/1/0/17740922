We present a novel action recognition method which is based on combining the effective description properties of Local Binary Patterns with the appearance invariance and adaptability of patch matching based methods. The resulting method is extremely efficient, and thus is suitable for real-time uses of simultaneous recovery of human action of several lengths and starting points. Tested on all publicity available datasets in the literature known to us, our system repeatedly achieves state of the art performance. Lastly, we present a new benchmark that focuses on uncut motion recognition in broadcast sports video.
