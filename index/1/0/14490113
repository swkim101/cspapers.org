We propose a framework for efficient storing and scalable browsing of surveillance video based on video synopsis. Our framework employs a novel synopsis analysis scheme named Detail-based video synopsis to generate a set of object flags to store and browse surveillance video synopsis. The main contributions of our work are: 1) highlighting important contents of surveillance video; 2) improving the storage efficiency of original video and synopsis video; 3) realizing multi-scale scalable browsing of synopsis video while reserving essential information. The experiments of implementing the framework are shown compared with the previous independent storage method of original video and synopsis video.
