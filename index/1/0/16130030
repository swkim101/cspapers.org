Two major problems in schema integration are to identify correspondences between different conceptual schemas and to verify that the proposed correspondences are consistent with the semantics of the schemas. We propose a heuristic method, based on the use of Galois lattices, for identifying schema correspondences. We show how the results of this method can be checked for correctness by introducing a number of necessary conditions for schema mergeability. These conditions are formulated in the context of a semantically rich modelling formalism, the distinguishing feature of which is the use of case grammar.
