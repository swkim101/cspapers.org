In this paper, a closed-loop strategy for controlling the transient regime of Marangoni flows and thus to selectively manipulate and separate micro-particles is reported. Marangoni flows were generated by an infrared laser as a heat source. Simulations of the transient regime of Marangoni flows were performed with COMSOL Multiphysics to analyze the temperature field and velocity profile. The convection cell dynamic growth was controlled with the laser beam exposure time. Then, selected particles, glass beads ranging from 150 up to 212 Î¼m, were dragged by small convection flows without reaching undesired particles. The closed-loop control improved the manipulation speed and precision in comparison to manual manipulation.
