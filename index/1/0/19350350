Conventional yield optimization approaches rely on accurate yield estimation for given design parameters, which would be computational intensive. In this paper, a novel Bayesian yield optimization approach is proposed for analog and SRAM circuits. An equivalent problem is formulated via applying Bayes' theorem on the augmented yield problem. The yield optimization problem is converted to identifying the design parameters with maximal probability density conditioning on the event that the corresponding circuit is “pass”. Gaussian kernel density estimation is employed to approximate the conditional probability, and a multi-start-point based EM-like algorithm is proposed to solve the equivalent problem efficiently. Compared with the state-of-the-art yield optimization approaches, the proposed method can significantly reduce the number of circuit simulations with comparable optimization accuracy by avoiding repetitive yield estimations.
