This paper investigates active dynamic running of a planar telescopic-legged rimless wheel. Unlike the most dynamic runners with compliant legs, our model achieves stable limit-cycle running only by a simple extension control of the stance leg. We first generate a stable running gait by adjusting the desired settling time for the leg-extension control. We then analyze the gait efficiency with respect to the change of the desired settling time. Furthermore, several extensions, comparison with walking gait and running up slopes, are discussed.
