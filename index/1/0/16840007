We propose an object-oriented model for uniform treatment of parametric databases, of which temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and ordinary data are special cases. The integration of different forms of parametric data is achieved through the concept of dimension alignment. Such alignment is automatically handled by the system at the query level, yeikling a seamless interface for a user. We clarify the role of object identity in obtaining a good query language for object-oriented parametric databases.
