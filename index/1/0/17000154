After briefly summarizing the mechanical design of the two joint prototypes for the new DLR variable compliance arm, the paper exemplifies the dynamic modelling of one of the prototypes and proposes a generic variable stiffness joint model for nonlinear control design. Based on this model, the design of a simple, gain scheduled state feedback controller for active vibration damping of the mechanically very weakly damped joint is presented. Moreover, the computation of the motor reference values out of the desired stiffness and position is addressed. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate the proposed methods.
