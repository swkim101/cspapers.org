Two robust kinematic controllers for position trajectory tracking of a perturbed wheeled mobile robot are presented. We address a final objective of fixed-time pose-regulation, which means that the robot position and orientation must reach desired final values simultaneously in a user-defined time. To achieve that, we propose the robust tracking of adequate trajectories for position, which drives the robot to get a desired final orientation due to the nonholonomic motion constraint. Hence, the main contribution of the paper is a complete strategy to define adequate reference trajectories as well as robust controllers to track them in order to enforce the pose-regulation of a wheeled mobile robot in a desired time. Realistic simulations show the good performance of the proposed scheme even in the presence of strong disturbances.
