An automatic method for solving the problem of view planning in high-resolution industrial inspection is presented. The method's goal is to maximize the visual coverage, and to minimize the number of cameras used for inspection. Using a CAD model of the object of interest, we define the scene-points and the viewpoints, with the later being the solution space. The problem formulation accurately encapsulates all the vision- and task-related requirements of the design process for inspection systems. We use a graph-based approach to formulate a solution for the problem. The solution is implemented as a greedy algorithm, and the method is validated through experiments.
