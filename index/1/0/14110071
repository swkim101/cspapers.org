The Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST) is a fundamental and widely studied structure. In the approximate version we are given an n-element point set P in Rd and an error parameter e > 0, and the objective is to compute a spanning tree over P whose weight is at most (1 + e) times that of the true minimum spanning tree. Assuming that d is a fixed constant, existing algorithms have running times that (up to logarithmic factors) grow as O(n/eΩ(d)). We present an algorithm whose running time is O(n log n+(e−2 log2 1/e)n). Thus, this is the first algorithm for approximate EMSTs that eliminates the exponential e dependence on dimension. (Note that the O-notation conceals a constant factor of the form O(1)d.) The algorithm is deterministic and very simple.
