We present a design system shell which can be used to experiment with principles of design and be used as a design tool where complex layers of information need to be specified about objects, such as in database design. The shell can be tailored to a variety of application areas. It is object-oriented in its implementation and structure. Objects and messages are used as the specification language. The basic ingredients of a rule-based production system are provided, with rules treated as objects and defined independently of the classes to which they are applied.
