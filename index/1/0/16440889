This paper presents a new Moving Object Detection and Localization (MODEL) system, which is based on the smallscale fading of RF signal strength and independent from the salient characteristics of both the device and the sensor. We first validated the feasibility of applying small-scale fading effects to moving object detection and localization through experimental analysis. Then, we introduced MODEL: an embedded network system which adopts an easily-realized Rolling-Window algorithm. We applied the Region-Partition method to determine the position of the moving object, and concluded that the precision of the object position is dependant upon the density of participating nodes. MODEL is also scalable to other wireless network infrastructures and adaptable to various environments without the need for complex and time consuming training.
