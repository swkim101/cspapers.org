Tactile displays simulate skin deformations that occur when interacting with real surfaces (relieves) by transmitting small-scale shape information and vibration to the fingertip. In this paper, we present a new tactile interface VT (vector-touch) that is based on a rod network positioned in parallel to each other, electric motors to induce a rotation and a positioning mechanism that allows rotating rods to be positioned at different interspaces. Using a rather limited number of actuators, the rods can be driven in such manner to obtain various types of relieves or surface qualities.
