â€” The electric power transmission systems of tomorrow must incorporate advanced hardware and software technologies to increase reliable long-distance power transfer. While new hardware technologies can improve transmission system capabilities, software technologies are also needed to coordinate these hardware technologies safely, securely, and effectively. To prevent system failures, future transmission systems must (1) integrate advanced hardware and software technologies across new and existing facilities, (2) allow revolutionary improvements in power grid utilization, and (3) still offer verifiable assurance of system safety even in the face of faults or malicious attack. To achieve these goals, advances are needed in the security and networking of distributed real-time and embedded systems, particularly in support of system-wide monitoring and distributed computer-based transmission control to detect and react promptly to changing system conditions. These capabilities are needed to protect the grid not only against traditional threats to reliability (such as storms and other natural events), but also against deliberate disruptions.
