Now that mobile robots are getting tested more and more in challenging areas, difficulties in control, particularly when the robot cannot be seen, have appeared. In this research a mobile snake robot with actuated wheels is given the ability to sense its surroundings through its wheels by 3DOF force sensors, so that semi-autonomous control can be realized. This will simplify necessary operator commands and improve situation awareness through information feedback.
