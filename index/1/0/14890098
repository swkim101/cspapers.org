This paper describes the methodology to deal with the behavior of a dynamical system such as plant controllers in the framework of Temporal Logic. Many important concepts of the dynamical system like stability or observability are represented in this framework. As a reasoning method, we present an w -graph approach which enables us to represent the dynamical behavior of a given system, and an automatic synthesis of control rules can be reduced to a simple decision procedure on the w -graph. Moreover, the typical reasoning about the time-dependent system such as a causal argument or a qualitative simulation can be also treated on the w -graph in the same way.
