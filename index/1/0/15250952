In this paper a perception approach allowing for high distinctiveness is presented. The method works in accordance to the fingerprint concept. Such representation allows using a very flexible matching approach based on the minimum energy algorithm. The whole extraction and matching approach is presented in details and viewed in a topological optic, where the matching result can directly be used as observation function for a topological localization approach. The experimentation section will validate the fingerprint approach and present different set of experiments in order to explain practically the choice of different types of features.
