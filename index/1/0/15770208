“ULTSON” is a 2D code which solves the elastodynamic equations in a regular structured mesh. It has been developed at EDF to be used for non-destructive testing of nuclear power plants. Today, the code runs on classical architectures like Cray (YMP or C90), and workstations. Taking into account the execution times and memory requirements, to study ultrasonic wave propagation in the 3D case seems difficult today. In this context, our first purpose was to evaluate what can be gained with other architectures, like parallel systems, after optimizing as much as possible the sequential algorithm in the 2D case. Our second purpose was to extend our development to the 3D case and to present some results in the case of the propagation of a wave due to a local sudden variation of pressure. Calculations have been done on different architectures (CM5, IPSC860, Paragon) in order to do comparisons.
