In order to improve the supplier selection and matching supply with demand for third party logistics integrated platform, this paper proposes a three-layer evaluation index system for supply and demand matching considering factors of service areas and cooperation experiences, establishes a supply and demand matching model based on neural network. This model perfectly simulates the process of fuzzy integral diagnosis, with corresponding parameters of adaptive learning and training index systems of fuzzy neural network. Experiments show that this model can effectively evaluate comprehensive abilities of suppliers, with high level of accuracy and feasibility.
