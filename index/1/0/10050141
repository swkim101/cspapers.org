Signal processing capabilities of biological neurons are investigated. Temporally coded signals in neurons can be multiplexed to increase the transmission capacity. Multiplexing of signal is suggested in bi-threshold neurons with "high-threshold" and "low-threshold" for switching firing modes. To extract the signal embedded in the interspike-intervals of firing, the encoded signal are demultiplexed and multiplexed by a network of neurons with delayed-line circuitry for signal processing. The temporally coded input signal is transformed spatially by mapping the firing intervals topographically to the output of the network, thus decoding the specific firing interspike-intervals. The network also provides a band-pass filtering capability where the variability of the timing of the original signal can be decoded.
