We present a feature selection method for solving sparse regularization problem, which has a composite regularization of lp norm and l∞ norm. We use proximal gradient method to solve this lp, l∞ operator problem, where a simple but efficient algorithm is designed to minimize a relatively simple objective function, which contains a vector of l2 norm and l∞ norm. Proposed method brings some insight for solving sparsity-favoring norm, and extensive experiments are conducted to characterize the effect of varying p and to compare with other approaches on real world multi-class and multilabel datasets.
