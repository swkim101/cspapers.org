Even to one who has lived long enough to receive many awards, the recognition of distinguished achievement from the scientific community in oneâ€™s own research field is surprisingly welcome. I particularly treasure the SIGPLAN citation for my award, which singles out exactly the modest achievements of which I am most proud. I have known nearly all the previous winners of this award, and they number among my professional colleagues, rivals, and friends. I have derived inspiration from them all, and I am pleased to be regarded in their company. The award prompts me to reflect again on the origins and progress of my professional career: how did I select the topics for my research? What methods did I consider appropriate for an academic researcher to pursue such research? What is the current level of maturity of research on these topics? What does the future hold for it? Why do I regard my renewed interest in unifying theories as a contribution to that future?
