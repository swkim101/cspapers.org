Version control is one of the most important lunctions which need to be supported in integrated computer-aided design (CAD) systems. In this paper we address a broad spectrum of semantic and operational issues in version control for a public/private distributed architecture of CAD syslems. The research issues we address include the semantics of version creation and manipulation, version na.ming and name binding, a.nd version change notification. We develop solutions to these issues under a unifying framework, and discuss implementation and application interface issues.
