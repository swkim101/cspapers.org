Although WSRF (Web Services Resource Framework) and Java-based hosting environment have been successful in dealing with the heterogeneity of resources and the diversity of applications, the current Grid middleware has several limitations to support on-demand resource provisioning effectively.
 This paper proposes DynaGrid, a new framework for WSRF-compliant applications. Many new components, such as Service Door, Dynamic Service Launcher (DSL), Client Proxy, and Partition Manager, have been introduced to offer adaptive, scalable, and reliable resource provisioning. All of these components are implemented as standard WSRF-compliant Web services, hence DynaGrid is complementary to the existing Grid middleware. The experimental evaluations are performed on a real test bed with practical applications including the Map Reduce application. The results indicate that DynaGrid effectively utilizes Grid resources by allocating only the required number of resources adaptively according to the amount of incoming requests, providing both the scalability and the reliability at the same time.
