A team of robots sharing a common goal can benefit from coordination of the activities of team members, helping the team to reach the goal more reliably or quickly. We address the problem of coordinating the actions of a team of robots with periodic communication capability executing an information gathering task. We cast the problem as a multi-agent optimal decision-making problem with an information theoretic objective function. We show that appropriate techniques for solving decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) are applicable in such information gathering problems. We quantify the usefulness of coordinated information gathering through simulation studies, and demonstrate the feasibility of the method in a real-world target tracking domain.
