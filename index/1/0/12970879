The conference theme - "Leveraging Computing to Change Education" - focuses on the influence of computing on the way we educate at all levels. In this paper we highlight the conference theme from the perspective of computer science (CS) teacher preparation and describe the Views program, launched at the Technion -- Israel Institute of Technology, two year ago. Views invites Technion graduates back to the Technion to study toward an additional bachelor's degree in the Department of Education in Science and Technology. The degree they earn includes a high school teaching certificate in one of eight tracks: math, physics, biology, chemistry, CS, environmental sciences, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Views students receive full study scholarships and are not required to commit to work in the education system after graduation. In the paper, we (a) present the Views program; (b) analyze factors that motivate and demotivate CS graduates to enroll in the program; (c) describe the characteristics of students in the program and their contribution to the learning environments and (d) address hopes with respect to the expected future impact of the Views program on the education system in Israel in general and on CS education in particular.
