This retrospective study of the performance of Computer Information Systems (CIS) students from between 1987 and 2010 found evidence that remedial math, reading, and writing courses can significantly increase student mean GPA, persistence, and completion in a CIS program. Remediation was most effective when verbal as well as mathematical deficiencies were addressed, and the performance of fully remediated students was indistinguishable as a group from students not requiring remediation.
