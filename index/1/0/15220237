This paper describes the development of a database to support three-dimensional image reconstruction of structural biology using objectoriented technology. The requirements of this system encompass many of the popular justifications for the application of object-oriented technology, such as non-standard data types and complex composite data, but we also find advantage in the increased functionality obtained for spatial relationship operations and access methods. We focus attention on the implementation of the spatial data, its representation, operations, indexing, and queries.
