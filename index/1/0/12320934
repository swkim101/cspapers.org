The primary information technologies, microelectronics and photonics, continue to improve their performance at extraordinary rates and are not expected to reach any fundamental theoretical limitations before the turn of the century.
In his keynote address, Ian Ross will review progress in information technologies to date, consider its prospects and assess the emerging technologies and systems that may follow, with an emphasis on the engineering challenges ahead.
In 1963, Dr. Ross received the Morris N. Liebmann Award from the Institute of Radio Engineers, now a part of the IEEE. In 1969 and 1975 he received the Public Service Group Achievement Award from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Dr. Ross is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in April 1973. In May 1981, he was elected to a Fellowship in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in April 1982.
