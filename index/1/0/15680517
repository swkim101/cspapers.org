Recently, digital art plays a more and more important role in various kinds of performance arts. Not only do the performers have more performing forms, but the audiences also receive the performing messages from the stage in completely different ways as compared to before. Moreover, the performers and the audiences can do the interaction with each others. In this paper, we try to establish an interactive system to control the lights of the stage. We wish the user can use the system to create their own stage by themselves. This study is aimed to explore the following two concerns: (1) How can we provide the audiences better interaction by combining music and lights? (2) How to make the audiences emotionally fulfilled by interacting with the system? The experimental results show that the user can enjoy the interaction by his own way and create different light effect with the music. At the same time, the users believe the system can became more useful and expandable and feel satisfied.
