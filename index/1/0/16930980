Buuer replacement is a classic research problem in database management. It has been extensively studied , and new strategies continue to be proposed. While existing strategies (e.g. LRU, LFU) use heuristics to determine which page to replace when there is a page fault, this paper presents a diierent approach, called BROOM, that is based on two ideas: for robust performance (e.g. regardless of buuer size), the replacement policy must (1) \know" something about the patterns of page references, and (2) imitate the optimum ooine policy. BROOM requires that historical reference streams be mined periodically to extract knowledge about current patterns in page access. It then uses this knowledge for online buuer replacement by imitating the optimum strategy. Simulation results are presented to show that BROOM sometimes has the best hit rates, but seldom the worst, over a wide range of system conngurations and reference patterns.
