This poster describes the main features provided by the Sapienza University Networking framework for underwater Simulation Emulation and real-life Testing (SUNSET) [1]. Particularly, we focus on the innovations and improvements introduced in SUNSET v2 after several years of in field experimentation. All the results collected during the different sea trials (considering sea, fjord, lake and river scenarios) have shown how SUNSET represents a robust, reliable and flexible solutions for in field tests where a network of heterogeneous devices is considered, with different acoustic modems, sensing devices and underwater vehicles.
