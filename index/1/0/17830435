In this paper, we propose a novel decoding algorithm for discriminative joint Chinese word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and parsing. Previous work often used a pipeline method -- Chinese word segmentation followed by POS tagging and parsing, which suffers from error propagation and is unable to leverage information in later modules for earlier components. In our approach, we train the three individual models separately during training, and incorporate them together in a unified framework during decoding. We extend the CYK parsing algorithm so that it can deal with word segmentation and POS tagging features. As far as we know, this is the first work on joint Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing. Our experimental results on Chinese Tree Bank 5 corpus show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art pipeline system.
