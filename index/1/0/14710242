Jericho is a reactive computing engine capable of supporting advanced high user-intensity applications systems. It has four primary architectural characteristics:
 1. A user-dedicated computing environment
 2. Direct execution of high-level programming languages
 3. High bandwidth communication between user and system
 4. High bandwidth communication between user-support machines and the other machines the task environment.
 Each of these architectural components will be described further, followed by a discussion of the Jericho hardware.
