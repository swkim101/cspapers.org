Due to the wide use of the Internet and information technology, there are many attractive services provided in the network environment. Since the Internet is a public environment, a user must pass the authentication before using these services. Also, due to the reduced cost of the RFID tags, RFID technologies are widely used in various information applications. In this paper, we propose a mutual authentication RFID scheme for multiserver environment. Since in our proposed scheme, the tag only needs random number generation and one-way hash function operations, the computation cost for the tags is low. Our scheme does not need to store any verification table in the server and the registration center. Our proposed scheme can withstand all well-known security attacks, and can achieve anonymity for the tag.
