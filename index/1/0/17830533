It is generafly believed that words, rather than characters, should be the smallest indexing unit for Chinese text retrieval systems, and that it is essential to have a comprehensive Chinese dictionary or lexicon for Chhmse text retrieval systems to do well. Chinese text has no delimiters to mark woni boundaries. As a result, any text retrieval systems that build word-based indexes need to segment text into words. We implemented several statistical and dictionary-hazed word segmentation methods to study the effect on retrieval effectiveness of different segmentation methods using the TREC-S Chinese test collection and topics. The results show that, for all three sets of queries, the simple bigram indexing and the purely statistical word segmentation perform better than the popular dictionary-based maximum matching method with a dictionary of 138,955 entries.
