The Manchester Data-Flow Machine, MDFM, has evolved continuously during the past decade. By the time the prototype uniprocessor hardware system was decommissioned, in 1989, the putative multi-processor architecture comprised separate Processing Elements and Structure Store Units, together with a “global” Allocator and Throttle Unit, all linked by a packet-based Interconnection Switch.
The decisions leading to this design are well documented in the literature, but some of the reasoning behind these decisions is now out-of-date. This paper looks afresh at the MDFM architecture, in the light of new hardware and software technology and the new state-of-the-art in data-flow computing, and derives an updated architecture, NMDFM, for a Manchester-style multi-processor system. The variable parameters of the NMDFM are investigated in an attempt to find an “optimum” set for future simulation studies.
