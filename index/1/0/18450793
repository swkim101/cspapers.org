There is a requirement for a stronger treatment of intentional concepts and more general inferential ability within database systems. A framework for achieving this will be described in terms of extensions to an object data model.
The type Concept is introduced into the model as a subtype of Action. Intentional concepts may then be defined as filters or generators, depending on the nature of the defining formula. In either case, the dual action should be availableâ€”provided automatically by the system or explicitly by the user.
Finally, sets and types are treated as special cases of extensional concepts, leading to a novel structure of the hierarchy of system types.
