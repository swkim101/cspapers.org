This paper introduces a method for computational analysis of move structures in abstracts of research articles. In our approach, sentences in a given abstract are analyzed and labeled with a specific move in light of various rhetorical functions. The method involves automatically gathering a large number of abstracts from the Web and building a language model of abstract moves. We also present a prototype concordancer, CARE, which exploits the move-tagged abstracts for digital learning. This system provides a promising approach to Web-based computer-assisted academic writing.
