This research focuses on mining ordinances (local laws) and public reactions to them expressed on social media. We place particular emphasis on ordinances and tweets relating to Smart City Characteristics (SCCs), since an important aim of our work is to assess how well a given region heads towards a Smart City. We rely on SCCs as a nexus between a seemingly infinite number of ordinances and tweets to be able to map them, and also to facilitate SCC-based opinion mining later for providing feedback to urban agencies based on public reactions. Common sense knowledge is harnessed in our approach to reflect human judgment in mapping. This paper presents our research in ordinance and tweet mapping with SCCs, including the proposed mapping approach, our initial experiments, related discussion, and future work emerging therein. To the best of our knowledge, ours is among the first works to conduct mining on ordinances and tweets for Smart Cities. This work has a broader impact with a vision to enhance Smart City growth.
