In this paper a strategy to control the motion of platoon of autonomous vehicles is presented. The proposed technique is based on the definition of suitable task functions that are handled in the framework of singularity-robust task-priority inverse kinematics. The algorithm is implemented by two-stage control architecture such that inter-vehicle communication is not required. The possible definition of several task functions of interest is discussed and the effectiveness of the approach is investigated by means of numerical simulation case studies.
