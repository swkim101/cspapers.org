We consider degree bounded network design problems with element and vertex connectivity requirements. In the degree bounded Survivable Network Design (SNDP) problem, the input is an undirected graph G = (V, E) with weights w(e) on the edges and degree bounds b(v) on the vertices, and connectivity requirements r(uv) for each pair uv of vertices. The goal is to select a minimum-weight subgraph H of G that meets the connectivity requirements and it satisfies the degree bounds on the vertices: for each pair uv of vertices, H has r(uv) disjoint paths between u and v; additionally, each vertex v is incident to at most b(v) edges in H. We give the first (O(1), O(1) · b(v)) bicriteria approximation algorithms for the degree-bounded SNDP problem with element connectivity requirements and for several degree-bounded SNDP problems with vertex connectivity requirements. Our algorithms construct a subgraph H whose weight is at most O(1) times the optimal such that each vertex v is incident to at most O(1) · b(v) edges in H. We can also extend our approach to network design problems in directed graphs with out-degree constraints to obtain (O(1), O(1) · b+(v)) bicriteria approximation.
