This paper is a contribution to the generic problem of having simple and accurate models to dimension radio cells with data traffic on a GPRS or EDGE network. It addresses the issue of capacity limitation in a given cell due to coupling with other cells because of a central equipment or transmission link of limited capacity. A mobile station can't access the requested resource although it is alone in a cell. The traffic on other coupled cells leads to reach the global capacity limit. Our objective is to avoid the derivation of any multi-dimensional Markovian (or semi-Markovian) model, where each dimension corresponds to a given cell of the system. Such direct extensions would be of non-manageable complexity. Instead we derive an analytical model that captures in an aggregate way the coupling between cells. We show that the performance parameters of the GPRS/EDGE network can be derived quickly and with a very good accuracy. Finally, as our modeling framework allows very fast computations, we show how to use it to perform complex iterative dimensioning studies.
