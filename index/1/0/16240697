How can grammar be viewed as a functional part of a cognitive system? Given a neural basis for the processing control paradigm of language performance, what roles does "grammar" play? Is there evidence to suggest that grammatical processing can be independent from other aspects of language processing?This paper will focus on these issues and suggest answers within the context of one computational solution. The example model of sentence comprehension, HOPE, is intended to demonstrate both representational considerations for a grammar within such a system as well as to illustrate that by interpreting a grammar as a feedback control mechanism of a "neural-like" process, additional insights into language processing can be obtained.
