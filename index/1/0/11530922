Handling mode changes is one of the most complex and important problems for real-time systems designers. The challenge is to move a system from running one set of software to another while still achieving the quality of service guarantees necessary. There has been previous work which concentrated on how to perform scheduling and timing analysis of mode changes. However, a common theme of all this research is that if the system's schedule and allocation is chosen to minimise the set of differences between modes then the mode transition problem can be performed more easily and quickly. This paper investigates how this can be achieved
