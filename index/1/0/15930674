Local search algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems are in general of pseudopolynomial running time and polynomial-time algorithms are often not known for finding locally optimal solutions for NP-hard optimization problems. We introduce the concept of ε-local optimality and show that an ε-local optimum can be identified in time polynomial in the problem size and 1=ε whenever the corresponding neighborhood can be searched in polynomial time, for ε > 0. If the neighborhood can be searched in polynomial time for a Δ-local optimum, a variation of our main algorithm produces a (Δ + ε)-local optimum in time polynomial in the problem size and 1/ε. As a consequence, a combinatorial optimization problem has a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme if and only if the problem of determining a better solution---the so-called augmentation problem---has a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme.
