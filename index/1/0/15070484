The Distributed Systems Technology Centre (DSTC) framework for workflow specification, verification and management captures workflows transaction-like behavior for long lasting processes. FlowBack is an advanced prototype functionally enhancing an existing workflow management system by providing process backward recovery. It is based on extensive theoretical research ([3],[4],[5],[6],[8],[9]), and its architecture and construction assumptions are product independent. FlowBack clearly demonstrates the extent to which generic backward recovery can be automated and system supported. The provision of a solution for handling exceptional business process behavior requiring backward recovery makes workflow solutions more suitable for a large class of applications, therefore opening up new dimensions within the market. For the demonstration purpose, FlowBack operates with IBM FlowMark, one of the leading workflow products.
