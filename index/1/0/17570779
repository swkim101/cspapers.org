In this paper we present a trace-driven framework capable of building realistic mobility models for the simulation studies of mobile systems. With the goal of realism, this framework combines coarse-grained wireless traces, i.e., association data between WiFi users and access points, with an actual map of the space over which the traces were collected. Through a sequence of data processing steps, including filtering the data trace and converting the map to a graph representation, this framework generates a probabilistic mobility model that produces user movement patterns that are representative of real movement. This is done by adopting a set of heuristics that help us infer the paths users take between access points. We describe our experience applying this approach to a college campus, and study a number of properties of the trace data using our framework.
