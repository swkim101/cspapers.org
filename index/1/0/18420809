To tackle the highlighted I/O bottleneck problem in cloud, we proposes ACIC, a system which automatically searches for optimized I/O system configurations from many candidates for each individual application running on a given cloud platform. The top ACIC-recommended configuration improves the applications? performance by a factor of up to 10.5 (3.0 on average), and cost saving of up to 89% (53% on average), compared with a commonly used baseline.
