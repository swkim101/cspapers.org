Digital Signature (DS) technology may be employed to produce legally enforceable signatures in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) among computer users within the same general guidelines and requirements as those developed for handwritten signatures on paper. Digital signature technology promises assurance at least equal to written signatures. From a legal standpoint, this assurance remains to be tested in the evidentiary process. Business policies for organizational use of this technology are being created as the use of digital signature technology is adopted. Standard industry practice serves to create and document a legal precedent. Digital signatures are especially applicable to interpretations of contracts and statute of fraud law. Digital signatures may be used to provide assurances in distributed and networked computer environments where electronic transactions require a high degree of trust.
