As a novel approach to force-reflecting teleoperation of a mobile teleoperator (MTO), a mobile haptic interface (MHI) is presented. The MHI actively follows the locomotion of an operator, who is no longer bound to be stationary during interaction with a remote environment. Thus, operator locomotion can be used as input for locomotion control of the MTO while keeping the advantage of force-reflection. The paper introduces a new paradigm for the position control of a nonholonomic platform and a new approach for the coupling of display and teleoperator in a teleoperation setup.
