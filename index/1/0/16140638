A neural network based approach is presented for controlling two distinct types of nonlinear systems. The first corresponds to nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties where the parameters occur nonlinearly. The second corresponds to systems for which stabilizing control structures cannot be determined. The proposed neural controllers are shown to result in closed-loop system stability under certain conditions.
