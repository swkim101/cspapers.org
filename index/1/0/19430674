Time series data is ubiquitous; large volumes of time series data are routinely created in scientific, industrial, entertainment, medical and biological domains. Examples include gene expression data, electrocardiograms, electroencephalograms, gait analysis, stock market quotes, space telemetry etc. Although statisticians have worked with time series for more than a century, many of their techniques hold little utility for researchers working with massive time series databases.A decade ago, a seminal paper by Faloutsos, Ranganathan, Manolopoulos appeared in SIGMOD. The paper, Fast Subsequence Matching in Time-Series Databases, has spawned at least a thousand references and extensions in the database/ data mining and information retrieval communities. This tutorial will summarize the decade of progress since this influential paper appeared.
