The growth in wireless communication technologies attracts a considerable amount of attention in mobile ad-hoc networks. Since mobile hosts in an ad-hoc network usually move freely, the topology of the network changes dynamically and disconnection occurs frequently. These characteristics make a mobile ad-hoc network be likely to be separated into several disconnected partitions, and the data accessibility is hence reduced. Several schemes are proposed to alleviate the reduction of data accessibility by replicating data items. However, little research effort was elaborated upon exploiting the group mobility where the group mobility refers to the phenomenon that several mobile nodes tend to move together. In this paper, we address the problem of replica allocation in a mobile ad-hoc network by exploring group mobility. We first analyze the group mobility model and derive several theoretical results. In light of these results, we propose a replica allocation scheme to improve the data accessibility. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is able to not only obtain higher data accessibility but also produce lower network traffic than prior schemes.
