This paper describes a system currently being developed called the “Analyst”. The Analyst is a support system for analysis and design methods. The method support facilities are being implemented using expert system or knowledge based techniques. The user can add rules for additional analysis of the application facts. The explicit representation of rules and facts (i.e. the knowledge base) makes it relatively easy to add methods to cover different phases or aspects of the software life cycle.
