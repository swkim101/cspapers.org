In this paper, we use query-level regression as the loss function. The regression loss function has been used in pointwise methods, however pointwise methods ignore the query boundaries and treat the data equally across queries, and thus the effectiveness is limited. We show that regression is an effective loss function for learning to rank when used in query-level. We use neural network to model the ranking function and gradient descent for optimization and refer our method as ListReg. Experimental results show that ListReg significantly outperforms pointwise Regression and the state-of-the-art listwise method in most cases.
