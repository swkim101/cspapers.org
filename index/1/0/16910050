The Linguistic Annotation Framework defines a generalised graph based model for annotation data intended as an interchange format for transfer of annotations between tools. The DADA system uses an RDF based representation of annotation data and provides a web based annotation store. The annotation model in DADA can be seen as an RDF realisation of the LAF model. This paper describes the relationship between the two models and makes some comments on how the standard might be stated in a more formatneutral way.
