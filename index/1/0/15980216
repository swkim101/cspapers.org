In this work we propose a regular layout fabric practical for industrial random logic design and present cell synthesis algorithms specialized to this fabric. We show results on an industrial test-case where physical synthesis onto a library of extremely regular cells results in only 7% increase in leakage in comparison to traditional standard cells. We also show that using this fabric based cell synthesis system allows better overall area by allowing more upper layer routing. We achieve a 4% routable die size reduction by simultaneous cell synthesis and custom M1 routing.
