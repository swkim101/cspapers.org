The “hands-on” laboratory approach to teaching operating systems has been used at West Virginia University since August 1971 [3, 6, 8]. In 1977 a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-11/34 system replaced the IBM 1130 system previously used for the course. The course is now using an (DEC) LSI-11 and is much improved.
 This paper focuses on the student projects which are the major part of the course. The “hands-on” laboratory course as currently being taught is discussed and compared to other techniques for teaching operating systems.
