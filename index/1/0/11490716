The behavioral description based Web Service Composition (WSC) problem aims at the automatic construction of a coordinator web service that controls a set of web services to reach a goal state. However, solving the WSC problem exactly with a realistic model is doubly-exponential in the number of variables in web service descriptions. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient approximation-based algorithm using automatic abstraction and refinement to dramatically reduce the number of variables needed to solve the problem.
