The fast growth of technologies has driven the advancement of our society. It is often necessary to quickly grab the evolution of technologies in order to better understand the technology trend. The availability of huge volumes of granted patent documents provides a reasonable basis for analyzing technology evolution. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, named PatentLine, to generate a technology evolution tree for a given topic or a classification code related to granted patents. The framework integrates different types of patent information, including patent content, citations of patents, temporal relations, etc., and provides a concise yet comprehensive evolution summary. The generated summary enables a variety of patent-related analyses such as identifying relevant prior art and detecting technology gap. A case study on a collection of US patents demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed framework.
