Video usage in educational environments has increased significantly with the expansion of online learning opportunities. However, current video-based applications used for learning are designed for passive consumption of video content and do not support small-group collaboration. Specifically, they lack interaction affordances for active and collaborative learning through video materials. In this paper, we present the affordances and user experience of a web-based video application called Video Collaboratory that is designed with multiple affordances for group-based learning around video content. We surveyed students and analyzed the use of the Video Collaboratory in an HCI course. Students found the Video Collaboratory helpful because they could learn from their peers. Students also used the application beyond the activities required for credit.
