Bio-inspired undulatory fin propulsion holds considerable potential for endowing robotic underwater vehicles with low-speed manoeuvrability and stable station-keeping. Robotic fins typically comprise a number of serially arranged and individually actuated “fin rays”, interconnected by a membrane-like flexible surface. Propulsive forces are generated by the propagation of a traveling wave along the mechanism, via appropriately timed ray oscillations. The present paper describes a dynamic model for an elementary two-ray fin system, analyzed as a standard robot mechanism with additional contributions arising from the elastic deformation of the flexible membrane and from the hydrodynamic forces. The model's main aspects, particularly with regard to the hydrodynamic effects, are explored via simulation studies, as well as via experiments with a robotic prototype. The developed model can serve a number of purposes towards optimizing the mechanical design, the control strategies, and the propulsive efficacy of robotic undulatory fins.
