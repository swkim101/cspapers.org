In this paper we consider the problem of cyclic schedules such as arise in manufacturing. We introduce a new formulation of this problem that is a very simple modification of a standard job shop scheduling formulation, and which enables us to use existing constraint reasoning techniques to generate cyclic schedules. We present evidence for the effectiveness of this formulation, and describe extensions for handling multiple-capacity resources and for recovering from breaks in cyclic schedules.
