In this paper we examine the use of TikiWiki as an open source content management tool in the context of its use as a part of a descriptive process model-based software development environment. This environment is currently made up of a process model based electronic process guide (EPG) linked to an experience repository server and a separate database for task management and time recording. It is implemented in a medium sized software development organization that is focussed on web applications, large mark-up projects and web technologies.
