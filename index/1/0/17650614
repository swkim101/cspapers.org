Cross domain communication has been a long-discussed subject in the field of web-based application, especially for any sort of mashups where a single web app combines resources from different locations. This issue becomes more important in the Web of Things context, where every physical resources are exposed to the Web and mashed up by other web applications. In this paper we demonstrate a use case in which cross domain communication is applied in the Web of Things using the HTML5 Cross Document Messaging API (HTML5CDM). In addition, we contribute an advanced implementation of HTML5CDM that brings RESTful communication model to HTML5CDM and supports better concurrent message exchange, which we believe will be of much benefit to web developers. In addition, a time/space evaluation that measures CPU and Memory usage for the developed HTML5CDM library is carried out and the results has proved our implementation's practicability.
