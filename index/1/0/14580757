The layered multilingual input/output(I/O) sytems we designed, based on typological studies of major-language writing conventions, unifies common features of such conventions to enable international and local utilization. The internationalization layer input module converts keystroke sequences to phonograms and ideograms. The corresponding output module displays position-independent and dependent characters. The localization layer positions language-specific functions outside the structure, integrating them as tables used by finite automaton interpreters and servers to add new languages and code sets without recompilation. The I/O system generates and displays stateful and stateless code sets, enabling interactive language switching. Going beyond POSIX locale model bounds, the system generates ISO 2022, ISO/DIS 10646 (1990), and Compound Text, defined for the interchange encoding format in X11 protocols, for basic polyglot text communication and processing. Able to generate multilingual code sets, the I/O system clearly demonstrates that code sets should be selected by applications which have purposes beyond selecting one element from a localization set. Functionality and functions related to text manipulation in an operating sytem (OS) must also be determined by such applications. A subset of this I/O system was implemented in the X window system as a basic use of X11R5 I/O by supplying basic code set generation and string manipulation to eliminate OS interference. To ensure polyglot string manipulation, the I/O system must clearly be implemented separately from an OS and its limitations.
