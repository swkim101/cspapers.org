This paper explores the problem of building a structure of a desired shape, using re-usable interlocking blocks. Blocks are cubes; we make use of nine different types of cubes, each with different arrangements of male and female connectors on the six sides of the cube. The desired shape is specified by a set of voxels. We propose an algorithm that lays out cubes in a particular pattern to give the desired shape and gives a fairly simple assembly order.
