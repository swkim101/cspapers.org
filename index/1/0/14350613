Performance regression testing is an important step in the software development lifecycle, especially for enterprise applications. Commonly the analysis of performance regression testing to find anomalies is carried out manually and therefore can be error-prone, time consuming and sensitive to the input load. In our research, we propose a new technique that overcomes the above problems which helps the performance testing teams to improve their process and speeds up the entire software production process.
