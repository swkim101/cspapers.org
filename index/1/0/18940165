Neurons encoding simple visual features in area V1 such as orientation, direction of motion and color are organized in retinotopic maps. However, recent physiological experiments have shown that the responses of many neurons in V1 and other cortical areas are modulated by the direction of gaze. We have developed a neural network model of the visual cortex to explore the hypothesis that visual features are encoded in head-centered coordinates at early stages of visual processing. New experiments are suggested for testing this hypothesis using electrical stimulations and psychophysical observations.
