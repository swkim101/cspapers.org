The affective domain can be used to support the internalization of cognitive content and foster the development of curriculum and industry-related interests, attitudes, values, and practices. This study investigated correlations between affective factors and course grade. Interest, perceived competence, effort, lack of pressure, and value correlated significantly with CS1 course grades. Moreover, this study investigated the levels of these factors over the course of CS1. Almost all of the levels of these significant factors decreased significantly during the CS1 course as measured by pretests and posttests. Results of this study further indicated that the use of specific affective objectives and instructional strategies lessened these decreases.
