A user of an IR system is often left in the dark with a query box. It may be useful in many cases to present some kind of representation of the underlying collection to the user. Obviously, constructing and providing a representation of a massive collection such as the Web is very difficult and probably not very useful. However, such functionality could be feasible and useful for a small or specialized collection. The other issue that keeps the user in the dark is the presentation of the retrieved information. A typical search engine presents the retrieved results ordered by their relevance. While working with specialized collections in which most of the documents are about a specific domain or topic, relevance is not enough to derive and order the retrieved set. A user may also want to know how much the retrieved documents differ from each other. In other words, in addition to relevance, it becomes useful to present novelty among those documents. We demonstrate this concept using DiscoverInfo a system that allows the user to explore a collection of documents by their relevance and novelty. The system facilitates discovery through three functions.
