In this paper, we suggest the use of an ecological approach to measuring the effectiveness of pervasive technologies in a classroom setting. We report the lessons learned from evaluating the TinkerLamp, an interactive tabletop interface. We illustrate that due to the many factors involved in authentic settings, the technologies would better be evaluated based on how well they support and enhance the experience of the classroom ecology in addition to based on learning outcomes.
