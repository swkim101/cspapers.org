Primary challenges in the building of untethered sub-millimeter sized robots include power supply, propulsion methods, and control. We present a novel type of microrobot termed Magmite that utilizes a new class of wireless magnetic actuator which accomplishes all three tasks. The device harvests magnetic energy from the environment and effectively transforms it into mechanical propulsion while being fully controllable. This microrobotic agent with dimensions less than 300 mum times 300 mum times 70 mum is capable of maneuvering with 3 degrees of freedom. A specially prepared substrate allows for adjustable speeds exceeding 12.5 mm/s or 42 times the robot's body length per second (see accompanying video). It is powered by oscillating fields in the kHz range and strengths as low as 2 mT - roughly 50 times the average Earth magnetic field.
