We analyze the recognition errors made by a morph-based continuous speech recognition system, which practically allows an unlimited vocabulary. Examining the role of the acoustic and language models in erroneous regions shows how speaker adaptive training (SAT) and discriminative training with minimum phone frame error (MPFE) criterion decrease errors in different error classes. Analyzing the errors with respect to word frequencies and manually classified error types reveals the most potential areas for improving the system.
