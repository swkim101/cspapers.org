The τεΧνη project, which provides an unusual alternative to the standard design of the computing curriculum for the bachelor's degree in computer science, is now entering full-scale implementation at Clemson University. The approach relies extensively on problem-based instruction, computer graphics, and the notion of cognitive apprenticeship. The novelty arises from the magnitude and origin of the problems to be integrated into the curriculum and the breadth of impact across the curriculum. The first three courses in the new curriculum are now being taught. The design of each course is described, and preliminary assessments from earlier trial sessions of the first two courses are offered.
