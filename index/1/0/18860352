Information in enterprises comes in documents and data bases. From a semantic viewpoint, both kinds of information are usually tightly connected. In this paper, we propose to enhance common search-engines with contextual information retrieved from databases. We establish system requirements and anecdotally demonstrate how documents and database information can be represented as the nodes of a graph. Then, we give an example how we exploit this graph information for document retrieval.
