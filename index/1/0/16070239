As widely recognized, there is more to relevance than topicality. By looking at the user experience of Information Retrieval (IR), this proposal takes a broader perspective on relevance. Several facets of relevance are structured according to how the user will experience an information object. In particular, the antecedents and consequences of positive affect are discussed. The consequences of positive affect are related to the goal of an IR system, whereas features to derive the antecedents of positive affect from information objects are proposed. The features are combined in a model of relevance, consisting of three factors: topicality, understandability, and affective value. Moreover, it is discussed how the model can be evaluated through methods based on user studies.
