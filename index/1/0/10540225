In this paper we introduce a bilingual dictionary generating tool that does not use any large bilingual corpora. With this tool we implement our novel pivot based bilingual dictionary generation method that uses mainly the WordNet of the pivot language to build a new bilingual dictionary. We propose the usage of WordNet for good accuracy, introducing also a double directional selection method with local thresholds to maximize recall.
