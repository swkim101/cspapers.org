This paper presents a unifying probabilistic framework for clustering individuals or systems into groups when the available data measurements are not multivariate vectors of xed dimensionality. For example, one might have data from a set of medical patients, where for each patient one has di erent numbers of time-series observations, each time-series of di erent lengths. We propose a general model-based framework for clustering heterogeneous data types of this form. We discuss a general Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure for clustering within this framework and outline how it can be applied to clustering of sequences, time-series, histograms, trajectories, and other non-vector data. We show that a number of earlier algorithms can be viewed as special cases within this unifying framework. The paper concludes with several illustrations of the method, including clustering of twodimensional histograms of red blood cell data in a medical diagnosis context, clustering of proteins from curves of gene expression data, and clustering of individuals based on their sequences of Web navigation.
