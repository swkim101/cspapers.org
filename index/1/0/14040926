Product lines are implemented by the disciplined application of a combination of existing technologies, based on a business case to identify domains for which a product line approach is justified, a domain analysis to determine commonalities and variabilities, the software architecture as the technical foundation for the development of the product line, the adoption of the modified dual life cycle (i.e., domain and application engineering) and the resultant organizational structure and processes, and well defined processes for configuration management, planning, and customer management.
