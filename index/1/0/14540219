This paper describes a continuing series of summer workshops hosted by Purdue University entitled "Linking Mathematics and Computer Science." Each is designed to inform and inspire high school teachers of mathematics with an interest in computer science. Originally conceived as an extension of our existing K-12 outreach, our workshop aims to provide teachers with innovative activities and ideas that link their secondary school mathematics curriculum with computer science. By reaching out to high school math teachers, we hope to in turn reach a broader base of students outside of computer science classes. By fostering interest in this broader audience, we can increase the number of students entering undergraduate computer science programs, and reach a larger segment of underrepresented populations.
