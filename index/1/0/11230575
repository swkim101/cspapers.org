In this paper, we propose a new method to assemble microstructures with biological cells towards in vitro 3D cellular structures. The proposed assembly method uses self-assembly process of magnetized toroidal microstructures. Biocompatible toroidal hydrogel microstructures are prepared by electrodeposition method, and ferrite particles are put on the fabricated structures using poly-L-lysine (PLL). The microstructures are magnetized by the magnetic field at 3 T, and assembled by the magnetic self-assembly process. Biological cells were encapsulated in the microstructures and cultured to achieve high density of cells inside structures. The magnetized microstructures were assembled automatically. The magnetic force generated from the ferrite embedded microstructures was estimated and compared to the fluid resistance applied to the microstructures. The proposed method can be applied to achieve 3D in vitro cell structures with vascular networks for tissue engineering applications.
