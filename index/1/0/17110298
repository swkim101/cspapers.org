A primary goal of Software Engineering is to improve the process of software development. It is being recognised that recent integrated programming environments have made significant progress towards this aim. This paper describes new operations, suitable for such environments, which are applicable in a much wider scope of programming, termed here as programming in the all. Development of software in this new scope is carried out incrementally in program fragments of various types, called fragtypes. Fragtypes range from a simple Expression type to a complete Subsystem type, and therefore are suited to the development of non-trivial software. The proposed operations on fragtypes have been incorporated in the design of the programming environment MUPE-2 for Modula-2, which is currently under development at McGill University.
