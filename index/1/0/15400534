Fragmentation of customer data across internal product based systems is preventing a meaningful customer dialog across channels. This problem is compounded further by the addition of new Internet and customer-facing applications from multiple vendors.
The typical clicks and mortar company has dozens of e-commerce and product-based systems containing millions of records with customer information without the ability to consolidate the data into a common customer view. Maintaining profitable customer relationships in such an environment requires a new approach.
The Customer Context Server application uses a set of frameworks and subsystems operating on an object database to assemble and deliver, within a second, a continuously updated Customer Context to all customer touchpoints even in extremely high volume situations.
The Customer Context Server application enables customer conversations to continue where they left off in a multi-vendor environment. The heart of the Customer Context Server application is the scalable Update Stream Processori (USP), which performs asynchronous contention-free updates on hundreds of processors concurrently. Several of the subsystems will be demonstrated including the active modeling and mapping systems used to refine the customer-relationship object mode] and assemble objects from record-based input data.
