Recently, indoor pedestrian navigation systems have attracted attentions of people. We have been developing an interactive pedestrian navigation system and found that the navigation system could not provide enough sense of reassurance for a user according to our preliminary experiment. In this study, we propose a method to improve the user's sense of reassurance by notifying user's level of achievement sensed by their smart phone sensors and conduct the experiment in the Osaka underground city. According to the questionnaire survey that we conducted after the experiment, people who chose affirmative opinions on a sense of reassurance increased by 45% due to the proposed method.
