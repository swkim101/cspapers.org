We present yet another heuristic for the software pipelining problem. We believe this heuristic to be of interest because it brings a new insight to the software pipelining problem by establishing its deep link with the circuit retiming problem. Also, in the single resource class case, our new heuristic is guaranteed, with a better bound than that of~\cite{GasperoniSc94}. Finally, we point out that, in its simplest form, our algorithm has a lower complexity.
