Human-Data Interaction (HDI) systems can be defined as technologies that use embodied interaction to facilitate the users' exploration of rich datasets. As the design of gestures for Whole-Body Interaction is often based on an uninformed trial and error approach, I propose the use of Johnson's embodied schemata, extended with allegories, to inform the design of suites of gestures for HDI systems. This approach involves: (1) the identification of embodied allegories to encourage data exploration, (2) a study of the allegorical relation between input and output, and (3) an analysis of the implication of the (social) space.
