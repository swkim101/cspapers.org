Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a technique that finds how "similar" are the subspaces that are spanned by the columns of two different matrices A έℜ(of size m-x-n) and B έℜ(of size m-x-l). CCA measures similarity by means of the cosines of the so-called principal angles between the two subspaces. Those values are also known as canonical correlations of the matrix pair (A,B). In this work, we consider the over-constrained case where the number of rows is greater than the number of columns (m > max(n,l)). We study the problem of constructing "core-sets" for CCA. A core-set is a subset of rows from A and the corresponding subset of rows from B - denoted by Â and B, respectively. A "good" core-set is a subset of rows such that the canonical correlations of the core-set (Â, B) are "close" to the canonical correlations of the original matrix pair (A, B). There is a natural tradeoff between the core-set size and the approximation accuracy of a core-set. We present two algorithms namely, single-set spectral sparsification and leverage-score sampling, which find core-sets with additive-error guarantees to canonical correlations.
