A swimming microrobot driven by FMP (ferromagnetic polymer) actuators under magnetic field is developed. The size of the swimming microrobot is 3 mm /spl times/ 2 mm /spl times/ 0.4 mm. The robot can swim when the magnetic intensity is higher than 8 mT and the frequency is about 10 Hz, with the speed of 0.3/spl sim/1 mm/s. Dynamic analysis of the microrobot is performed, and the results fit the experiment data reasonably. The experimental results indicate that the driving method is effective and the swimming speed can be controlled by modifying the intensity of magnetic field.
