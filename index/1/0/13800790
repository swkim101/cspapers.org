In the last two decades a new part of the web grew significantly, namely the Semantic Web. It contains many Knowledge Bases (KB) about different areas like music, books, publications, live science and many more. Question Answering (QA) over KBs is seen as the most promising approach to bring this data to end-users. We describe WDAqua-core1, a QA service for querying RDF knowledge-bases. It is multilingual, it supports different RDF knowledge bases and it understands both full natural language questions and keyword questions.
