This paper addresses the problem of extending the flight duration of cooperative missions with multiple gliding fixed-wing UAVs by using the energy that comes from static soaring. We consider exploration missions where UAVs should pass through a set of Point of Interest (PoI) with the presence of thermals in the space. These thermals can be exploited to provide energy in terms of altitude for each gliding UAV. The objective of the mission is to extend the flight duration of each UAV to explore the environment without landing and decreasing the time to perform the mission. An algorithm named Bounded Recursive Heuristic Search (BRHS), based on Depth-First search techniques, is applied to the PoIs and to the UAVs. The main advantage is the real time application because of the low computational load. The paper presents a set of simulations and experiments have carried out in the airfield of La Cartuja (Seville, Spain).
