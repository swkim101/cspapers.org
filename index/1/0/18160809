The amount of data that a typical translation lookaside bu er (TLB) can map has not kept pace with the growth in cache sizes and application footprints. As a result, the cost of handling TLB misses limits the performance of an increasing number of applications. The use of superpages, multiple adjacent virtual memory pages that can be mapped with a single TLB entry, extends a TLB's reach without signi cantly increasing its size or cost. Previous studies have shown that simple online policies that decide to create superpages dynamically can be e ective in reducing TLB penalties. We reevaluate online superpage policies in the context of the Impulse memory controller, which supports no-copy superpage construction [4]. Our results show that the presence of Impulse changes the tradeo s in choosing an appropriate policy, and that the most aggressive policy becomes desirable.
