This paper introduces the Finite-State Turn-Taking Machine (FSTTM), a new model to control the turn-taking behavior of conversational agents. Based on a non-deterministic finite-state machine, the FSTTM uses a cost matrix and decision theoretic principles to select a turn-taking action at any time. We show how the model can be applied to the problem of end-of-turn detection. Evaluation results on a deployed spoken dialog system show that the FSTTM provides significantly higher responsiveness than previous approaches.
