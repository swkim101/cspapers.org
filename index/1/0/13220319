Autonomous ground robots for exploring natural environments are developed in our research center, along with the recognition of the configurations and the obstacles. The three key technologies for such a robot are the study of the locomotion mechanism, the autonomous system and the multiple robot control. This paper will discuss the definition of rough terrain and the establishment of the fundamental precondition based on the results of the experiments we conducted. It will also propose an autonomous system for robots taking not only its configurations into consideration, but weather, lighting and temperature conditions as well.<<ETX>>
