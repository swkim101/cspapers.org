In this work, we propose a novel post-indexing spam-blog (or splog) detection method, which capitalizes on the results returned by blog search engines. More specifically, we analyze the search results of a sequence of temporally-ordered queries returned by a blog search engine, and build and maintain Blog profiles for those blogs whose posts frequently appear in the top-ranked search results. With the blog profiles, 4 splog scoring functions were evaluated using real data collected from a popular blog search engine. Our experiments show that the proposed method could effectively detect splogs with a high accuracy.
