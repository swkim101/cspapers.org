We investigate different feature sets for performing automatic sentence-level discourse segmentation within a general machine learning approach, including features derived from either finite-state or contextfree annotations. We achieve the best reported performance on this task, and demonstrate that our SPADE-inspired context-free features are critical to achieving this level of accuracy. This counters recent results suggesting that purely finite-state approaches can perform competitively.
