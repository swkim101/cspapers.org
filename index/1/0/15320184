In Parnas at al. advocate the use of relational model for documenting the intended behaviour of programs. In this method, tabular expressions (or tables) are used to improve readability so that formal documentation can replace conventional documentation. Parnas describes several classes of tables and provides their formal syntax and semantics. In this paper, an alternative, more general and more homogeneous semantics is proposed.
