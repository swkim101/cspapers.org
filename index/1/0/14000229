A mobile robot can identify its own position relative to landmarks, the locations of which are known in advance. The main contribution of this research is that it gives various ways of making the self-localizing error smaller by referring to a sensitivity which is defined as the ratio of the localizing error to sensor error. In this paper, the authors propose a set of indices to evaluate the accuracy of the self-localizing methods, and the indices are derived from the sensitivity. And then, the accuracy of self-localizing a mobile robot with landmarks based on the indices is compared, and a rational way to minimize the localizing error is proposed. Finally, we discuss a method to reduce the computational cost of selecting the best self-localizing method.
