In 1966 the Communications and Electronics Division of the Philco-Ford Corporation developed a Computer-Aided-Design (C-A-D) Capability for multilayer printed interconnection wiring.1 At that time improvements were planned to enhance the efficiency and usefulness of the series of computer programs involved. Since then additions and changes have been incorporated which allow for the slope classifying of nets, provide data for the automatic generation of artwork, and adapt the series for use on revisions as well as original runs.
 This paper addresses itself to describing the scope of these additions and changes, how they were implemented, and the resulting effects on the overall C-A-D capability
