Texts exhibit considerable stylistic variation. This paper reports an 
experiment where a large corpus of documents is analyzed using various 
simple stylistic metrics. A subset of the corpus has been previously 
assessed to be relevant for answering given information retrieval 
queries. The experiment shows that this subset differs significantly from 
the rest of the corpus in terms of the stylistic metrics studied.
