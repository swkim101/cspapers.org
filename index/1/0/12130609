This paper introduces the Time-Optimal Planning and Execution (TOPE) problem, in which the aim is to minimise the total planning and execution time required to achieve a goal. The TOPE process is derived and shown to be capable of solving this problem in dynamic state spaces, by continuously calculating the optimum value of any system parameters that can affect this total time. Procedures are presented to apply this process to an existing replanning system, and to determine its required accuracy and timeliness. It is shown that the TOPE process can yield lower total times than other planning systems if these requirements are met.
