Products, services or brands can be advertised alongside the search results in major search engines, while recently smaller displays on devices like tablets and smartphones have imposed the need for smaller ad texts. In this paper, we propose a method that produces in an automated manner compact text ads (promotional text snippets), given as input a product description webpage (landing page). The challenge is to produce a small comprehensive ad while maintaining at the same time relevance, clarity, and attractiveness. Our method includes the following phases. Initially, it extracts relevant and important n-grams (keywords) given the landing page. The keywords reserved must have a positive meaning in order to have a call-to-action style, thus we attempt sentiment analysis on them. Next, we build an Advertising Language Model to evaluate phrases in terms of their marketing appeal. We experiment with two variations of our method and we show that they outperform all the baseline approaches.
