We present a mobile robot navigation system guided by a novel vision-based road recognition approach. The system represents the road as a set of lines extrapolated from the detected image contour segments. These lines enable the robot to maintain its heading by centering the vanishing point in its field of view, and to correct the long term drift from its original lateral position. We integrate odometry and our visual road recognition system into a grid-based local map that estimates the robot pose as well as its surroundings to generate a movement path. Our road recognition system is able to estimate the road center on a standard dataset with 25,076 images to within 11.42 cm (with respect to roads at least 3 m wide). It outperforms three other state-of-the-art systems. In addition, we extensively test our navigation system in four busy college campus environments using a wheeled robot. Our tests cover more than 5 km of autonomous driving without failure. This demonstrates robustness of the proposed approach against challenges that include occlusion by pedestrians, non-standard complex road markings and shapes, shadows, and miscellaneous obstacle objects.
