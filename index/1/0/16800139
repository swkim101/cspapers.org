Networks with local inhibition are shown to have enhanced computational performance with respect to the classical Hopfield-like networks. In particular the critical capacity of the network is increased as well as its capability to store correlated patterns. Chaotic dynamic behaviour (exponentially long transients) of the devices indicates the overloading of the associative memory. An implementation based on a programmable logic device is here presented. A 16 neurons circuit is implemented whit a XILINK 4020 device. The peculiarity of this solution is the possibility to change parts of the project (weights, transfer function or the whole architecture) with a simple software download of the configuration into the XILINK chip.
