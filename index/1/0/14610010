Programs tend to reference pages unequally and cluster references to certain pages in short time intervals. These properties depend on the tendency of program locality references and program phase transitions. The significant effects on system performances arise from the phase transition behavior. However, the phase transition behavior of programs has been rarely taken into account in the analysis of memory management strategies. This paper investigates the effect of the phase transition behavior on the total system performance. For this purpose, an elaborate simulation model of the multiprogrammed memory management has been developed for a time-sharing environment. The working set strategy and the local LRU strategy are modeled in the simulation system. A simple phase transition model and the simple LRU stack model are used as a program paging behavior model. Both cases are analyzed where (1) locality variations exist and phase transitions occur, and (2) only locality variations exist and phase transitions do not occur. The relations between the phase transition rate and the system performance are found in the above memory management strategies.
