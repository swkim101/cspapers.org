We report on a computer monitoring study of users of the Ohio State University Libraries' online catalog, an established and heavily used information retrieval system. To our knowledge, this is the first monitoring study of an online catalog performed without system-defined user sessions. Online catalogs represent a class of retrieval systems which are designed for end users, require little or no formal training, and replace an existing manual system. The study characterizes user behavior in terms of types of searches done, patterns of use, time spent on searching, errors, and system problems. Preliminary results suggest that users have much shorter sessions than on other types of retrieval systems. Patterns of use vary between campus libraries, academic quarters, and between short and long sessions. Results of the study will be applied to improving the user interface and other system features.
