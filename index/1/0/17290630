The results of a study to develop a predictor of success in a first programming course are presented. The predictor is based on data currently available for a substantial number of students and is tailored to the local program. This predictor is developed using data from a group of students who took the course in the fall of 1980. The results obtained by applying the predictor to a second group of students who took the course in the fall of 1981 are compared with these students' actual grades.
