In this paper, we propose the new fixedsize ordinally-forgetting encoding (FOFE) method, which can almost uniquely encode any variable-length sequence of words into a fixed-size representation. FOFE can model the word order in a sequence using a simple ordinally-forgetting mechanism according to the positions of words. In this work, we have applied FOFE to feedforward neural network language models (FNN-LMs). Experimental results have shown that without using any recurrent feedbacks, FOFE based FNNLMs can significantly outperform not only the standard fixed-input FNN-LMs but also the popular recurrent neural network (RNN) LMs.
