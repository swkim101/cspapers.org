The aim of this freeware is to provide computational (skew) mu methods for analysing the robust stability and performance properties of an uncertain closed loop. It could also be considered as a software complement to the book. The toolbox contains low-level routines as well as fully automated procedures which allow a non specialist to obtain guaranteed robustness margins. Different realistic engineering applications are included (missile, rigid and flexible aircraft, telescope mock-up), which illustrate the efficiency and reliability of the proposed tools
