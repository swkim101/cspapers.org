This paper proposes a hybrid control algorithm for mobile manipulation subject to joint-space constraints. More specifically, we consider the problem of making the end-effector of a planar manipulator attached to a nonholonomic mobile platform reach a set-point or equivalently follow a given path in workspace by means of kinematic actuation. A switched control strategy allows the robot to avoid singular joint configurations and execute a pseudo-inverse based feedback using bounded and continuous control signals. The switching scheme is also utilized to maintain feasible joint configurations. Numerical examples provide an intuitive understanding of the algorithm's workings.
