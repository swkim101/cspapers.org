This paper investigates the evaluation method of decision procedures for multi-modal logic proposed by Giunchiglia and Sebastiani as an adaptation from the evaluation method of Mitchell et al of decision procedures for propositional logic. We compare three different theorem proving approaches, namely the Davis-Putnam-based procedure KSAT, the tableaux-based system KTUS and a translation approach combined with first-order resolution. Our results do not support the claims of Giunchiglia and Sebastiani concerning the computational superiority of KSAT over KRIS, and an easy-hard-easy pattern for randomly generated modal formulae.
