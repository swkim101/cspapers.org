We describe a novel approach to runtime visualization of object-oriented programs. Our approach features: visualizations of execution state and history; forward and reverse execution; interactive queries during program execution; and advanced drawing capabilities involving a combination of compile-time and runtime-analysis. Our methodology is realized in a software tool called <i>JIVE</i>, for <i>Java Interactive Visualization Environment</i>.
