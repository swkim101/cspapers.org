F. Bergadano”, D. Catalano+ and S. Varricchio” “Universit> di Torino +Universitii di Catania OUniversit& di L’ Aquila In this paper we study the problem of learning Sat-k-DNF formulas from membership queries. We show that Sat-kDNF are PAC’ learnable with membership queries by proving that k-ambiguous automata are PAC learnable with membership queries and by establishing a PAC reduction that preserves membership queries between these two classes of concepts. We also give a positive answer in the direction of learning two way finite automata. We show that k-reversal bounded two-way automata (i.e. two-way automata that change head direction at most k times) are PAC learrtable with membership queries. As a corollary of Sat-1-DNF learnability y one easily derives that decision trees are PAC learnable with membership queries. All these resuks are valid for every distribution of probability.
