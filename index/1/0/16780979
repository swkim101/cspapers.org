To address this issue, we explore instance utility from two dimensions: individual uncertainty and instance disparity, using a correlation matrix. The active learning is transformed to a semi-definite programming problem to select an optimal subset with maximum utility value. Experiments demonstrate the algorithm performance in comparison with baseline approaches.
