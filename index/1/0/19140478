We present WiTraffic: the first WiFi-based traffic monitoring system. The unique WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) patterns of passing vehicles are captured and analyzed to perform vehicle classification. We implemented WiTraffic with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and performed real-world experiments with over a week of field data collection. The results show that the classification accuracy is around 96%.
