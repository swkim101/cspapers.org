In this paper, we describe WikiPop service, a system designed to detect significant increase of popularity of topics related to users' interests. We exploit Wikipedia page view statistics to identify concepts with significant increase of the interest from the public. Daily, there are thousands of articles with increased popularity; thus, a personalization is in order to provide the user only with results related to his/her interest. The WikiPop system allows a user to define a context by stating a set of Wikipedia articles describing topics of interest. The system is then able to search, for the given date, for popular topics related to the user defined context.
