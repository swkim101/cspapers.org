Keyword search over XML data usually brings irrelevant results especially when the keywords in a user query have ambiguities. We demonstrate a statistic-based approach to identify the search targets and constraints of a user query in the presence of keyword ambiguities, and come out a relevance oriented result ranking scheme called XML TF*IDF. Since the search intention of a same query may even vary from user to user, we provide an interactive search strategy by allowing user to simply tick their desired search targets from a list of suggestions recommended by the search engine. In this way, we can acquire more precise results and also take the burden of learning the schema of XML data off users.
