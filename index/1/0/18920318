The results of this paper concern the question of how fast machines with one type of storage media can simulate machines with a different type of storage media. Most work on this question has focused on the question of how fast one deterministic machine can simulate another. In this paper we shall look at the question of how fast a probabilistic machine can simulate another. This approach should be of interest in its own right, in view of the great attention that probabilistic algorithms have recently attracted.
