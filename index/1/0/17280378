The main advantage of multi-legged robots is the ability to traverse uneven terrain and to overcome obstacles that would impede the movement of a wheeled robot. Compliant joint drives can further improve the performance of legged robot systems by considerably reducing the problems associated with uneven or slippery footholds. Small changes of the foot position in uneven terrain are compensated by the passive joint compliance without the need for fast contact detection and controller responses while the mechanical tension is reduced. On rougher terrain with bigger elevations/depressions of the surface structure, however, a reliable ground contact detection and stance height regulation for each leg is required to distribute the weight of the robot evenly among the legs on ground during stance phase. This work presents a concept that allows the inherently compliant hexapod robot HECTOR to walk on uneven terrain and to overcome moderate obstacles by means of a decentralized walking controller. An important prerequisite is the availability of inherently compliant joint drives with an increased power/weight-ratio.
