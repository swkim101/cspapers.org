In this work, we reformulate our previously developed strategy for operating unknown constrained mechanisms, to fit our new task specification framework for indirect force controlled robots, which we presented recently. The main improvement is a significant reduction of erroneous forces, which is achieved by breaking the manipulation task down into a hierarchical set of subtasks instead of having interfering tasks. The improvement is evaluated by conducting a series of manipulation experiments using the old and new approach and comparing the average erroneous forces.
