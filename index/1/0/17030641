A distributed parallel computing for a multidisciplinary problem has been realized on a heterogeneous parallel computer cluster. A communication library for heterogeneous parallel computing, Stampi, has been newly developed and implemented on a parallel computer cluster. This library is based on MPI specification and has capability of creating processes on the slave parallel computer from the master parallel computer. From programmers, only the ordinary functions of MPI-2 are seen and the heterogeneity is hidden. A fluid/structure coupled simulation has been applied, and the distributed parallel computing for the coupled simulation has been performed between vector-parallel and scalar-parallel computers using this library. The 3-dimension Euler equations were solved in a moving grid by a finite difference method on the vector-parallel computer, Fujitsu VPP300. The structure equation of motion was solved by a finite element method on the scalar-parallel computer, Hitachi SR2201. These two disciplines were solved concurrently and independently, synchronizing and exchanging the boundary data through the network. As a test problem, the aeroelastic response of the 3-dimensional wing in a transonic flow was calculated. In the present simulation, the CFD code and the CSD code have shown higher performance on the vector-parallel and the scaIar-parallel computers, respectively. Hence, the distributed parallel computing will be one of effective methods to raise the total performance for multidisciplinary simulations. problems
