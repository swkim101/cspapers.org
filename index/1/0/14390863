Many researchers have proposed that ensembles of processing elements be organized as trees. This paper explores how large tree machines may be assembled efficiently from smaller components. A principal constraint that we consider is the limited number of external connections from an integrated circuit chip. We also explore the emerging capability of restructurable VLSI which allows a chip to be customized after fabrication.
 We give a linear-area chip of m processors and only four off-chip connections which can be used as the sole building block to construct an arbitrarily large complete binary tree. We also present a restructurable linear-area layout of m processors with O(lg m) pins that can realize an arbitrary binary tree. This layout is based on a solution to the graph-theoretic problem: Given a tree in which each vertex is either black or white, determine how many edges need be cut in order to bisect the tree into equal-size components, each containing exactly half the black and half the white vertices.
