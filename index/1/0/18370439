This study examines methods for displaying distance information to blind travellers using sound, focussing on abstractions of methods currently used in commercial Electronic Travel Aids (ETAs). Ten blind participants assessed three sound encodings commonly used to convey distance information by ETAs: sound frequency (Pitch), Ecological Distance (ED), and temporal variation or Beat Rate (BR). Response time and response correctness were chosen for measures.
