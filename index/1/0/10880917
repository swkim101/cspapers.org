In our research group, the hybrid knowledge representation system Babylon has been developed providing formalisms for rules, prolog and frames. Beyond it, we implemented Consat, a system for constraint satisfaction. Since applications of Babylon for process diagnosis, planning etc. required constraints. we integrated Consat into the Babylon environment. 
 
The paper describes the integration of Consat into Babylon, regarding two aspects. First, constraints should be available as another Babylon formalism by using the functional interface of Consat. On the other hand, it is important to have constraints implicitly controlling other Babylon formalisms, for instance, in order to keep the system's database consistent. While with respect to the first point, the paper describes work already finished, the second form of integration is work in progress.
