Commercial graphics processors (GPUs) have high compute capacity at very low cost, which makes them attractive for general purpose scientic computing. In this poster we show how graphics processors can be used for N-body simulations to obtain large improvements in performance over current generation CPUs. We have developed a highly optimized algorithm for performing the O(N^2) force calculations that constitute the major part of stellar and molecular dynamics simulations. In the calculations, we achieve sustained performance of nearly 100 GFlops on an ATI X1900XTX. The performance on GPUs 25x an Intel Pentium4, and 2x specialized hardware such as GRAPE-6A, but at a fraction of the cost. Furthermore, the wide availability of GPUs has signicant implications for cluster computing and distributed computing efforts like Folding@Home.
