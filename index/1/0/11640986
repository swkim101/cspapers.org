An autonomous mobile robot must be constantly involved in the processing of large amounts of data in order to produce meaningful actions. The ability of a control architecture to support this immense processing task in a timely manner is significantly affected by the organization of information pathways within the architecture. Based on lessons learned from our experience with a hierarchical architecture for autonomous cross-country navigation (Daily et al 1987) (Keirsey, Payton, Rosenblatt 1988), we have adopted a different approach which emphasizes the minimization of information loss both within and between system layers. We will illustrate our approach by presenting an design of an control architecture for an autonomous vehicle tasked to perform road reconnaissance.
