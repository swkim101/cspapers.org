In this paper, we address the scalability issue plaguing graph-based semi-supervised learning via a small number of anchor points which adequately cover the entire point cloud. Critically, these anchor points enable nonparametric regression that predicts the label for each data point as a locally weighted average of the labels on anchor points. Because conventional graph construction is inefficient in large scale, we propose to construct a tractable large graph by coupling anchor-based label prediction and adjacency matrix design. Contrary to the Nystrom approximation of adjacency matrices which results in indefinite graph Laplacians and in turn leads to potential non-convex optimization over graphs, the proposed graph construction approach based on a unique idea called AnchorGraph provides nonnegative adjacency matrices to guarantee positive semidefinite graph Laplacians. Our approach scales linearly with the data size and in practice usually produces a large sparse graph. Experiments on large datasets demonstrate the significant accuracy improvement and scalability of the proposed approach.
