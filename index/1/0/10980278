The structure and motion problem of multiple one- dimensional projections of a two-dimensional environment is studied. One-dimensional cameras have proven useful in several different applications, most prominently for autonomous guided vehicles, but also in ordinary vision for analysing planar motion and the projection of lines. Previous results on one-dimensional vision are limited to classifying and solving minimal cases, bundle adjustment for finding local minima to the structure and motion problem and linear algorithms based on algebraic cost functions. In this paper, we present a method for finding the global minimum to the structure and motion problem using the max norm of reprojection errors. We show how the optimal solution can be computed efficiently using simple linear programming techniques. The algorithms have been tested on a variety of different scenarios, both real and synthetic, with good performance. In addition, we show how to solve the multiview triangulation problem, the camera pose problem and how to dualize the algorithm in the Carlsson duality sense, all within the same framework.
