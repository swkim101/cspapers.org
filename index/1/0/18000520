We present a general-purpose computer architecture based on the concept of recursion, suitable for VLSI computer systems built from replicated (LEGO-like) computing elements. The recursive computer architecture is defined by presenting a program organisation, a machine organisation and an experimental machine implementation oriented to VLSI. The program organisation, called recursive control flow, attempts a synthesis of the concepts underlying traditional control flow, data flow and reduction, to exploit the individual strengths of each organisation. The machine organisation is based on replicated general-purpose computing elements, as well as special-purpose computing elements that allow the function of individual computer systems to be specialised. These elements are interconnected to form a larger computer system and cooperate in the concurrent execution of a program. The experimental implementation is being restricted to simple, identical microcomputers each containing a memory, a processor and a communications capability. This future generation of LEGO-like computer systems are termed fifth generation computers [1] by the Japanese.
