A Network Interface Program (NIP) is that part of an operating system which interfaces with similar entities in a network. Normally, the NIP is a collection of software routines which implement interprocess communication, interhost protocols, data flow controls, and other necessary executive functions. This paper discusses the organization of the NIP currently being used with the Unix operating system on the ARPA network. The Network Unix system is noteworthy because of the natural way that network and local functions are merged. As a result the network appears as a logical extension to the local system - from the point of view of both the interactive terminal and user program.
