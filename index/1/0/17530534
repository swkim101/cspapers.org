We investigate temporal resolution of documents, such as determining the date of publication of a story based on its text. We describe and evaluate a model that build histograms encoding the probability of different temporal periods for a document. We construct histograms based on the Kullback-Leibler Divergence between the language model for a test document and supervised language models for each interval. Initial results indicate this language modeling approach is effective for predicting the dates of publication of short stories, which contain few explicit mentions of years.
