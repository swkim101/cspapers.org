Building a Unified Data Mining Engine (UDME) is not an easy exercise, specifically, when several factors can undermine their quality success, such as cost, time, and lack of systematic approaches. We would like to architect and develop a UDME, that has the some or all of the following properties: 1. Ease of use, 2. No Need of Expert to run the tool 3. Easy to add new functionality 4. Easy to interface 6. Multiple algorithms 7. Fewer resources 8. Stable 9. Isolation of Application logic 10. Minimum Maintenance Cost The workshop will address the unified data mining engine' challenges, and also debate several issues that are related to the architecture and development of the UDME.
