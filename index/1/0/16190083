Recently, multichannel networks composed of several parallel, medium-speed channels multiplexed on a single high-speed medium have been proposed as a practical way to harness the high bandwidths of optical fibers. In order to limit the cost of network interfaces, a partially-connected multichannel network allows each node access to only a proper subset of the channels, its channel set. Staircase interconnection topologies constitute a family of partially-connected multichannel networks in which every node can still send messages directly to every other node.
Group-based computer applications composed of cooperative processing entities are proliferating. The communication among processes in group-based applications typically involves multiple destinations and is often symmetric and temporally local. In this paper, we investigate the problem of supporting group communication in staircase multichannel networks. We analyze those properties of staircase topologies that benefit temporally local multicast communication. We then develop an adaptive protocol that permits nodes to dynamically change their channel sets. These changes are based on recent network traffic history, thus enabling the topology to conform to network traffic patterns and, specifically, group locality. Analytical and simulation results are presented.
