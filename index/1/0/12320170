Passage-level question answer matching is a challenging task since it requires effective representations that capture the complex semantic relations between questions and answers. In this work, we propose a series of deep learning models to address passage answer selection. To match passage answers to questions accommodating their complex semantic relations, unlike most previous work that utilizes a single deep learning structure, we develop hybrid models that process the text using both convolutional and recurrent neural networks, combining the merits on extracting linguistic information from both structures. Additionally, we also develop a simple but effective attention mechanism for the purpose of constructing better answer representations according to the input question, which is imperative for better modeling long answer sequences. The results on two public benchmark datasets, InsuranceQA and TREC-QA, show that our proposed models outperform a variety of strong baselines.
