Industry, particularly those following the eXtreme Programming (XP) methodology [2], has popularized the use of pair-programming. The pair-programming model has also been found to be beneficial for student programmers. Initial quantitative and qualitative results, which will be discussed in this paper, demonstrate that the use of pair-programming in the computer science classroom enhances student learning and satisfaction and reduces the frustration common among students. Additionally, the use of pair-programming relieves the burden on the educators because students no longer view the teaching staff as their sole form of technical information. We explore the nature of pair-programming, then examine the ways such a practice may enhance teaching and learning in computer science education.
