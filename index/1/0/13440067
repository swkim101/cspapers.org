We propose a novel kernel regression algorithm which takes into account order preferences on unlabeled data. Such preferences have the form that point x1 has a larger target value than that of x2, although the target values for x1, x2 are unknown. The order preferences can be viewed as side information or a form of weak labels, and our algorithm can be related to semi-supervised learning. Learning consists of formulating the order preferences as additional regularization in a risk minimization framework. We define a linear program to effectively solve the optimization problem. Experiments on benchmark datasets, sentiment analysis, and housing price problems show that the proposed algorithm outperforms standard regression, even when the order preferences are noisy.
