Trivia is any fact about an entity which is interesting due to its unusualness, uniqueness, unexpectedness or weirdness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for mining entity trivia from their Wikipedia pages. Given an entity, our system extracts relevant sentences from its Wikipedia page and produces a list of sentences ranked based on their interestingness as trivia. At the heart of our system lies an interestingness ranker which learns the notion of interestingness, through a rich set of domain-independent linguistic and entity based features. Our ranking model is trained by leveraging existing user-generated trivia data available on the Web instead of creating new labeled data. We evaluated our system on movies domain and observed that the system performs significantly better than the defined baselines. A thorough qualitative analysis of the results revealed that our rich set of features indeed help in surfacing interesting trivia in the top ranks.
