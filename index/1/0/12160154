We describe theoretical and experimental results for the extrinsic calibration of sensor platform consisting of a camera and a 2D laser range finder. The calibration is based on observing a planar checkerboard pattern and solving for constraints between the "views" of a planar checkerboard calibration pattern from a camera and laser range finder. We give a direct solution that minimizes an algebraic error from this constraint, and subsequent nonlinear refinement minimizes a re-projection error. To our knowledge, this is the first published calibration tool for this problem. Additionally we show how this constraint can reduce the variance in estimating intrinsic camera parameters.
