In this paper, we describe how the ODESeW platform can be used 
for the generation of the internal and external Web sites of R&D 
projects. ODESeW is a platform for the development of Semantic 
Web applications, which has been successfully used in the 
creation of the semantic portals of the EU R&D projects 
Esperonto, Knowledge Web and OntoGrid.
