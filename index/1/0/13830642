The proposed (SCA) model contains two pathways. The first pathway is a deep neural network customized for semantic-aware saliency, which aims to capture the semantic information in images, especially for the presence of meaningful objects and object parts. The second pathway is based on on-line feature learning and information maximization, which learns an adaptive representation for the input and discovers the high contrast salient patterns within the image context. The two pathways characterize both long-term and short-term attention cues and are integrated using maxima normalization. Experimental results on artificial images and several benchmark dataset demonstrate the superior performance and better plausibility of the proposed model over both classic approaches and recent deep models.
