Choosing the best-performing cloud for one's application is a critical problem for potential cloud customers. We propose CloudProphet, a trace-and-replay tool to predict a legacy application's performance if migrated to a cloud infrastructure. CloudProphet traces the workload of the application when running locally, and replays the same workload in the cloud for prediction. We discuss two key technical challenges in designing CloudProphet, and some preliminary results using a prototype implementation.
