We present a novel contextualization approach for passage retrieval. The core principle is to let any occurrence of a query term in a document affect the passage retrieval score, whether the occurrence is in the passage or not. This effect is controlled by the distance between the term occurrence and the passage. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the merits of our approach; the resultant retrieval performance substantially transcends that of previously proposed passage retrieval methods, including those that use various contextualization approaches.
