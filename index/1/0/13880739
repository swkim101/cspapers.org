Within-Network Classification (WNC) techniques are designed for applications where objects to be classified and those with known labels are interlinked. For WNC tasks like web page classification, the homophily principle succeeds by assuming that linked objects, represented as adjacent vertices in a network, are likely to have the same labels. However, in other tasks like chemical structure completion, recent works suggest that the label of a vertex should be related to the local structure it resides in, rather than equated with those of its neighbors. These works also propose structure-aware vertex features or methods to deal with such an issue. In this paper, we demonstrate that frequent neighborhood patterns, originally studied in the pattern mining literature, serve as a strong class of structure-aware features and provide satisfactory effectiveness in WNC. In addition, we identify the problem that the neighborhood pattern miner indiscriminately mines patterns of all radiuses, while heuristics and experiments both indicate that patterns with a large radius take much time only to bring negligible effectiveness gains. We develop a specially designed algorithm capable of working under radius threshold constraints, by which patterns with a large radius are not mined at all. Experiments suggest that our algorithm helps with the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness in WNC tasks.
