This paper presents a fault tolerant multiprocessor architecture suitable for real time control applications requiring an extremely high degree of reliability. The architecture satisfies the following requirements:
 l) Ability to deal with software as well as hardware faults: The proposed architecture is based on the assignment of distinct but redundant software modules to each task.
 2) Efficient use of resources: The proposed architecture is a multiprocessor using time redundancy for fault correction. Thus, redundancy (beyond that needed for fault detection) is invoked only when a fault is detected. In normal operation, this extra capacity is available as an additional computing resource.
 3) No hard core: In addition to the usual replication of system components, a partitioned system executive and a unique communication facility is defined which insures that the available redundancy will not be lost through a “domino” effect.
 4) Interaction of computing units with sensors and effectors: The manner in which system architecture must be responsive to the amount and type of redundancy provided by the sensors and effectors is shown.
 5) Use of current technology: The proposed architecture is based on the use of currently available hardware for the major system components.
 After a detailed description of the architecture and the method of system operation, the system is related to existing fault tolerant systems, and unique characteristics of the present design are indicated.
