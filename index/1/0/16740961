Independent component analysis of natural images leads to emergence of simple cell properties, i.e. linear filters that resemble wavelets or Gabor functions. In this paper, we extend ICA to explain further properties of V1 cells. First, we decompose natural images into independent subspaces instead of scalar components. This model leads to emergence of phase and shift invariant features, similar to those in V1 complex cells. Second, we define a topography between the linear components obtained by ICA. The topographic distance between two components is defined by their higher-order correlations, so that two components are close to each other in the topography if they are strongly dependent on each other. This leads to simultaneous emergence of both topography and invariances similar to complex cell properties.
