Trust is considered one of the most important factors for successfully managing software outsourcing relationships. However, there is lack of research into understanding the factors that are considered important in establishing and maintaining trust between clients and vendors. The goal of this research is to gain an understanding of software outsourcing vendors' perceptions of the importance of factors that are critical to the establishment and maintenance of trust in software outsourcing projects in Vietnam. We used a multiple case study design to guide our research and in-depth interviews to collect qualitative data from 12 Vietnamese software development practitioners drawn from 8 companies that have been developing software for Far Eastern, European, and American clients. Vendor companies identified that cultural understanding, creditability, capabilities, and personal visits are important factors in gaining the initial trust of a client, while cultural understanding, communication strategies, contract conformance, and timely delivery are vital factors in maintaining that trust.
