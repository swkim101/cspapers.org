Much research has been done recently on getting various UAVs to perch on various surfaces, however very little research has looked at how to detect when this perch has failed, especially when the surface the UAV is perched on is moving. This paper proposes a method to detect these types of falls using the Instantaneous Center of Rotation (ICR) of the UAV. Two methods are proposed to calculate this ICR, one based on integrating accelerometers to get velocities at various points on the UAV, the other based on using the magnitude of the acceleration at these points to estimate the distance to the ICR from that point. These methods provide a way to detect a fall from a moving perch that should work with different types of perching mechanisms and perches, while requiring minimal additional hardware on the UAV.
