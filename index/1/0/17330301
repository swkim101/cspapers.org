To relieve "News Information Overload", in this paper, we propose a novel approach of 5W1H (who, what, whom, when, where, how) event semantic elements extraction for Chinese news event knowledge base construction. The approach comprises a key event identification step, an event semantic elements extraction step and an event ontology population step. We first use a machine learning method to identify the key events from Chinese news stories. Then we extract event 5W1H elements by employing the combination of SRL, NER technique and rule-based method. At last we populate the extracted facts of news events to NOEM, an event ontology designed specifically for modeling semantic elements and relations of events. Our experiments on real online news data sets show the reasonability and feasibility of our approach.
