We formulate an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) that systematically distributes the computations of any technique for optimizing pairwise functions, including non-submodular potentials. Such discrete functions are very useful in segmentation and a breadth of other vision problems. Our method decomposes the problem into a large set of small sub-problems, each involving a sub-region of the image domain, which can be solved in parallel. We achieve consistency between the sub-problems through a novel constraint that can be used for a large class of pairwise functions. We give an iterative numerical solution that alternates between solving the sub-problems and updating consistency variables, until convergence. We report comprehensive experiments, which demonstrate the benefit of our general distributed solution in the case of the popular serial algorithm of Boykov and Kolmogorov (BK algorithm) and, also, in the context of non-submodular functions.
