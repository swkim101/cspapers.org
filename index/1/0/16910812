In micromanipulation, especially microassembly, accuracy is a criterion useful for characterizing the performance of microrobots. The increase of positioning accuracy is a very important issue before making automatic assembly or other micro-tasks such as characterization. Thermal drift is one of the major sources of inaccuracy for automatic micromanipulation in ambient conditions and even in clean room. This paper addresses the calibration of a 1-DOF (Degree Of Freedom) nanopositioning cell including thermal drift compensation. The nanopositioning cell consists of a single-axis PZT stage and a XYZ manual stage which is usually used for fine positioning in microassembly platform. Subsequently, validations are implemented to test the performance by integrating the calibrated model. The experimental results show an effective improvement of the accuracy by a factor of 7 when temperature changes in the range of temperature for training, and 2.4 times improvement is achieved when temperature goes out of the training range.
