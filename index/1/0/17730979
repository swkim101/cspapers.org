The Daytona#8482; data management system is used by AT&T to solve a wide spectrum of data management problems. For example, Daytona is managing a 4 terabyte data warehouse whose largest table contains over 10 billion rows. Daytona's architecture is based on translating its high-level query language Cymbal (which includes SQL as a subset) completely into C and then compiling that C into object code. The system resulting from this architecture is fast, powerful, easy to use and administer, reliable and open to UNIX#8482; tools. In particular, two forms of data compression plus robust horizontal partitioning enable Daytona to handle terabytes with ease.
