ARmonica is a 3D audiovisual augmented reality environment in which players can position and edit virtual bars that play sounds when struck by virtual balls launched under the influence of physics. Players experience ARmonica through head-tracked head-worn displays and tracked hand-held ultramobile personal computers, and interact through tracked Wii remotes and touch-screen taps. The goal is for players to collaborate in the creation and editing of an evolving sonic environment. Research challenges include supporting walk-up usability without sacrificing deeper functionality.
