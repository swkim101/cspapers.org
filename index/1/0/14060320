In this paper, a functional fault model for analog circuit diagnosis is proposed. A faulty module is modeled as a fault-free module in serial or in parallel with a fault module. To extract such a fault module, we adopt an iterative deconvolution technique to deconvolute the impulse response of the fault module from the faulty response. The test results show that with such a fault model and fault extraction technique the diagnostic resolution is improved significantly due to the separation of the fault and the system function. Moreover, such a fault model allows single-module fault tables to be applied to the diagnosis of a multi-module system.
