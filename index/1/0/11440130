With the rapid increase in online video services, video retrieval systems are becoming increasingly important search tools to many users in many different fields. In this poster we present a novel video retrieval interface, which supports the creation of multiple search "facets", to aid users carrying out complex, multi-faceted search tasks. The interface allows multiple searches to be executed and viewed simultaneously, and allows material to be reorganized between the facets. An experiment is presented which compares the faceted interface to a tabbed interface similar to that on modern web browsers, and some preliminary results are given.
