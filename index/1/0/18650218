Reliability is a critical feature of chip integration and unreliability can lead to performance, cost, and time-to-market penalties. Moreover, upcoming Many-Core System-on-Chips (MCSoCs), notably future generations of mobile devices, will suffer from high power densities due to the dark silicon problem. Thus, in this paper, a novel NoC-based MCSoC architecture, called Shift Sprinting, is introduced in order to reliably utilize dark silicon under the power budget constraint. By employing the concept of distributional sprinting, our proposed architecture provides Quality of Service (QoS) to efficiently run real-time streaming applications in mobile devices. Simulation results show meaningful gain in performance and reliability of the system compared to state-of-the-art works.
