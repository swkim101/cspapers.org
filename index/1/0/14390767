A lot of information necessary to maintain a software tends to be lost in conventional documentation. One of the leading causes is considered that the ideas of developers which maintainers will want to know later are not fixed in any documents while the ideas are fresh. To remove the cause, we propose a new description form, called a frame, and construct a system called π, to support a software through its lifetime. This system gathers all the information with the frames, stores it in a database and provides the various services with respect to programming and documentation. This paper describes the frames and a subsystem, called π-editor, which provides a user friendly interface to make it easy to gather essential information. By using frames, (1) the associated information around one programming concept can be gathered at one time and (2) lack of necessary information hardly arises. The editor has the distinguished features such as (1) a structure-oriented display editor, (2) facilities to display selective information, provide helpful user guides, and check input errors immediately.
