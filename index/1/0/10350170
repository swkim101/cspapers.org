Platforms are families of microarchitectures that implement the same instruction set architecture but that differ in architectural parameters, such as frequency, memory latencies, or memory sizes. The choice of these parameters influences execution time, implementation cost, and energy consumption. In this paper, we introduce the first general framework for architecture-parametric timing analysis (APTA). APTA computes an expression that bounds the worst-case execution time (WCET) of a program in terms of architectural parameters. This enables to configure a platform, at design or even at run time, in a way that is guaranteed to meet all deadlines, while minimizing implementation cost and/or energy consumption. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by implementing APTA for a precision-timed (PRET) platform and by evaluating our implementation on MaÌˆlardalen benchmarks.
