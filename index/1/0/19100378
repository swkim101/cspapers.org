Recent progress in LOC technology have made it possible to analyze cells in microfluidic devices in a microscopic environment. Vision-based cell analysis systems have a limitation in their analysis range owing to the small view area of the microscopic objective lens; thus, an expansion of the view area of microscopic observation is required. In this paper, we propose a view expansion system for photomicroscopy using the observing point movement of a Galvano mirror. We develop a prototype of the proposed view expansion system that consists of a microscope, Galvano mirror, and vision system. Then, the visual field of the developed microscopic view expansion system is derived experimentally. Finally, our system is demonstrated through panoramic image developing experiments. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified by comparing it with a normal microscopic video shooting area.
