This paper describes a multi-modal interface design and its implementation to a teleoperated field robot system. The ROBHAZ-DT2 is developed as a teleoperated mobile manipulator for hazard environment applications (e.g. rescue, explosive ordnance disposal, security). To complete these missions in outdoor environment, the robot system must have appropriate functions, accuracy and reliability. However, the more functions it has, the more difficulties for the operator to control the functions. To cope up with this problem, an effective user interface should be developed. The main challenge of this research is to make a simple and intuitive user interface and teleoperate the slave robot easily. This paper provides multi-modalities such as visual, auditory and haptic sense. It enables an operator to control every functions of a field robot, ROBHAZ-DT2 more easily. In this paper, an EOD (explosive ordinance disposal) demonstration is conducted to verify the validity of the proposed multimodal interface.
