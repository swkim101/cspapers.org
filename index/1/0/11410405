We present an analysis of the structured relationships observed in a randomly sampled set of question-like queries submitted to a search engine for a popular online encyclopedic document collection. Our study shows that a relatively small number of binary relationships account for most of the queries in the sample. This empirically validates an approach of analyzing query logs to identify the relationships most relevant to user needs and populating corresponding fact tables from the collection for factoid question answering. Our analysis shows that such an approach can lead to substantial coverage of user questions.
