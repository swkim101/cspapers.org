This paper reports the results of a four-year National Science Foundation CCLI grant that supported development and assessment of curricular material linking computer science (CS), digital audio, music, and sound design. A book and online learning aids were created and used in courses and summer workshops. The material was refined based on feedback from students and instructors. Learning was measured by pre- and post-tests. In this paper, we map the curricular material to the Big Ideas for CS Principles as well as to core CS courses. Objective and subjective assessment of the material over the course of the grant leads us to recommendations for purposeful, parallel, and convergent learning, concepts that are explained in the paper.
