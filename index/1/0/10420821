Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) and Non-Uniform Cache Architectures (NUCAs) represent two emerging trends in computer architecture. Targeting future CMP based systems with NUCA type L2 caches, this paper proposes a novel data migration algorithm for parallel applications and evaluates it. The goal of this migration scheme is to determine a suitable location for each data block within a large L2 space at any given point during execution. A unique characteristic of the proposed scheme is that it models the problem of optimal data placement in the L2 cache space as a two dimensional post office placement problem, presents a practical architectural implementation of this model, and gives an evaluation of the proposed implementation.
