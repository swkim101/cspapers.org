How to achieve the required contouring tracking accuracy especially during high-speed and large-curvature contouring tasks, has always been an important problem in manufacturing applications. In this paper, a contouring error estimation method based on natural local approximation is used, and then the position-loop cross-coupled controller is proposed to reduce the estimated contouring error. The effectiveness and superiority of the natural local approximation method using on the position-loop cross-coupled control scheme are demonstrated through experiments on a biaxial linear motor drive servo system.
