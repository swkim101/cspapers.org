In this paper, experimental studies of bilateral teleoperation control of a quadrotor system are presented. Not only position control but force control of a quadrotor system is regulated by forming a force controlled loop. The contact force is measured by a load cell mounted on the top of the quadrotor system. The sensed force is used for a haptic device as an operator feels the force. This configuration forms the bilateral teleoperation control system. Contact force of a quadrotor system in the altitude direction is regulated by the command from the master. The quadrotor system is controlled by a master to fly up from the ground to the ceiling, and to maintain desired contact force against the ceiling, and finally to land back on the ground. This experimental work mimics the possible ceiling task performed by a quadrotor system to see the feasibility of applying the force control technique to the quadrotor system. Experimental studies confirm the feasible force control performance.
