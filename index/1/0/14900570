The IBM Poughkeepsie mechanical design system reduces the cost and time to design and release mechanical parts during the product development cycle. The system uses an interactive graphics design program, CADAM (FOOTNOTE: CADAM is a registered trademark of Lockheed Corporation.), and integrates complementary applications driven from the common mechanical design data base. The applications include: 1. Synchronization of the graphics data base with the bill of material data base. 2. Automated power cabling design and checking. 3. Release of mechanical designs using a computer network.
