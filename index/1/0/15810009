In this report a language (SDL) for describing structural properties of digital systems will be presented. SDL can be used at all levels of the design process i. e. from the system level down to the circuit level. The language is intended as a complement to existing computer hardware description languages, which emphasize behavioural description.The language was motivated partly by the nature of the design process.
