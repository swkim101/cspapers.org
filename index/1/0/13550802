This paper proposes a novel human-computer interface system, with architecture flexible enough to adapt to various types of physical disabilities and able-bodied person, and also capable of connecting to various devices via a wireless protocol, using a tablet PC as a central system with which a user are interacting. For this interface system surface Electromyogram (EMG) of various muscles which a user still has control, are used as input signals for controlling a tablet. The aim of this system is to extract additional intention of user while user doing deskwork. The characteristic EMG patterns, which are observed when agonistic and antagonistic muscles contract together, are utilized for extracting operational intention. Since these patterns are rarely observed while user doing deskwork or other actions of daily life, this methodology can discriminate the derivation of EMG whether intentional or not. Then the operability of interface system are evaluated by Fitts' law based test GUI. The experimental results show the validity of our proposed interface system comparering with other alternative interface systems.
