A challenging problem for model checking is represented by railway interlocking systems. It is a well known fact that interlocking systems, due to their inherent complexity related to the high number of variables involved, are not readily amenable to automatic verification, typically incurring in state space explosion problems. The study described in this paper aims at evaluating and experimenting the industrial application of verification by model checking for this class of systems. The choices made at the beginning of the study, also on the basis of specific requirements from the industrial partner, are presented, together with the advancement status of the project and the plans for its completion.
