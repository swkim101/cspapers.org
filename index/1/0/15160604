Certain algorithms also lend them-selves well to design of experiments (DOE). Adaptive designrefers to experimental design where determining where to sam-ple next is inﬂuenced by information from previous experiments.We present a constrained optimization algorithm known as su-perEGO (a variant of the EGO algorithm of Schonlau, Welchand Jones) that is able to create adaptive designs effectively. Itsability to allow easily for a variety of sampling criteria and to in-corporate constraint information accurately makes it well suitedto the needs of adaptive design. The approach is demonstratedon a human reach experiment where the selection of samplingpoints adapts successfully to the stature and perception of the in-dividual test subject. Results from the initial study indicate thatsuperEGO is able to create experimental designs that yield moreaccurate models using fewer points than the original testing pro-cedure.NOMENCLATUREDOE Design of ExperimentsISC Inﬁll Sampling CriterionMLE Maximum Likelihood Estimation
