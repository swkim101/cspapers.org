City Indicators are metrics used to measure city per- formance. Global City Indicators, as developed by the Global Cities Institute at the University of Toronto, are metrics that have been agreed to by over 250 cities world wide and have been approved as ISO 37120. The definitions of the indicators exist only in written form. The purpose of this research is to provide an ontology for representing the definition of these indi- cators and their instantiation by cities worldwide so that they can shared across the Semantic Web. This paper describes the requirements for the ontology and provides an example of its use.
