To integrate Linked Open Data, which originates from various and heterogeneous sources, the use of well-defined ontologies is essential. However, oftentimes the utilization of these ontologies by data publishers differs from the intended application envisioned by ontology engineers. This may lead to unspecified properties being used ad-hoc as predicates in RDF triples or it may result in infrequent usage of specified properties. These mismatches impede the goals and propagation of the Web of Data as data consumers face difficulties when trying to discover and integrate domain-specific information. In this work, we identify and classify common misusage patterns by employing frequency analysis and rule mining. Based on this analysis, we introduce an algorithm to propose suggestions for a data-driven ontology re-engineering workflow, which we evaluate on two large-scale RDF datasets.
