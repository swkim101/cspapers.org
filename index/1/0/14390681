Especially multiagent settings, however, are known to suffer from an exponential increase in value component sizes as interactions become denser, restricting problem sizes and types that can be handled. We present an approach to mitigate this limitation for certain types of multiagent systems, exploiting a property that can be thought of as "anonymous influence" in the factored MDP. We show how representational benefits from anonymity translate into computational efficiencies, both for variable elimination in a factor graph and for the approximate linear programming solution to factored MDPs. Our methods scale to factored MDPs that were previously unsolvable, such as the control of a stochastic disease process over densely connected graphs with 50 nodes and 25 agents.
