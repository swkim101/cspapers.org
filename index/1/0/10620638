This paper presents an algorithm for optimizing the route of a connection that becomes suboptimal due to operations such as handoffs and location-based reroutes, and applies this algorithm to the handoff management problem in mobile ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) networks based on the PNNI (Private Network-to-Network Interface) standard. The route optimization algorithm uses hierarchical route information of the connection and summarized topology and loading information of the network to determine a “crossover node” such that adjusting the connection from that crossover node results in an optimally routed connection. Handoff management schemes that perform local rerouting of connections have been proposed in order to support fast handoffs. These methods result in suboptimally routed connections. In this paper, we demonstrate how this route optimization algorithm can be used to optimize the route of a connection after such a handoff is executed, as the second phase of a two-phase handoff scheme. This route optimization procedure can also be executed as part of the handoff procedure resulting in a one-phase handoff scheme. Applying this route optimization algorithm, we propose two one-phase schemes, the one-phase optimal scheme and the one-phase minimal scheme. A comparative performance analysis of one- and two-phase handoff schemes is presented. Measures of comparison are handoff latency and the amount of network resources used by a connection. Handoff latency in the one-phase optimal scheme is greater than that in the two-phase schemes, and handoff latency in the one-phase minimal scheme is smaller than that in the two-phase schemes. The one-phase methods show a significant increase in efficiency of the connection compared to the two-phase methods.
