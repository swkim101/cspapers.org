The transaction concept in computing goes back to the early days of computerized data processing. It has developed and evolved over the years both in terms of formal theory and practical application. This evolutionary process has been driven in large part by applications that require transactionlike properties. Newly emerging applications include several that involve people in a time-dependent role. The new forms of human involvement in transaction processing required by these applications are generating new systemslevel challenges. Likewise, these needs present challenges and opportunities from a theoretical standpoint. This talk reviews the history of synergy between theory and practice in the area of transaction processing, and considers currently emerging needs from that perspective.
