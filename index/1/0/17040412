An important aspect of communication in Twitter (and other Social Network is message propagation -- people creating posts for others to share. Although there has been work on modelling how tweets in Twitter are propagated (retweeted), an untackled problem has been who will retweet a message. Here we consider the task of finding who will retweet a message posted on Twitter. Within a learning to-rank framework, we explore a wide range of features, such as retweet history, followers status, followers active time and followers interests. We find that followers who retweeted or mentioned the author's tweets frequently before and have common interests are more likely to be retweeters.
