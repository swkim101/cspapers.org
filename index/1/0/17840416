Earlier investigation into cross-language information retrieval systems that incorporate both document and query translation has shown that incorporating document translation improves retrieval performance even for human-quality query translation. Thus we view monolingual retrieval as crosslanguage retrieval in which the queries have already been translated and propose the incorporation of document translation. Experiments on the TREC 6 and 7 ad hoc tasks [l, 21 yield modest improvements in performance.
