This paper presents a new modeling approach for IMP programs with operator component matrix (OCM) model, which can be used in IMP program diagnosis. Using this model and model-based diagnosis method, some logic errors can be found in IMP programs. The model can also be extended to all kinds of imperative programs. The advantages of this diagnosis method lie in its simple and regular presentation, uniform diagnosed objects, usage of isomorphism assumptions in structure, and usage of assertions about the expected program. These advantages make diagnoses more accurate, and even help to correct the faults by mutation of operator components.
