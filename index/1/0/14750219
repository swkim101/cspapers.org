An integral part of any parallel processing system is its interconnection network. These networks have been the objects of intense research in recent years. Existing Markov chain analysis techniques for circuit switched, generalized cube interconnection networks will be extended to allow the performance modeling of partitionable SIMD/MIMD systems. Based on both analysis and simulation data, the relationship between the network performance, the partitioning scheme employed, and the conflict resolution algorithm used within the network will be enumerated. It will be shown that "input partitioning" coupled with the use of the "hold" conflict algorithm produces the best network operation in terms of the time to establish a circuit switched path through the network. Additionally, it will be shown that the performance of partitioned subnetworks is generally better than the performance of comparable sized random groupings of network resources.
