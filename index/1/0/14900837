We discuss a system for performing interactive graph drawing on the World Wide Web (WWW), implemented in the Java programming language. The system allows for highly interactive experimentation in graph drawing, supporting direct user interaction and parameter adjustment during the embedding process. The use of Java and the WWW in its implementation makes the system globally available, both for interactive use and for integration into other systems, regardless of computer platform details. We present the design, implementation and use of the system, as well as some experimental results.
