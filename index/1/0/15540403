Synchronization of multiple threads in a Java program using the built-in features of the language has serious pitfalls for the programmer, particularly if a thread is interrupted while waiting inside a monitor. These concerns have lead to a movement to avoid Java monitors altogether and use message passing instead. This paper visits the field of concurrent programming to show that replacing all Java monitors with message passing is an overreaction to these problems.
