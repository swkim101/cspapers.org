The standard SQL assumes that the users are aware of all tables and their schemas to write queries. This assumption may be valid when the users deal with a relatively small number of tables, but writing a SQL query on a large number of tables is often challenging; (1) the users do not know what tables are relevant to their query, (2) it is too cumbersome to explicitly list tens of (or even hundreds of) relevant tables in the FROM clause and (3)
 the schemas of those tables are not identical. We now propose an intuitive yet powerful extension to SQL that helps users explore and aggregate information spread over a large number of tables.
