This paper presents a voice-controlled mobile robotic system capable of recognizing voice commands and relaying them to a mobile robot. First, the specifications of the robot used will be presented. Second, a description of the HTK toolkit, the HMM, and the VCR software developed will be discussed. Finally, comparing our HTK-developed HMM against a commercially available Microsoft speech recognition engine (SDK 5.1) in terms of accuracy. The experimental evaluation and accuracy tests will show the ability of the VCR software to control a robot with simple human voice commands. Conclusions and future work are presented towards the end of the paper.
