Model Driven Architecture (MDA), which supports the development of software-intensive systems through the transformation of models to executable components and applications, requires a standard way to express transformations. The approach developed by this research focuses on defining pattern-based transformation at the metamodel level. This research has two primary objectives. The first objective is to support systematic application of patterns. The use of patterns as model building blocks (through pattern-based transformations) helps raise the level of abstraction at which systems are developed. The second research objective is to support controlled model evolution by specifying pattern-based transformations at the metamodel level.
