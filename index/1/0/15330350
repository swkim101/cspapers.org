Online metrics measured through A/B tests have become the gold standard for many evaluation questions. But can we get the same results as A/B tests without actually fielding a new system? And can we train systems to optimize online metrics without subjecting users to an online learning algorithm? This tutorial summarizes and unifies the emerging body of methods on counterfactual evaluation and learning. These counterfactual techniques provide a well-founded way to evaluate and optimize online metrics by exploiting logs of past user interactions. In particular, the tutorial unifies the causal inference, information retrieval, and machine learning view of this problem, providing the basis for future research in this emerging area of great potential impact.
