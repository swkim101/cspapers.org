The wide adoption of smart devices has stimulated a fast shift of security-critical data from desktop to mobile devices. However, recurrent device theft and loss expose mobile devices to various security threats and even physical attacks. This paper presents TinMan, a system that protects confidential data such as web site password and credit card number (we use the term cor to represent these data, which is short for Confidential Record) from being leaked or abused even under device theft. TinMan separates accesses of cor from the rest of the functionalities of an app, by introducing a trusted node to store cor and offloading any code from a mobile device to the trusted node to access cor. This completely eliminates the exposure of cor on the mobile devices. The key challenges to TinMan include deciding when and how to efficiently and transparently offload execution; TinMan addresses these challenges with security-oriented offloading with a low-overhead tainting scheme called asymmetric tainting to track accesses to cor to trigger offloading, as well as transparent SSL session injection and TCP pay-load replacement to offload accesses to cor. We have implemented a prototype of TinMan based on Android and demonstrated how TinMan protects the information of user's bank account and credit card number without modifying the apps. Evaluation results also show that TinMan incurs only a small amount of performance and power overhead.
