A drilling task requires a mechanism with five degrees of freedom, in order to achieve the correct position and orientation of the drilling tool. When performed with a standard 6-axes industrial robot, this task leaves an extra degree of freedom that can be exploited in order to achieve any additional criterion. Unfortunately, typical industrial robotic control architectures do not allow the user to modify the inverse kinematics algorithm, and thus to solve task redundancy following any specified criterion. In this paper a method to enforce an arbitrary redundancy resolution criterion on top of an industrial robot controller is discussed and applied to the execution of a drilling task. The extra degree of freedom is used to perform a torque-effective drilling. Experimental results achieved on the ABB IRB 140 industrial robot are presented.
