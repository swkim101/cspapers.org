(MATH) We give an algorithm for finding a Fourier representation <b>R</b> of <i>B</i> terms for a given discrete signal signal <b>A</b> of length <i>N</i>, such that $\|\signal-\repn\|_2^2$ is within the factor (1 +ε) of best possible $\|\signal-\repn_\opt\|_2^2$. Our algorithm can access <b>A</b> by reading its values on a sample set <b><i>T</i></b> ⊆[0,<i>N</i>), chosen randomly from a (non-product) distribution of our choice, independent of <b>A</b>. That is, we sample non-adaptively. The total time cost of the algorithm is polynomial in <i>B</i> log(<i>N</i>)log(<i>M</i>)ε (where <i>M</i> is the ratio of largest to smallest numerical quantity encountered), which implies a similar bound for the number of samples.
