In this paper, a new motor control input and controller for small-scale electrically powered multirotor aerial vehicles is proposed. The proposed scheme is based on controlling aerodynamic power as opposed to the rotor speed of each motor-rotor system. Electrical properties of the brushless direct current motor are used to both estimate and control the mechanical power of the motor system which is coupled with aerodynamic power using momentum theory analysis. In comparison to current state-of-the-art motor control for multirotor aerial vehicles, the proposed approach is robust to unmodelled aerodynamic effects such as wind disturbances and ground effects. Theory and experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed motor control.
