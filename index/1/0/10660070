This paper reports an ultra-fast manipulation on micro-scale objects in a microfluidic channel. The objects are manipulated in simple harmonic motions and the manipulation speed has been achieved up to 3000 Hz. While the maximum speed was only about 130 Hz in previous works, the speed is advanced with an additional order in this work. Based on the experimental results, we find that the gain decreases along the line of âˆ’20 dB/decade in a logarithmic plot. The transfer function based on a theoretical model was employed for interpreting the results. The experimental gain and theoretical gain were well matched. Finally, experiments with red blood cells were performed and it supports the feasibility of applying such ultra-fast manipulation to cell evaluations.
