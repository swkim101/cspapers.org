In 2007, Vestal proposed Mixed-Criticality Scheduling (MCS) to increase utilisation despite imperfect timing evidence. Others have since refined the MCS problem formulation, proposed alternative scheduling approaches, and evaluated their performance. We assess existing MCS problem formulations from a safety assurance perspective and report problems found. Among these is the use of the word ‘criticality’ to mean several related but distinctly different things such as Safety Integrity Levels (SIL), importance, and confidence. We conclude with suggestions for addressing the problems found.
