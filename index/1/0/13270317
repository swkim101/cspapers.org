This paper describes Animaatiokone, an installation for experimenting and learning about stop-motion animation. Located in a movie theater, it allows people to create clay animation while waiting for a movie. Collaboration between users is supported, for example, by sharing of clay actors. The installation's user interface allows even beginners to create and edit animation with help of automatic onion-skinning and simple controls developed through iterative testing and prototyping. In test use, the installation has been popular and hundreds of animations have been created and made available via the installation's homepage http://www.animaatiokone.net
