In this paper, we propose the use of metadata contained in documents to improve coreference resolution. Specifically, we quantify the impact of speaker and turn information on the performance of our coreference system, and show that the metadata can be effectively encoded as features of a statistical resolution system, which leads to a statistically significant improvement in performance.
