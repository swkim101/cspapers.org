The Cerebus project is an attempt to extend parallelreactive architectures to higher-level cognitive tasks. Cerebus is intended to be a “self-demoing” robot in the sense that it is able to give a short talk about itself and it is able to field (slightly) more detailed questions (asked by typing English on a keyboard) about itself, in add ition to demonstrating specific capabilities on demand. We will describe the motivation and techniques underlying the system and present preliminary results. 1
