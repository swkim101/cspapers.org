We present and <italic>O</italic>(1) slowdown emulation of a fault-free <italic>N</italic> x <italic>N</italic> two dimensional mesh with a slack of <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>N</italic> log log <italic>N</italic>) by a faulty mesh of the same size and slack. All components of the faulty mesh, including the memory modules, are assumed to be subject to failure. The faults may occur at any time during the emulation and the system readjusts dynamically.
