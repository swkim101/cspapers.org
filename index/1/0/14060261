The reliability of atomic commit protocols for distributed systems is investigated. Recent research has proved that blocking is unavoidable after certain site or network failures. The results of this paper enable one to quantify the expected amount of such blocking.A probabilistic model of a distributed system is developed, consisting of two components: a model of the communication network and a model of distributed transaction processing. We introduce the notion of the window of uncertainty for a site participating in a distributed transaction, which characterizes when that site is vulnerable to blocking in the event of a network partition. The model is then used to evaluate and compare the expected number of blocked sites for several atomic commit protocols.
