Since the formalization of ring signature by Rivest, Shamir and Tauman in 2001, there are lots of variations appeared in the literature. Almost all of the variations rely on the random oracle model for security proof. In this paper, we propose a ring signature scheme based on bilinear pairings, which is proven to be secure against adaptive chosen message attack without using the random oracle model. It is one of the first in the literature to achieve this security level.
