Telerobotics fundamentally aims to project human skills into a remote, unstructured environment. A key component of human skills is anticipatory modulation of limb impedances in accordance with task requirements and in expectation of events or disturbances. These adjustments occur continually in human interaction strategies, yet are mostly masked in telerobotics by limited bandwidth controllers and fixed impedance hardware. We propose a telerobotic architecture with user-controlled variable impedance and show a single degree of freedom experimental implementation. The master incorporates a grip force sensor as an additional impedance command channel. Since grip force correlates with the user's own impedance, this input provides an intuitive and natural extension to the regular interface. On the slave, a physically variable clutch actuator is used to adjust both low and high frequency impedance. The additional command channel allows the operator to utilize impedance variation strategies to control impact forces and accomplish varying tasks. These natural interaction strategies are simpler and more robust, leading to superior performance and a telerobot which more effectively represents the operator.
