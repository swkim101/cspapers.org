This paper presents the first formalization of partial key leakage security of a two-pass two-party authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocol on the extended Canetti-Krawczyk (eCK) security model. Our formalization, λ-leakage resilient eCK security, is a (stronger) generalization of the eCK security model with enhanced by the notion of λ-leakage resilient security recently introduced by Akavia, Goldwasser and Vaikuntanathan. We present a PKI-based two-pass key exchange protocol with Hash Proof System (HPS), that is λ-leakage resilient eCK secure without random oracles.
