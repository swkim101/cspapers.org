Bluetooth is a promising recent radio technology for ad hoc networking. Bluetooth networks are based on connecting together piconets, to form a scatternet. The structure of the scatternet, and the way the scatternet is built and maintained, are not part of the Bluetooth specifications, but have a tremendous impact on the performance of the network. We present an efficient distributed algorithm for Bluetooth scatternet construction. The resulting scatternet is scalable and our construction is dynamic in the sense that nodes can join and leave the network at their convenience. For fixed constant degree of nodes, the resulting diameter is polylogarithmic in the size of the network, and the connectivity of the masters is high. We also give a routing protocol adapted to the specific scatternet topology returned by our algorithm. This protocol does not require complicated path-discovery methods, but is based on a simple virtual labeling of the devices participating in the scatternet.
