Although the use of secure software development tools can help developers build more secure software, many developers do not use these tools. In previous work, a colleague conducted interviews with professional developers to develop a qualitative model of factors that influence developers' decisions to use or not use security tools. In the work described in this abstract, I conducted interviews with open-source software developers to evaluate how our findings generalize outside of corporate software development populations. With the data from these interviews, I aim to gain insight into open-source software developers' behavior and values. I aim to refine, expand, and generalize our security tool adoption model so it may be used to foster wider adoption of security tools.
