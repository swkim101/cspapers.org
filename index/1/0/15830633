Automating any part of the user interface design and evaluation process can help reduce development costs. This paper presents a metric-based tool called AIDE (semi-Automated Interface Designer and Evaluator) which assists designers in creating and evaluating layouts for a given set of interface controls. AIDE is an initial attempt to demonstrate the potential of incorporating metrics into user interface development tools, Analyzing the interfaces produced using AIDE provides encouraging feedback about the potential of this technique.
