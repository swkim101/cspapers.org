2.1.1 Model Validation The above archetypal models can be gathered in a reusable set of component-level model libraries. A validation step is necessary to check whether the predicted figures for each of the above components are consistent with the related "real world" performance behaviors. A data collection activity was hence planned, and the related figures were compared with the predicted ones. This step was repeated to achieve a consistent confidence interval between predicted and measured data.
