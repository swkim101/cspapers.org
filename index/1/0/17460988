Structure estimation from motion (SfM) is a classical and well-studied problem in computer and robot vision, and many solutions have been proposed to treat it as a recursive filtering/estimation task. However, the issue of actively optimizing the transient response of the SfM estimation error has not received a comparable attention. In this paper, we provide an experimental validation of a recently proposed nonlinear active SfM strategy via two concrete applications: 3D structure estimation for a spherical and a cylindrical target. The experimental results fully support the theoretical analysis and clearly show the benefits of the proposed active strategy. Indeed, by suitably acting on the camera motion and estimation gains, it is possible to assign the error transient response and make it equivalent to that of a reference linear second-order system with desired poles.
