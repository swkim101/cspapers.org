This paper presents an efficient signature file approach for fast and intelligent retrieval of large Chinese full-text document databases. The proposed approach is an integrated and efficient text access method, which performs well both in exact match searching of Boolean queries and best match searching (ranking) of quasi-natural language queries. Using this approach, the inherent difficulties of Chinese word segmentation and proper noun identification can be effectively reduced, queries can be expressed with non-controlled vocabulary, and the ranking function can be easily implemented neither demanding extra space overhead nor affecting the retrieval efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves good performance in many ways, especially in the reduction of false drops and space overhead, the speedup of retrieval time, and the capability of best match searching using quasi-natural language queries. In conclusion, the proposed approach is capable of retrieving gigabytes of Chinese texts very efficiently and intelligently.
