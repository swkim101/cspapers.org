Trajectory optimization is done most efficiently when an inverse dynamics model is available. Here we develop the first model of contact dynamics defined in both the forward and inverse directions. The contact impulse is the solution to a convex optimization problem: minimize kinetic energy in contact space subject to non-penetration and friction-cone constraints. We use a custom interior-point method to make the optimization problem unconstrained; this is key to defining the forward and inverse dynamics in a consistent way. The resulting model has a parameter which sets the amount of contact smoothing, facilitating continuation methods for optimization. We implemented the proposed contact solver in our new physics engine (MuJoCo). A full Newton step of trajectory optimization for a 3D walking gait takes only 160 msec, on a 12-core PC.
