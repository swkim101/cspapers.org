In this paper, we present a novel acoustic sensing technique that recognizes two convenient input actions: hand gestures and on-body touch. We achieved them by observing the frequency spectrum of the wave propagated in the body, around the periphery of the wrist. Our approach can recognize hand gestures and on-body touch concurrently in real-time and is expected to obtain rich input variations by combining them. We conducted a user study that showed classification accuracy of 97%, 96%, and 97% for hand gestures, touches on the forearm, and touches on the back of the hand.
