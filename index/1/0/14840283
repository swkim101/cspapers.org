In this paper, we present a semantic search technique considering the type of desired Web resources and the semantic relationships between the resources and the query keywords in the ontology. In order to effectively retrieve the most relevant top-k resources, we propose a novel ranking model. To do this, we devise a measure to determine the weight of the semantic relationship. In addition, we consider the number of meaningful semantic relationships between a resource and keywords, the coverage of keywords, and the distinguishability of keywords. Through experiments using real datasets, we observe that our ranking model provides more accurate semantic search results compared to existing ranking models.
