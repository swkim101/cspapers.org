WikiNEXT is a wiki engine 100% written in JavaScript that relies on recent APIs and frameworks. It has been designed to author web applications directly in a web browser, which can exploit the web of data. It combines the functionalities of a semantic wiki with those of a Web-based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in order to develop web applications in addition to writing classic documents. It gives developers a rich internal API (Application Programming Interface) and provides several functionalities to exploit the web of data. Our approach uses templates, a special type of wiki pages that represent the semantic data model. Templates generate wiki pages with semantic annotations that are stored as quadruplets in a triple store engine. To query this semantic data, we provide a SPARQL endpoint. Screencasts are available on YouTube (look for WikiNEXT).
