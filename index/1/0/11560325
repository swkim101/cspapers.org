Developers of rapidly growing applications must be able to anticipate potential scalability problems before they cause performance issues in production environments. A new type of data independence, called scale independence, seeks to address this challenge by guaranteeing a bounded amount of work is required to execute all queries in an application, independent of the size of the underlying data. While optimization strategies have been developed to provide these guarantees for the class of queries that are scale-independent when executed using simple indexes, there are important queries for which such techniques are insufficient.
 Executing these more complex queries scale-independently requires precomputation using incrementally-maintained materialized views. However, since this precomputation effectively shifts some of the query processing burden from execution time to insertion time, a scale-independent system must be careful to ensure that storage and maintenance costs do not threaten scalability. In this paper, we describe a scale-independent view selection and maintenance system, which uses novel static analysis techniques that ensure that created views do not themselves become scaling bottlenecks. Finally, we present an empirical analysis that includes all the queries from the TPC-W benchmark and validates our implementation's ability to maintain nearly constant high-quantile query and update latency even as an application scales to hundreds of machines.
