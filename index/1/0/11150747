This panel will discuss major issues and challenges in computer science education across a wide range of institutions. It originates from a report developed by the Education Working Group of the Strategic Directions in Computing Research (SDCR) Workshop. That report appears in its entirety in the ACM Computing Surveys issue [Wegner96] which is distributed to all attendees to this SIGCSE 97 conference.) In this panel, we will discuss the general aims and accomplishments of the SDCR conference, highlighting the specific recommendations of the Education Working Group. We will outline ideas for improving the quality and effectiveness of computer science programs at the undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 levels. We will also argue for the creation of a Resource Center for developing and distributing computer science and engineering curricular materials, including the idea of developing a "Virtual Computing University."
