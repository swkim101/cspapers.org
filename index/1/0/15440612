In this paper we describe research on summarizing conversations in the meetings and emails domains. We introduce a conversation summarization system that works in multiple domains utilizing general conversational features, and compare our results with domain-dependent systems for meeting and email data. We find that by treating meetings and emails as conversations with general conversational features in common, we can achieve competitive results with state-of-the-art systems that rely on more domain-specific features.
