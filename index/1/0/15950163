This paper describes a placement method of rectangular blocks with the interconnection channels. The method consists of a constructive initial placement followed by an iterative improvement. An estimation of the interconnection channel widths, the number of crossovers and the connection lengths is proposed. The criteria to be minimized are : area, number of crossovers and connection length.
