Computational techniques such as Behavioural Analytics (BA) have been extremely effective at transforming social media data into useful insights for applications such as recommender systems [1] and customer relation management [2]. However, due to the rise of smarter, more sophisticated social bots [3] and the increasing reliance on algorithmic filtering (which nudges online users to make certain choices and take specific actions) [4], it begs the question, if we are using data from social media for modelling, are we modelling human behavior in social media or simply reverse engineering how bots and other algorithms operate?
