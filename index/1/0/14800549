INTRODUCTION Despite a proliferation of methodologies for designing computer systems, we commonly end up with systems that appear to have been designed in spite of the users: they are difficult to master and/or are poorly suited for the users’ tasks. Participatory design rejects the assumption that designers design and users use, assuming instead that unless representative users are among the designers, it is unlikely that the system will make adequate use of the users’ skills and talents or provide good support for their tasks. Of course, poorly designed systems have negative effects for both users and their employers.
