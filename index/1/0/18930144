We present a natural language generation approach which models, exploits, and manipulates the non-linguistic context in situated communication, using techniques from AI planning. We show how to generate instructions which deliberately guide the hearer to a location that is convenient for the generation of simple referring expressions, and how to generate referring expressions with context-dependent adjectives. We implement and evaluate our approach in the framework of the Challenge on Generating Instructions in Virtual Environments, finding that it performs well even under the constraints of realtime generation.
