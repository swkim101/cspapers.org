The World Wide Web is now a treasure house of public opinion about any and all topics. We have therefore been developing a novel Web-based question answering system, named “Web OpinionPoll”, that collects other people’s opinions about a user-given concern on the Web, and presents a general view, local aspect, and short summary of the opinions in a visual way. This system will be able to intuitively answer users’ questions requesting others’ opinions, for example, “What do people think about mothers always getting angry?”. We report on the progress of our developing system, and propose a system that effectively collects the Web pages that are related to a user question or concern using a paraphrasing technique, extracts impressions from each of the Web pages, and plots their impressions on two impression planes each spanned by two impression scales.
