The separation of all representations of structural properties from data is proposed as a stratagem for data base management system (DBMS) design. The DBMS operates by creating for each user an interpreted user-oriented data base machine which utilizes the separated structure representations as an instruction stream. An example of the user data base machine is considered, and a proposed implementation of the DBMS is outlined. The advantages of such a DBMS are discussed.
