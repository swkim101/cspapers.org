Parameterized programming [9] is a powerful technique for the construction, maintenance, and reuse of software. In this technique, modules may be parameterized over very general interfaces that describe what properties of an environment are required for the module to work correctly. Ease of construction, maintenance, and reuse of software are all enhanced by the flexibility of the parameterization mechanism provided.
OBJ2 [8] is designed to support parameterized programming, using algebraic specification techniques [2, 16, 17]; it provides facilities for user-definable abstract data types, parameterized
