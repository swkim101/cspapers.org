In this paper a new intelligent control architecture for autonomous multi-robot systems is presented. Furthermore, the paper deals with task description, task distribution, task allocation and coordination of the system components. The main advantage of the new control architecture is the distributed execution of tasks or subtasks by components of the multi-robot system. The components are able to build teams dynamically thereby avoiding the bottle neck problem of the information flow in centralized controlled architectures. The communication and cooperation between components to achieve distributed organized control architectures is studied. The described intelligent control architecture is to replace the former control architecture of the autonomous robot KAMRO.<<ETX>>
