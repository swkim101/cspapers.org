In this paper, we introduce a new community detection algorithm, called Attractor, which automatically spots communities in a network by examining the changes of "distances" among nodes (i.e. distance dynamics). The fundamental idea is to envision the target network as an adaptive dynamical system, where each node interacts with its neighbors. The interaction will change the distances among nodes, while the distances will affect the interactions. Such interplay eventually leads to a steady distribution of distances, where the nodes sharing the same community move together and the nodes in different communities keep far away from each other. Building upon the distance dynamics, Attractor has several remarkable advantages: (a) It provides an intuitive way to analyze the community structure of a network, and more importantly, faithfully captures the natural communities (with high quality). (b) Attractor allows detecting communities on large-scale networks due to its low time complexity (O(|E|)). (c) Attractor is capable of discovering communities of arbitrary size, and thus small-size communities or anomalies, usually existing in real-world networks, can be well pinpointed. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm allows the effective and efficient community detection and has good performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.
