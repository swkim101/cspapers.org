The object oriented paradigm provides new opportunities for development via reuse. However, those opportunities are accompanied by new challenges. In particular, consumers of reusable components want to ensure that they have maintained the semantic integrity of the reused components. Several special approaches have been proposed to describe and enforce semantic integrity constraints in reusable components, for example class invariants [ 11, contracts [2], and inspection gauges (31; others have discussed more conventional means such as simple assertions and unit and module testing (451.
