In this paper, we are interested in the performance of both one-against-all and one-against-one for classification algorithms, such as decision tree, na√Øve bayes, support vector machine, and logistic regression. Since both one-against-all and one-against-one work like creating a classification committee, they are expected to improve the performance of classification algorithms. However, our experimental results surprisingly show that one-against-all worsens the performance of the algorithms on most datasets. One-against-one helps, but performs worse than the same iterations of bagging these algorithms. Thus, we conclude that both one-against-all and one-against-one should not be used for the algorithms that can perform multiclass classifications directly. Bagging is better approach for improving their performance.
