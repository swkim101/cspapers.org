It is well known that American productivity has advanced very little in the last ten years in contrast to many other countries' rapidly rising productivity. It is becoming evident that major productivity gains can be made, particularly in the office workforce, which constitutes the majority of the American workforce today. Rapidly developing information technologies are making it possible to achieve radically increased productivity in the office. This paper will discuss the specific technologies; the specific major office functions; how they interrelate; and how they are making such radical productivity increases possible. "The Paperless Office", created by Micronet, Inc. in Washington, D.C., will be described. The current project to automate the office activities of the American Productivity Center in Houston, Texas, will be described. Some projections of the significance of these projects will be given.
