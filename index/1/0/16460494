This paper describes an attempt to provide realistic software development experience to a group of 15 students at North Texas State University. Each of the students had some previous programming experiences. Most of this experience was with higher level languages, but all students had been exposed to at least a simple assembler language, CARDIAC(1), in previous course work. The course was designed to be more like a laboratory rather than a lecture course. Scheduled lectures were held to present basic concepts, discuss the programming assignments and to provide for class discussion periods. The course grade was based on the quality of the software projects and on the ability of students to interact with others in the class. The software projects were implemented using several Motorola M6800 Microprocessors.
