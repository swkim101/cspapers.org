In this paper a robotic catching algorithm based on a nonlinear mapping of visual information to the desired trajectory is proposed. The nonlinear mapping is optimized by learning based on constraints of dynamics and kinematics. As a result a reactive and flexible motion is obtained due to the real-time high-speed visual information. Experimental results on catching a moving object using a high-speed vision system and a manipulation are presented.
