The dynamics of a nonlinear bistable system are analyzed in the presence of noise for detecting the weak signals. It is shown that suitable selection of such system parameters with optimal noise intensity values increases the spectral amplification of weak input signal. A criteria has been developed for evaluating the system's performance under various input conditions thus providing the system parameters and noise intensities for maximal performance. Necessary conditions for weak signal amplification are derived, leading to its efficient detection using this simple bistable system. The special case of threshold detection is also discussed using the same results
