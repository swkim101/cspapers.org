a related loglogN improvement of Chazelleâ€™s O(N logd-lN / log log N) space data structure [C86a], that performs the reporting version of d-dimensional orthogonal range query in time O(logd-lN / loglogN + K), where K is the number of elements outputted. a data structure for performing the aggregation version of orthogonal range query with a time-space complexity precisely matching the lower bound prediction that Yao [Y82] derived for the dimension d = 2 and Chazelle
