A hang glider in the form of an aerial wing of airfoil shape is disclosed. The wing is defined by an outer envelope of flexible material inflatable to the airfoil shape and having a plurality of chambers therein each receiving an inflatable bladder. Air inlet openings are provided in the bottom portion of the envelope adjacent the leading edge of the wing. Either the bladders or the chambers are inflated with a gas lighter than air and, during flight, air enters the openings and fills the available space in the others of the bladders or chambers to provide a complete smooth airfoil shape for the wing. Shroud lines are employed to suspend a person beneath the wing during flight.
