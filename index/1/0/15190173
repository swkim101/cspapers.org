Although various mining algorithms have been proposed in the literature to efficiently compute clusters, few strides have been made to date in helping analysts to interactively explore such patterns in the stream context. We present a framework called CLUES to both computationally and visually support the process of real-time mining of density-based clusters. CLUES is composed of three major components. First, as foundation of CLUES, we develop an evolution model of density-based clusters in data streams that captures the complete spectrum of cluster evolution types across streaming windows. Second, to equip CLUES with the capability of efficiently tracking cluster evolution, we design a novel algorithm to piggy-back the evolution tracking process into the underlying cluster detection process. Third, CLUES organizes the detected clusters and their evolution interrelationships into a multidimensional pattern space - presenting clusters at different time horizons and across different abstraction levels. It provides a rich set of visualization and interaction techniques to allow the analyst to explore this multi-dimensional pattern space in real-time. Our experimental evaluation, including performance studies and a user study, using real streams from ground group movement monitoring and from stock transaction domains confirm both the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed CLUES framework.
