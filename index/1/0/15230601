We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of AirCloud -- a novel client-cloud system for pervasive and personal air-quality monitoring at low cost. At the frontend, we create two types of Internet-connected particulate matter (PM2:5) monitors -- AQM and miniAQM, with carefully designed mechanical structures for optimal air-flow. On the cloud-side, we create an air-quality analytics engine that learn and create models of air-quality based on a fusion of sensor data. This engine is used to calibrate AQMs and mini-AQMs in real-time, and infer PM2:5 concentrations. We evaluate AirCloud using 5 months of data and 2 month of continuous deployment, and show that AirCloud is able to achieve good accuracies at much lower cost than previous solutions. We also show three real applications built on top of AirCloud by 3rd party developers to further demonstrate the value of our system.
