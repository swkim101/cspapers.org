Previous studies on facial expression analysis have been focused on recognizing basic expression categories. There is limited amount of work on the continuous expression intensity estimation, which is important for detecting and tracking emotion change. Part of the reason is the lack of labeled data with annotated expression intensity since expression intensity annotation requires expertise and is time consuming. In this work, we treat the expression intensity estimation as a regression problem. By taking advantage of the natural onset-apex-offset evolution pattern of facial expression, the proposed method can handle different amounts of annotations to perform frame-level expression intensity estimation. In fully supervised case, all the frames are provided with intensity annotations. In weakly supervised case, only the annotations of selected key frames are used. While in unsupervised case, expression intensity can be estimated without any annotations. An efficient optimization algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is developed for solving the optimization problem associated with parameter learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method by comparing it against both fully supervised and unsupervised approaches on benchmark facial expression datasets.
