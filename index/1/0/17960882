Link analysis methods have been used successfully for knowledge discovery from the link structure of mutually linking entities. Existing link analysis methods have been inherently designed based on the fact that the entire link structure of the target graph is observable such as public web documents; however, link information in graphs in the real world, such as human relationship or economic activities, is rarely open to public. If link analysis can be performed using graphs with private links in a privacy-preserving way, it enables us to rank entities connected with private ties, such as people, organizations, or business transactions. In this paper, we present a secure link analysis for graphs with private links by means of cryptographic protocols. Our solutions are designed as privacy-preserving expansions of well-known link analysis methods, PageRank and HITS. The outcomes of our protocols are completely equivalent to those of PageRank and HITS. Furthermore, our protocols theoretically guarantee that the private link information possessed by each node is not revealed to other nodes. %We demonstrate the efficiency of our solution by experimental studies, comparing with existing solutions, such as secure function evaluation, decentralized spectral analysis, and privacy-preserving link-analysis.
