The difficulty and expense of achieving valid and reliable tests of bibliographic retrieval systems has been attested to by many investigators. If tests are carried out with large operational systems, there are difficulties in experimentally controlling and modifying the variables. On the other hand, results from small experimental systems tend to be unreliable. An alternative approach to determining general relationships among the variables of a bibliographic or document retrieval system is computer simulation, both of the database and of the search process. Such a simulation is based on a probabilistic model of the document representatives, search statements, the search process and the characteristics of the search output. Before such models are used to determine actual relationships, however, they must be validated by comparison with existing databases, query sets and search outputs. Two types of investigations may be aided by bibliographic retrieval system simulation: (1) studies of efficient ways to store and retrieve bibliographic data, and (2) studies of effective ways to represent bibliographic items (documents) and queries (users' information needs). The former is concerned with analysing and comparing different data structures and access algorithms, the latter with analysing and comparing different document indexing and search statement formulation methods. The bibliographic retrieval systems models for the two types of investigations will not, in general, be the same. The two model types might be categorised as physical models and logical models, respectively. This chapter is concerned with the second type of simulation. Its purpose is:
