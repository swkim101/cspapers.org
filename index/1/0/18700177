Model-driven development is leading to increased use of models in conjunction with source code in software testing. Model-based testing, however, introduces new challenges for testing activities, which include creation and maintenance of traceability information among test-related artifacts. Traceability is required to support activities such as selective regression testing. In fact, most model-based testing automated approaches often concentrate on the test generation and execution activities, while support to other activities is limited (e.g. model-based selective regression testing, coverage analysis and behavioral result evaluation) To address this problem, we propose a solution that uses model transformation to create a traceable infrastructure of test-related artifacts. We use this infrastructure to support model-based selective regression testing.
