We propose to enhance proximity-based probabilistic retrieval models with more contextual information. A term pair with higher contextual relevance of term proximity is assigned a higher weight. Several measures are proposed to estimate the contextual relevance of term proximity. We assume the top ranked documents from a basic weighting model are more relevant to the query, and calculate the contextual relevance of term proximity using the top ranked documents. We propose a context-sensitive proximity model, and the experimental results on standard TREC data sets show the effectiveness of our proposed model.
