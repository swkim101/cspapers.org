The information and communication technologies (ICT) integrate different types of wireless communication technologies to provide IT-enabled services and applications. Our goal is to integrate the available wireless communication technologies to enhance seamless communication efficiency and increase resources utilization. We proposed a heterogeneous network management algorithm which includes roaming and sharing functions. The roaming function provides the multiple network resources in physical and media access control layers. The sharing function supports multiple network resource allocation and the service handover process in network and application layers. By applying the incentive scheme, it also encourage users to share the available resources. The simulation result also shows that the proposed scheme can increase the network bandwidth utilization effectively. The sharing system could be used in home, mobile and vehicular environments to realize ubiquitous social sharing networks.
