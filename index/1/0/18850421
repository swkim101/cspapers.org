We present a cost-effective method for improving data availability during restart recovery of a data base management system (DBMS) after a failure. The method achieves its objective by enabling the processing of new transactions to begin even before restart recovery is completed by exploiting the Comnlt-rs~V concept. It supports finegranularity (e.g., record) locking with semanticallyrich lock modes and operation logging, partial rollbacks, write-ahead logging, and the steal and no-force buffer management policies. The overhead imposed by this method during normal transaction processing is insignificant. We require very few changes to an existing DBMS in order to support our method. Our method can be implemented with different degrees of sophistication depending on the existing features of a DBMS.
