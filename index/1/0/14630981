The Relational On-Line Analytical Processing (ROLAP) is emerging as the dominant approach in data warehousing. In order to enhance query performance, the ROLAP approach relies on selecting and materializing in summary tables appropriate subsets of aggregate views which are then engaged in speeding up OLAP queries. However, a straight forward relational storage implementation of materialized ROLAP views is immensely wasteful on storage and incredibly inadequate on query performance and incremental update speed.
