We take the alternative approach of tackling users' high-level missions directly by introducing a human computation system that generates simple plans, by decomposing a mission into goals and retrieving search results tailored to each goal. Results show that our system is able to provide users with diverse, actionable search results and useful roadmaps for accomplishing their missions.
