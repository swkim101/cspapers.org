This paper presents a multi-layered Question Answering (Q.A.) architecture suitable for enhancing current Q.A. capabilities with the possibility of processing complex questions. That is, questions whose answer needs to be gathered from pieces of factual information scattered in different documents. Specifically, we have designed a layer oriented to process the different types of temporal questions. Complex temporal questions are first decomposed into simpler ones, according to the temporal relationships expressed in the original question.In the same way, the answers of each simple question are re-composed, fulfilling the temporal restrictions of the original complex question.Using this architecture, a Temporal Q.A. system has been developed.In this paper, we focus on explaining the first part of the process: the decomposition of the complex questions. Furthermore, it has been evaluated with the TERQAS question corpus of 112 temporal questions. For the task of question splitting our system has performed, in terms of precision and recall, 85% and 71%, respectively.
