Humor is an integral aspect of the human experience. Motivated by the prospect of creating computational models of humor, we study the influence of the language of cartoon captions on the perceived humorousness of the cartoons. Our studies are based on a large corpus of crowdsourced cartoon captions that were submitted to a contest hosted by the New Yorker. Having access to thousands of captions submitted for the same image allows us to analyze the breadth of responses of people to the same visual stimulus. We first describe how we acquire judgments about the humorousness of different captions. Then, we detail the construction of a corpus where captions deemed funnier are paired with less-funny captions for the same cartoon. We analyze the caption pairs and find significant differences between the funnier and less-funny captions. Next, we build a classifier to identify funnier captions automatically. Given two captions and a cartoon, our classifier picks the funnier one 69% of the time for captions hinging on the same joke, and 64% of the time for any pair of captions. Finally, we use the classifier to find the best captions and study how its predictions could be used to significantly reduce the load on the cartoon contest's judges.
