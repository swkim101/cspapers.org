A deterministic method for sequential estimation of 3-D rotations is presented. The Bingham distribution is used to represent uncertainty directly on the unit quaternion hypersphere. Quaternions avoid the degeneracies of other 3-D orientation representations, while the Bingham distribution allows tracking of large-error (high-entropy) rotational distributions. Experimental comparison to a leading EKF-based filtering approach on both synthetic signals and a ball-tracking dataset shows that the Quaternion Bingham Filter (QBF) has lower tracking error than the EKF, particularly when the state is highly dynamic. We present two versions of the QBF- suitable for tracking the state of first- and second-order rotating dynamical systems.
