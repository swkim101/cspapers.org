This paper discusses the extension of a system developed for automatic discovery of treebank annotation inconsistencies over an entire corpus to the particular case of evaluation of inter-annotator agreement. This system makes for a more informative IAA evaluation than other systems because it pinpoints the inconsistencies and groups them by their structural types. We evaluate the system on two corpora - (1) a corpus of English web text, and (2) a corpus of Modern British English.
