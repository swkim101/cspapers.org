Each year Computer Science Departments generally find that enrollment, at least in Associate and Bachelor's level programs, is increasing. At the same time, most Computer Science Departments find it difficult to recruit faculty with Ph.D. 's in Computer Science. In fact, Computerworld (6) recently reported on an NSF study which identified approximately 600 vacant faculty positions in Computer Science in this country.
 Primarily, the purpose of this article is to report the results of the study without attempting extensive analysis or interpretation. Certain inconsistencies in the data have been noted by the authors—primarily due to inaccurate or incomplete answers to various questions. It was not feasible to disregard incomplete or inconsistent questionnaires since the number of complete, consistent responses was small. In a few cases, the authors have attempted to correct obvious inconsistencies—for example, if an institution reported that it recruited to fill 3 vacancies on the faculty, that no one was hired, and that 4 of those hired had a Ph.D. in Computer Science, we assumed that the 4 should be a 0. In most other cases, the data is reported as given in the responses and the authors believe that it is reasonably accurate and representative.
