One of the most important challenges in heterogeneous wireless sensor network (WSN) is to design a routing protocol that use energy efficiently to prolong the lifetime of the entire network due to the limited battery power of sensor nodes. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose Sector-Chain Based Clustering (SCBC) Routing Protocol, in which, entire network area is divided into sectors (clusters), which balance to the number of nodes. SCBC further reduces energy dissipation of communication in network by constructing chain for each cluster with the chain leader as the cluster head (CH) or secondary cluster head (SCH) that has high residual energy and the shortest distance between candidate nodes and base station (BS) in network. In addition, SCBC improves energy efficiency by calculating the time length of each round in the steady data transmission phase for CHs or SCHs but still guarantee that it is alive in next round. Our simulation results show that the network lifetime of our proposed protocol can be improved about 70% and 20% in comparison with PEGASIS (Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information System) and IEEPB (An Improved Energy-Efficient PEGASIS-Based) protocols, respectively.
