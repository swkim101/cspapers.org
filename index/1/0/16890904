In this paper we introduce a new model for the design of performance analysis and visualization tools. The system integrates static code analysis, relational database designs and a spreadsheet model of interactive programming. This system provides a general methodology for visualizing parallel program executions by providing correlation to the source program, a convenient method for rapidly developing new visualizations of the program and a framework for performance studies.
The basic semantics of this model are described and example applications of visualizing the execution of two different parallel programs are considered.
