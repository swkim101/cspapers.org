Ambiguous queries, which are typical on search engines and recommendation systems, often return a large number of results from multiple interpretations. Given that many users often perform their searches on limited size screens (e.g. mobile phones), an important problem is which results to display first. Recent work has suggested displaying a set of results (Top-k) based on their relevance score with respect to the query and their diversity with respect to each other. However, previous works balance relevance and diversity mostly by a predefined fixed way. In this paper, we show that for different search tasks there is a different ideal balance of relevance and diversity. We propose a principled method for adaptive diversification of query results that minimizes the user effort to find the desired results, by dynamically balancing the relevance and diversity at each query step (e.g. when refining the query or viewing the next page of results). We introduce a navigation cost model as a means to estimate the effort required to navigate the query-results, and show that the problem of estimating the ideal amount of diversification at each step is NP-Hard. We propose an efficient approximate algorithm to select a near-optimal subset of the query results that minimizes the expected user effort. Finally we demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our solution in minimizing user effort, compared to state-of-the-art ranking methods, by means of an extensive experimental evaluation and a comprehensive user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
