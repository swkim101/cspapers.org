Cascades are ubiquitous in various network environments such as epidemic networks, traffic networks, water distribution networks and social networks. The outbreaks of cascades will often bring bad or even devastating effects. How to accurately predict the cascading outbreaks in early stage is of paramount importance for people to avoid these bad effects. Although there have been some pioneering works on cascading outbreaks detection, how to predict, rather than detect, the cascading outbreaks is still an open problem. In this paper, we attempt harnessing historical cascade data, propose a novel data driven approach to select important nodes as sensors, and predict the outbreaks based on the cascading behaviors of these sensors. In particular, we propose Orthogonal Sparse LOgistic Regression (OSLOR) method to jointly optimize node selection and outbreak prediction, where the prediction loss are combined with an orthogonal regularizer and L1 regularizer to guarantee good prediction accuracy, as well as the sparsity and low-redundancy of selected sensors. We evaluate the proposed method on a real online social network dataset including 182.7 million information cascades. The experimental results show that the proposed OSLOR significantly and consistently outperform topological measure based method and other data driven methods in prediction performances.
