The Query Network [12] is a model for query-based social networks automation features, motivated by the rise of social networks as a central internet application. This work generalizes the model to consist of a proposal query and an acceptance query for each participant. As a result, addition of edges is done by coordination between participants, simulating interactions between participants. We designed, implemented and experimented with evaluation algorithms for this new model. Experiments with both synthetic and real datasets show the high effectiveness of our methods.
