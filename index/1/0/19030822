This paper summarizes a study which was made by the authors on the various roles of personal computing in early education, college education and continued education of the individual. The role of personal computing in continued education is decomposed into its specific roles in the re-education of business persons (especially small businesses), of computer professionals, and of educators and other users of personal computing. It is pointed out that among many professional societies today, as well as within the total education of the individual, personal computing is an essential topic of national and international concern.
