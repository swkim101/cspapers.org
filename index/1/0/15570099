It is known that k tapes are no better than two tapes for nondeterministic machines. We show here that two tapes are better than one. In fact, we show that two pushdown stores are better than one tape. Also, k tapes are no better than two for nondeterministic reversal-bounded machines. We show here that two tapes are better than one for such machines. In fact, we show that two reversal-bounded pushdown stores are better than one reversal-bounded tape. We also show that for one-tape nondeterministic machines, unrestricted machines are better than reversal-bounded machines.
