This paper is directed towards providing an answer to the question, ”Can you control the trajectory of a Lagrangian float?” Being a float that has minimal actuation (only buoyancy control), their horizontal trajectory is dictated through drifting with ocean currents. However, with the appropriate vertical actuation and utilising spatio-temporal variations in water speed and direction, we show here that broad controllabilty results can be met such as waypoint following to keep a float inside of a bay or out of a designated region. This paper extends theory experimen- tally evaluted on horizontally actuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for trajectory control utilising ocean forecast models and presents an initial investi- gation into the controllability of these minimally actuated drifting AUVs. Simulated results for offshore coastal and within highly dynamic tidal bays illustrate two tech- niques with the promise for an affirmative answer to the posed question above.
