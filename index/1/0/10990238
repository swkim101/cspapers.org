In this paper, we present a framework for dynamic consistent estimation of dense motion fields over a sequence of images. The originality of the approach is to exploit recipes related to optimal control theory. This setup allows performing the estimation of an unknown state function according to a given dynamical model and to noisy and incomplete measurements. The overall process is formalized through the minimization of a global spatio-temporal cost functional w.r.t the complete sequence of motion fields. The minimization is handled considering an adjoint formulation. The resulting scheme consists in iterating a forward integration of the evolution model and a backward integration of the adjoint evolution model guided by a discrepancy measurement between the state variable and the available noisy observations. Such an approach allows us to cope with several delicate situations (such as the absence of data) which are not well managed with usual estimators.
