Support vector machines (SVM) decomposition methods were proposed to solve high dimensional and/or large data classification problems. Two major decomposition algorithms: Karush-kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition based algorithm, and 'Joachims' decomposition algorithm are popularly adopted. In this paper, both these two decomposition methods are analyzed and applied into face recognition with three basic mapping kernels. Numerical results showed that: a) face recognition with SVM performs better accuracy than other existed methods; b) the decomposition methods can perform face recognition efficiently; c) Joachims' decomposition method has better accuracy than that of decomposition algorithm based on KKT condition; d) linear kernel can provide much higher recognition accuracy than polynomial and slightly better accuracy than Gaussian radial based function (RBF) kernel; Also due to the fact that the linear kernel method is much simpler than others, it is most suitable for face recognition.
