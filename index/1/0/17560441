We devise effective randomized parallel algorithms for the solution (over any field and some integers rings of constants) of several fundamental problems of computations with polynomials and structured matrices, well known for their resistance to effective parallel solution. This includes computing the gcd of two polynomials, as well as any selected entry of the extended Euclidean scheme for these polynomials and of Pad6 approximation table, the solution of the Berlekamp-Massey problem of recovering the coefficients of a linear recurrence from its terms, the solutjon of a nonsingular Toeplitz linear system of equations, computing the ranks of ToeDlitz matrices. and other related comoutations with Toepkz, Hankel, kandermonde, Cauchy igeneralized Hilbert) matrices and with matrices having similar structures. Our algorithms enable us to reach new record estimates for randomized parallel arithmetic complexity of these computations, that is, O((10gn)~) time and b((n~loglogn)/(log-n)2) arithmetic &o&s&s,â€™ n being the input size. The results have further applications to nurnerous related computations over abstract fields.
