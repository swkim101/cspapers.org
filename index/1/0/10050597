We introduce a framework for the symbolic verification 
of epistemic properties of programs expressed 
in a class of general-purpose programming 
languages. To this end, we reduce the verification 
problem to that of satisfiability of first-order formulae 
in appropriate theories. We prove the correctness 
of our reduction and we validate our proposal 
by applying it to two examples: the dining 
cryptographers problem and the ThreeBallot voting 
protocol. We put forward an implementation 
using existing solvers, and report experimental results 
showing that the approach can perform better 
than state-of-the-art symbolic model checkers for 
temporal-epistemic logic.
