Traffic prediction systems are currently the most important techniques, as they can be wildly applied in different aspects. Given a set of past traffic data, a traffic prediction system is able to predict the future traffic conditions. However, the existing traffic prediction systems are hard to implement and are quite expensive. Hence, this work proposed a Matlab-based traffic prediction system, which can be easily implemented by Matlab and operated on the internet. That is, the problem of the existing traffic prediction systems can be solved.
