Based on our experience in the development of an interactive system for the control of subway lines, we set forward some notions about various forms of context and about context sharing. In effect, context plays a crucial role especially for incident solving on a subway line. The analysis of operators' behavior doing incident solving proved that context takes three different forms, namely external and contextual knowledge and proceduralized context. Moreover, the paper discusses the dynamics between these three kinds of context.
