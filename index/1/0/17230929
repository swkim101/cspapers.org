Single port surgery is an innovative approach in the field of minimally invasive surgery. Although several telemanipulators exist to perform operations through only a single incision they all suffer from the lack of haptic feedback. To generate kinesthetic feedback the intracorporeal forces need to be measured, which is a challenging task. To overcome these limitations we investigate in this paper the force sensing capability of a new single port robot that has two parallelkinematic manipulators. Because of the rigidity and excellent controllability the tip force is measured using proximally arranged force sensors. To minimize friction effects a longitudinal vibration of 6 Hz with an amplitude of 20 Î¼m is applied to the manipulator while the tip force is varied in the three main coordinate axes. Within the analysis 32320 values are investigated showing that a vibration has a significant impact and dramatically improves the signal quality by minimizing the crosstalk by a factor of up to 12.7 enabling to measure the tip force exactly.
