In medium-big enterprise it is quite typical that the database architecture is defined through a sequence of projects and realizations that result a number of different and sometime overlapping data sources. This trend is worsened by merger and acquisition activities that add in existing data architecture new data sources from external organizations. Data fragmentation reduces significantly the possibility to exploit organizational information assets and it needs the building of a data integration architecture. This architecture allows the organization to access to data stored by heterogeneous data sources and to manage updates through a unified view of this data. In this paper we present an original framework able to support the evolution of data architecture by identifying the optimal solution that maximize the quality of the overall architecture within a given cost threshold. In particular, we focus on Publish and Subscribe as solution for data architecture.
