Cellular operators want to be able to deploy small cells with the same ease as WiFi access points, to quickly address traffic hotspots in dense urban areas. However, deploying small cells has not been easy. The reason is that due to scarcity of licensed spectrum, small cells need to use the same spectrum as the existing macro cells, and they need to explicitly coordinate their spectrum usage with each other to manage interference. The challenge is that this coordination needs to happen with latencies less than a millisecond, otherwise adding small cells does not help scale the overall network capacity. Implementing such tight coordination in dense urban deployments has not been easy in practice. We present QuickC, a wireless transport technology that can simplify small cell deployment. QuickC enables small cells to coordinate with their neighboring macro and small cells with sub-1ms latencies over the operator's licensed spectrum but in a way that the users of this spectrum are negligibly affected. QuickC is designed to be an "add on" to existing cellular networks and does not require any invasive changes to the existing infrastructure or standards. We implement QuickC on a commodity system on chip from Texas Instruments used for building commercial cellular baseband and show that it can consistently deliver latencies less than 0.6 ms between neighboring cells. We also use system-level simulations to evaluate the wide-area impact of deploying QuickC in current networks, and show that it can deliver 5--10 Mbps of bandwidth between neighboring cells while causing less than 1--4% throughput degradation to the existing users of the spectrum.
