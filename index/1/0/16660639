This paper introduces a conceptual framework for modeling and simulation of variable structure hybrid systems. The framework proposed is based on and further extends the DEVS-formalism, providing a novel definition for modularhierarchical systems with discrete structural changes. An interactive, graphical model development approach and Object Oriented implementation are also presented. Finally, an application of the framework to variable structure systems is demonstrated.
