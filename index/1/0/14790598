We adapt a method proposed by Nesterov [16] to design an algorithm that computes ε-optimal solutions to fractional packing problems by solving <i>O</i><sup>*</sup>(ε<sup>-1</sup> √<i>Kn</i>) separable convex quadratic programs, where <i>K</i> is the maximum number of non-zeros per row and <i>n</i> is the number of variables. We also show that the quadratic program can be approximated to any degree of accuracy by an appropriately defined piecewise-linear program. For the special case of the maximum concurrent flow problem on a graph <i>G</i> =(<i>V,E</i>) with rational capacities and demands we obtain an algorithm that computes an Ε-optimal flow by solving <i>O</i>*(ε<sup>-1</sup> <i>K</i><sup>3/2</sup>|<i>E</i>| √|<i>V</i>| (log 1/ε+ <i>L<inf>U</inf></i> + <i>L<inf>D</inf></i>)) shortest path problems, where <i>K</i> is the number of commodities, and <i>L<inf>U</inf>, L<inf>D</inf></i> are, respectively, the number of bits needed to store the capacities and demands. We also show that the complexity of computing a maximum multicommodity flow is <i>O</i><sup>*</sup>(1/εlog2(1/ε)). In contrast, previous algorithms required Ω(ε<sup>-2</sup>) iterations.
