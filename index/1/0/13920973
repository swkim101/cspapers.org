Unlock gestures are performed by billions of users across the world multiple times a day. Beyond preventing accidental input on mobile devices, they currently serve little to no other purpose. In this paper, we explore how replacing the regular unlock screen with one that asks the user to perform a simple, optional task, can benefit a wealth of application domains, including data collection, personal-health metrics collection, and human intelligence tasks. We evaluate this concept, which we refer to as Slide to X. Further, we show that people are willing to perform microtasks presented through this interface and continue to do so throughout the day while they visit different locations as part of their daily routines. We then discuss how to implement this concept and demonstrate three applications.
