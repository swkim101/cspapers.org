The algorithm of trajectory planning and four leg coordination for quasi-static stair climbing in a quadruped robot is reported. The development is based on the geometrical interactions between the robot legs and the stair, starting from single-leg analysis, followed by two-leg collaboration, and then four-leg coordination. A brief study on stability of the robot is included. In addition, the first-step and last-step algorithm which deals with the transient between the flat ground and the stair is reported as well. Finally, simulation and experimental validation are performed to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.
