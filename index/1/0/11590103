In many real-world applications, the domain of model learning (referred as source domain) is usually inconsistent with or even different from the domain of testing (referred as target domain), which makes the learnt model degenerate in target domain, i.e., the test domain. To alleviate the discrepancy between source and target domains, we propose a domain adaptation method, named as Bi-shifting Auto-Encoder network (BAE). The proposed BAE attempts to shift source domain samples to target domain, and also shift the target domain samples to source domain. The non-linear transformation of BAE ensures the feasibility of shifting between domains, and the distribution consistency between the shifted domain and the desirable domain is constrained by sparse reconstruction between them. As a result, the shifted source domain is supervised and follows similar distribution as target domain. Therefore, any supervised method can be applied on the shifted source domain to train a classifier for classification in target domain. The proposed method is evaluated on three domain adaptation scenarios of face recognition, i.e., domain adaptation across view angle, ethnicity, and imaging sensor, and the promising results demonstrate that our proposed BAE can shift samples between domains and thus effectively deal with the domain discrepancy.
