Rather than iormaliaing general properties or database systems and derining abstract languages ror databases, in this paper we provide a formal system for reasoning about spdric properties of eaoh application and the speeiiioation or query/update functions whioh are particular to that application. We regard a database as a dynamic! object and use a system of modal logia similar to Hoare-style program logic ror its specification. The possible worlds in our modal system are the (correct) database instanoes. Each database instanoe is defined as a manysorted algebra where the signature of the algebra oonstitutes the basis for the database schema. Concepts related to database instances such aa queries and (static) integrity constraints are simply well-formed expressions on the signature. Similarly , at the dynamic level, we define notions suah as transition constraints and update operations as expressions or the modal system.
