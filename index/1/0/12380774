We are trying to induce a quadruped robot to walk dynamically on irregular terrain by using a neural system model. We integrate several reflexes, such as a stretch reflex, a vestibulospinal reflex, and extensor/flexor reflexes, into a CPG (central pattern generator). The success in walking on terrain of medium degree of irregularity with fixed parameters of CPGs and reflexes shows that the biologically inspired control proposed in this study has an ability for autonomous adaptation to unknown irregular terrain.
