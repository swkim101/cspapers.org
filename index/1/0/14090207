Software architecture is considered as a set of architectural design decisions. Managing the evolution of architectural design decisions helps to maintain consistency between requirements and the deployed system, and is also necessary for reducing architectural knowledge evaporation. In this paper, we propose a UML metamodel based on the Triple View Model from our previous research work. The UML metamodel incorporates evolution-centered characteristics to manage architectural design decision evolution. It helps to capture and trace the evolution of architectural design decisions explicitly, and reduces the evaporation of architectural knowledge that results from decisions evolution. We conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of the metamodel.
