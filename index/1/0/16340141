The Slam toolkit demonstrates that predicate abstraction enables automated verification of real world Windows device drivers. Our predicate abstraction-based tool DDVerifyenables the automated verification of Linux device drivers and provides an accurate model of the relevant parts of the kernel. We report on benchmarks based on Linux device drivers, confirming the results that Slam established for the Windows world. Furthermore, we take predicate abstraction one step further and introduce a technique to verify concurrent software with shared memory
