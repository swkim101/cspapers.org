In this paper, we present how moment invariants can be used to design a decoupled 2D visual servoing scheme and to minimise the nonlinearity of the interaction matrix related to the selected visual features. Experimental results using a 6 DOF eye-in-hand system to position a camera parallel to planar objects of complex shape are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.
