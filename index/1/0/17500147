Most software systems use simple text files to represent the current state of an evolving design. We propose that layered networks provide a much better medium to represent the design of a software system and its documentation. PIE is an experimental personal information environment which provides users with descriptive structures for documents and programs. In PIE, alternative designs for programs and documents can be examined and manipulated within the systems context structured database. This data base also facilitates cooperative design among several people.
