In this paper, we study the problem of timely finding and crawling of \textit{ephemeral} new pages, i.e., for which user traffic grows really quickly right after they appear, but lasts only for several days (e.g., news, blog and forum posts). Traditional crawling policies do not give any particular priority to such pages and may thus crawl them not quickly enough, and even crawl already obsolete content. We thus propose a new metric, well thought out for this task, which takes into account the decrease of user interest for ephemeral pages over time. We show that most ephemeral new pages can be found at a relatively small set of content sources and suggest a method for finding such a set. Our idea is to periodically recrawl content sources and crawl newly created pages linked from them, focusing on high-quality (in terms of user interest) content. One of the main difficulties here is to divide resources between these two activities in an efficient way. We find the adaptive balance between crawls and recrawls by maximizing the proposed metric. Further, we incorporate search engine click logs to give our crawler an insight about the current user demands. The effectiveness of our approach is finally demonstrated experimentally on real-world data.
