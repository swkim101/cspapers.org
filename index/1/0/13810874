It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the WWW 2018 PhD Symposium. The goal of the PhD Symposium is to provide a supportive atmosphere for PhD students to present and receive feedback on their ongoing work. Students at different stages in their research get an opportunity to present and discuss their problem statements, goals, methods and results. The symposium aims to provide students with useful guidance on various aspects of their research from established researchers and other PhD students, working in areas related to the World Wide Web. Finally, the symposium also aims to enable PhD students to interact with other participants and potential collaborators in order to stimulate an exchange of ideas, suggestions and experiences. We received 25 PhD proposal submissions from all around the world covering a broad range of topics. We evaluated them with respect to methodology, approach, relevance and novelty, selecting 8 papers for long presentation and 4 papers for short presentation. We also took in account the coverage of the different areas related to WWW as well as the potential audience and the possibility to receive feedback from seniors and peers.
