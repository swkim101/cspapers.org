We revisit the well-known problem of gaze correction and present a solution based on supervised machine learning. At training time, our system observes pairs of images, where each pair contains the face of the same person with a fixed angular difference in gaze direction. It then learns to synthesize the second image of a pair from the first one. After learning, the system gets the ability to redirect the gaze of a previously unseen person by the same angular difference as in the training set. Unlike many previous solutions to gaze problem in videoconferencing, ours is purely monocular, i.e. it does not require any hardware apart from an in-built web-camera of a laptop. Being based on efficient machine learning predictors such as decision forests, the system is fast (runs in real-time on a single core of a modern laptop). In the paper, we demonstrate results on a variety of videoconferencing frames and evaluate the method quantitatively on the hold-out set of registered images. The supplementary video shows example sessions of our system at work.
