One of the most demanding tasks for a robotic servicer is capturing a target. During this task, the mechanical systems can be subject to large forces for short duration (impacts). In space servicers, these impacts may render the capturing of a target impossible without the use of undesirable fuel-consuming maneuvers. This paper presents an approach for minimizing impact reactions, using the Center of Percussion (CoP), a characteristic of rigid bodies rotating around an axis. This work generalizes and delineates the exact requirements for its use. Application of CoP in multibody systems is demonstrated using the Newton-Euler Algorithm. Implementation guidelines are discussed. Simulations of a planar space robot system, and a three-dimensional PUMA-like manipulator on a satellite base confirm the benefit of using the CoP during tasks that include impacts.
