Languages using Chinese characters are mostly processed at word level. Inspired by recent success of deep learning, we delve deeper to character and radical levels for Chinese language processing. We propose a new deep learning technique, called “radical embedding”, with justifications based on Chinese linguistics, and validate its feasibility and utility through a set of three experiments: two in-house standard experiments on short-text categorization (STC) and Chinese word segmentation (CWS), and one in-field experiment on search ranking. We show that radical embedding achieves comparable, and sometimes even better, results than competing methods.
