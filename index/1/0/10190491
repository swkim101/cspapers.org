This paper focusses on the main issues related to the development of a corpus for opinion and sentiment analysis, with a special attention to irony, and presents as a case study Senti‐TUT, a project for Italian aimed at investigating sentiment and irony in social media. We present the Senti‐TUT corpus, a collection of texts from Twitter annotated with sentiment polarity. We describe the dataset, the annotation, the methodologies applied and our investigations on two important features of irony: polarity reversing and emotion expressions.
