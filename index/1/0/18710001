This paper describes some experiences in building a software factory by defining multiple small domain specific languages (DSLs) and having multiple small models per DSL. This is in high contrast with traditional approaches using
monolithic models, e.g. written in UML. In our approach, models behave like source code to a large extend, leading to an easy way to manage the model(s) of large systems.
