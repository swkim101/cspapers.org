Since multimedia retrieval is based on similarity calculations of semantics and media-based search, exact matches are not expected. We view querying multimedia database as a combination of IR, image matching, and traditional database query processing and it should be conducted in a way of perpetual query reformulation for honing target results. In this paper we present a hybrid multimedia database system, which employs a hierarchical database statistics structure for both query optimization and reformulation analysis without adding additional query processing cost. The contribution of this work is the integration of database methodology, user interface design, IR concepts, and image matching techniques for facilitating multimedia database ex-
