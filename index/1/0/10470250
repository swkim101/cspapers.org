This paper investigates the applicability to a shape-recognition problem of a concept learning algorithm which generates decision rules from examples. A comprehensive analysis of this algorithm applied to an industrial vision problem is described. This problem has no obvious 'best' solution and much effort has been devoted to performing a realistic appraisal of the algorithm by making a detailed set of comparisons with the performances of appropriate alternative classifiers. Results presented show the algorithm to be comparable in performance with the alternative classifiers but superior in terms of both the cost of making a classification and also the intelligibility of the solution.
