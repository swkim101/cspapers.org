Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the standard language for styling web documents and is extensively used in the industry. However, CSS lacks constructs that would allow code reuse (e.g., functions). Consequently, maintaining CSS code is often a cumbersome and error-prone task. Preprocessors (e.g., Less and Sass) have been introduced to fill this gap, by extending CSS with the missing constructs. Despite the clear maintainability benefits coming from the use of preprocessors, there is currently no support for migrating legacy CSS code to preprocessors. In this paper, we propose a technique for automatically detecting duplicated style declarations in CSS code that can be migrated to preprocessor functions (i.e., mixins). Our technique can parameterize differences in the style values of duplicated declarations, and ensure that the migration will not change the presentation semantics of the web documents. The evaluation has shown that our technique is able to detect 98% of the mix-ins that professional developers introduced in websites and Style Sheet libraries, and can safely migrate real CSS code.
