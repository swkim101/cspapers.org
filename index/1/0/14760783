As an experimental platform for modular legged robots, generic limb modules are developed which are used to implement 3-limb robot units. Benefits of 3-limb modularity are discussed in the context of multi-legged robot assembly. A CPG network based locomotion gait generation approach for generic multi-leg formations is considered.
