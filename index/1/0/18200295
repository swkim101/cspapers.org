In this paper, we present a supervised classification approach for disambiguation of preposition senses. We use the SemEval 2007 Preposition Sense Disambiguation datasets to evaluate our system and compare its results to those of the systems participating in the workshop. We derived linguistically motivated features from both sides of the preposition. Instead of restricting these to a fixed window size, we utilized the phrase structure. Testing with five different classifiers, we can report an increased accuracy that outperforms the best system in the SemEval task.
