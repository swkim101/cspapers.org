which are substantially larger than those reached by traditional computers. Communicators are small handheld devices that combine the features of PDAs and palmtop computers with those of telephones. Communicators are widely believed to be the next big wave of devices with projected worldwide market penetration exceeding that of conventional desktop computers. Because of their being ready at hand as people go about their daily business, Communicators provide a natural platform on which to conduct e-commerce. However, Communicators pose major technical challenges because of their physical limitations and likely modes of usage. They offer small screens for presentation, difficult input, low bandwidth, and intermittent and unreliable connectivity. Further, people use their Communicators while on the run, in awkward settings, and may break, lose, or have their Communicators stolen. We describe an approach that addresses the above challenges while retaining the convenience of using Communicators. This approach integrates innovations in user interfaces and backend systems for information access and transactions. Norman argues forcefully that information appliances (or “invisible computers”) of the sort of communicators can fundamentally be more usable and thus more popular than traditional computers [5]. We agree with this assessment and think of communicators and their relatives as becoming ever more popular. (We revisit other aspects of Norman’s position in section 4.4.) As communicators (and related devices such as palmtops and PDAs) become more prevalent, it is natural that they will be used to conduct electronic commerce. Indeed, because communicators are carried by people all the time, in many cases, communicators are likelier to be used for e-commerce than traditional desktop computers. E-Commerce involves a number of activities. Of these, the following are especially relevant from the perspective of the consumer:
