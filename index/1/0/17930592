A key issue in biological data integration is how to detect changes to the underlying biological data sources. In this poster, we present an algorithm called BioDiff for detecting exact changes to genomic and proteomic data. In our approach we transform heterogeneous genomic and proteomic data to XML format and then detect changes between two versions of XML representation of biological data. Our algorithm extends X-Diff [2], a published XML change detection algorithm. X-Diff algorithm can detect the optimum differences between two unordered XML documents in a polynomial time. It works for any type of XML data. However, we believe that it is not efficient to apply X-Diff directly to detect changes to XML representation of biological data. Since the min-cost max-flow algorithm for computing the bipartite mapping between two XML trees is the most time consuming part, it is desirable to reduce the size of data set during mapping. However, X-Diff fails to do so for biological data as it ignores the semantics of the XML elements. 2. ALGORITHM BIODIFF
