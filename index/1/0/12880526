This paper introduces ILOG( a declarative language in the style of (stratified) datalog( which can be used for querying, schema translation, and schema augmentation in the context of object-based data models. The semantics of ILOG is based on the use of Skolem functors, and is closely related to semantics for object-based data manipulation languages which provide mechanisms for explicit creation of object identifiers (OIDs). A normal form is presented for ILOG’ programs not involving recursion through OID creation, which identifies a precise correspondence between OIDs created in the target, and values and OIDs in the source. The expressive power of various sublanguages of ILOG’ is shown to range from a natural generalization of the conjunctive queries to the object-based context, to a language which can specify all computable database translat.ions (up to duplicate copies). The issue of testing vuliilityof ILOG programs translat.ing one semantic schema to another is studied: cases are presented for which several -validity issues (e.g., functional and/or subset relationships in the *This research supported in part by NSF grant IRI-8719875. ‘Research by this author also supported in part by NSF grant INT-8817874 and a grant from ATTI [cc and/or special permission from the EnJo%mcnt.

Non-recursive ILOG is rich enough to simulate some schema translation languages based on local structural manipulation, and non-recursive ILOG’ can simulate the core of the OOAlgebra of [Day89], and of several other translation languages of the systems literature.
