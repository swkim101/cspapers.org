Packet generation is crucial to network measurements. Despite its importance, software packet generators lack the accuracy and precision to model realistic test scenarios [1]. Hardware traffic generators provide the necessary precision and accuracy but tend to be inflexible and expensive. MoonGen presents a novel approach to provide flexible, accurate, and precise traffic generation in software on inexpensive commodity hardware. Moreover, it features latency measurements in the sub-microsecond range. We offer MoonGen1 as free software under MIT licence. For more information, we refer the interested reader to the draft of our full paper [2].
