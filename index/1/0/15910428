In this paper, we present Stepping Stones and Pathways (SSP), an alternative model of building and presenting answers for the cases when queries on document collections cannot be answered just by a ranked list. Stepping Stones can handle questions like: "What is the relation of topics X and Y?" SSP addresses when the contents of a small set of related documents is needed as an answer rather than a single document, or when "query splitting" is required to satisfactorily explore a document space. Query results are networks of document groups representing topics, each group relating to and connecting (by documents) to other groups in the network. Thus, a network answers the user's information need. We devise new and more effective representations and techniques to visualize such answers, and to involve users as part of the answer-finding process. In order to verify the validity of our approach, and since the questions we aim to answer involve multiple topics, we performed a study involving a custom built broad collection of operating systems research papers, and evaluated the results with interested computer science students, using multiple measures.
