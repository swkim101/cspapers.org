We consider several empirical estimators for probabilistic context-free grammars, and show that the estimated grammars have the so-called consistency property, under the most general conditions. Our estimators include the widely applied expectation maximization method, used to estimate probabilistic context-free grammars on the basis of unannotated corpora. This solves a problem left open in the literature, since for this method the consistency property has been shown only under restrictive assumptions on the rules of the source grammar.
