This paper present a part-based approach for detecting objects with large variation of appearance. We extract local image patches as local features both from the object and from the background in training images to learn an object part model discriminatively. Our object part model discriminates the local features whether they are an object part or not. Based on the discrimination results, each local feature casts probabilistic votes for the object location and size which are learned from the training images. Our object part model also requires regression performance for predicting the object location and size through the voting procedure. We build such an object part model with an ensemble of randomized trees trained by splitting each tree node so as to reduce the entropy of class label distribution and the variance of object location and size. Experimental results on hand detection with large pose variation show that our approach outperforms conventional generalized Hough transform. We verified the performance on a public dataset of side-view cars.
