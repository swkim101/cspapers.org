Lexical disambiguation can be achieved using different sources of information. Aiming at high performance of automatic disambiguation it is important to know the relative importance and applicability of the various sources. In this paper we classify several sources of information and show how some of them can be achieved using statistical data. First evaluations indicate the extreme importance of local information, which mainly represents lexical associations and selectional restrictions for syntactically related words.
