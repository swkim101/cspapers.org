We propose and demonstrate Kinetic Tiles, modular con-struction units for Interactive Kinetic Surfaces (IKSs). We aimed to design Kinetic Tiles to be accessible and available so that users can construct IKSs easily and rapidly. The components of Kinetic Tiles are inexpensive and easily available. In addition, the use of magnetic force enables the separation of the surface material and actuators so that users only interact with the tile modules as if constructing a tile mosaic. Kinetic Tiles can be utilized as a new design and architectural material that allows the surfaces of everyday objects and spaces to convey ambient and pleasurable kinetic expressions.
