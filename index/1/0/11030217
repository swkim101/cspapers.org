The Open Network Laboratory (ONL) is a remotely accessible network testbed of high performance routers which has been designed with an eye towards ease of use for users from the na√Øve to the expert. The system is built around a set of high-performance routers that are extendible and easily configurable through the Remote Laboratory Interface (RLI), an intuitive graphical interface. The RLI also makes it easy to configure packet filters in the routers, assign flows or flow aggregates to separate queues with configurable QoS and attach hardware monitoring points to real-time charts. The RLI's real-time charts and user data facility make it easy to directly view the effects of traffic as it moves through a router, allowing the user to gain better insight into system behavior and create compelling demonstrations. Each port of the router is equipped with an embedded processor that supports software plugins which allow users to extend the system's functionality. This paper describes the ONL and how it can be used in networking education. Our web site onl.arl.wustl.edu includes a short video and a tutorial.
