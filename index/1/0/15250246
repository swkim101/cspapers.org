Today's multiprocessor system-on-a-chip (MPSoC) products typically have multiple execution modes, and for each mode, all the products utilize the same task allocation and schedule strategy determined at design stage. As these products experience different usages by customers, such unified solution can at best be optimized for a hypothetical common case. It is hence likely that the product is not reliable or energy-efficient from particular customers' point of view. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel customer-aware task allocation and scheduling technique, wherein we generate an initial task schedule for each execution mode at design stage and then perform online adjustment at regular intervals for lifetime reliability improvement and/or energy reduction according to the specific usage strategy of individual products. Experimental results on several hypothetical MPSoCs with various task graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed personalized solution.
