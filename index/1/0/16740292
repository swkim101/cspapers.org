We present a stemming algorithm for text retrieval. The algorithm uses the statistics collected on the basis of certain corpus analysis based on the co-occurrence between two word variants. We use a very simple co-occurrence measure that reflects how often a pair of word variants occurs in a document as well as in the whole corpus. A graph is formed where the word variants are the nodes and two word variants form an edge if they co-occur. On the basis of the co-occurrence measure, a certain edge strength is defined for each of the edges. Finally, on the basis of the edge strengths, we propose a partition algorithm that groups the word variants based on their strongest neighbors, that is, the neighbors with largest strengths. Our stemming algorithm has two static parameters and does not use any other information except the co-occurrence statistics from the corpus. The experiments on TREC, CLEF and FIRE data consisting of four European and two Asian languages show a significant improvement over no-stem strategy on all the languages. Also, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms a number of strong stemmers including the rule-based ones on a number of languages. For highly inflectional languages, a relative improvement of about 50% is obtained compared to un-normalized words and a relative improvement ranging from 5% to 16% is obtained compared to the rule based stemmer for the concerned language.
