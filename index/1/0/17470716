We introduce a simple technique to generate incremental query log samples that mimics well the original query distribution. In this way, editorial judgments for new queries can be consistently added to previous judgments. We also review the problem of how to choose the sample size depending on the types of queries that need to be detected as well as the conditions needed to get a good sample.
