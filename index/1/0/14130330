In view of the size and complexity of modern operating systems, this paper proposes their subdivision into a set of smaller functional modules and the implementation of a number of their functions on separate hardware processors. The information transfer requirements resulting from physically separated system components are examined and the adaptation of a standard end-to-end protocol is suggested for an efficient solution to the interprocess communication problems.
