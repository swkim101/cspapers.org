Solving cooperative path finding (CPF) by translating it to propositional satisfiability represents a viable option in highly constrained situations. The task in CPF is to relocate agents from their initial positions to given goals in a collision free manner. In this paper, we propose a reduced time expansion that is focused on makespan sub-optimal solving. The suggested reduced time expansion is especially beneficial in conjunction with a goal decomposition where agents are relocated one by one.
