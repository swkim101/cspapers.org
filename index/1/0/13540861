The participants will use a debate format with a provocative thesis to explore the pedagogical approach known as "objects early" or "objects first." By arguing in the affirmative, Elliot Koffman and Stuart Reges will point out concerns that have been raised about the approach. By arguing in the negative, Kim Bruce and Michael KÃ¶lling will describe schools that are succeeding with the approach and ways to address significant concerns. Owen Astrachan as moderator will ensure that the debate remains civil and will provide some humorous and possibly even insightful commentary on the evidence presented by both sides.
