Based on the differential genetic programming, a new design method is proposed for optimal and/or robust controllers of nonlinear systems. First we introduce a new type of the genetic programming (GP), so-called differential GP (DGP), combining GP with an automatic differentiation scheme, which could solve Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)/ Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs(HJI)/ Francis-Byrnes-Isidori (FBI) equations. Lastly, the effectiveness of a DGP based design method is demonstrated through some design examples of nonlinear systems
