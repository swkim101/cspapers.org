Web catalog integration is an interesting problem in current digital content management. Past studies have shown that using a flattened structure with auxiliary information extracted from the source catalog can improve the integration results. However, the nature of a flattened structure ignores the hierarchical relationships, and thus the performance improvement of catalog integration may be reduced. In this paper, we propose an enhanced hierarchical catalog integration (EHCI) approach with conceptual thesauri extracted from the source catalog. The results show that our enhanced hierarchical integration approach effectively boosts the accuracy of hierarchical catalog integration.
