A host interface 1 for an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network comprises a Segmenter 2 and Reassembler 3. The host interface 1 is connected to a Sunshine ATM switch 7 via an electrical to optical converter 6 and an IBM RS/6000 workstation 4 via a MicroChannel bus 5. The Reassembler 3 comprises three components, respectively referred to as the Linked List Manager, Dual Port Reassembly Buffer and SONET Interface and VCI Lookup Controller, that are capable of concurrent operation once they are initialized and configured. Those components are capable of reassembling an ATM cell in less than 2.7 microseconds.
