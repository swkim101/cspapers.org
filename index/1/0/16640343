We argue that A. I. should not lose sight of the need for general principles when working with problems in specific domains. We also argue the case for studying Artificial Learning. We present a computer program with a very limited sense modality that acquires some facility with the English language and learns some numerical concepts. The principles by which such learning takes place are expressed in terms of a concept of process and they prove to be applicable to learning the decimal numeral system and forming elementary utterances as well as learning to interpret English sentences.
