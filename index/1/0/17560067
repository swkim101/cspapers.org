We present ICARUS, a versatile graphical search tool to query dependency treebanks. Search results can be inspected both quantitatively and qualitatively bymeans of frequency lists, tables, or dependency graphs. ICARUS also ships with plugins that enable it to interface with tool chains running either locally or remotely.
