It suffers from the label noise in training data generated by distant supervision. Although recent studies use many features to prune wrong label ahead of training, they suffer from error propagation and bring much complexity. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end typing model, called the path-based attention neural model (PAN), to learn a noise-robust performance by leveraging the hierarchical structure of types. Experiments on two data sets demonstrate its effectiveness.
