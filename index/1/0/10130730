In this paper, the problem of controlling a motion by visual servoing around an unknown object is addressed. These works can be interpreted as an initial step towards a perception goal of an unmodeled object. The main purpose is to perform motion with regard to the object in order to discover several viewpoint of the object. The originality of our work is based on the choice and extraction of visual features in accordance with motions to be performed. The notion of invariant feature is introduced to control the navigational task around the unknown object. A real-time experimentation with a complex object is realized and shows the generality of the proposed ideas.
