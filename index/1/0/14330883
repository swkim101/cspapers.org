Reading congressional legislation, also known as bills, is often tedious because bills tend to be long and written in complex language. In IBM Many Bills, an interactive web-based visualization of legislation, users of different backgrounds can browse bills and quickly explore parts that are of interest to them. One task users have is to be able to locate sections that don't seem to fit with the overall topic of the bill. In this paper, we present novel techniques to determine which sections within a bill are likely to be outliers by employing approaches from information retrieval. The most promising techniques first detect the most topically relevant parts of a bill by ranking its sections, followed by a comparison between these topically relevant parts and the remaining sections in the bill. To compare sections we use various dissimilarity metrics based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence. The results indicate that these techniques are more successful than a classification based approach. Finally, we analyze how the dissimilarity metrics succeed in discriminating between sections that are strong outliers versus those that are 'milder' outliers.
