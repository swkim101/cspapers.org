Previous applications of the Markov random field model for information retrieval have used manually chosen features. However, it is often difficult or impossible to know, a priori, the best set of features to use for a given task or data set. Therefore, there is a need to develop automatic feature selection techniques. In this paper we describe a greedy procedure for automatically selecting features to use within the Markov random field model for information retrieval. We also propose a novel, robust method for describing classes of textual information retrieval features. Experimental results, evaluated on standard TREC test collections, show that our feature selection algorithm produces models that are either significantly more effective than, or equally effective as, models with manually selected features, such as those used in the past.
