We define a dynamic oracle for the Covington non-projective dependency parser. This is not only the first dynamic oracle that supports arbitrary non-projectivity, but also considerably more efficient (O(n)) than the only existing oracle with restricted non-projectivity support. Experiments show that training with the dynamic oracle significantly improves parsing accuracy over the static oracle baseline on a wide range of treebanks.
