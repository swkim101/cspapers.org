This paper describes a diagnosis technique for locating design errors in circuit implementations which do not match their functional specification. The method efficiently propagates mismatched patterns from erroneous outputs backward into the network and calculates circuit regions which most likely contain the error(s). In contrast to previous approaches, the described technique does not depend on a fixed set of error models. Therefore, it is more general and especially suitable for transistor-level circuits, which have a broader variety of possible design errors than gate-level implementations. Furthermore, the proposed method is also applicable for incomplete sets of mismatched patterns and hence can be used not only as a debugging aid for formal verification techniques but also for simulation based approaches. Experiments with industrial CMOS circuits show that for most design errors the identified problem region is less than 3% of the overall circuit.
