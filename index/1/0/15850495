Mobile devices provide convenience and portable access to the huge information space on the Internet. It is desire to access the most updated financial information through mobile devices in order to make critical and urgent decision for most of the investors. In this paper, we present a financial news delivery system on mobile devices based on the fractal summarization model. Fractal summarization is developed based on the fractal theory. It generates a brief skeleton of summary at the first stage, and the details of the summary on different levels of the document are generated on demands of users. Such interactive summarization reduces the computation load in comparing with the generation of the entire summary in one batch by the traditional summarization, which is ideal for wireless access.
