We demonstrate the use of a novel cross layer protocol for routing in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs). Our protocol, named CARP [1] for Channel-Aware Routing Protocol, is able to dynamically adapt to channel dynamics and to the changes occurring in the network topology and link quality over time. CARP is implemented and tested using the Sapienza University Networking framework for underwater Simulation Emulation and real-life Testing (SUNSET) [2] in different network scenarios. Our demonstration shows that CARP is able to find the suitable routes and to deliver data to the sink node independently of prevailing packet error rates and of nodes/links addition and removal.
