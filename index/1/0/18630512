Recently, automatic parking assist systems have become commercially available in some cars. In order to improve the reliability and accuracy of parking control, pose estimation problem needs to be solved. Odometry is widely used for pose estimation of a mobile robot. However, most previous odometry calibration methods have focused on two wheeled mobile robots. In this paper, we consider systematic error sources of the car-like mobile robot(CLMR), and we suggest a useful calibration method for systematic errors. Finally, our calibration method is verified by experiments using a miniature car.
