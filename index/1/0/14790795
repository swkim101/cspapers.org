The Hairlytop Interface is a high scalability interface composed of hair-like units called smart hairs. The original version of the smart hair comprised a shape-memory alloy, drive circuits, and a light sensor. Simply placing the smart hair above a light display device enabled each smart hair to be bent and controlled by modulating the intensity of light from the display. Various prototypes of the Hairlytop Interface have been created to show its high flexibility in configuration. This flexibility should help users to develop their own moving interfaces.
