In this paper, we wish to analyze the convergence behavior of a number of neuronal plasticity models. Recent neurophysiological research suggests that the neuronal behavior is adaptive. In particular, memory stored within a neuron is associated with the synaptic weights which are varied or adjusted to achieve learning. A number of adaptive neuronal models have been proposed in the literature. Three specific models will be analyzed in this paper, specifically the Hebb model, the Sutton-Barto model, and the most recent trace model. In this paper we will examine the conditions for convergence, the position of convergence and the rate at convergence, of these models as they applied to classical conditioning. Simulation results are also presented to verify the analysis.
