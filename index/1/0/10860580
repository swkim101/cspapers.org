Many web databases are hidden behind form-based interfaces which are not always easy-to-use on mobile devices because of limitations such as small screen sizes, trickier text entry, etc. In this demonstration, we have developed MOBIES, a third-party system that generates mobile-user-friendly interfaces by exploiting data analytics specific to the hidden web databases. Our user studies show the effectiveness of MOBIES on improving user experience over a hidden web database.
