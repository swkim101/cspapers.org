An introductory computer science course is frequently the most difficult course in the curriculum to teach. Computer science educators must stay abreast of rapidly changing trends, text books, technology and teaching techniques. This paper provides an overview and perspective of introductory computer science courses, surveys some trends, and presents new alternative approaches regarding organization, foundations and material. It is based on the premise that the introductory course should create strong foundations upon which students can build, and that the curriculum should teach students to build software systems which people use and maintain, not just toy computer programs. The paper presents personal views and insights, motivates underlying concepts, and provides many useful suggestions which have been successfully employed in such introductory courses.
