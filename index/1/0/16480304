In this paper we propose a model of a database that could become a kernel of cooperative database applications. First, we propose a new data model CDM (Collaborative Data Model) that is oriented for the specificity of multiuser environments, in particular: cooperation scenarios, cooperation techniques and cooperation management. Second, we propose to apply to databases supporting collaboration so called multiuser transactions. Multiuser transactions are flat transactions in which, in comparison to classical ACID transactions, the isolation property is relaxed.
