The mathematical framework for factorizing equivalence classes of multivariate functions is formulated in this paper. Independent component analysis is shown to be a special case of this decomposition. Using only the local geometric structure of a class representative, we derive an analytic solution for the factorization. We demonstrate the factorization solution with numerical experiments and present a preliminary tie to decorrelation.
