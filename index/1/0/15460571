Finding related articles from the PubMed (a large biomedical literature repository) is challenging because it is hard to express the user's specific relevance in the given query interface and a keyword query typically retrieves many results. Biomedical researchers spend a critical amount of time (e.g., often more than several days) in the literature search process. This paper proposes RefMed, a novel search system for PubMed, which supports relevance ranking by enabling relevance feedback on PubMed. RefMed first returns initial result documents for a user's keyword query as in PubMed. The user then makes relevance judgments on some of the resultant documents while browsing them. Once the user "pushes the feedback", the system induces a relevance function using RankSVM and ranks the results according to the function. To realize the ad-hoc relevance retrieval on PubMed, RefMed "tightly" integrates RankSVM within RDBMS and runs the rank learning and process on the fly with a response time of a few minutes.Our qualitative experiments with biomedical researchers show that RefMed substantially reduces the amount of effort required to search related PubMed articles.
