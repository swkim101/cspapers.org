This paper describes a query segmentation method for search engines supporting inverse lookup of words and phrases. Data mining in query logs and document corpora is used to produce segment candidates and compute connexity measures. Candidates are considered in context of the whole query, and a list of the most likely segmentations is generated, with each segment attributed with a connexity value. For each segmentation a segmentation score is computed from connexity values of non-trivial segments, which can be used as a sorting criterion for the segmentations. We also point to a relevancy improvement in query evaluation model by means of proximity penalty.
