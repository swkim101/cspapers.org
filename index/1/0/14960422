This paper develops and tests a novel rapid updating technique for use with a nonlinear branch and bound optimisation method, tailored for finding optimal trajectories for a vehicle constrained to avoid fixed obstacles. The key feature of the rapid updating technique developed is the ability to increment and re-arrange the existing search tree reducing the amount of computation taken to find a new plan. The rapid updating techniques developed are combined into a receding horizon control and compared to full cold start method. The rapid updating technique demonstrated an average 62% solve time improvement over a cold start. The rapid updating method is also demonstrated for removal of obstacles from the environment and very large scale problems with 60 obstacles.
