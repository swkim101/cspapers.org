In order to outline what business students need to know about data base management (DBM), this paper first identifies the four most pertinent DBM concepts: (1) characteristics and benefits of DBM, (2) design of data base schemas, (3) set-theoretic queries, and (4) the transition to DBM. Next, the paper discusses four secondary concepts and the reasons for not stressing them. Finally, the need for further co-ordination between DBM instructors and faculty members in the functional areas of business administration is described.
