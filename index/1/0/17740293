This demo presents a testbed for computer networking education. It leverages hardware virtualization to accommodate 6 PCs and 2 routers on a single testbed host to reduce costs, energy consumption, space requirements, and heat emission. The testbed excels by providing dedicated physical Ethernet and USB interfaces for virtual machines so that students can interconnect them with cables and switches like in a non-virtualized testbed
