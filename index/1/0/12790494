This workshop, aimed at instructors of introductory or intermediate courses, introduces participants to version control via two popular source code management (SCM) tools: SVN and Git. Not only is proficiency with SCM tools an invaluable skill for aspiring software developers, but version control also allows students to collaborate effectively on projects. Participants will complete hands-on activities using distributed and centralized SCM tools, learn how to integrate version control into curricula, and discuss the pros and cons of various hosting solutions. Participants will also be introduced to version50, an open-source abstraction layer that provides a common, simplified interface for SCM tools aimed at making version control accessible to novice programmers. Laptop required.
