This paper proposes a method of generating XSLT scripts, which support the fast transformation of XML documents, given one-to-one matching relationships between leaf nodes of XML schemas. The proposed method enhances the transformation speed of generated XSLT scripts through reducing template calls. Experimental results show that the proposed method has generated XSLT scripts that support the faster transformation of XML documents, compared with previous works.
