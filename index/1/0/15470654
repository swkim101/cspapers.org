Human beings do not have well defined shapes neither well defined behaviors. In dense outdoor environments, they are as a consequence hard to detect and algorithms based on a single sensor tend to produce lot of wrong detections. Moreover, many applications require algorithms that work very fast on CPU limited mobile architectures while remaining able to detect, track and classify objects as people with a very high precision. We present an algorithm based on the contribution of a range finder and a vision based algorithm that addresses these three constraints: efficiency, velocity and robustness and that we believe is scalable to a large variety of applications.
