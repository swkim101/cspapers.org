Manhattan channel routing is known to be attractive for practical applications in VLSI layout design, but because of its theoretical complexity no efficient algorithms that yield the optimum can be expected to exist for the general case. Based on two lower bounds for channel width [BBL] have designed an approximation algorithm that has a quite good performance ratio, but does not work well in practice. On the other hand heuristics are known, that find almost optimal solutions in most practical cases, but can perform very badly on some problem instances. In this paper, we present a new channel router, that works well both theoretically and practically. Our method proceeds by transferring specific knock-knee channel routers to the Manhattan model. Like [BBL] the new algorithm approximates the optimal channel width to within a constant factor , but it is superior to the method of [BBL] with respect to the constant factor, the running-time, the number of generated jogs and the typical number of tracks used. Moreover, by including practical heuristics our approximation algorithm is made practical.
