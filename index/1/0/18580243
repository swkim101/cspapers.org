We present Metamorphe, a novel shape-changing keyboard with keys that can be individually raised and lowered. Metamorphe augments the output of traditional keyboards with haptic and visual feedback, and offers a novel design space for user input on raised keys using new gestures (e.g., squeering or pushing the sides of keys). We detail the implementation of Metamorphe, describe its properties, and discuss possible applications including command selection.
