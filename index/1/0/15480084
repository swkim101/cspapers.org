We report on an exploratory analysis of pairwise relationships between three different forms of information consumption on Twitter viz., following, listing and subscribing. We develop a systematic framework to examine the relationships between these three forms. Using our framework, we conducted an empirical analysis of a dataset from Twitter. Our results show that people not only consume information by explicitly following others, but also by listing and subscribing to lists and that the people they list or subscribe to are not the same as the ones they follow. Our work has implications for understanding information propagation and diffusion via Twitter and for generating recommendations for adding users to lists, subscribing and merging or splitting them.
