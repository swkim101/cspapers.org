Locomotion in uneven terrain is important for a wide range of robotic applications, including Search&Rescue operations. Our mobile manipulation robot Momaro features a unique locomotion design consisting of four legs ending in pairs of steerable wheels, allowing the robot to omnidirectionally drive on sufficiently even terrain, step over obstacles, and also to overcome height differences by climbing. We demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of this design on the example of the DARPA Robotics Challenge, where our team NimbRo Rescue solved seven out of eight tasks in only 34 minutes. We also introduce a method for semi-autonomous execution of weight-shifting and stepping actions based on a 2D heightmap generated from 3D laser data.
