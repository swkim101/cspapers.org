In this paper, we propose new models and algorithms to perform practical computations on W3C XML Schemas, which are schema minimization, schema equivalence testing, subschema testing and subschema extraction. We have conducted experiments on an e-commerce standard XSD called xCBL to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms. One experiment has refuted the claim that the xCBL 3.5 XSD is compatible with the xCBL 3.0 XSD. Another experiment has shown that the xCBL XSDs can be effectively trimmed into small subschemas for specific applications, which has significantly reduced schema processing time.
