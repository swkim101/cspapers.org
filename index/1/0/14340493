During the past 20 years, probability theory has become a critical element in the development of many areas in computer science. Commensurately, in this paper, we argue for expanding the coverage of probability in the computing curriculum. Specifically, we present details of a new course we have developed on Probability Theory for Computer Scientists. An analysis of course evaluation data shows that students find the contextualized content of this class more relevant and valuable than general presentations of probability theory. We also discuss different models for expanding the role of probability in different curricular programs that may not have the capacity to teach a full course on the subject.
