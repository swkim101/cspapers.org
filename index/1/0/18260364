In some numerical simulation programs such as Comput ational Fluid Dynamics applications, it is quite common for program loop constructs to include array accessing statements which are themselves subscripted by another array. It is very difficult and in many cases impossible to detect parallelism by subscript analysis at compile time. The dat~flow model of computation is viewed as a good candidate for parallel processing due to its ability to exploit parallelism at run-time. The main purpose of this paper is to utilize data-flow principle in order to exploit run-time parallelism in the type of loops aforementioned. Due to its characteristics such as nonstrict operation and full functionality at the graph level, our proposed Token Relabeling method has the potential to be a good structure handling scheme in cases where array access patterns are very irregular.
