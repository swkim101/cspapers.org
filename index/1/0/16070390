Ar t i f i c i a l Intel l igence has been the f ield of study for explor ing the pr inciples under ly ing thought, and u t i l i z ing thei r discovery to develop use­ fu l computers. T rad i t i ona l AI models have been, consciously or subconsciously, opt imized for available comput ing resources which has led AI in cer ta in direct ions. The emergence o f mas­ sively paral le l computers l iberates the way i n ­ tell igence may be modeled. A l t hough the A I commun i t y has yet to make a quan tum leap, there are a t tempts to make use of the oppor tu ­ nit ies offered by massively paral lel computers, such as memory-based reasoning, genetic algor i t hms , and other novel models. Even w i t h i n the t rad i t i ona l A I approach, researchers have begun to realize tha t the needs for h igh per­ formance comput ing and very large knowledge bases to develop intel l igent systems requires massively paral le l A I techniques. In this Com­ puters and Though t A w a r d lecture, I w i l l argue tha t massively paral le l ar t i f ic ia l intel l igence w i l l add new dimensions to the ways tha t the AI goals are pursued, and demonstrate tha t mas­ sively paral le l ar t i f ic ia l intel l igence is where AI meets the real wor ld .
