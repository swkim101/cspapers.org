We have developed a new method to uniformly balance communication traffic over the interconnection network called Distributed Routing Balancing (DRB) that is based on limited and load-controlled path expansion in order to maintain a low message latency. DRB defines how to create alternative paths to expand single paths (expanded path definition) and when to use them depending on traffic load (expanded path selection carried out by DRB Routing). The alternative path definition offers a broad range of alternatives to choose from and the DRB Routing is designed with the goal of minimising monitoring and decision overhead. Evaluation in terms of latency and bandwidth is presented. Some conclusions from the experimentation and comparisons with existing methods are given. It is demonstrated that DRB is a method to effectively balance network traffic.
