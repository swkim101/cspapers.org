Cloud computing has the potential for tremendous benefits, but wide scale adoption has a range of challenges that must be met. We review these challenges and how they relate to scientific computing. To achieve the portability, interoperability, and economies of scale that clouds offer, it is clear that common design principles must be widely adopted in both the user community and marketplace. To this end, we argue that a private-to-public cloud deployment trajectory will be very common, if not dominant. This trajectory can be used to define a progression of needed common practices and standards which, in turn, can be used to define deployment, development and fundamental research agendas. We then survey the cloud standards landscape and how the standards process could be driven by major stakeholders, e.g., large user groups, vendors, and governments, to achieve scientific and national objectives. We conclude with a call to action for stakeholders to actively engage in driving this process to a successful conclusion.
