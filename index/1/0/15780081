Modern automotive systems are composed of hundreds of software-implemented features often interacting with physical subsystems under real-time constraints. For efficient management of their development, the features are conceived and realized as product lines involving variability with different variants being deployed in different vehicle classes. The variability information is expressed at different levels of abstraction during the various phases of development, like requirements, design and implementation. We introduce and study a formal model of such feature product lines capable of capturing variability and real-time behavior. We define a notion of conformance to relate the variability at different levels of abstraction and propose a compositional method of verifying conformance of multiple features. The proposed approach naturally extends to hybrid system behaviors consisting of discrete and continuous plant variables. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach by giving a simple paradigmatic example.
