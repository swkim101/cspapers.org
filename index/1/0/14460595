In this paper, we describe the use of manufacturing scan-based vectors to structurally assess the frequency of any given semiconductor design, as opposed to the complex and costly effort of creating a functional set of vectors that can actually exercise all of the functions needed to accurately determine if the chip really operates at its rated or advertised frequency. Structural techniques reduce the problem to one of a finite measureable and deterministic set of tests whereas functional vectors can be somewhat subjective unless analyzed, simulated and assessed. The techniques developed and described here were developed on microprocessor designs and were then expanded to cover the general case of an ASIC, SoC, and even FPGA by using static timing analysis, automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) against a path-delay fault model, path selection from STA and using path filtering to eliminate false-paths that would result in an incorrect frequency assessment.
