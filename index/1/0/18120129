Dexterous multifingered hands are the most complex and versatile variants of robotic end effectors. Compared to simpler grippers and underactuated hands, they should be more capable of grasping and, especially, manipulating different objects. This paper explores the relationship between kinematic design and manipulation performance of robotic hands. Some evaluation criteria frequently used by hand designers to verify kinematic configurations are revisited. The results from these criteria are scrutinized and compared with the evaluation of the manipulation workspace and the ranges of motion of inhand manipulation for a set of predefined objects. Simulations and actual manipulation experiments are carried out with different kinematic configurations on a modular dexterous hand. The results show some disconnection between perceived good designs through common evaluation criteria and their actual, realizable manipulation performance. This work finally gives some insight toward a more holistic approach to design hands that better address grasp and manipulation for the intended tasks and applications.
