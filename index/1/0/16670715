This paper summarizes current research at RI aimed at developing secure operating systems and verifying certain critical properties of these systems. It is seen that proofs of design properties can be relatively straightforward when the design is specified in suitable formal specification language. These proofs demonstrate the correspondence between the desired properties and a specification of the system design. Various on-line tools aid considerably in this process. In addition, correctness proofs for implementations of such systems are now feasible, because of both various theoretical advances and the use of supporting tools.
