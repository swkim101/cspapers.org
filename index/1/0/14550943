In this paper, we study the problem of personalized restaurant recommendations. Specifically, we develop a probabilistic factor analysis framework, named RMSQ-MF, which has the ability in exploiting multi-source information, such as the users' task, their friends' preferences, and human mobility patterns, for personalized restaurant recommendations. The rationale of this work is motivated by two observations. First, people's preferences can be affected by their friends. Second, human mobility patterns can reflect the popularity of restaurants to a certain degree. Finally, empirical studies on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark methods with a significant margin.
