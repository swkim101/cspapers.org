In this paper we describe the theory, architecture, implementation, and performance of a multimodal passive biometric verification system that continually verifies the presence/participation of a logged-in user. We assume that the user logged in using strong authentication prior to the starting of the continuous verification process. While the implementation described in the paper combines a digital camera-based face verification with a mouse-based fingerprint reader, the architecture is generic enough to accommodate additional biometric devices with different accuracy of classifying a given user from an imposter. The main thrust of our work is to build a multimodal biometric feedback mechanism into the operating system so that verification failure can automatically lock up the computer within some estimate of the time it takes to subvert the computer. This must be done with low false positives in order to realize a usable system. We show through experimental results that combining multiple suitably chosen modalities in our theoretical framework can effectively do that with currently available off-the-shelf components
