In the fall of 2002 our institution will begin teaching a new computer science curriculum based on the guidelines set forth in Computing Curricula 2001. Of particular interest in this new curriculum is our "breadth-also" approach to a lower-level core. In general, a breadth-also model incorporates topics from across the discipline of computer science into an expanded, programming-first introductory sequence. In this paper we present our specific implementation of this model, and argue its potential to significantly improve learning.
