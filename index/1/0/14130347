We present Phantm, a static analyzer that uses a flow-sensitive analysis to detect type errors in PHP applications. Phantm can infer types for nested arrays, and can leverage runtime information and procedure summaries for more precise results. Phantm found over 200 true problems when applied to three applications with over 50'000 lines of code, including the popular DokuWiki code base.
