This paper presents a geometric based approach for multiple mobile robot motion coordination. All the robot paths being computed independently, we address the problem of coordinating the motion of the robots along their own path in such a way they do not collide each other. The proposed algorithm is based on a bounding box representation of the obstacles in the so-called coordination diagram. The algorithm is resolution-complete. Its efficiency is illustrated by examples involving more than 100 robots.
