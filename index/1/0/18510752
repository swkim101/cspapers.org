Entrainment is the phenomenon of the speech of conversational partners becoming more similar to each other. This thesis proposal presents a comprehensive look at entrainment in human conversations and how entrainment may be incorporated into the design of spoken dialogue systems in order to improve system performance and user satisfaction. We compare different kinds of entrainment in both classic and novel dimensions, provide experimental results on the utility of entrainment, and show that entrainment can be used to improve a systemâ€™s ASR performance and turntaking decisions.
