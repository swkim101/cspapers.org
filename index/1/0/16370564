A novel approach to the problems associated with the development of total avionics systems design and evaluation is described. The ASCE framework provides a general, interactive aid for comparing and evaluating hardware/software systems configurations. Adopting ideas and methodologies from existing programs and ongoing research (FOSS, SCERT, ISDOS, ECSS, etc.) a detailed structure is presented utilizing the best features from these systems and several new approaches. Design weaknesses existing in these programs are alleviated where possible, and several innovative features developed by the authors are incorporated into the methodology of ASCE. Although ASCE methodology is tailored for evaluating designs of avionic systems, the ASCE functions should be useful and applicable to most other computerized systems with little or no change. ASCE uses an elegant but easy to learn and highly usable interactive language. It incorporates a Tutor mode for training new design engineers and insures the input of all essential information for experienced engineers.
