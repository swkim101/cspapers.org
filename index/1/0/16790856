This paper presents a novel control method to stabilize the whole-body motion of humanoid robots when climbing vertical ladders and transitioning between ladders and catwalks. In such environments, the body of the robot tends to incline and rotate because of the slippery surfaces. The inclination and rotation may cause the robot to fail to grasp and thus collide with the rungs. The proposed method modifies the subsequent contact position in real time based on the error of the current robot posture estimated with inertial measurement units (IMUs) and actual joint angles. This paper also presents a method of generating motion by minimizing the contact wrench. This method satisfies hardware limitations, such as collision avoidance, joint torque limits, and joint limits. Applying these methods to a humanoid robot, we realize the robust climbing and descending of multiple rungs of a vertical ladder and bidirectional transitioning from ladders to catwalks.
