Driven by the proliferation of mobile applications, the conflict between data communication requirement and limited battery capacity is becoming sharp on modern smartphones. Offloading mobile traffic from cellular to WiFi is widely recognized as a viable solution to improve the energy efficiency. However, through extensive field experiments, we find WiFi offloading is not always energy efficient and even consumes more energy than cellular network due to link quality variation. In addition, we also observe that practical data transmission deadline requirement and link utilization allows scheduling of data traffic to time periods with good link quality. Accordingly, we propose Q-offload, the first attempt towards energy efficient WiFi offloading with link dynamics. In Q-offload, we propose an iterative framework to achieve energy efficient WiFi offloading by exploiting good link quality while not affecting user experience. We evaluate the performance of Q-offload through both trace-driven analysis and real-world experiments. The results show that it can achieve 33.5%~55.7% energy efficiency improvement, compared with state-of-the-arts under different conditions.
