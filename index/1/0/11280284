This paper deals with the issues of adding a hardware lab component to a typical undergraduate Computer Organization course at a small college. We present a sequence of lab exercises, linked to the material presented during lectures, and discuss the advantages, challenges and pitfalls of implementing such a lab as a part of a liberal-arts Computer Science program.
