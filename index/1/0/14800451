This paper presents the systematic methodology of error correction scheme using low-density parity check (LDPC) codes to improve the reliability and endurance of multi-level cell (MLC) non-volatile memories. Using our realistic error model, the LDPC architecture with the scheme of non-uniform reference voltages (NURV) is proposed to trade off among error correction capability, area, and throughput, which can improve the bit-error-rate significantly.
