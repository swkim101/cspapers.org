Graspless manipulation is easily interfered by external disturbances because the manipulated object is not completely held by a robot hand and supported by an environment such as a floor. Thus it is important to ensure the manipulation is executed robustly against some disturbances. In our works, a rigid-body-based analysis of indeterminate contact forces for quasi-static graspless manipulation has been proposed, and also joint torque optimization for robotic hands. The joint torques of the robot is determined in consideration of some robustness of manipulation against disturbances, which include changes or estimation errors of friction. In the analysis of contact forces in quasi-statics, a kinematic constraint on static friction is considered to exclude infeasible sets of frictional force, with considering treatment of kinetic friction. Additionally, new objective functions for computing optimal joint torques in both static and quasi-static graspless manipulation are proposed. Some numerical samples of both applications are shown to verify our proposed methods.
