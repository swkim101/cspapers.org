We present a document expansion approach that uses Conditional Random Field (CRF) segmentation to automatically extract salient phrases from ad titles. We then supplement the ad document with query segments that are probable translations of the document phrases, as learned from a large commercial search engine's click logs. Our approach provides a significant improvement in DCG and interpolated precision and recall on a large set of human labeled query-ad pairs.
