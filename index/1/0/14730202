Given a set U with n elements and a family of subsets S sube 2 <sup>U</sup> we show how to count the number of k-partitions S<sub>1 </sub> cup ... cup S<sub>k</sub> = U into subsets S<sub>i</sub> isin S in time 2<sup>n</sup>n<sup>O(1)</sup>. The only assumption on S is that it can be enumerated in time 2<sup>n</sup>n<sup>O(1)</sup>. In effect we get exact algorithms in time 2<sup>n</sup>n<sup>O(1)</sup> for several well-studied partition problems including domatic number, chromatic number, bounded component spanning forest, partition into Hamiltonian subgraphs, and bin packing. If only polynomial space is available, our algorithms run in time 3<sup>n</sup>n<sup>O(1)</sup> if membership in S can be decided in polynomial time. For chromatic number, we present a version that runs in time O(2.2461<sup>n</sup>) and polynomial space. For domatic number, we present a version that runs in time O(2.8718<sup>n</sup>). Finally, we present a family of polynomial space approximation algorithms that find a number between chi(G) and [(1 + epsi)chi(G)] in time O(1.2209<sup>n</sup> + 2.2461<sup>e-epsi</sup>n)
