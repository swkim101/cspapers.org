Modeling tools are often not used for tasks during the software lifecycle for which they should be more helpful; instead free-from approaches, such as office tools and white boards, are frequently used. Prior workshops explored why this is the case and what might be done about it. The goal of this workshop is to continue those discussions and also to form an initial set of challenge problems and research challenges that researchers and developers of flexible modeling tools should address.
