In this paper we introduce a novel distributed simulation environment with GUI for P2P simulations (D-P2P-Sim). The key aim is to provide the appropriate integrated set of tools in a single software solution to evaluate the performance of various protocols. The basic architecture of the distributed P2P simulator is based on a multi-threading, asynchronous, message passing and distributed environment with graphical user interface to facilitate ease of use by both researchers and programmers.
