We present a mathematical framework for analyzing the synthesis of interacting, finite state systems. The logic S1S is used to derive simple, rigorous, and constructive solutions to problems in sequential synthesis. We obtain exact and approximate sets of permissible FSM network behavior, and address the issue of FSM realizability. This approach is also applied to synthesizing systems with fairness and timed systems.
