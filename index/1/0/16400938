Spartacus, our 2005 AAAI Mobile Robot Challenge entry, integrated planning and scheduling, sound source localization, tracking and separation, message reading, speech recognition and generation, and autonomous navigation capabilities onboard a custom-made interactive robot. Integration of such a high number of capabilities revealed interesting new issues such as coordinating audio/visual/graphical capabilities, monitoring the impacts of the capabilities in usage by the robot, and inferring the robot's intentions and goals. Our 2006 entry will be used to address these issues, to add new capabilities to the robot and to improve our software and computational architectures, with the objective of increasing, evaluating and improving our understanding of human-robot interaction and integration with an autonomous mobile platform.
