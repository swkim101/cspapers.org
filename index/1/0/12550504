This paper presents an efficient algorithm for post-synthesis logic simulation of digital circuits with oscillatory combinational loops. Oscillatory combinational loops can significantly degrade the performance of cycle accurate logic simulators. We provide an algorithm that first, dynamically detects oscillatory loops. Then, we introduce a novel approach to compute a multiple of their oscillation period which is used to optimize the efficiency of the simulation by reducing the number of time points that need to be evaluated. Finally, we provide the experimental results of our optimized algorithm measured on a cycle accurate simulator used in conjunction with a hardware emulator.
