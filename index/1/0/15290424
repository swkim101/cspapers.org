A two semester first year course is proposed that provides an introduction to algorithmic problem solving and programming, human-computer communication, file and database systems, and software engineering. The goals of this course coincide and expand upon the Introduction to Programming and Computer Tools course proposed by the ACM Task Force as a prerequisite for studies in computer science. The methodology integrates the contents of several knowledge units of the Computing Curricula 1991 of the ACM/IEEE-CS.
