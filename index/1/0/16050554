We present an approach to automatically recover hidden attributes of scientific articles, such as whether the author is a native English speaker, whether the author is a male or a female, and whether the paper was published in a conference or workshop proceedings. We train classifiers to predict these attributes in computational linguistics papers. The classifiers perform well in this challenging domain, identifying non-native writing with 95% accuracy (over a baseline of 67%). We show the benefits of using syntactic features in stylometry; syntax leads to significant improvements over bag-of-words models on all three tasks, achieving 10% to 25% relative error reduction. We give a detailed analysis of which words and syntax most predict a particular attribute, and we show a strong correlation between our predictions and a paper's number of citations.
