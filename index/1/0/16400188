In recent years, recommendation algorithms have become one of the most active research areas driven by the enormous industrial demands. Most of the existing recommender systems focus on topics such as movie, music, e-commerce etc., which essentially differ from the TV show recommendations due to the cold-start and temporal dynamics. Both effectiveness (effectively handling the cold-start TV shows) and efficiency (efficiently updating the model to reflect the temporal data changes) concerns have to be addressed to design real-world TV show recommendation algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid recommendation algorithm incorporating both collaborative user-item relationship as well as item content features. The cold-start TV shows can be correctly recommended to desired users via a so called space alignment technique. On the other hand, an online updating scheme is developed to utilize new user watching behaviors. We present experimental results on a real TV watch behavior data set to demonstrate the significant performance improvement over other state-of-the-art algorithms.
