A large percentage of the research in computer science is published in conferences and workshops. We propose three methods which compute a "relatedness score" for conferences relative to a pivot conference, usually a top rated conference. We experiment with the DBLP bibliography to show that our relatedness ranking can be used to help understand the basis of conference reputation ratings, determine what conferences are related to an area and the classification of conferences into areas.
