This work presents GaussStarter, a pluggable and tileable analog Hall-sensor grid module for easy and scalable bread- board prototyping. In terms of ease-of-use, the graspable units allow users to easily plug them on or remove them from a breadboard. In terms of scalability, tiling the units on the breadboard can easily expand the sensing area. A software development kit is also provided for designing applications based on this hardware module.
