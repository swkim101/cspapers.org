Smoothing document model with word graph is a new and effective method in information retrieval. Word graph can naturally incorporate the dependency between the words; random walk algorithm based on the graph can be used to estimate the weight of each vertex. In this paper, we present a new way to construct a local word graph for smoothing document model, which exploits the document's k nearest neighbors: the vertices represent the words in the document and its k nearest neighbors, and the weights of the edges are estimated through word co-occurrence in the local document set. We argue that word graph is a key factor to the performance in graph-based smoothing method. By using the local document set, we can obtain a document specific word graph, and achieve better retrieval performance. Experimental results on three TREC collections show that our proposed approach is effective.
