Support for deterministic replay of multithreaded execution can greatly help in finding concurrency bugs. For highest effectiveness, replay schemes should (i) record at production-run speed, (ii) keep their logging requirements minute, and (iii) replay at a speed similar to that of the initial execution. In this paper, we propose a new substrate for deterministic replay that provides substantial advances along these axes. In our proposal, processors execute blocks of instructions atomically, as in transactional memory or speculative multithreading, and the system only needs to record the commit order of these blocks. We call our scheme DeLorean. Our results show that DeLorean records execution at a speed similar to that of release consistency (RC) execution and replays at about 82% of its speed. In contrast, most current schemes only record at the speed of Sequential Consistency (SC) execution. Moreover, DeLorean only needs 7.5% of the log size needed by a state-of-the-art scheme. Finally, DeLorean can be configured to need only 0.6% of the log size of the state-of-the-art scheme at the cost of recording at 86% of RCpsilas execution speed - still faster than SC. In this configuration, the log of an 8-processor 5-GHz machine is estimated to be only about 20GB per day.
