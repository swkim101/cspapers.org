This paper presents a framework for exploring issues in time-dependent planning: planning in which the time available to respond to predicted events varies, and the decision making required to formulate effective responses is complex. Our analysis of time-dependent planning suggests an approach based on a class of algorithms that we call anytime algorithms. Anytime algorithms can be interrupted at any point during computation to return a result whose utility is a function of computation time. We explore methods for solving time-dependent planning problems based on the properties of anytime algorithms.
