In the current research project, we aim at developing a system for answering why-questions (why-QA). In previous research, we investigated the possibilities of answer extraction for why-QA exploiting discourse structure in the source text. One conclusion was that many why-questions require a complete paragraph as an answer. In the present paper, we will first discuss the results and the main conclusions that we obtained from these experiments. Then, we will present our research plans concerning paragraph retrieval for why-QA.
