While monitoring stations have been established to collect pollutant statistics, the number of stations is very limited due to the high cost. Thus, inferring fine-grained urban air quality information is becoming an essential issue for both government and people. In this paper, we propose a generic neural approach, named ADAIN, for urban air quality inference. We leverage both the information from monitoring stations and urban data that are closely related to air quality, including POIs, road networks and meteorology. ADAIN combines feedforward and recurrent neural networks for modeling static and sequential features as well as capturing deep feature interactions effectively. A novel attempt of ADAIN is an attention-based pooling layer that automatically learns the weights of features from different monitoring stations, to boost the performance. We conduct experiments on a real-world air quality dataset and our approach achieves the highest performance compared with various state-of-the-art solutions.
