In this paper we exploit the use of the proposed RKPCA method ([1], [2], [3]) for sensor fault detection, localisation and reconstruction. To this end, a set of structured residues is generated by using partial RKPCA technique. Also to identify fault, the Reconstruction Based Contribution RBC approach [4] was used. The relevance of the evaluated techniques partial RKPCA and RBC is revealed on Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR).
