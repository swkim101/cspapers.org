We introduce a new algorithmic technique that applies to several graph connectivity problems. Its power is demonstrated by experimental studies of the minimum-weight strongly-connected spanning subgraph problem and the minimum-weight augmentation problem. Even though we are unable to improve the approximation ratios for these problems, OUT studies indicate that the new method generates significantly better solutions than the current known approximation algorithms, and yields solutions very close to optimal. We believe that our technique will eventually lead to algorithms that improve the performance ratios as well.
