We discuss a smart navigation system by route planning which makes active use of spatial semantics. The central concept of the system is coordination of lightweight components as services, such as business process modeling. Our proposed navigation system consists of three main components: a route planner, an object repository, and a space functionality retriever (SFR). The route planner is the component for inquisitions. The object repository deals with real-world information. Then, the SFR deals with knowledge about space represented by XML-based descriptions. Using these components, we realize a smart navigation system that enables a route planner to suggest alternate solutions to end-users. Our final target is to develop advanced location-based information services that surpass conventional ones, thereby realizing an intelligent space.
