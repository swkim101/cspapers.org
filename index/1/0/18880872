Trust management of cloud services is emerging as an important research issue in recent years, which poses significant challenges because of the highly dynamic, distributed, and non-transparent nature of cloud services. This paper describes Cloud Armor, a platform for credibility-based trust management of cloud services. The platform provides a crawler for automatic cloud services discovery, an adaptive and robust credibility model for measuring the credibility of feedbacks, and a trust-based recommender to recommend the most trustworthy cloud services to users. This paper presents the motivation, system design, implementation, and a demonstration of the Cloud Armor platform.
