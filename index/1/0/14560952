Location-based services have attracted significant attentions from both industry and academia, thanks to modern smartphones and mobile Internet. To provide users with gratifications, location-aware publish/subscribe has been recently proposed, which delivers spatio-textual messages of publishers to subscribers whose registered spatio-textual subscriptions are relevant to the messages. Since there could be large numbers of subscriptions, it is necessary to devise an efficient location-aware publish/subscribe system to enable instant message filtering. To this end, in this paper we propose two novel indexing structures, mbrtrie and PKQ. Using the indexes, we devise two filtering algorithms to support fast message filtering. We analyze the complexities of the two filtering algorithms and develop a cost-based model to judiciously select the best filtering algorithm for different scenarios. The experimental results show that our method achieves high performance and significantly outperforms the baseline approaches
