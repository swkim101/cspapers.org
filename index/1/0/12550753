The central task of a Security Incident and Event Manager (SIEM) or Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) is to detect security incidents on the basis of tens of thousands of event types coming from many kinds of security products. We present Smoke Detector, which processes trillions of security events with the Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm, inferring high order relationships between known security incidents and imperfect secondary security events (smoke) to find undiscovered security incidents (fire). By finding previously undetected incidents, Smoke Detector's RWR algorithm is able to increase the MSSP's critical incident count by 19% with a 1.3% FP rate. Perhaps equally importantly, our approach offers significant benefits beyond increased incident detection: (1) It provides a robust approach for leveraging Big Data sensor nets to increase adversarial resistance of protected networks; (2) Our event-scoring techniques enable efficient discovery of primary indicators of compromise; (3) Our confidence scores provide intuition and tuning capabilities for Smoke Detector's discovered security incidents, aiding incident display and response.
