Example-based programming is a form of software reuse in which existing code examples are modified to meet current task needs. Example-based programming systems that have enough exampIes to be useful present the problem of finding relevant examples. A prototype system named CODEFINDER, which explores issues of retrieving software objects relevant to the design task, is presented. CODEFINDER supports human-computer dialogue by providing the means to incrementally construct a query and by providing associative cues that are compatible with human memory retrieval principles.
