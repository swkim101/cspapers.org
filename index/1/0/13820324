Applications in different domains require reactive processing of massive, dynamically generated streams of data. This trend is increasingly visible also on the Web, where more and more streaming sources are becoming available. These originate from social networks, sensor networks, the Internet of Things (IoT) and many other technologies that use the Web as a platform for sharing data. This has resulted in new Web-centric efforts such as the Web of Things (WoT), which focuses on exposing and describing the IoT resources on the Web; or the Social Web which provides protocols, vocabularies, and APIs to facilitate access to social communications and interactions on the Web.
