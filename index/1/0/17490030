This paper explores the role of anisotropic friction properties in vibratory parts manipulation. We show that direction-dependent surface friction properties can be used in conjunction with a vibrating plate to help design friction-induced velocity fields on the surface of the plate. Theoretical, simulation, and experimental results are presented quantifying the anisotropic friction effects of textured surfaces such as micromachined silicon and fabrics.
