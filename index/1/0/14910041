The paper presents two new versions of the FFT algorithm. Based on these versions a new VLSI oriented architecture for implementing of the FFT algorithm is introduced. It consists of a homogenous structure of processing elements. The structure has a performance equal to 1/tB transforms per second, where tB is the time needed for execution of a single butterfly computation.
Besides high performance the architecture is modular and makes it possible to design a system which performs the DFT of any size with constant performance and without any extra circuitry. Moreover, the system can provide a built-in self test.
