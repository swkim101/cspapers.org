An approach to systematic informal program analysis is discussed in which comments that describe hypotheses and assertions about the behavior of programs are analyzed. Event sequence comments analysis methods analyze the consistency of comments that describe events. Two event sequence analysis methods are discussed, one of which uses a linear event sequence model, and which has been applied to the analysis of large data processing systems. The other uses a new approach involving rule-based structural models, and has been applied to the analysis of Ada programs.
