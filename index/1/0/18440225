486,344. Roller bearings. BENEDEK, E. K. March 15, 1937, No. 7567. [Class 12 (i)] A high-speed heavyload needle roller bearing comprises two races 7, 8, with needle rollers 31, the individual rollers being spaced apart by a lubricant film and the total clearance between the rollers of a set lying between the limits of one to three needle roller diameters whereby an efficient circulation of lubricant is obtained. As shown, for a multiple row bearing, one of the races has annular oil channels 6 and the other lubricant ducts 9. Rings 10 separate the rows of rollers. The needle rollers may be conical. The invention may be applied to single and double thrust bearings. In a modification needle rollers 3, Fig. 12, carried in a rectangular cage 16 are arranged between members 14, 15, having relative oscillatory or rotary motion. The total clearance between the rollers and the cage lies between one to three roller diameters. A rectilinear-motion bearing is constructed similarly. Specification 410,968 is referred to.
