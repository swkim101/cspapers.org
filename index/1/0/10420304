Queries are often ambiguous and can be interpreted in many ways, even by humans. Hence, semantic query understanding's primary objective is to understand the intention behind the query. This implies first predicting the language used to express the query. Second, parsing the query according to that language. Third, extracting the entities and concepts mentioned in the query. Finally, based on all this information, we predict one or more possible intentions with a certain probability, which is particularly important for ambiguous queries. These scores will be one of the inputs for the final semantic ranking. For example, given the query "bond", possible results for query understanding are a financial instrument, the movie character, a chemical reaction, or a term for endearment. Semantic ranking refers to ranking search results using semantic information. In a standard search engine, a rank is computed by using signals or features coming from the search query, from the documents in the collection being searched and from the search context, such as the language and device being used. Using semantic processing, we also add semantic features that come from concepts present in the knowledge base that appear in the query and semantically match documents in the collection. To do this efficiently, all documents are preprocessed semantically to build an index that includes semantic annotations. To accomplish semantic ranking, we use machine learning in several stages. The first stage selects the data sources that we should use to answer the query. In the second stage, each data source generates a set of answers using "learning to rank." The third and final stage ranks these data sources, selecting and ordering the intentions as well as the answers inside each intention (e.g., news) that will appear in the final composite answer. All these techniques are language independent, but may use language dependent features.
