The goal of this demonstration is to present the main features of (i) Axielle, an XML repository developed by Ardent Software [3] on top of the O2 object-oriented DBMS and (ii) the ActiveView system which has been built by the Verso project at INRIA [1] on top of Axielle. The demonstration is based on a simple electronic commerce application which will be described in Section 2. Electronic commerce is emerging as a major Web-supported application. It involves handling and exchange of data (e.g. product catalogs, yellow pages, etc.) and must provide (i) database functionalities (query language, transactions, concurrency control, distribution and recovery) for the efficient management of large data volumes and hundreds of users as well as (ii) standard data storage and exchange formats (e.g. XML, SGML) for the easy integration of existing software and data. The ActiveView system combined with the Axielle XML repository enables a fast deployment of electronic commerce applications based on a new high-level declarative specification language (AVL), advanced database technology (object-oriented data model, XML query language, notifications), Web standards (HTTP, HTML) and other Internet compliant
