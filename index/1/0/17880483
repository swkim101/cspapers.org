This paper presents the uniform theory for describing of the shuffle-exchange type permutation networks - the theory of Ek stages. The use of this new approach is demonstrated by applying it to the flip, omega, and other incomplete permutation networks and to some complete networks /e.g. the Beneš network/ as well. Especially the paper deals with the p, 2p, and /2p−1/-stage networks, where p &equil; log2n and n is number of the inputs /or outputs/ of these networks.
