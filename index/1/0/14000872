We present a novel technique for synthesising behaviour models that works for an expressive subset of liveness properties and conforms to the foundational requirements engineering World/Machine model, dealing explicitly with assumptions on environment behaviour and distinguishing controlled and monitored actions. This is the first technique that conforms to what is considered best practice in requirements specifications: distinguishing prescriptive and descriptive assertions. Most previous attempts at using synthesis of behavioural models were restricted to handling only safety properties. Those that did support liveness were inadequate for synthesis of operational event based models as they did not include the bespoke distinction between system goals and environment assumptions.
