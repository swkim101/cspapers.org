WHIRL [l, 21 is a hybrid system that combines properties of relational databases and statistical IR systems. WHIRL manipulates a relational database in which every cell of every relation contains a “document” (rather than an atomic symbol), represented as a TFIDF-weighted term vector [3]. WHIRL’s query language is an extension of SQL which contains a built-in similarity predicate over term vectors. This query language is given a “soft semantics”. Roughly speaking, every tuple that could potentially appear in the answer is given a real-numbered “score”, indicating the degree to which it satisfies the similarity constraints of the query. The answer to a query is the k tuples with highest score (where k is fixed by the user). For example:
