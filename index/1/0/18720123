This paper centers on the problem of finding commonalities for a set of objects belonging to an object-oriented database. In our approach, commonalities within a set of objects are described by object-oriented queries that compute this set of objects. The paper discusses the architecture of a knowledge discovery system, called MASSON, which employs genetic programming to find such queries. We also report on an experiment that evaluated the knowledge discovery capabilities of the MASSON system.
