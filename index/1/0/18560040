Computer vision approaches are increasingly used in mobile robotic systems, since they allow to obtain a very good representation of the environment by using low-power and cheap sensors. In particular it has been shown that they can compete with standard solutions based on laser range scanners when dealing with the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where the robot has to explore an unknown environment while building a map of it and localizing in the same map. We present a package for simultaneous localization and mapping in ROS (Robot Operating System) using a monocular camera sensor only. Experimental results in real scenarios as well as on standard datasets show that the algorithm is able to track the trajectory of the robot and build a consistent map of small environments, while running in near real-time on a standard PC.
