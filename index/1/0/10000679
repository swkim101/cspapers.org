The Cedar DBMS is a database management system developed as part of the Cedar programming environment. The system has several unusual aspects, including its interface for applications programming in a strongly-typed procedural language and its distribution of computation and data over a network. This paper describes the design goals, architecture, and implementation of the Cedar DBMS.
