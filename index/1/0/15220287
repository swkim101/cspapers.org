This paper describes the design and delivery of a highly successful MOOC that uses MATLAB to teach introductory computer programming to a wide audience. The decisions behind the curriculum and assessment strategy are detailed, and the results are evaluated based on three sessions of the course that saw 80,000 active students, two million lecture views and 100,000 auto-graded programming assignment sets during the three sessions delivered in 2015.
