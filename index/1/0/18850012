We present an efficient procedure converters from formal specifications. David M. Kristol David Lee Arun N. Netravali Krishan K. Sabnani AT&T Bell Laboratories Murray Hill, NJ 07974 that computes protocol This urocedure has a polynomial number of computation steps; on the other hand, all other procedures reported in the literature require an exponential number of computation steps. A major step in our procedure is the computation of the largest common subset of services. This largest common subset is used to compute the converter. Conditions under which the converter can be stateless are also described. As an example, we compute a converter for interconnecting a half-duplex protocol with a full-duplex protocol from their formal specifications.
