A rational-function hybrid-parameter model for general multiconductor transmission lines is derived from a spectralmethod solution of the telegrapher equations, using Chebyshev polynomials to represent spatial variation. Time-domain macromodel is then generated by a recursive convolution algorithm which can be simulated efficiently with arbitrary terminations. Results from a transient simulator implementing the approach are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and stability of the derived macromodel.
