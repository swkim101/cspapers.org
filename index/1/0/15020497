This paper describes an interesting number game of moderate complexity that is a suitable programming project for the CS 1 course. The { game provides an opportunity, not often found in CS 1, for a discussion of appropriate data structures (sets versus arrays). It is also complex enough that a divide-and-conquer approach using procedures and functions is helpful in solving the overall problem. Finally, because the game yields to a simple heuristic that outperforms most CS 1 students, the game provides an introduction to the elementary concepts of artificial intelligence.
