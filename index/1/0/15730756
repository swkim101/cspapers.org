Social simulations are a valuable but underutilized tool that can help public policy researchers understand when sustainable practices are likely to make the delicate transition from being an individual choice to becoming a social norm. In this paper, we introduce a new normative multi-agent architecture, Cognitive Social Learners (CSL), that models bottom-up norm emergence through a social learning mechanism, while using BDI (Belief/Desire/Intention) reasoning to handle adoption and compliance. CSL preserves a greater sense of cognitive realism than influence propagation or infectious transmission approaches, enabling the modeling of complex beliefs and contradictory objectives within an agent-based simulation. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of CSL for modeling norm emergence of recycling practices and public participation in a smoke-free campus initiative.
