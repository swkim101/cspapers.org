Unmanned multirotor helicopters have been expected for various critical tasks such as rescue missions, and it is important to sense the environment to achieve those tasks. In order to realize such sensor systems, this paper considers acoustic information recognition from a hovering helicopter which a microphone array system. As the noise of rotors distorts the acoustic information, noise reduction is necessary. Since the rotor noise varies even at the hovering flight, an acoustic model of the rotor noise is derived taking the dynamics of the helicopter into account, and the model is utilized to evaluate the performance of the microphone array. The proposed approach was verified by evaluating the optimality of a real device that was empirically tuned in authors previous work, and the computed configuration of the microphone array and the developed one coincide well, which ensures the validity of the approach. As the validation through a practical application, the signal was processed by Delay-and-Sum Beam Former to localize the sound source. The system was able to find peaks of the power that corresponded to the sound source.
