LUSTRE is a synchronous data-flow language for programming systems which interact with their environments in real-time. After an informal presentation of the language, we describe its semantics by means of structural inference rules. Moreover, we show how to use this semantics in order to generate efficient sequential code, namely, a finite state automaton which represents the control of the program. Formal rules for program transformation are also presented.
