This panel will focus on the integrated circuit fab and assembly line and the work of its manufacturing engineers. It will explore desirable CAD tool modifications for its products % process, relia ility, and test engineers, and brainstorm new workstation-based software to aid them to improve quality, reduce cost and shorten time to market. The panel and the audience will explore alternatives for breaking down the wall between R&D and manufacturing and improving the links to manufacturing process and test computers.
