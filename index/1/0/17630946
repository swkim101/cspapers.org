The emulator network, a single stage interconnection network, can be used to simulate a wide variety of single stage and multistage SIMD interconnection networks. These include the STARAN, the omega, the data manipulator, and the Illiac networks. A hardware design for the emulator network is presented. It is shown how the emulator network can be used to test different network control schemes. Its performance in a partitioned machine environment is discussed. It is well suited for use in SIMD system prototypes being built to study the effectiveness of various design parameters.
