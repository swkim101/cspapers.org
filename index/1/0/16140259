The 1990 Database system should support multiple interfaces to the same physical database as required by all potential users. This "same physical database" will exist transparently over several physically discrete geographic locations and involve separable schemas using heterogeneous data structures. Thus a single, comprehensive data dictionary will exist as perhaps the only de jure standard during a period when de facto standards increasingly limit the introduction of new data models. -This DD/D permits all database design at the "conceptual" level with all optimization done automatically.
