We present SCHN ¨ APPER, a web toolkit for Exploratory Relation Extraction (ERE). The tool allows users to identify relations of interest in a very large text corpus in an exploratory and highly interactive fashion. With this tool, we demonstrate the easeof-use and intuitive nature of ERE, as well as its applicability to large corpora. We show how users can formulate exploratory, natural language-like pattern queries that return relation instances. We also show how automatically computed suggestions are used to guide the exploration process. Finally, we demonstrate how users create extractors with SCHN ¨ APPER once a relation of interest is identified.
