This study explores how the design of visual display configurations relates to linguistic expressions. Twenty-five participants performed a series of object identification and narrative Description tasks on either a large wall-sized or small desktop display. Results revealed that during the Description tasks, large display users produced significantly greater rates of local deictic references than small display users, but in the identification tasks, the rates were similar for both large and small display users. Implications for the design of interactive technologies are discussed.
