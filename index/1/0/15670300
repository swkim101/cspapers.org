A graph G is called a Berge graph if neither G nor its complement contains a chordless cycle whose length is odd and at least five; what we call a dart is the graph with vertices u,v,w,x,y and edges uv,vw,uy,vy,wy,xy; a graph is called dart-free if it has no induced subgraph isomorphic to the dart. We present a polynomial-time algorithm to recognize dart-free Berge graphs; this algorithm uses as a subroutine the polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing claw-free Berge graphs designed previously by Chvatal and Sbihi [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 44 (1988), pp. 154--176].
