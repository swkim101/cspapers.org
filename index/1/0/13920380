This paper, motivated by functional brain imaging applications, is interested in the discovery of stable spatio-temporal patterns. This problem is formalized as a multi-objective multi-modal optimization problem: on one hand, the target patterns must show a good stability in a wide spatio-temporal region (antagonistic objectives); on the other hand, experts are interested in finding all such patterns (global and local optima). The proposed algorithm, termed 4D-Miner, is empirically validated on artificial and real-world datasets; it shows good performances and scalability, detecting target spatiotemporal patterns within minutes from 400+ Mo datasets.
