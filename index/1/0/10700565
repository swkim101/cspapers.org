The problem of tracking the position and orientation of a moving object using a stereo camera system is considered in this paper. A robust algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter is adopted, combined with an efficient selection technique of the object image features, based on Binary Space Partitioning tree geometric models. An experimental study is carried out using a vision system of two fixed cameras.
