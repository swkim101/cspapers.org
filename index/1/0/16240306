New work in robotics targets the development of controllable agile motions such as leaping. In this work, we examine animal and robotic systems on the metric of jumping agility and find that animals can outperform the most agile robots by a factor of two. These specially adapted animals use a jumping strategy we term power modulation to generate more peak power for jumping than otherwise possible. A novel eight-bar revolute mechanism designed with a new linkage synthesis approach encodes the properties for power modulation as well as constraints which assure rotation-free jumping motion. We fabricate an 85 gram prototype and demonstrate that it can perform a range of jumps while constrained by a linear slide. The prototype can deliver 3.63 times more peak jumping power than the maximum its motor can produce. A simulation matched to the physical parameters of the prototype predicts that the robot can attain an agility exceeding that of the most agile animals if the actuator power is increased to 15W.
