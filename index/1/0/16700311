Several fundamental optimization and counting problems arising in computer science, mathematics and physics can be reduced to one of the following computational tasks involving polynomials and set systems: given an oracle access to an m-variate real polynomial g and to a family of (multi-)subsets ℬ of [m], (1) compute the sum of coefficients of monomials in g corresponding to all the sets that appear in B(1), or find S ε ℬ such that the monomial in g corresponding to S has the largest coefficient in g. Special cases of these problems, such as computing permanents and mixed discriminants, sampling from determinantal point processes, and maximizing sub-determinants with combinatorial constraints have been topics of much recent interest in theoretical computer science. In this paper we present a general convex programming framework geared to solve both of these problems. Subsequently, we show that roughly, when g is a real stable polynomial with non-negative coefficients and B is a matroid, the integrality gap of our convex relaxation is finite and depends only on m (and not on the coefficients of g). Prior to this work, such results were known only in important but sporadic cases that relied heavily on the structure of either g or ℬ; it was not even a priori clear if one could formulate a convex relaxation that has a finite integrality gap beyond these special cases. Two notable examples are a result by Gurvits for real stable polynomials g when ℬ contains one element, and a result by Nikolov and Singh for a family of multi-linear real stable polynomials when B is the partition matroid. This work, which encapsulates almost all interesting cases of g and B, benefits from both - it is inspired by the latter in coming up with the right convex programming relaxation and the former in deriving the integrality gap. However, proving our results requires extensions of both; in that process we come up with new notions and connections between real stable polynomials and matroids which might be of independent interest.
