Biclustering (also known as submatrix localization) is a problem of high practical relevance in exploratory analysis of high-dimensional data. We develop a framework for performing statistical inference on biclusters found by score-based algorithms. Since the bicluster was selected in a data dependent manner by a biclustering or localization algorithm, this is a form of selective inference. Our framework gives exact (non-asymptotic) confidence intervals and p-values for the significance of the selected biclusters.
