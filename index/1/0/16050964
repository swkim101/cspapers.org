Three key components of an autonomous intelligent system are planning, execution, and learning. This paper describes how the Soar architecture supports planning, execution, and learning in unpredictable and dynamic environments. The tight integration of these components provides reactive execution, hierarchical execution, interruption, on demand planning, and the conversion of deliberate planning to reaction. These capabilities are demonstrated on two robotic systems controlled by Soar, one using a Puma robot arm and an overhead camera, the second using a small mobile robot with an arm.
