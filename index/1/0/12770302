Funneling and saltation are two major illusory feedback techniques for vibration-based tactile feedback. They are often put into practice e.g. to reduce the number of vibrators to be worn on the body and thereby build a less cumbersome feedback device. Recently, these techniques have been found to be applicable to eliciting "out of the body" experiences as well (e.g. through user-held external objects). This paper examines the possibility of applying this phenomenon to interacting with virtual objects. Two usability experiments were run to test the effects of funneling and saltation respectively for perceiving tactile sensation from a virtual object in an augmented reality setting. Experimental results have shown solid evidences for phantom sensations from virtual objects with funneling, but mixed results for saltation.
