This paper describes a method for compiling programs using interprocedural register allocation. A strategy for handling programs built from multiple modules is presented, as well as algorithms for global variable promotion and register spill code motion. These algorithms attempt to address some of the shortcomings of previous interprocedural register allocation strategies. Results are given for an implementation on a single register file RISC-based architecture.
