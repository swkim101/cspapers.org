Most existing face verification systems rely on precise face detection and registration. However, these two components are fallible under unconstrained scenarios (e.g., mobile face authentication) due to partial occlusions, pose variations, lighting conditions and limited view-angle coverage of mobile cameras. We address the unconstrained face verification problem by encoding face images directly without any explicit models of detection or registration. We propose a selective encoding framework which injects relevance information (e.g., foreground/background probabilities) into each cluster of a descriptor codebook. An additional selector component also discards distractive image patches and improves spatial robustness. We evaluate our framework using Gaussian mixture models and Fisher vectors on challenging face verification datasets. We apply selective encoding to Fisher vector features, which in our experiments degrade quickly with inaccurate face localization, our framework improves robustness with no extra test time computation. We also apply our approach to mobile based active face authentication task, demonstrating its utility in real scenarios.
