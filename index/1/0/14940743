The DAS is an automated system that supports design verification with the goal of improved software quality and reduced life cycle costs. The integral use of a system engineering language for requirements and design specification, automatic simulation model generation, and user-oriented features are key to the comprehensive approach. This paper briefly describes DAS' components and its intended application.
