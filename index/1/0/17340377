The management of multimedia information poses special requirements for multimedia information systems. Both representation and retrieval of the complex and multifaceted multimedia data are not easily handled with the flat relational model and require new data models. In the last several years, object-oriented and graph-based data models are actively pursued approaches for handling the multimedia information. In this paper the characteristics of the novel graph-based object-oriented data model are presented. This model represents the structural and behavioral aspects of data that form multimedia information systems. It also provides for handling the continuously changing user requirements and the complexity of the schema and data representation in multimedia information systems using the schema versioning approach and perspective version abstraction.
