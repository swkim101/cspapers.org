This paper describes a method to realize flexible cooperation between human and robot which reflects the intention and state of human by using gaze information. This physiological information expresses the process of thinking directly, so it enables us to read the internal condition such as hesitation or search in decision making process. We propose a method to interpret the intention and condition from the latest history of gaze movement and determine an appropriate cooperative action of a robot based on it so that the task proceeds smoothly. Finally, we show experimental results by using a humanoid-type robot.
