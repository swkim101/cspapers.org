To make the original optimization problem with combinational constraints computationally tractable,Â  the optimization techniques are adopted and a general compact representation lemma is summarized. Based on the lemma, a Nonlinear Maximum K-Min (NMKM) classifier is presented and the experiment results demonstrate the superior performance of the Maximum K-Min Approach.
