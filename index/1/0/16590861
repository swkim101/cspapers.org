HELPER is a symbol oriented debugging system used for programs which have been compiled previously. It is easily extensible employing an incremental compiler to process commands given in a natural language. Programs are executed by simulation permitting a number of analysis actions to take place on each instruction. Debugging is both dynamic and static. Many program errors are caught before execution and a back up feature is provided to check code in the neighborhood of an error. Free access to more machine oriented debugging tools is possible and a complete record of each computer session is kept.
