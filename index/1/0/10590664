We develop a localization method enabling a team of mobile robots to search for multiple unknown transient radio sources. Due to signal source anonymity, short transmission durations, and dynamic transmission patterns, robots cannot treat the radio sources as continuous radio beacons. Moreover, robots do not know the source transmission power and have limited sensing ranges. To cope with these challenges, we pair up robots and develop a sensing model using the signal strength ratio from the paired robots. We formally prove that the sensed conditional joint posterior probability of source locations for the m-robot team can be obtained by combining the pairwise joint posterior probabilities, which can be derived from signal strength ratios. Moreover, we propose a pairwise ridge walking algorithm (PRWA) to coordinate the robot pairs based on the clustering of high probability regions and the minimization of local Shannon entropy. We have implemented and validated the algorithm under hardware-driven simulation.
