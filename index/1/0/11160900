Our work deals with the analysis of the queueing delays of buffered multistage Banyan networks of multiprocessors. We provide tight upper bounds on the mean delays of the second stage and beyond, in the case of infinite buffers. Our results are validated by simulations performed on a network simulator constructed by us. The analytic work for network stages beyond the first, provides a partial answer to open problems posed by previous research.
