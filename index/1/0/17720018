This paper presents an approach that uses conformal mapping to parameterize a document's 3D shape to a 2D plane. Using this conformal parametrization, a restorative mapping between an image of the distorted document and a "flattened" representation of the document can be computed and used to deskew the image. Our experiments show that arbitrarily distorted documents can be restored to within a single pixel of their true planar format. In addition, surface points can be constrained to map to specified locations in the restored 2D plane.
