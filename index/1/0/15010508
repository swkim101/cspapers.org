Some iterative matrix relations for the geometric, kinematic and dynamic analysis of a Delta parallel robot are established in this paper. The prototype of this manipulator is a three degree of freedom spatial mechanism, which consists of a system of parallel chains. Supposing that the position and the translation motion of the platform are known, an inverse dynamic problem is solved using the virtual powers method. Finally, some recursive matrix relations and some graphs for the moments and the powers of the three active couples are determined.
