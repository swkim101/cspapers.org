In this paper, we describe a purely object-oriented framework of pattern recognition systems. Its aim is in dealing with knowledge representation issues in pattern recognition. In our approach, everything works in an entirely autonomous and decentralized manner. Even a search procedure for sample-concept matching is distributed onto every concept object itself by being implemented in what we introduced as the recursive agent-blackboard model. We developed an experimental prototype of character recognition systems in Smalltalk-80, which proved the ability of the object-oriented framework and the cooperative search procedure.
