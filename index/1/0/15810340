The world around us changes constantly. Knowing what has changed is an important part of our lives. For businesses, recognizing changes is also crucial. It allows businesses to adapt themselves to the changing market needs. In this paper, we study changes of association rules from one time period to another. One approach is to compare the supports and/or confidences of each rule in the two time periods and report the differences. This technique, however, is too simplistic as it tends to report a huge number of rule changes, and many of them are, in fact, simply the snowball effect of a small subset of fundamental changes. Here, we present a technique to highlight the small subset of fundamental changes. A change is fundamental if it cannot be explained by some other changes. The proposed technique has been applied to a number of real-life datasets. Experiments results show that the number of rules whose changes are unexplainable is quite small (about 20% of the total number of changes discovered), and many of these unexplainable changes reflect some fundamental shifts in the application domain.
