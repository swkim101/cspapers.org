We prove that any one-pass streaming algorithm which (ε, Δ)-approximates the <i>k</i>th frequency moment <i>F</i><inf><i>k</i></inf>, for any real <i>k</i> ≠ 1 and any ε = Ω(1/√m), must use Ω(1/ε²) bits of space, where <i>m</i> is the size of the universe. This is optimal in terms of ε, resolves the open questions of Bar-Yossef <i>et al</i> in [3, 4], and extends the Ω(1/ε²) lower bound for <i>F</i><inf>0</inf> in [11] to much smaller ε by applying novel techniques. Along the way we lower bound the one-way communication complexity of approximating the Hamming distance and the number of bipartite graphs with minimum/maximum degree constraints.
