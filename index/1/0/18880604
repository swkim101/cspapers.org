This paper proposes an approach for computing a sequence of finger repositioning that allows a 4-fingered hand to switch from one grasping configuration to another while maintaining a force-closure grasp of a polygon during the entire process. Assuming frictional point contacts, the proposed approach is based on exploring a structure called switching graph. The connectivity of this structure captures ability to switch from one grasp to another and allows regrasp planning to be formulated as a graph search. The proposed approach has been implemented and some preliminary results are presented.
