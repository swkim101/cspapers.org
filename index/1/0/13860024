Hurricane evacuation is a complex process and a better understanding of the evacuation behavior of the coastal residents could be helpful in planning better evacuation policy. Traditionally, various aspects of the household evacuation decisions have been determined by post-evacuation questionnaire surveys, which are usually time-consuming and expensive. Increased activity of users on social media, especially during emergencies, along with the geo-tagging of the posts, provides an opportunity to gain insights into user's decision-making process, as well as to gauge public opinion and activities using the social media data as a supplement to the traditional survey data. This paper leverages the geo-tagged Tweets posted in the New York City (NYC) in wake of Hurricane Sandy to understand the evacuation behavior of the residents. Based on the geo-tagged Tweet locations, we classify the NYC Twitter users into one of the three categories: outside evacuation zone, evacuees, and non-evacuees and examine the types of Tweets posted by each group during different phases of the hurricane. We establish a strong link between the social connectivity with the decision of the users to evacuate or stay. We analyze the geo-tagged Tweets to understand evacuation and return time and evacuation location patterns of evacuees. The analysis presented in this paper could be useful for authorities to plan a better evacuation campaign to minimize the risk to the life of the residents of the emergency hit areas.
