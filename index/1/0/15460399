We present a system utilizing narrow band software defined radio to detect the moving human through walls, and give some motion details, such as motion orientation which includes relative moving direction. To achieve high accuracy, FindIt applies Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and statistical methods to received signals. In order to adapt to different environments, FindIt uses clustering and classification methods to determine thresholds. Moreover, FindIt provides user-friendly real-time detection results, which can be used as a trigger of high-level functions.
