In this work we describe a new method that adjusts time-delays and the widths of time-windows in artificial neural networks automatically. The input of the units are weighted by a gaussian input-window over time which allows the learning rules for the delays and widths to be derived in the same way as it is used for the weights. Our results on a phoneme classification task compare well with results obtained with the TDNN by Waibel et al., which was manually optimized for the same task.
