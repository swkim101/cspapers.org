The descriptors or categories assigned to entries in an information system form the basis of most retrieval mechanisms (e.g., menu or key word). These descriptors are the primary means of communication between system designers and end users. In this paper we analyze some of the factors which influence this communication link. Our goal is to uncover some psychological principles that will help us to understand naming and describing behavior and thus improve the communication between designers and users.
 In traditional communication (e.g., conversation) the communicator can accommodate to different listeners, both by shifting perspective and by attending to explicit feedback from the listener. In describing items in a data base, however, system designers are at a disadvantage in that they do not usually get explicit, immediate, and continuous feedback from users. Knowing how people describe common objects and shift their descriptions for audiences of different levels of sophistication may help designers build systems whose information is accessible to the widest possible audience.
