In XML retrieval, nodes with different tags play different roles in XML documents and then tags should be reflected in the relevance ranking. An automatic method is proposed in this paper to infer the weights of tags. We first investigate 15 features about tags, and then select five of them based on the correlations between these features and manual tag weights. Using these features, a tag weight assignment model, ATG, is designed. We evaluate the performance of ATG on two real data sets, IEEECS and Wikipedia from two different perspectives. One is to evaluate the quality of the model by measuring the correlation between weights generated by our model and those given by experts. The other is to test the effectiveness of the model in improving retrieval performance. Experimental results show that the tag weights generated by ATG are highly correlated with the manually assigned weights and the ATG model improves retrieval effectiveness significantly.
