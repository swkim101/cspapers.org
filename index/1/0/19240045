However, most existing methods for this task focus only on monolingual clues of a specific language and ignore the massive information provided by other languages. Data scarcity and monolingual ambiguity hinder the performance of these monolingual approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel multilingual approach---dubbed as Gated Multilingual Attention (GMLATT) framework---to address the two issues simultaneously. In specific, to alleviate data scarcity problem, we exploit the consistent information in multilingual data via context attention mechanism. Which takes advantage of the consistent evidence in multilingual data other than learning only from monolingual data. To deal with monolingual ambiguity problem, we propose gated cross-lingual attention to exploit the complement information conveyed by multilingual data, which is helpful for the disambiguation. The cross-lingual attention gate serves as a sentinel modelling the confidence of the clues provided by other languages and controls the information integration of various languages. We have conducted extensive experiments on the ACE 2005 benchmark. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
