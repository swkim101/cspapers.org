Forensic analysts typically require access to application-layer information gathered over long periods of time to completely investigate network security incidents. Unfortunately, storing longitudinal network data is often at odds with maintaining detailed payload information due to the overhead associated with storing and querying such data. Thus, the analyst is left to choose between coarse information about long-term network activities or brief glimpses of detailed attack activity. In this paper, we take the first steps toward a storage framework for network payload information that provides a better balance between these two extremes. We take advantage of the redundancy found in network data to aggregate payload information into flexible and efficiently compressible data objects that are associated with network flows. To enable interactive querying, we introduce a hierarchical indexing structure for both the flow and payload information, which allows us to quickly prune irrelevant data and answer queries directly from the indexing information. Our empirical results on data collected from a campus network show that our approach can significantly reduce the volume of the stored data, while simultaneously preserving the ability to perform detailed queries with response times on the order of seconds.
