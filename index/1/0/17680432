This paper presents a Bayesian decision framework that performs automatic story segmentation based on statistical modeling of one or more lexical chain features. Automatic story segmentation aims to locate the instances in time where a story ends and another begins. A lexical chain is formed by linking coherent lexical items chronologically. A story boundary is often associated with a significant number of lexical chains ending before it, starting after it, as well as a low count of chains continuing through it. We devise a Bayesian framework to capture such behavior, using the lexical chain features of start, continuation and end. In the scoring criteria, lexical chain starts/ends are modeled statistically with the Weibull and uniform distributions at story boundaries and non-boundaries respectively. The normal distribution is used for lexical chain continuations. Full combination of all lexical chain features gave the best performance (F1=0.6356). We found that modeling chain continuations contributes significantly towards segmentation performance.
