In this paper, we propose a novel analytical method, called scheduling time bound analysis, to find a tight upper bound of the worst-case response time in a distributed real-time embedded system, considering execution time variations of tasks, jitter of input arrivals, and scheduling anomaly behavior in a multi-tasking system all together. By analyzing the graph topology and worst-case scheduling scenarios, we measure the conservative scheduling time bound of each task. The proposed method supports an arbitrary mixture of preemptive and non-preemptive processing elements. Its speed is comparable to compositional approaches while it gives a much tighter bound. The advantages of the proposed approach compared with related work were verified by experimental results with randomly generated task graphs and a real-life automotive application.
