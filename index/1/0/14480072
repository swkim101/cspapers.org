The results of an investigation of the relationship between software structure, hardware interconnect structure, and the performance of decentralized computer systems are presented in this paper. Programs written in a language that has the salient features of most languages suggested for decentralized software were analyzed using trace-driven simulation. Results indicate that reasonable performance may be obtained at relatively low bandwidths using typical decentralized interconnect structures. Additional results provide insight into the use of hardware interconnect structures by decentralized software.
