This session is intended as a fun and highly interactive way for college and high school teachers to increase their familiarity with the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. Using a quiz show format, participants will be asked to provide solutions to knotty (and sometimes humorous) ethical challenges. This will be followed by think-pair-share (so that everyone gets involved), and then a presentation of the relevant sections of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. Members of the ACM's Committee on Professional Ethics will be on hand to collect feedback and questions about the Code, for use by the Code 2018 task force, and for the "Ask an Ethicist" feature at http://ethics.acm.org.
