In this paper, we propose an extended logic programming based formalization for a multi-agent system in mobile environments. Such a system consists of a number of agents connected via wire or wireless communication channels. Our formalization is knowledge oriented and has declarative semantics inherited from extended logic programming. This model can be used to study the details of knowledge transaction in mobile environments.
