Trends such as the increasing adoption of smartphones, the development of the service-oriented internet, and diffusion of sensing technologies into cities have the potential to combine in order to form a ubiquitous computing infrastructure. At the same time, as the computer diffuses into the physical world, it loses its location-neutrality, exposing the urgent need for a debate of design choices in ubiquitous computing. In this paper, we discuss the process of urban development as a source of inspiration for such design choices. Looking from the ground up, of particular interest is the opportunity to localize and democratize an emerging ubiquitous computing infrastructure. The design choices we negotiate today will determine the society in which we will live in the future.
