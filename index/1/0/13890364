We have developed a foveated gesture recognition system that runs in an unconstrained office environment with an active camera. Using vision routines previously implemented for an interactive environment, we determine the spatial location of salient body parts of a user and guide an active camera to obtain images of gestures or expressions. A hidden-state reinforcement learning paradigm is used to implement visual attention. The attention module selects targets to foveate based on the goal of successful recognition, and uses a new multiple-model Q-learning formulation. Given a set of target and distractor gestures, our system can learn where to foveate to maximally discriminate a particular gesture.
