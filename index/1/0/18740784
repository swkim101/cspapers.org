We show that a black-box construction of a pseudorandom generator from a one-way function needs to make Î©(n/log(n)) calls to the underlying one-way function. The bound even holds if the one-way function is guaranteed to be regular. In this case it matches the best known construction due to Gold Reich, Krawczyk, and Luby (SIAM J. Comp. 22, 1993), which uses O(n/log(n)) calls.
