We show that for every fixed k, there is a linear time algorithm that decides whether or not a given graph has crossing number at most k, and if this is the case, computes a drawing of the graph in the plane with at most k crossings. This answers the question posed by Grohe (STOC'01 and JCSS 2004). Our algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of the seminal result by Hopcroft and Tarjan lin1, which determines if a given graph is planar in linear time.
 Our algorithm can also be compared to the algorithms by Mohar (STOC'96 and Siam J. Discrete Math 2001), for testing the embeddability of an input graph in a fixed surface. For each surface s, Mohar describes an algorithm which yields either an embedding of G in s or a minor of G which is not embeddable in s and is minimal with this property.
 The same approach allows us to obtain linear time algorithms for the same question for a variety of other crossing numbers. We can also determine in linear time if an input graph can be made planar by the deletion of k edges (for fixed k).
