We carried out a study on monolingual translators with no knowledge of the source language, but aided by post-editing and the display of translation options. On Arabic-English and Chinese-English, using standard test data and current statistical machine translation systems, 10 monolingual translators were able to translate 35% of Arabic and 28% of Chinese sentences correctly on average, with some of the participants coming close to professional bilingual performance on some of the documents.
