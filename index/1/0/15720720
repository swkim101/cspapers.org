Recurrent Cascade-Correlation (RCC) is a recurrent version of the Cascade-Correlation learning architecture of Fahlman and Lebiere [Fahlman, 1990]. RCC can learn from examples to map a sequence of inputs into a desired sequence of outputs. New hidden units with recurrent connections are added to the network as needed during training. In effect, the network builds up a finite-state machine tailored specifically for the current problem. RCC retains the advantages of Cascade-Correlation: fast learning, good generalization, automatic construction of a near-minimal multi-layered network, and incremental training.
