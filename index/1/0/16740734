We present a simple estimator for the number of perfect matchings in a general (non-bipartite) graph. Our estimator requires <i>O</i>(ε<sup>-2</sup>3<sup><i>n</i>/2</sup>) trials to obtain a (1 ± ε)-approximation of the correct value with high probability on a graph with 2<i>n</i> vertices in the worst case, and only a polynomial number <i>(O</i>(ε<sup>-2</sup><i>nω(n))</i> of trials on random graphs, where <i>ω(n)</i> is any function tending to infinity.Our algorithm is based on the following idea: For any graph <i>G</i>, construct its associated Tutte matrix <i>T</i>, and derive a random matrix <i>B</i> from it by replacing each variable in <i>T</i> with ±1 uniformly at random; then output det <i>B</i>. This estimator is a natural generalization of the Godsil--Gutman estimator for matchings in a bipartite graph, and our analysis of its performance on random graphs borrows generously from Frieze and Jerrum's analysis of a similar estimator for bipartite graphs.
