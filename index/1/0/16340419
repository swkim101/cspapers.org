The adoption of adequate tools, oriented towards the End User Development (EUD), can promote mobile mashups as "democratic" tools, able to accommodate the long tail of users' specific needs. We introduce MobiMash, a novel approach and a platform for the construction of mobile mashups, characterized by a lightweight composition paradigm, mainly guided by the notion of visual templates. The composition paradigm generates an application schema that is based on a domain specific language addressing dimensions for data integration and service orchestration, and that guides at run- time the dynamic instantiation of the final mobile app.
