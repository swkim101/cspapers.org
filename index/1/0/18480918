Reading and Commenting online news is becoming a common user behavior in social media. Discussion in the form of comments following news postings can be effectively facilitated if the service provider can recommend articles based on not only the original news itself but also the thread of changing comments. This turns the traditional news recommendation to a "discussion moderator" that can intelligently assist online forums. In this work, we present a framework to recommend relevant information in the forum-based social media using user comments. When incorporating user comments, we consider structural and semantic information carried by them. Experiments indicate that our proposed solutions provide an effective recommendation service.
