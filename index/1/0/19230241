It learns low-dimensional vector representation for each vertex in networks. Existing network representation methods only focus on incomplete aspects of vertex information (i.e., vertex content, network structure or partial integration), moreover they are commonly designed for homogeneous information networks where all the vertices of a network are of the same type. In this paper, we propose a deep network representation model that integrates network structure and the vertex content information into a unified framework by exploiting generative adversarial network, and represents different types of vertices in the heterogeneous network in a continuous and common vector space. Based on the proposed model, we can obtain heterogeneous bibliographic network representation for efficient citation recommendation. The proposed model also makes personalized citation recommendation possible, which is a new issue that a few papers addressed in the past. When evaluated on the AAN and DBLP datasets, the performance of the proposed heterogeneous bibliographic network based citation recommendation approach is comparable with that of the other network representation based citation recommendation approaches. The results also demonstrate that the personalized citation recommendation approach is more effective than the non-personalized citation recommendation approach.
