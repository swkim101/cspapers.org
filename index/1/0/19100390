Such methods, performing classification at the bag level, cannot identify the mapping between a relation and a sentence, and largely suffers from the noisy labeling problem. In this paper, we propose a novel model for relation classification at the sentence level from noisy data. The model has two modules: an instance selector and a relation classifier. The instance selector chooses high-quality sentences with reinforcement learning and feeds the selected sentences into the relation classifier, and the relation classifier makes sentence-level prediction and provides rewards to the instance selector. The two modules are trained jointly to optimize the instance selection and relation classification processes.Experiment results show that our model can deal with the noise of data effectively and obtains better performance for relation classification at the sentence level.
