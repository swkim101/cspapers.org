This research focuses on using frameworks, model-driven development, and aspect-oriented software development techniques to address key configuration and deployment concerns of component-based distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems. System designers and deployers can use these techniques to configure quality of service (QoS) aspects of their systems and fine-tune their systems during the design and runtime phases to ensure their systems meet end-to-end performance requirements.
