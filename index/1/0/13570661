We present a new family of hybrid transitive closure algorithms, and present experimental results showing that these algorithms perform better than existing transitive closure algorithms, includmg matrix-based algorithms that divide a matrix into stripes or into square blocks, and graph-based algmtihms. This family of algorithms can be generalized to solve path problems and to solve problems in which some selection criteria have been specified for source or destination nodes.
