We consider the implementation of generalized doubled-ended queues. The generalized data structure, which is denoted as mindeque, allows the standard deque operations and also the additional operations of catenation and findmin. We first present a simple RAM algorithm that achieves an amortized O(1) RAM steps per mindeque operation. We then develop a more complex RAM algorithm that performs worst case O(1) steps per mindeque operation, solving an open problem posed by Buchsbaum, et al. We also develop a simple accounting procedure for establishing that bottom-up insert, delete and join operations on balanced binary trees have an 0( 1) amortized speed.
