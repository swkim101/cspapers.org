Pseudo relevance feedback method is an effective method for query model refinement. Most existing pseudo relevance feedback methods only take into consideration the term distribution of the feedback documents, but omit the term's context information. This paper presents a graph-based method to improve query models, in which a word graph is constructed to encode terms and their co-occurrence dependencies within the feedback documents. Using a random walk, the weight of each term in the graph can be determined in a context-dependent manner, i.e. the weight of a term is strongly dependent on the weights of the connected context terms. Our experimental results on four TREC collections show that our proposed approach is more effective than the existing state-of-the-art approaches.
