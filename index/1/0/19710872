Emerging Resistive Memory (ReRAM) is a promising candidate as the replacement for DRAM because of its low power consumption, high density and high endurance. Due to the unique crossbar structure, ReRAM can be constructed with a very high density. However, ReRAM's crossbar structure causes an IR drop problem which results in non-uniform access latency in ReRAM banks and reduces its reliability. Besides, the access latency and reliability of ReRAM arrays are greatly influenced by the data patterns involved in a write operation. In this paper, we propose a performance and reliability efficient ReRAM-based main memory structure. At the circuit level, we propose a double-sided write driver design to reduce the IR drops along bitlines. At the architecture level, a region partition with address remapping method and two flip schemes are proposed to reduce the access latency and improve the reliability of ReRAM arrays. The experimental results show that the proposed design can improve the system performance by 30.3% on average and reduce the memory access latency by 25.9% on average over an aggressive baseline, meanwhile the design improves the reliability of ReRAM-based memory system.
