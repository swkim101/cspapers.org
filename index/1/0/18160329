Taxonomies embody formalized knowledge and define aggregations between concepts/categories in a given domain, facilitating the organization of the data and making the contents easily accessible to the users. Since taxonomies have significant roles in the data annotation, search and navigation, they are often carefully engineered. However, especially in very dynamic content, they do not necessarily reflect the content knowledge. Thus, in this paper, we propose A Narrative Interpretation of Taxonomies for their Adaptation (ANITA) for re-structuring existing taxonomies to varying application contexts and we evaluate the proposed scheme by user studies that show that the proposed algorithm is able to adapt the taxonomy in a new compact and understandable structure from a human point of view.
