A "generalized" channel router operates on horizontal and vertical channels generated from an irregular cell structure, and is free of a routing grid. Such a router can solve virtually any routing problem. It has two major phases: the global routing phase and the channel routing phase. This paper describes both phases as they have been implemented at TI. It concludes with a demonstration of the versatility of the router (it is used to solve the Hampton Court Maze) and with applications of the router in TI's I2L (Integrated Injector Logic) / STL (Schottky Transistor Logic) Automatic Layout System.
