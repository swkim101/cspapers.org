Model Driven Architecture (MDA) design approach proposes to separate design into two stages: implementation independent stage then an implementation-dependent one. This improves the reusability, the reusability, the standability, the maintainability, etc. Here we show how MDA can be augmented using a formal refinement approach: B method. Doing so enables to gradually refine the development from the abstract specification to the executing implementation; furthermore it permits to prove the coherence between components in low levels even if they are implemented in different technologies.
