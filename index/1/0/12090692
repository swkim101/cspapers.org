This paper provides an approach to test nonlinear functions in computer programs, whether this function is used for control flow, such as a predicate inequality or equality constraint, or is given as an input-output relationship. This approach will obtain test data to detect linear errors in the given nonlinear function. An error-space criterion previously given by Zeil will be utilized, and a necessary and sufficient condition for the test data will be specified to guarantee the satisfaction of this criterion. This leads to a simple and efficient method to select test data which satisfies that condition; only (n+2) tests are required, where n is the number of input variables. An analysis will be given to show that this simple approach can be very effective in detecting nonlinear errors as well.
