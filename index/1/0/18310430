The effect of some restrictions on W-grammars (the formalization of the syntax of ALGOL 68) are explored. Two incomparable families examined at length are W<subscrpt>RB</subscrpt> (languages generated by normal regular-based W-grammars) and W<subscrpt>S</subscrpt> (languages generated by simple W-grammars). Both properly contain the context-free languages and are properly contained in the family of quasirealtime languages. In addition, W<subscrpt>RB</subscrpt> is closed under nested iterated substitution (but is not an AFL) and is properly contained in the family of indexed languages.
