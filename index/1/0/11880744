This work is devoted to the study of the typical structure of a random map. Maps are planar graphs embedded in the plane. We investigate the degree sequences of random maps from families of a certain type, which, among others, includes fundamental map classes like those of biconnected maps, 3-connected maps, and triangulations. In particular, we develop a general framework that allows us to derive relations and exact asymptotic expressions for the expected number of vertices of degree k in random maps from these classes, and also provide accompanying large deviation statements. Extending the work of Gao and Wormald (Combinatorica, 2003) on random general maps, we obtain as results of our framework precise information about the number of vertices of degree k in random biconnected, 3-connected, loopless, and bridgeless maps.
