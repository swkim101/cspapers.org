In this paper, we propose a machine learning al-gorithm for shallow semantic parsing, extending the work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), Surdeanu et al. (2003) and others. Our al-gorithm is based on Support Vector Machines which we show give an improvement in performance over earlier classiÔ¨Åers. We show performance improvements through a number of new features and measure their ability to generalize to a new test set drawn from the AQUAINT corpus.
