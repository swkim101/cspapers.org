It has been previously noted that optimization of the <i>n</i>-call@<i>k</i> relevance objective (i.e., a set-based objective that is 1 if at least <i>n</i> documents in a set of <i>k</i> are relevant, otherwise 0) encourages more result set diversification for smaller <i>n</i>, but this statement has never been formally quantified. In this work, we explicitly derive the mathematical relationship between <i>expected n-call@k</i> and the <i>relevance vs. diversity trade-off</i> --- through fortuitous cancellations in the resulting combinatorial optimization, we show the trade-off is a simple and intuitive function of <i>n</i> (notably independent of the result set size <i>k</i> e <i>n</i>), where diversification increases as <i>n</i> approaches 1.
