An important aspect of robotic path planning for is ensuring that the vehicle is in the best location to collect the data necessary for the problem at hand. Given that features of interest are dynamic and move with oceanic currents, vehicle speed is an important factor in any planning exercises to ensure vehicles are at the right place at the right time. Here, we examine different Gaussian process models to find a suitable predictive kinematic model that enable the speed of an underactuated, autonomous surface vehicle to be accurately predicted given a set of input environmental parameters.
