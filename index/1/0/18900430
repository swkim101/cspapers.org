In this paper, I describe an AI laboratory assignment in which students implement standard search techniques and explore heuristic measures of their own design for a palindrome discovery system. The system successfully derives palindromic sequences of words, many of which are meaningful, and achieves what is to the author's knowledge the first automatic generation of palindromes. Code is made available to students which implements the state space for palindrome search. This makes a large-scale problem accessible to introductory AI students by harnessing their knowledge of natural language. Students were motivated by the intrigue of discovering new palindromes.
