Introduction I originally titled my talk “Pasta’s Revenge”, with the intention of discussing the scalability of ambitious projects written in object oriented languages. In particular I wanted to discuss the pitfalls I observed in a probably typical huge project, and ways to avoid them. Such a high level talk, I was persuaded, would be less useful than a very detailed talk of lesser scope. This paper is therefore concerned with one aspect of large scale systems: the construction of editors for large numbers of domain objects, query definition objects, report cordiguration objects, and user preference objects.
