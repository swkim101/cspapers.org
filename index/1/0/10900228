In this paper we explore the use of 3D acoustic flow fields to steer robot motion. We derive the 3D velocity fields set up by linear and rotational robot motions and explain how they can be sampled directly by a sonar array-sensor that we developed recently. The resulting acoustic flow field patterns are then shown to contain all the information necessary for controlling obstacle avoidance and corridor following behavior. Experimental data collected by the sonar system mounted on a wheelchair that was driven in an office environment are presented to validate the theoretically predicted acoustic flow patterns.
