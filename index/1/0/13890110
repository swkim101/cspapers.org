Multitask learning addresses the problem of learning related tasks that presumably share some commonalities on their input-output mapping functions. Previous approaches to multitask learning usually deal with homogeneous tasks, such as purely regression tasks, or entirely classification tasks. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning multiple related tasks of predicting both continuous and discrete outputs from a common set of input variables that lie in a high-dimensional feature space. All of the tasks are related in the sense that they share the same set of relevant input variables, but the amount of influence of each input on different outputs may vary. We formulate this problem as a combination of linear regressions and logistic regressions, and model the joint sparsity as L1/Lâˆž or L1/L2 norm of the model parameters. Among several possible applications, our approach addresses an important open problem in genetic association mapping, where the goal is to discover genetic markers that influence multiple correlated traits jointly. In our experiments, we demonstrate our method in this setting, using simulated and clinical asthma datasets, and we show that our method can effectively recover the relevant inputs with respect to all of the tasks.
