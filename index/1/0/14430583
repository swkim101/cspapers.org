We describe work on developing workshop activities that are part of wConnect, a project that is building an online community of women in computer and information science. The workshops are designed by college women for high school girls, with hands-on construction of dynamic web sites. Because of limited workshop time, the activities use scaffolding to help girls achieve the in-tended learning objectives. In this paper we describe the design of the activities, their formative evaluation in a series of four work-shops, and how we are using these results in the larger project.
