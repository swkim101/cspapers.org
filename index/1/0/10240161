We present a large-margin formulation and algorithm for structured output prediction that allows the use of latent variables. Our proposal covers a large range of application problems, with an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently using Concave-Convex Programming. The generality and performance of the approach is demonstrated through three applications including motiffinding, noun-phrase coreference resolution, and optimizing precision at k in information retrieval.
