Basically, there are two approaches to testing digital networks, namely, functional and structural. There are few available publications dealing with functional testing methods. This is due mainly to the lack of a universal algorithm for testing networks that function differently. Moreover, functional testing usually does not yield a complete test of a given network, therefore it does not have as much academic value as structural testing.
 In this paper a few functional testing techniques are briefly described. They are heuristic methods used in the computer industry mainly for trouble-shooting purposes. Structural testing has recently been summarized by Professor Susskind. It is the purpose of this paper to show recent testing techniques and to indicate the need for inclusion of self-testing capabilities to chips during the fabrication process.
