In this aper we investigate the Church-Rosser property (CRY for Pure Type Systems with Pq-reduction. For Pure Type Systems with only @-reduction, CR on well typed terms follows immediately from CR on the so called ’pseudoterms’ and subject reduction. For pqreduction, CR on the set of pseudoterms is just false, as was shown by [Nederpelt 19731. Here we prove that CR (for pq) on the well-typed terms of a fixed type holds, which is the maximum we can expect in view of Nederpelts counterexample. The proof is given for a large class of Pure Type systems that contains e.g. LF (for which CR for q was proved by [Salvesen 19891 and [Coquand 1991$, F, Fw and the Calculus of Constructions. In the proof, one key lemma (a very weak form of CR for pq on pseudoterms) takes a central position. It is remarkable that in the proof of this key lemma the counterexample to CR for pq is essentially used.
