We present a metadata free system for the interaction with massive collections of music, the MusicSurfer. MusicSurfer automatically extracts descriptions related to instrumentation, rhythm and harmony from music audio signals. Together with efficient similarity metrics, the descriptions allow navigation of multimillion track music collections in a flexible and efficient way without the need of metadata or human ratings.
