This paper studies credit allocation schemes for quality-class oriented services based on the 3GPP policy and charging control (PCC) architecture. According to users' preference for the service quality, three credit allocation schemes, Minimum Credit First (MCF), Average Quality First (AQF) and Best Quality First (BQF), are proposed and investigated. Specifically, we study the expected number of sessions (nc) supported and the expected lifetime (Tc) of an online charging account for each scheme. The above performance metrics provide useful information to operators for online account management.
