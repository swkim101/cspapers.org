This paper covers the use of Java and its API for developing networking programs in an undergraduate computer networks class. Through the use of TCP and UDP sockets provided in the java.net package, students are able to write several client-server applications such as web and mail servers and a chat room. Additionally, the java.rmi API provides a library for invoking methods on remote objects, similar to remote procedure calls. Remote method invocation (RMI) is used to write a distributed version of the Producer-Consumer problem.
