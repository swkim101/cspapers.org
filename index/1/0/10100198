Quote is a language phenomenon of transcribing the saying of someone else. Proper usage of quote can usually make the statement more elegant and convincing. However, the ability of quote usage is usually limited by the amount of quotes one remembers or knows. Quote recommendation is a task of exploiting abundant quote repositories to help people make better use of quotes while writing. The task is different from conventional recommendation tasks due to the characteristic of quote. A pilot study has explored this task by using a learning to rank framework and manually designed features. However, it is still hard to model the meaning of a quote, which is an interesting and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a neural network approach based on LSTMs to the quote recommendation task. We directly learn the distributed meaning representations for the contexts and the quotes, and then measure the relevance based on the meaning representations. In particular, we try to represent the words in quotes with specific embeddings, according to the contexts, topics and even author preferences of the quotes. Experimental results on a large dataset show that our proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance and it outperforms several strong baselines.
