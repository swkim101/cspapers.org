Bumptrees are geometric data structures introduced by Omohundro (1991) to provide efficient access to a collection of functions on a Euclidean space of interest. We describe a modified bumptree structure that has been employed as a neural network classifier, and compare its performance on several classification tasks against that of radial basis function networks and the standard mutli-layer perceptron.
