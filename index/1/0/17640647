In this paper, we describe a fixed-threshold sequential minimal optimization (FSMO) for a joint constraint learning algorithm of structural classification SVM problems. Because FSMO uses the fact that the joint constraint formulation of structural SVM has b=0, FSMO breaks down the quadratic programming (QP) problems of structural SVM into a series of smallest QP problems, each involving only one variable. By using only one variable, FSMO is advantageous in that each QP sub-problem does not need subset selection.
