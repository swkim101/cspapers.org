A novel approach for the design of magnetically-propelled microrobots is proposed as an effective solution for swimming in a liquid medium. While intrinsic neutral buoyancy of a microrobot per se simplifies propulsion in the liquid environments, softness makes it compliant with delicate environments, such as the human body, thus guaranteeing a safe interaction with soft structures. With this aim, two groups of soft microrobots with paramagnetic and ferromagnetic behaviors were designed, fabricated and their features were experimentally analyzed. In agreement with the theoretical predictions, in the performed trials the ferromagnetic microrobots showed orientation capabilities in response to the magnetic field that could not be achieved by the paramagnetic one. Moreover, it was observed that the ferromagnetic microrobot could reach higher speed values (maximum value of 0.73 body length/s) than the paramagnetic prototype.
