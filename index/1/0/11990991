We investigate the use of multiword query features to improve the eeectiveness of text-retrieval systems that accept natural-language queries. A relevance feedback process is explained that expands an initial query with single and multiword features. The multiword features are modelled as a set of words appearing within windows of varying sizes. Our experimental results suggest that windows of larger span yield improvements in retrieval over windows of smaller span. This result gives rise to a query contraction process that prunes 25% of the features in an expanded query with no loss in retrieval eeectiveness.
