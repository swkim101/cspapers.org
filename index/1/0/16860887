Spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model used simple spring mass mechanism to explain leg function and ground reaction force in legged locomotion. Balancing the upper body can be addressed by addition of a rigid trunk to this template model. The resulting model is not conservative and needs hip torque to keep the trunk upright during locomotion, like humans. Leg force modulated compliant hip (FMCH) is our new model for postural control in walking which employs the leg force feedback to adjust the hip compliance. Such an application of positive force feedback presents a new template for neuromuscular model. This method provides stable and robust walking in simulations and also mimics human-like kinetic behavior. Analyzing human walking experiment shows that FMCH can explain the hip torque-angle relation for different walking speeds. Finally, this approach may physically implement the virtual pendulum (VP) concept, observed in human/animal locomotion.
