We present a simulation-based method for combinational design verification that aims at complete coverage of specified design errors using conventional ATPG tools. The error models used in prior research are examined and reduced to four types: gate substitution errors (GSEs), gate count errors (GCEs), input count errors (ICEs), and wrong input errors (WIEs). Conditions are derived for a gate to be completely testable for GSEs. These conditions lend to small rest sets for GSEs. Near-minimal test sets are also derived for GCEs. We analyze redundancy in design errors and relate this to single stuck-line (SSL) redundancy. We show how to map all the foregoing error types into SSL faults, and describe an extensive set of experiments to evaluate the proposed method. Our experiments demonstrate that high coverage of the modeled design errors can be achieved with small test sets.
