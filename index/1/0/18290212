OdeFS is a file-like interface to the Ode objectoriented database. OdeFS allows database objects to be accessed and manipulated with standard commands, just like files in a traditional file system. No recompilation is required, so proprietary applications can access Ode objects. OdeFS is implemented as a network file server, using the NFS protocol. This paper describes OdeFS and its implementation.
