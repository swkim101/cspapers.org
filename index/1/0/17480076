Essential to any multi-process computer system is some mechanism to enable coexisting processes to communicate with one another. The basic inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism is the exchange of messages among independent processes in a commonly accessible data base and in accordance with some pre-arranged convention.By introducing several system wide conventions for initiating communication, and by utilizing the Traffic Controller it is possible to expand the basic IPC mechanism into a general purpose IPC facility. The Multics IPC facility is an extension of the central supervisor which assumes the burden of managing the shared data base and of respecting the IPC conventions, thus providing a simple and easy way for the programmer to use the interface.
