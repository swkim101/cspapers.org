We have developed the TextEvaluator system for providing text complexity and Common Core-aligned readability information. Detailed text complexity information is provided by eight component scores, presented in such a way as to aid in the userâ€™s understanding of the overall readability metric, which is provided as a holistic score on a scale of 100 to 2000. The user may select a targeted US grade level and receive additional analysis relative to it. This and other capabilities are accessible via a feature-rich front-end, located at http://texteval-pilot.ets.org/TextEvaluator/.
