The explicit finite element method for dynamic structural analysis can be expressed in a highly parallel form. A proposed architecture is described that addresses the fundamental algorithmic issues of the method. An approximation equation for the efficiency is given as a function of processing time for a single element, the fundamental interprocessor communication time, the number of processors, and the number of finite elements. The predicted speedups are plotted against postulated parallel processor speedup bounds, and are shown to be much closer to the upper (linear) bound than to the lower bounds of Amdahl and Minsky.
