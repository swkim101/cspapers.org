LOTOS is an executable specification language for protocols and services currently being standardized within ISO. It is based on an extended version of Milner's Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) and ACT ONE Abstract Data Type formalism. After a brief introduction to LOTOS, we give here an account of a prototype LOTOS interpreter, which includes an interactive system that allows the user to direct the execution of a specification. The interpreter was implemented in YACC/LEX, C, and Prolog. The discussion includes the following topics: syntax and static semantics analysis; translation from LOTOS external format to internal representation; evaluation of Abstract Data Type value expressions and CCS* clauses.
