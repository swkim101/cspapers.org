This paper proposes a momentum-based balancing controller for robots which have non-rigid contacts with their environments. This controller regulates both linear momentum and angular momentum about the center of mass of the robot by controlling the contact forces. Compliant contact models are used to determine the contact forces at the contact points. Simulation results show the performance of the controller on a four-link planar robot standing on various compliant surfaces while unknown external forces in different directions are acting on the center of mass of the robot.
