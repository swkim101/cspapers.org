This paper discusses an experimental integrated design system being developed at Cambridge University, aimed at exposing some principles of good practice in the construction of large ensembles of CAD programs. The paper discusses three aspects of this work: (1) the laying down of the philosophical foundation for the design of the Cad system, (2) system techniques used to implemtnt these fundamental considerations, (3) the pursuit of a number of applications to evaluate the CAD system.
