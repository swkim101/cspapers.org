This work addresses fine-grained image classification. Our work is based on the hypothesis that when dealing with subtle differences among object classes it is critical to identify and only account for a few informative image parts, as the remaining image context may not only be uninformative but may also hurt recognition. This motivates us to formulate our problem as a sequential search for informative parts over a deep feature map produced by a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A state of this search is a set of proposal bounding boxes in the image, whose informativeness is evaluated by the heuristic function (H), and used for generating new candidate states by the successor function (S). The two functions are unified via a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) into a new deep recurrent architecture, called HSnet. Thus, HSnet (i) generates proposals of informative image parts and (ii) fuses all proposals toward final fine-grained recognition. We specify both supervised and weakly supervised training of HSnet depending on the availability of object part annotations. Evaluation on the benchmark Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011 and Cars-196 datasets demonstrate our competitive performance relative to the state of the art.
