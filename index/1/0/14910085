A PLA (Programmable Logic Array) usually uses inverters to complement its output logic. The design can be easily modified using non-inverting buffers if complementary (or, ground true) outputs are needed. In this paper, we explore the tradeoffs in implementing PLAs with/without mixed ground true outputs. An efficient minimization algorithm, namely, PLAYGROUND, is presented. The PLAYGROUND program has been implemented on VAX 8600 in C language. The results of this study indicate that the number of product terms can be further reduced by as much as 50% from the results obtained by the ESPRESSO program when the mixed ground true outputs are used.
