Bubbles in saline solution were controlled by optically induced heating, and made to function as microrobots for micromanipulation and micro-assembly. Using a 980-nm laser, bubble microrobots in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were used to manipulate glass microbeads and cell-laden hydrogel beads. Micro-assembly of glass beads in PBS was also demonstrated. Bubble microrobot actuation in saline solution was demonstrated at velocities of up to 4 mm/s.
