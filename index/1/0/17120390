In this paper, a vision-based stabilization and output tracking control method for a four-rotor helicopter has been proposed. A novel 2 camera method has been described for estimating the full 6 DOF pose of the helicopter. This two camera system is consisting of a pan-tilt ground camera and an onboard camera. The pose estimation algorithm is compared in simulation to other methods (such as four point method, and a stereo method) and is shown to be less sensitive to feature detection errors on the image plane. The proposed pose estimation algorithm and non-linear control techniques have been implemented on a remote controlled quadrotor helicopter.
