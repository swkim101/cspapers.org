Touch surfaces are common devices but they are often uniformly flat and provide little flexibility beyond changing the visual information communicated to the user via software. Furthermore, controls for interaction are not tangible and are usually specified and placed by the user interface designer. Using ForceForm, a dynamically deformable interactive surface, the user is able to directly sculpt the surface to create tangible controls with force feedback properties. These controls can be made according to the user's specifications, and can then be relinquished when no longer needed. We describe this method of interaction, provide an implementation of a slider, and ideas for further controls.
