This video demonstrates the progress of the CityFlyer project. The goal of the project is to develop an autonomous quadrotor helicopter capable of autonomous flight in indoor and outdoor 3D environments such as hallways, stairwells, forests, caves and tunnels. Currently we are focused on developing 3D mapping and navigation capabilities for indoor environments. This video shows our 6 Degree of Freedom pose estimation system, a novel 3D map structure called Multi Volume Occupancy Grids, and the development of a groundstation.
