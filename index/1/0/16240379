In this paper, we introduce the design of Hybot, a botnet which could recover its command and control (C&C) channel in a tolerable delay in case most of critical resources are destroyed. Hybot exploits a hybrid C&C structure, hybrid P2P and URL Flux, to ensure both robustness and effectiveness. Our preliminary results show that the design of Hybot is feasible, consequently posing potential threat for Internet security. The goal of our work is to increase the understanding of advanced botnets which will promote the development of more efficient countermeasures.
