This paper presents collaborative smoothing and mapping (C-SAM) as a viable approach to the multi-robot map- alignment problem. This method enables a team of robots to build joint maps with or without initial knowledge of their relative poses. To accomplish the simultaneous localization and mapping this method uses square root information smoothing (SRIS). In contrast to traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) methods the smoothing does not exclude any information and is therefore also better equipped to deal with non-linear process and measurement models. The method proposed does not require the collaborative robots to have initial correspondence. The key contribution of this work is an optimal smoothing algorithm for merging maps that are created by different robots independently or in groups. The method not only joins maps from different robots, it also recovers the complete robot trajectory for each robot involved in the map joining. It is also shown how data association between duplicate features is done and how this reduces uncertainty in the complete map. Two simulated scenarios are presented where the C-SAM algorithm is applied on two individually created maps. One basically joins two maps resulting in a large map while the other shows a scenario where sensor extension is carried out.
