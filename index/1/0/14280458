DAtahasus have been mandated as the chosen platform to develop automated control systems for enviromne~ts where the state of the system changes rapidly, and actions need to be tAkt~ with tin'ring constraints, such as stock trading, air traffic control, network management and process conlxol to name a few. Such dRt~ses require the amalgamation ofrea/-t/me, act/re and Wnpora/characteristics. These systems have been termed ARCS. In this paper we specify an extensible architecture for ARCS like systems and identify two pmblerns that need special attention.
