We present a novel unsupervised query-focused multi-document summarization approach. To this end, we generate a summary by extracting a subset of sentences using the Cross-Entropy (CE) Method. The proposed approach is generic and requires no domain knowledge. Using an evaluation over DUC 2005-2007 datasets with several other state-of-the-art baseline methods, we demonstrate that, our approach is both effective and efficient.
