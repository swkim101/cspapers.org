The Internet has grown from a small testbed shared by a close-knit community of researchers to a global commercial network with a huge number of users. The change in the scale requires revisiting original assumptions in the Internet design and checking whether they match the reality of today. One such assumption is trust. Conventional protocols for network bandwidth allocation assume that all communicating parties follow guidelines for fair bandwidth sharing. However, a selfish receiver has incentives to acquire data at an unfairly high rate. Furthermore, open-source operating systems create ample opportunities for receiver misbehavior. For example, Savage et al show that a misbehaving TCP receiver can increase its reliable throughput substantially at the expense of competing traffic [6]. Thus, network research faces a new important challenge of robust bandwidth allocation in the presence of distrusted receivers [2]. Multicast is a service for scalable dissemination of data to a group of receivers: a receiver subscribes to the group by submitting the group address to the local edge router, and the network forwards the data to subscribed receivers. Scalable protocols for multicast congestion control require additional mechanisms, e.g., for feedback aggregation or suppression. To address heterogeneity of receivers, multicast protocols compose a session from multiple groups and provide each receiver with guidelines for choosing a fair subscription level in the session [5]. Resolving the multicast-specific challenges of scalability and heterogeneity opens new opportunities for congestion control misbehavior of receivers. In this work, we focus on an attack of inflated subscription where a receiver ignores subscription guidelines to acquire
