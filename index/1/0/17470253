This paper focuses on the estimation of the impedance for a Variable Impedance Actuator (VIA) through torque and position measurements. Despite the recent development of several VIA, impedance control is not yet implemented in closed loop because of the difficulty of obtaining in real-time measurements of time-varying impedance. The estimation algorithm is proposed as an alternative approach to the standard procedures of impedance identification, to robustly tolerate the variability of the mechanical stiffness due, for example, to model uncertainties. The impedance estimator is therefore implemented on the Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness (AwAS). The effectiveness of the proposed estimator is proved through simulation and experimental results.
