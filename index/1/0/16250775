In this paper we present a novel approach for intuitive telemanipulation in Cartesian space and discuss the results of a user study evaluating different aspects of our approach. The proposed method inhibits certain degrees of freedom based on the current viewpoint. Together with automatic mapping of the input device to corresponding motion axes, our approach provides a very intuitive method for controlling the telemanipulation system while reducing the mental workload of the operator and therefore the amount of erroneous commands. Similar principles apply for controlling the viewpoint of real or virtual cameras to facilitate manipulation or navigation tasks.
