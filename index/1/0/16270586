For batch mannf*~-tari~ plant management, both physical process data and product data needs to be handled integratedly. In this paper, the architecture and mechanisms to realize a database system for the batch m~-ufacturing plant management are described in three features. First, the database system is constructed in two layers to integrate data acquisition part and high functional part. As the second feature, to trace a batch or lot which passes through some processes, a flexible data mA,. agement model based on the object-oriented data model and the ECA mechAniMm is presented. For the third feature, collected physical process data and product data are integrated and provided for operators in three views. A prototype system is also introduced with an example of a coffee m~k;n 8 plant. 1 Introduction In recent years, high functional systems for production information management are required. Manufacturing companies need to reduce the production cost, improve the yield-rate and use manufacturing lines effectively. For supporting such activities, production information management systems[5] should collect production data reliably and enable to use the data in various aspects such as recipe management or parameter tuning. In this paper, the architecture and mecbaniRms of a production information management system for batch manufacturing plants are described. To realize production information management systems which enable to use batch manufacturing plants efficiently, we point out and focus on the following three problems and requirements. First, the plant control system and information management system should be connected directly without interfering each other. Data acquisition task requires real-time capability for collecting process values without any loss. On the other hand, data utilization task requires high functionality for providing Pennilion to make digital/hard eopi~ of all or part oflhi~ mala.ial for I~emJ e¢ dmroem ,~-is granted wilhout fee provided that the eopia are not made w di~'lm~ for profit er ~,~-ial advanu~ the copy. right notke, the title ofthe publicatlon and ~ date appar, and naive is given tlmt cm, pyt'ight w by permim tff'tbe ACM.
