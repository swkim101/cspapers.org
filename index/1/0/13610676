In this paper, we develop the switching controller presented by Lee et al. for the pose control of a car-like vehicle, to allow the use of an omnidirectional vision sensor. To this end we incorporate an extension to a hypothesis on the navigation behaviour of the desert ant, cataglyphis bicolor, which leads to a correspondence free landmark based vision technique. The method we present allows positioning to a learnt location based on feature bearing angle and range discrepancies between the robot's current view of the environment, and that at a learnt location. We present simulations and experimental results, the latter obtained using our outdoor mobile platform.
