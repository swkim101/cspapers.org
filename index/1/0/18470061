This paper designs an implementation of the MPI message passing interface using a zero copy message transfer primitive supported by a lower communication layer to realize a high performance communication library. The zero copy message transfer primitive requires a memory area pinned down to physical memory, which is a restricted quantity resource under a paging memory system. Allocation of pinned down memory by multiple simultaneous requests for sending and receiving without any control can cause deadlock. To avoid this deadlock, we have introduced: i) separate of control of send/receive pin-down memory areas to ensure that at least one send and receive may be processed concurrently, and ii) delayed queues to handle the postponed message passing operations which could not be pinned-down.
