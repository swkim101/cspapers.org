The activities of search and rescue of victims in large-scale disasters are very relevant social problems, and from a scientific viewpoint raise many different technical problems in the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics and multi agent systems. In this paper we describe the development of a multi agent system based on the RoboCup Rescue simulator to allow monitoring and decision support, that are needed in a rescue operation. Two significant accomplishments are reported in this paper: the first is a framework for cognitive agent development that provides for the capabilities of information fusion, planning and coordination; the second one is a methodology for evaluation of multi-agent systems in this scenario that aims at measuring not only the efficiency of a system, but also its robustness when conditions in the environment change.
