The approach was inspired by the developmental progression of insertion abilities in both chimpanzees and humans (Hayashi et al. 2006). Before mastering insertions, the infants of the two species undergo a stage where they only press objects against other objects without releasing them. Our goal was to emulate this developmental stage on a robot to see if it may lead to simpler representations for insertion tasks. Experiments were performed using a shapesorter puzzle with three different blocks and holes.
