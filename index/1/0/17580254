Indoor tracking systems will be an essential part of the home of the future, enabling location-aware and individually-tailored services. However, today there are no tracking solutions that are practical for "every day" use in the home. In this paper, we introduce the Doorjamb tracking system that uses ultrasonic range finders mounted above each doorway, pointed downward to sense people as they walk through the doorway. The system differentiates people by measuring their heights, infers their walking direction using signal processing, and identifies their room locations based on the sequence of doorways through which they pass. Doorjamb provides room-level tracking without requiring any user participation, wearable devices, privacy-intrusive sensors, or high-cost sensors. We create a proof-of-concept implementation and empirically evaluate Doorjamb with experiments that include over 3000 manually-recorded doorway crossings. Results indicate that the system can perform room-level tracking with 90% accuracy on average.
