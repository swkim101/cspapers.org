In this paper we propose a novel control approach for robots that are physically coupled with humans, such as exoskeletons and assisting devices. In contrast with the conventional controllers, where assistance is usually provided indifferently of the configuration of the arm and direction of the motion, we propose a control method that compensates the anisotropic property of the manipulability related to the human arm. Consequently, the assistive behaviour of the proposed method allows the user to perform tasks in arm configurations that are otherwise unsuitable due to the lack of manipulability. In effect, the proposed method transforms the elliptic shape of the force manipulability ellipse to a circular shape in the whole space of human arm configurations. The proposed approach was evaluated by the arm-reaching task that involved pushing of a heavy object on a plane. We tested the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method under several conditions that involved motions with added weight and friction. The results of our study show that the proposed approach significantly improves the human motor control ability and maintains the desired accuracy of the movement.
