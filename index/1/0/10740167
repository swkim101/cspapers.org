The artificial potential fields (APF) method is attractive for mobile robot navigation, and solutions to the difficulties of their application are investigated here. The basic problem induced by early convergence in local minima is solved by using a systematic local reshaping of the APF. It enables one to destabilize, and to extract the robot from the local basin of attraction. A theoretical analysis of kinematic and dynamic constraints has led to the use of Speed Dependent APF (SDAPF) for avoidance. This concept allows one to generate a controlled centrifugal force that respects the constraints. Simulation results for data close to sensor capabilities are very satisfactory.
