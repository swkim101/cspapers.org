An integrated system for minimally invasive robot-assisted image-guided lung brachytherapy has been developed. The system incorporates an experimental setup for accurate radioactive seed placement with commercially available dosimetry planning software. The end result is a complete system that allows planning and executing a brachytherapy procedure with increased accuracy. The results of the in vitro seed placement evaluation show that seed misplacement has a significant effect on the volume receiving more than 200% of the dose (V200), and the minimum dosage received by 90% of the volume (D90).
