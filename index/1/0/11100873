The fast development of hospital information systems (HIS) produces a large volume of electronic medical records, which provides a comprehensive source for exploratory analysis and statistics to support clinical decision-making. In this paper, we investigate how to utilize the heterogeneous medical records to aid the clinical treatments of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus, simply diabetes, is a group of metabolic diseases, which is often accompanied with many complications. We propose a Symptom-Diagnosis-Treatment model to mine the diabetes complication patterns and to unveil the latent association mechanism between treatments and symptoms from large volume of electronic medical records. Furthermore, we study the demographic statistics of patient population w.r.t. complication patterns in real data and observe several interesting phenomena. The discovered complication and treatment patterns can help physicians better understand their specialty and learn previous experiences. Our experiments on a collection of one-year diabetes clinical records from a famous geriatric hospital demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.
