An additive fluent is a fluent with numerical values such that the effect of several concurrently executed actions on it can be computed by adding the effects of the individual actions. We propose a method for describing effects of actions on additive fluents in the declarative language C+. An implementation of this language, called the Causal Calculator, can be used for the automation of examples of commonsense reasoning involving additive fluents.
