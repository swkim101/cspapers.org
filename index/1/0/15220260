Most high-level information extraction (IE) consists of compound and aggregated subtasks. Such IE problems are generally challenging and they have generated increasing interest recently. We investigate two representative IE tasks: (1) entity identification and relation extraction from Wikipedia, and (2) citation matching, and we formally define joint optimization of information extraction. We propose a joint paradigm integrating three factors -- segmentation, relation, and segmentation-relation joint factors, to solve all relevant subtasks simultaneously. This modeling offers a natural formalism for exploiting bidirectional rich dependencies and interactions between relevant subtasks to capture mutual benefits. Since exact parameter estimation is prohibitively intractable, we present a general, highly-coupled learning algorithm based on variational expectation maximization (VEM) to perform parameter estimation approximately in a top-down and bottom-up manner, such that information can flow bidirectionally and mutual benefits from different subtasks can be well exploited. In this algorithm, both segmentation and relation are optimized iteratively and collaboratively using hypotheses from each other. We conducted extensive experiments using two real-world datasets to demonstrate the promise of our approach.
