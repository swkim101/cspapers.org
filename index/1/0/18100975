Multi-gigabit speeds are reaching the periphery of the network, where both hard- and software are unprepared for these high rates. With wider pipes available, network uses are also diversifying: time-constrained streaming media, low-latency telephony and high-throughput bulk transfers have to contend for the same overloaded resources on the host. To top it off, a heightened awareness of the need for security is making host-side firewalling and intrusion detection commonplace.
