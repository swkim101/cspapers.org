The inference of temporal information from past event occurences in imagistic domains is relevant in several applications in knowledge engineering. In such applications, the order in which events have happened is imprinted in the domain as visual-spatial relations among its elements. Therefore, the interpretation of the relative ordering in which those events have occured is essential for understanding the domain evolution. We propose a cognitive model for event ordering reasoning within domains whose elements have been modified by past events. From the analysis of cognitive abilities of experts we propose new ontology constructs for knowledge modelling associated to Problem-Solving Methods. We illustrate the effectiveness of the model by means of an applications to an imagistic domain.
