Usecases for wireless sensor networks, such as building automation or patient care, often collect and transmit sensitive information. Yet, many deployments currently do not protect this data through suitable security schemes. We propose an end-to-end security scheme build upon existing internet standards, specifically the Datagram Transport Layer Security protocol (DTLS). By relying on an established standard existing implementations, engineering techniques and security infrastructure can be reused which enables easy security uptake. We present a system architecture for this scheme and show its feasibility through the evaluation of our implementation.
