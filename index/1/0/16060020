Well designed assertions improve overall software quality, ease debugging and maintenance, and support the construction of autonomic software systems. Although widely used both in academia and industry, manually defining code assertions is hard and error-prone. In this summary we present LuMiNous, a prototype that implements a technique to automatically generate code assertions from model annotations.
