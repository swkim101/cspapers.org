Predicate encryption provides fine-grained control over encryption and decryption. In a predicate encryption scheme, message is encrypted with a set of attributes, and decryption key is incorporated with a predicate. Only when the predicate evaluates to true over these attributes, the message can be correctly decrypted. We propose an extension to predicate encryption named delegate predicate encryption. In our extension, a user generates a encryption capability of a set of attributes, then sends the capability to a encryption proxy. Using this capability, the proxy can encrypt arbitrary message with these attributes without knowing anything about these attributes. We give a concrete construction from a predicate encryption scheme which supports the widest range of predicate known to date. Then, using our extension, we are able to construct an anonymous authentication scheme. In our anonymous authentication scheme, authentication rules can be described in an very expressive way, while the anonymity of user is protected and the authentication rules are also hidden.
