In this demo we will show how devices from different vendors, using different protocols, can be combined and made to work together without detailed low-level programming by the user. The small example we have chosen uses a radio-controlled power socket from one vendor and a temperature sensor from another vendor. We use these to create a remotely controlled electric kettle, which keeps the water at the point of boiling, ready to make tea at any time. We also show how we very easy can use a mobile phone for remote control and monitoring of the kettle. It is all built with a simple-to-use graphical user interface offered by the PalCom middleware, and will be modified as part of the demo.
