The author has written several plays that can by used by professors in courses on the social implications of computing, computer ethics, and artificial intelligence. This unusual session of the SIGCSE 2001 Symposium will present one of those plays, ElderCare VR, as a dramatic reading. Hopefully, this will convince those in attendance that theatrical presentations can make a valuable contribution to certain courses in the Computer Science curriculum.
