In this paper, we propose a gait tracking and analysis method using a depth image sensor installed on robotic walker. Nowadays, robotic walker not only can assist elders who have suffered deteriorating mobility but also help to provide rehabilitating function to people who have crippled walking ability. This approach is meant to be sufficiently accurate, non-intrusive, and low-cost. The goal of this research is to enable the robotic walker to become more active in terms of walker control and comfortable user experiences thorough gait analysis. In experiment, the accuracy of the proposed 3D leg pose tracking method was evaluated by a motion capture system and the result is quite promising. After actual trials, the proposed method has the potential to be used in a safer and more reliable application such as those assisting elders and specific group of patient subjects.
