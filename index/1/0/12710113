Techniques for detecting covert channels are based on information flow models. This paper establishes a connection between Shannon's theory of communication and information flow models, such as the Goguen-Meseguer model, that view a reference monitor as a state-transition automaton. The channel associated with a machine and a compromise policy is defined, and the capacity of that channel is taken as a measure of covert channel information rate.
