Pivoting on bilingual parallel corpora is a popular approach for paraphrase acquisition. Although such pivoted paraphrase collections have been successfully used to improve the performance of several different NLP applications, it is still difficult to get an intrinsic estimate of the quality and coverage of the paraphrases contained in these collections. We present ParaQuery, a tool that helps a user interactively explore and characterize a given pivoted paraphrase collection, analyze its utility for a particular domain, and compare it to other popular lexical similarity resources ‚Äê all within a single interface.
