A concept inventory (CI) is a standardized assessment tool that evaluates how well a student's conceptual framework matches the accepted conceptual framework of a discipline. In this paper, we present our process in creating and evaluating the alpha version of a CI to assess student understanding of digital logic. We have checked the validity and reliability of the CI through an alpha administration, follow-up interviews with students, analysis of administration results, and expert feedback. So far the feedback on the digital logic concept inventory is positive and promising.
