In this paper, we propose a novel anti-malware system based on behavior profiling, called Andro-profiler. Andro-profiler consists of mobile devices and a remote server, and is implemented in Droidbox. Our aim is to detect and classify malware using an automatic classifier based on behavior profiling. First, we propose the representative behavior profiling for each malware family represented by system calls coupled with Droidbox system logs. This is done by executing the malicious application on an emulator and extracting integrated system logs. By comparing the behavior profiling of malicious applications with representative behavior profiling for each malware family, we can detect and classify them into malware families. Andro-profiler shows over 99% of classification accuracy in classifying malware families.
