This paper presents an experimental program designed to introduce high school students to the use and interpretation of computer data. The program has evolved from a model research center in the Department of Sociology at California State College, Dominguez Hills. The Center is operated and administered by undergraduates and graduates as a part of their curricular experience in research methods.
