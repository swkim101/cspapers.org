We consider the problem of designing a network with edge-connectivity requirements. As special cases, this problem encompasses the Steiner tree problem and the traveling salesman problem (TSP). We establish a property, referred to as the parsimonious property, of the linear programming (LP) relaxation of a classical formulation for the problem. The parsimonious property has several important consequences, both algorithmically and theoretically. Among other results, we derive a tight worst-case analysis of the duality gap corresponding to an LP relaxation of the Steiner tree problem, the monotonicity of the Held-Karp lower bound for the TSP, the almost surely asymptotic optimality of partitioning schemes a la Karp for the Held-Karp lower bound, a very strong rela*Operations Research Center, MIT, Rm E40-170, Cambridge, MA 02139. tSloan School of Management, MIT, Rm E53-359, Cambridge, MA 02139.
