In this paper, we describe a new indexing technique, the time indez, for improving the performance of certain classes of temporal queries. The time index can be used to retrieve versions of objects that are valid during a specific time period. It supports the processing of the temporal WHEN operator and temporal aggregate functions efficiently. The time indexing scheme is also extended to improve the performance of the temporal SELECT operator, which retrieves objects that satisfy a certain condition during a specific time period. We will describe the indexing technique, and its search and insertion algorithms. We also describe an algorithm for processing a commonly used temporal JOIN operation. Some results of a simulation for comparing the performance of the time index with other proposed temporal access structures are presented.
