Current software suites suffer from problems due to poor integration of their individual tools. They require the designer to think of all possible integrating behaviours and leave little flexibility to the user. In this paper, we discuss CyberDesk, a component software framework that automatically integrates desktop and network services, requiring no integrating decisions to be made by the tool designers and giving total control to the user. We describe CyberDeskâ€™s architecture in detail and show how CyberDesk components can be built. We give examples of extensions to CyberDesk such as chaining, combining, and using higher level context to obtain powerful integrating behaviours.
