Evaluating the impact of scholarly papers plays an important role for addressing recruitment decision, funding allocation and promotion, etc. Yet little is known how actual geographic distance influences the impact of scholarly papers. In this paper, we leverage the law of geographic distance and citations between different institutions to weight quantum Pagerank algorithm for objectively measuring the impact of scholarly papers. The results indicate that the weighted quantum PageRank algorithm can better differentiate the impact of scholarly papers compared to PageRank algorithm.
