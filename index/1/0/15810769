We present a novel way to recognize users by the way they press a button. Our approach allows low-effort and fast interaction without the need for augmenting the user or controlling the environment. It eschews privacy concerns of methods such as fingerprint scanning. Button pressing behavior is sufficiently discriminative to allow distinguishing users within small groups. This approach combines recognition and action in a single step, e.g., getting and tallying a coffee can be done with one button press. We deployed our system for 5 users over a period of 4 weeks and achieved recognition rates of 95% in the last week. We also ran a larger scale but short-term evaluation to investigate effects of group size and found that our method degrades gracefully for larger groups.
