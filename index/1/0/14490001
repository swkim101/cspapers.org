This paper describes a behavior-based approach to stealth. The specific problem we consider is that of making stealthy traverses, i.e., transiting from one point to another while remaining hidden from an observer. Since we assume that the robot has no a priori model of the environment, our stealthy traverse behavior makes opportunistic use of terrain features to hide from the observer. This behavior has been evaluated in both real and simulated experiments, comparing it against a regular goal-seeking/obstacle-avoidance behavior. These experiments show a clear improvement in the stealthiness of the robot.
