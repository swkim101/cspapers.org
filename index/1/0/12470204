In response to the current need for fast, secure and cheap public-key cryptography largely induced by the fast development of electronic commerce, we propose a new on the fly signature scheme, i.e. a scheme that requires very small on-line work for the signer It combines provable security based on the factorization problem, short public and secret keys, short transmission and minimal on-line computation. It is the first RSA-like signature scheme that can be used for both efficient and secure applications based on low cost or contactless smart cards.
