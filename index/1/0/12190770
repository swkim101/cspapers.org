Ordered lists of objects are widely used as representational forms. Such ordered objects include Web search results and best-seller lists. Techniques for processing such ordinal data are being developed, particularly methods for a supervised ordering task: i.e., learning functions used to sort objects from sample orders. In this article, we propose two dimension reduction methods specifically designed to improve prediction performance in a supervised ordering task.
