Requirements engineering, an integral part of the life of a software engineer, often receives little or no attention in the education of a computer science student. We report on our experiences in constructing an innovative curriculum that utilizes a three tier model of learning that provides students with hands-on experience on the various facets of requirements elicitation and management. This curriculum can be integrated into an existing course on software engineering, software requirements or the senior capstone experience. We believe our experience will be of use to other computer science and software engineering programs that are aiming at introducing requirements in the undergraduate curriculum.
