Predictive models can be used to discover potentially problematic components. Source code metrics can be used as input features to predictive models, however, there are many structural and design measures that capture related metrics of coupling, cohesion, inheritance, complexity and size. Feature selection is the process of identifying a subset of attributes that improves the performance of a predictive model. This paper presents a prototype that implements a parallel genetic algorithm as a search-based feature selection method that enhances a predictive model's ability to identify cognitively complex components in a Java application.
