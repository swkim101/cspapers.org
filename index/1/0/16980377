Logic modelling is presented as an approach for exploring cognitive reasoning. The notion of mental construction and execution of propositional models is introduced. A model is constructed through inclusions and exclusions of assertions and assumptions about the task. A constructed model is executed in a logical control structure. Formal rules of inference are argued to be an essential feature of this architecture. A few examples are given for purpose of illustration.
