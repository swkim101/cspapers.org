The quality of a sentence translated by a machine translation (MT) system is difficult to evaluate. We propose a method for automatically evaluating the quality of each translation. In general, when translating a given sentence, one or more conditions should be satisfied to maintain a high translation quality. In EnglishJapanese translation, for example, prepositions and infinitives must be appropriately translated. We show several procedures that enable evaluating the quality of a translated sentence more appropriately than using conventional methods. The first procedure is constructing a test set where the conditions are assigned to each test-set sentence in the form of yes/no questions. The second procedure is developing a system that determines an answer to each question. The third procedure is combining a measure based on the questions and conventional measures. We also present a method for automatically generating sub-goals in the form of yes/no questions and estimating the rate of accomplishment of the sub-goals. Promising results are shown.
