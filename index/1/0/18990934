It will be studied which degree parallel supercomputers can be scaled to. Necessary measures to achieve a maximum scalability will be discussed, and a case-study be presented. To this purpose, a new class of “supermassively parallel architectures” is introduced, and the notation of scalable architectures will be extended to reflect the impact of technological progress onto cost-functions. For systems in this class, the performance efficiency of applications is discussed and two examples are given.
