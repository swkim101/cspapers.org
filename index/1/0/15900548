Alert is an extension architecture designed for transforming a passive SQL DBMS into. an active DBMS. The salient features of the design of Alert are reusing, to the extent possible, the passive DBMS technology, and making minimal changes to the language and implementation of the passive DBMS. Alert provides a layered architecture that allows the semantics of a variety of production rule languages to be supported on top. Rules may be specified on userdefined as well as built-in operations. Both synchronous and asynchronous event, monit,oring are possible. This paper presents the design of Alert and its implementation in the Starburst extensible DBMS.
