DisViz is a visualization tool designed to assist students in learning graph algorithms, an important topic in the undergraduate curriculum. DisViz is intended for collaborative use by a group of students over a classroom network. This visualization system views network hosts as graph nodes and the socket connections among them, as graph edges. In typical usage, every student runs a copy of DisViz on his/her local machine. These applications detect each other's presence on the network and coordinate their actions to execute the graph algorithm in question and to deliver identical animations to every terminal.
