Social semantic web technologies led to huge amounts of data and information being available. The production of knowledge from this information is challenging, and major efforts, like DBpedia, has been done to make it reality. Linked data provides interconnection between this information, extending the scope of the knowledge production. The knowledge construction between decentralized sources in the web follows a co-evolution scheme, where knowledge is generated collaboratively and continuously. Sources are also autonomous, meaning that they can use and publish only the information they want. The updating of sources with this criteria is intimately related with the problem of synchronization, and the consistency between all the replicas managed. Recently, a new family of algorithms called Commutative Replicated Data Types have emerged for ensuring eventual consistency in highly dynamic environments. In this paper, we define SU-Set, a CRDT for RDF-Graph that supports SPARQL Update 1.1 operations.
