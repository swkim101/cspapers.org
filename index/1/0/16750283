The system center of gravity (SCG) is a critical element for the stability of a robot when it undergoes locomotion. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for enhancing such stability by manipulating the location of the SCG. Specifically, we can prevent the robot from tipping over, rolling over, and tumbling over. The tipover stability criteria for a tracked mobile manipulator are discussed and the velocity kinematic model of the manipulator for SCG adjustment is also presented in this paper. The embedded 3-axial gyroscope provides us the data necessary for the SCG computation. The algorithm outputs the adjustments needed on the joint angles in order to maintain the SCG within a body-fixed safety zone. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
