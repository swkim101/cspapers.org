Performance optimization is the primary design goal in most digital signal processing (DSP) and numerically intensive applications. The problem of mapping high-level algorithmic descriptions for these applications to specialized instruction sets has only recently begun to receive attention. In fact, the problem of optimizing performance has yet to be addressed directly. This paper introduces a new approach to instruction set mapping (and template matching in general) targeted toward performance optimization. Several novel issues are addressed including partial matching and automatic clock selection.
