The increasing emphasis on software engineering in industry has been paralleled by the widespread introduction of project centered undergraduate courses in software engineering and software development (viz. [2], [3], [5], [6], [8], [9], [i0]). The purpose of this paper is to share with the academic computer science community the history of a project oriented course in software development at Bowling Green State University of Ohio. Described are the projects that have been undertaken, the management of those projects, student activity data, and anticipated modifications to the course. In particular, critical concerns are identified and suggested approaches presented.
