A major barrier for the adoption of wireless mesh networks is severe limits on throughput. In this paper, we apply superposition coding to substantially improve network capacity of large, dense wireless mesh networks. Superposition coding is a physical layer technique that allows a transmitter to simultaneously send independent packets to multiple receivers. While superposition coding has been studied extensively by the physical layer community, we present the first design of practical and effective MAC protocols to take advantage of superposition coding in wireless mesh networks. Extensive evaluations show that superposition coding can be a practical method to increase the throughput of large, dense wireless mesh networks. Specifically, in a mesh network with 2 to 64 active receivers and one gateway, we show that our system can increase throughput up to 154%, with average gain ranging from 10% to 21%. When there are multiple gateways forming a mesh network, our system gains up to 98%, with average gain ranging from 24% to 46%. These results clearly demonstrate the potential benefits of our system. We also present results from an implementation of superposition coding using GNU Radio.
