This paper deals with the minimization of the asymptotic latency of horizontal microprograms performing vectorial loops. On a quite general architecture model, we show that all the constraints can be formalized to give a cyclic scheduling problem, modelled with a Timed Petri net. To analyse the net behaviour, a bivalued resolution graph is build. A critical cycle of this graph leads to optimal microprograms whose structure is independent on the number of iterations. This approach is then extended to uniform recurrences.
