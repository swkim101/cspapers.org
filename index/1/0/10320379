This paper presents a novel online video recommendation system called VideoReach, which alleviates users' efforts on finding the most relevant videos according to current viewings without a sufficient collection of user profiles as required in traditional recommenders. In this system, video recommendation is formulated as finding a list of relevant videos in terms of multimodal relevance (i.e. textual, visual, and aural relevance) and user click-through. Since different videos have different intra-weights of relevance within an individual modality and inter-weights among different modalities, we adopt relevance feedback to automatically find optimal weights by user click-though, as well as an attention fusion function to fuse multimodal relevance. We use 20 clips as the representative test videos, which are searched by top 10 queries from more than 13k online videos, and report superior performance compared with an existing video site.
