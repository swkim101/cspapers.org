A functional model of instructional programs (for Computer Assisted Instruction - CAI) that describes all program types as being essentially composed of a set of primitive building blocks is proposed. The variables that account for the apparent distinguishing characteristics of these programs are then interpreted in the light of this model and a procedure is provided for reducing the different program types to their elementary building blocks. Starting with the primitive building blocks, it is shown how programs of varying descriptions can be generated by an appropriate choice of parameter values. This model provides better insight on the requirements and structure of application-oriented CAI languages, software, and systems. Furthermore, the model provides an easy means of generating CAI synthetic programs for the purpose of simulation modeling directed towards instructional systems design, analysis, and performance evaluation.
