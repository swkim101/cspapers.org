As a consequence of the increased dissemination of wireless and location-aware mobile devices, self-monitoring and crowd-sensing has become increasingly popular in recent years. In parallel, discussions about sustainability, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions have also been intensified. We propose combining ideas of self-monitoring, crowd-sensing and persuasion towards a real-time city atlas which induces urban dwellers to integrate higher levels of physical activities into their daily mobility needs and to guide their mobility behavior towards a higher degree of sustainability as well as a lower exposure to polluted air.
