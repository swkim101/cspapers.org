We discuss a parallel program model that allows a very general synchronization mechanism with a scheduler to control the progress of processes “undergoing synchronization.” We how to “abstract” the program, i.e. remove the scheduler, resulting in a simpler program. We then show that, for a large class of schedulers, a process can become deadlocked in the original program iff it can become deadlocked in the abstracted program.
