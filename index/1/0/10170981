We propose a method for improving motivation to participate in sensing services by presenting rankings in multidimensional hierarchical sets. We call this method Top of Worlds. Because previously proposed methods only rank a user among all other users, many have little chance of being ranked in the top group, resulting in little motivation to continue. Top of Worlds creates many sets with varying granularity to increase the chance of many users being ranked in the top group and presents these rankings in those sets. Through an experiment, we partially confirmed the validity of Top of Worlds.
