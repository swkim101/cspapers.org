We study sequence nearest neighbors (SNN). Let D be a database of n sequences; we would like to preprocess D so that given any on-line query sequence Q we can quickly find a sequence S in D for which d(S;Q) d(S; T ) for any other sequence T in D. Hered(S;Q) denotes the distance between sequences S andQ, defined to be the minimum number of edit operations needed to transform one to another (all edit operations will be reversible so thatd(S; T ) = d(T; S) for any two sequencesT andS). These operations correspond to the notion of similarity between sequences that we wish to capture in a given application. Natural edit operations include character edits (inserts, replacements, deletes etc), block edits (moves, copies, deletes, reversals) and block numerical transformations (scaling by an additive or a multiplicative constant). The SNN problem arises in many applications. We present the first known efficient algorithm for “approximate” nearest neighbor search for sequences with preprocessing time and space polynomial in size of D and query time near-linear in size of Q. We assume the distanced(S; T ) between two sequences S andT is the minimum number of character edits and block operations needed to transform one to the other. The approximation factor we achieve is O(log `(log `)2), where` is the size of the longest sequence in D.

The time and space requirements of the algorithm is near linear; previously known approaches take at least quadratic time.
