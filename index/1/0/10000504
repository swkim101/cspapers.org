The endoscope system consists of a control hand unit with valves and manoeuvrable bend section at the distal end by turning two knobs from a control hand unit. An accurate kinematic model for the relationships between motion of the distal end and the control unit is essential for endoscopist to control a motion of the tip navigating in the human organ effectively. In this paper we introduce a new method for modeling of kinematics for the distal end of the colonoscope in the use of D-H (Denavit - Hartenberg) parameters when the distal end of the colonoscope is taken as continuum robot, and analyze the kinematic relationship between the motion of the tip of the enodoscope and angular control from the control hand unit. Our kinematical model plays an important role in controlling the motion of the distal end accurately.
