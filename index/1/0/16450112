Based on the Lyapunov stability theory in control theory, a new sufficient condition is proposed in this paper for chaos synchronization by the linear-state-feedback approach for a class of chaotic systems. By using Schur theorem and some matrix technique, this criterion is then transformed into the linear matrix inequality (LMI) form, which can be easily verified and resolved using the MATLAB LMI Toolbox. It is shown that under the proposed criterion chaos synchronization can be achieved at an exponential convergence rate. The effectiveness of the criterion proposed herein is verified and demonstrated by the chaotic Murali-Lakshmanan-Chua circuit
