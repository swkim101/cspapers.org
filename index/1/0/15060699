This paper presents a discretionary access control model in which authorizations contain temporal information. This information can be used to specify temporal intervals of validity for authorizations and temporal dependencies among authorizations. A formal definition of those concepts is presented in the paper, in terms of their interpretation in first order logic. We characterize sets of temporal dependencies that can lead to undesirable states of the authorization system and we sketch an algorithm for their detection. Finally, operations to add, remove, or modify authorizations and temporal dependencies are described.
