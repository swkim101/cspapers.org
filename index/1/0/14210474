Semantic Binary Object-oriented Data Model (Sem-ODM) provides an expressive data model (similar to Object-oriented Data Models) with a well-known declarative query facility - SQL (similar to relational databases). Advantages of using Sem-ODM include (i.) friendlier and more intelligent generic user interfaces; (ii.) comprehensive enforcement of integrity constraints; (iii.) greater flexibility; (iv.) substantially shorter application programs; and (v.) easier query facility. SemanticAccess is a set of tools developed to provide a semantic interface to Semantic Binary Object-oriented Databases (Sem-ODB) as well as relational databases. This presentation focuses on the system architecture of SemanticAccess including Semantic Binary Object-oriented Data Model, Semantic SQL query language, Semantic Binary Database and a wrapper developed for relational databases. 1.
