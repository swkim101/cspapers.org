Two-level logic minimization consists in finding a minimal cost sum-of-products, i.e, disjunctive normal form, of a given Boolean function. This paper presents a new algorithm to solve this problem, and gives experimental evidences showing that it outperforms the leading minimizers of several orders of magnitude. We suspect that it may be possible to explain this improvement in performance theoretically, and hope that our empirical results will stimulate research along
