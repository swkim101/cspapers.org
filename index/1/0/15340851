Traditional link-based web ranking algorithms run on a single web snapshot without concern of the dynamics of web pages and links. In particular, the correlation of web pages freshness and their classic PageRank is negative (see [11]). For this reason, in recent years a number of authors introduce some algorithms of PageRank actualization. We introduce our new algorithm called Actual PageRank, which generalizes some previous approaches and therefore provides better capability for capturing the dynamics of the Web. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to conduct ranking evaluations of a fresh-aware variation of PageRank on a large data set. The results demonstrate that our method achieves more relevant and fresh results than both classic PageRank and its "fresh" modifications.
