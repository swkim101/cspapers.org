The work described in this paper is part of an NSF funded project to develop tutorial materials for introductory computer science courses. We had several general goals for these materials that had an impact on their design and implementation:&bull; they should be delivered on-line;&bull; they should be highly interactive;&bull; they should be useful on a wide variety of hardware/software platforms; and&bull; it should be easy to extend the content to different courses or contexts.In trying to meet these goals we designed and implemented a package of Java classes that provided a framework for creating our set of tutorials, yet was general enough to be used in other contexts such as interactive laboratories. This paper describes the framework and the design decisions that governed the implementation. Information about obtaining the package is included in section 7.
