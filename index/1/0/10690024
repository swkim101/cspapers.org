This paper describes development of a distributed-type tactile sensor. This sensor arranges many sensor elements that can measure a triaxial force on the same plane. Therefore, the action force can be measured with the pressure distribution. Since the relative movement of a sensor and a contacted object can be evaluated by measuring the pressure distribution, a slip is detectable. Experimental results prove the validity of the sensor elements' output values. Moreover, the simulation shows that this sensor can detect a slip.
