This paper presents a methodology based on a variation of the Quintic Pythagorean Hodographs curves for generating smooth feasible paths for autonomous vehicles in three-dimensional space under the restriction of limited climb angles. A given path is considered feasible if the main kinematic constraints of the vehicle are not violated. The generated paths satisfy three main angular constraints: (i) maximum curvature, (ii) maximum torsion and (iii) maximum climb (or dive). The smoothness the vehicle acceleration profile is indirectly guaranteed between two consecutive points of the profile. The proposed methodology is applicable to vehicles that move in three-dimensional environments, and that can be modelled under the constraints assumed. We apply our methodology and show the results for a small autonomous aerial vehicle.
