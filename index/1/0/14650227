In ordinary telephone calls, we rely on cues for the assurance that the connection is active and that the other party is listening to what we are saying. For instance, noise on the line (whether it be someone's voice, traffic sounds, or background static from a bad connection) tells us about the state of our connection. Similarly, the occasional "uhuh" or muffled sounds from a side conversation tells us about the focus and activity of the person on the line. Conventional telephony is based on a single connection for communication between two parties â€” as such, it has relatively simple assurance needs. Multimedia, multiparty systems increase the complexity of the communication in two orthogonal directions, leading to a concomitant increase in assurance needs. As the complexity of these systems and services grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to assess the current state of these services and the level of the user interactions within the systems. We have addressed this problem through the use of assurances that are designed to provide information about the connectivity, presence, focus, and activity in an environment that is part virtual and part real. We describe how independent network media services (a virtual meeting room service, a holophonic sound service, an application sharing service, and a 3D augmented reality visualization system) were designed to work together, providing users with coordinated cohesive assurances for virtual contexts in multimedia, multiparty communication and interaction.
