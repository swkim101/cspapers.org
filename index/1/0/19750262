Data cubes are specialized database management systems designed to support multidimensional data for such purposes as decision support and data mining. For a given mix of queries, we can optimize the implementation of a data cube by materializing some projections of the cube. A greedy approach turns out to be very effective; it is both polynomial-time as a function of the number of possible views to materialize and guaranteed to come close to the optimum choice of views. The work reported here is a summary of results appearing in the following two papers:
