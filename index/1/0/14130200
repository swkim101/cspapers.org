This paper presents ChainFORM: a linear, modular, actuated hardware system as a novel type of shape changing interface. Using rich sensing and actuation capability, this modular hardware system allows users to construct and customize a wide range of interactive applications. Inspired by modular and serpentine robotics, our prototype comprises identical modules that connect in a chain. Modules are equipped with rich input and output capability: touch detection on multiple surfaces, angular detection, visual output, and motor actuation. Each module includes a servo motor wrapped with a flexible circuit board with an embedded microcontroller. Leveraging the modular functionality, we introduce novel interaction capability with shape changing interfaces, such as rearranging the shape/configuration and attaching to passive objects and bodies. To demonstrate the capability and interaction design space of ChainFORM, we implemented a variety of applications for both computer interfaces and hands-on prototyping tools.
