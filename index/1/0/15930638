In this work, we present the design and the implementation of an innovative knee locking mechanism for a dynamically walking robot. The mechanism consists of a four-bar linkage that realizes a mechanical singularity for locking the knee when the leg is in the extended position. Once extended, the knee remains locked without energy consumption, while unlocking it only costs a small amount of energy. Tests showed that the robot walks robustly and that the energy consumption of the new system is low.
