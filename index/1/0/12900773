In this paper we present solutions to a number of problems that arise in <underline>microelectronics, printed circuits</underline>, and <underline>process automation</underline>. These problems are broadly concerned with wiring and interconnection of modules, circuit layout design, and the graphic display, manipulation, and alteration of circuits. The solutions are based on a number of results obtained by the author on the <underline>characterization, coding, symmetries</underline>, and <underline>generation</underline> of <underline>planar graphs</underline>. These results are constructive in that they can be given in the form of algorithms and are thus suitable for direct computer implementation.
