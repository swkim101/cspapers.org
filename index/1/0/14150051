Hands-on laboratory experiences are essential critical for students to understand concepts and gain real-world insights in database security and auditing. We are developing a set of hands-on labs to integrate theories of database security into practices. Our designed labs do not require purchasing any commercial software or pre-configuration. Each lab includes objectives, results, and resources to help students to understand database security concepts including access control, virtual private database, and database auditing etc. We use two major database products (Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle 10g) to design and implement our labs.
