A technique that measures the impact of command selection on task time and errors is described. Users were timed while performing a drawing task, then while performing the same task with interpolated command selections. The difference between these times, consisting of both the time to select the command and to resume drawing, is the time cost of command selection. Several interface configurations were evaluated with this method including selected combinations of single mouse, two mice, voice and touch. Touch and voice input resulted in faster command selection times (approximately 1 sec) than any of the mouse conditions (approximately 3 sec).
