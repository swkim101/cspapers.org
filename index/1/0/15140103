Over the last few years, the number of game players using voice communication to talk to each other while playing games has increased dramatically. In fact, many modern games and game consoles have added voice support instead of expecting third-party companies to provide this technology. Unlike traditional voice-over-IP technology, where most conversations are between two people, voice communication in games often has 5 or more people talking together as they play.
 We present the first measurement study on the characteristics of multiparty voice communications. Over a 3 month period, we measured over 7,000 sessions on an active multi-party voice communication server to quantify the characteristics of communication generated by game players, including overall server traffic, group sizes, sessions characteristics, and speaking (and silence) durations.
