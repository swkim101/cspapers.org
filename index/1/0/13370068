Brand awareness is an important issue for the advertising. How to know the effective of every ad for business is always being studied. This paper present a face detection based on the use of eyes tracking system, that can track how long, does the consumer pays attention on current advertising. Firstly, we use the harr-likes features to capture the faces in the image. Secondly, with the similar feature we can locate eyes on each face, which is called the ROI. For each eye region, we then decide whether the consumer is interested to the advertising or not by considering the position of the eye ball. Usually when a consumer is attracted by an ad, their eye ball will locate at the center of the eye. With this manner, we can observe the user behavior sustained and then give the feedback to the business. Finally, we provided a user friendly interface to demonstrate the advertising results. Testing results show that our system can easily be used for business such that business can integrated other marketing strategies for further advertising.
