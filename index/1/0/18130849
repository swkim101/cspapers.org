At the heart of a well-disciplined, systematic methodology that explicitly supports the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components is a clearly defined process for effectively using components that meet the needs of the system under development. In this paper, we present the CARE/SA approach that supports the iterative matching, ranking, and selection of COTS components. The components are represented as an aggregate of its functional and non-functional requirements and architecture.
