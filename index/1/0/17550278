Effective physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) needs to account for variable human dynamics and also predict human intent. Recently, there has been a lot of progress in adaptive impedance and admittance control for human-robot interaction. Not as many contributions have been reported on online adaptation schemes that can accommodate users with varying physical strength and skill level during interaction with a robot. The goal of this paper is to present and evaluate a novel adaptive admittance controller that can incorporate human intent, nominal task models, as well as variations in the robot dynamics. An outer-loop controller is developed using an ARMA model which is tuned using an adaptive inverse control technique. An inner-loop neuroadaptive controller linearizes the robot dynamics. Working in conjunction and online, this two-loop technique offers an elegant way to decouple the pHRI problem. Experimental results are presented comparing the performance of different types of admittance controllers. The results show that efficient online adaptation of the robot admittance model for different human subjects can be achieved. Specifically, the adaptive admittance controller reduces jerk which results in a smooth human-robot interaction.
