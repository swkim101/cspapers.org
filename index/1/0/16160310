In this paper, we present algorithm BandWidth Inheritance (BWI), a new scheduling strategy that extends the bandwidth reservation approach to systems where tasks can interact through shared resources. The proposed algorithm provides temporal isolation between independent groups of tasks, and enables a schedulability analysis for guaranteeing the performance of realtime tasks. After showing that BWI is the natural extension of the well-known Priority Inheritance Protocol to dynamic reservation systems, a formal analysis of the algorithm is presented, and simple guarantee tests for hard real-time tasks are proposed.
