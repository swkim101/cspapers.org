We describe an architecture which allows any external agent (human or software) to point into the visual space of an interactive application. We describe the visual design of a scheme for highlighting any information in any application. This architecture requires the application to provide information about its semantic structure as part of its redraw algorithms. Based on this semantic map generalized pointer descriptions are defined and used to reference objects to be highlighted. The architecture is demonstrated using a multibookmark agent framework and several example applications.
