Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have enjoyed great success in speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. Many variants of RNNs have been proposed, including vanilla RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs. However, current architectures are not particularly adept at dealing with tasks involving multi-faceted contents, i.e., data with a bimodal or multimodal distribution. In this work, we solve this problem by proposing Multiple-Weight RNNs and LSTMs, which rely on multiple weight matrices to better mimic the human ability of switching between contexts. We present a framework for adapting RNN-based models and analyze the properties of this approach. Our detailed experimental results show that our model outperforms previous work across a range of different tasks and datasets.
