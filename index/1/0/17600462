During the analysis phase of the development of a software system, conceptual models are created to establish a description of the problem domain. In this paper we introduce concepts that allow us to introduce non-determinism in the specification of behaviour in conceptual models and we provide formal and declarative semantics for these constructs. We integrate non-determinism with the concept of constrainment and show how this can lead to a better separation of structure from behaviour.
