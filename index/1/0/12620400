This paper proposes new techniques for aircraft shape estimation, passive ranging, and shape-adaptive hidden Markov model filtering which are suitable for a monocular vision-based non-cooperative collision avoidance system. Vision-based passive ranging is an important missing technology that could play a significant role in resolving the sense-and-avoid problem in un-manned aerial vehicles (UAVs); a barrier hindering the wider adoption of UAVs for civilian applications. The feasibility of the pro- posed shape estimation, passive ranging and shape-adaptive filtering techniques is evaluated on flight test data.
