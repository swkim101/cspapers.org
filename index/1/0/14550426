A large number of robotic, computer vision and computer graphics applications rely on efficiently solving the associated sparse linear systems. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), structure from motion (SfM), non-rigid shape recovery, and elastodynamic simulations are only few examples in this direction. In general, these problems are nonlinear and the solution can be approximated by incrementally solving a series of linearized problems. In some applications, the size of the system considerably affects the performance, especially when the sparsity is low. This paper exploits the block structure of such problems and offers very efficient solutions to manipulate block matrices within iterative nonlinear solvers. The resulting method considerably speeds-up the execution of the implementation of the nonlinear optimization problem. In this work, in particular, we focus our effort on testing the method on SLAM applications, but the applicability of the technique remains general. Our implementation outperforms the state of the art SLAM implementations on all tested datasets. In incremental mode, where a larger portion of time is spent in updating the system, our implementation is on average two times faster than the others.
