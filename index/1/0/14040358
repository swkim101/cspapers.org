This paper analyses structure and algorithm of Floating-Point ALU, and implements multiplication and division operation in the homo-hardware circuit. The Floating-Point multiplication and division ALU supports Floating-Point number according with IEEE-754 standard. This ALU adopts 4-Level pipelining structure: ‘0’ operation number check¿exponent addition and subtraction operation¿fraction multiplication and division operation¿result normalization and round. Each step can act as a single module. Among these modules, there are some registers which can prepare necessary data for next operation.
