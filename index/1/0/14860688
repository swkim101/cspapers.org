In the first part of the paper, I present a new treatment of THE IMPERFECTIVE PARADOX (Dowty 1979) for the restricted case of trajectory-of-motion events. This treatment extends and refines those of Moens and Steedman (1988) and Jackendoff (1991). In the second part, I describe an implemented algorithm based on this treatment which determines whether a specified sequence of such events is or is not possible under certain situationally supplied constraints and restrictive assumptions.
