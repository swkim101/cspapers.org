We investigate the application of a light-weight approach to result list clustering for the purposes of diversifying search results. We introduce a novel post-retrieval approach, which is independent of external information or even the full-text content of retrieved documents; only the retrieval score of a document is used. Our experiments show that this novel approach is beneficial to effectiveness, albeit only on certain baseline systems. The fact that the method works indicates that the retrieval score is potentially exploitable in diversity.
