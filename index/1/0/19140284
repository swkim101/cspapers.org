Navigate code, find bugs, compute metrics, check style rules, and enforce coding conventions in Eclipse with SemmleCode. SemmleCode is a new free Eclipse plugin that allows you to phrase these tasks as queries over the codebase - it thus takes the search facilities in Eclipse to a whole new level. A large library of queries for common operations is provided, including metrics and Java EE style rules. Query results can be displayed as a tree view, a table view, in the problem view, as charts or graphs, all with links to the source code.
