The popularity of mobile devices has made people's lives more convenient, but threatened people's privacy at the same time. As end users are becoming more and more concerned on the protection of their private information, it is even harder for hackers to track a specific user by using conventional technologies. For example, cookies might be cleared by users regularly. Besides, OS designers have developed a series of measures to cope with tracker. Apple has stopped apps accessing UDIDs, and Android phones use some special permissions to protect IMEI code. However, some recent studies showed that attackers are able to find new ways to get around those limitations, even though these new methods should be improved in order to be practically deployed in large scale. For example, attackers can trace smart phones by using the hardware features resulting from the imperfect manufacturing process of accelerometers. In this paper, we will present another new and more practical method for the adversaries to generate stable and unique device ID stealthily for the smartphone by exploiting the frequency response of the speaker. With carefully selected audio frequencies and special sound wave patterns, we can reduce the impact of non-linear effects and noises, and keep our feature extraction process un-noticeable to phone owners. The extracted feature is not only very stable for a given smart phone, but also unique to that phone. The feature contains rich information, which is even enough to differentiate millions of smart phones of the same model. We have built a prototype to evaluate our method, and the results show that the generated device ID can be used to track users practically.
