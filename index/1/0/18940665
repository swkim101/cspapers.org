In the well-developed problem solving system, much goal satisfaction activity will not involve the use of heuristic methods. Rather, a problem will activate a known, general strategy which, if successfully executed, guarantees goal satisfaction. To be applicable in a variety of contexts, such a strategy must be specified in a high level abstraction space. Solutions to tactical details, necessary to bind a strategy to an actual situation, will be based upon similar strategies at lower abstraction levels. The problem solving system will be expected to operate in situations where several, non-independent goals await satisfaction. To function effectively in such situations, the system must be able to coordinate its execution of the independently generated solution strategies.
