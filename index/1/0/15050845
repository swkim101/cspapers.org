Recently, product line software engineering (PLSE) is gaining popularity. To employ PLSE methods, many organizations are looking for a tool system that supports PLSE methods so that core assets and target software can be developed and tested in an effective and systematic way.ASADAL (A System Analysis and Design Aid tooL) supports the entire lifecycle of software development process based on a PLSE method called FORM (Feature-Oriented Reuse Method) [6]. It supports domain analysis, architecture and component design, code generation, and simulation-based verification and validation (V&V). Using the tool, users may co-develop target software and its test environment and verify software in a continuous and incremental way.
