It appears that traditional divide-and-conquer strategies do not work well, due to the intricate non-local nature of the interactions between the problem variables. In this paper, we introduce a novel way in which parallelism can be used to exploit hidden structure of hard combinatorial problems. We demonstrate the success of this approach on minimal set basis problem, which has a wide range of applications in machine learning and system security, etc. We also show the effectiveness on a related application problem from materials discovery. In our approach, a large number of smaller sub-problems are identified and solved concurrently. We then aggregate the information from those solutions, and use this to initialize the search of a global, complete solver. We show that this strategy leads to a significant speed-up over a sequential approach. The strategy also greatly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete solvers in terms of solution quality. Our work opens up a novel angle for using parallelism to solve hard combinatorial problems.
