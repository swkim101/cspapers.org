Decision-making logic in hybrid systems is responsible for selecting modes of operation for the underlying (continuous) control system, reacting to external events and failures in the system, and insuring that the overall control system is satisfying safety and performance specifications. Tools from computer science, such as model-checking and logic synthesis, combined with design patterns from feedback control theory provide new approaches to solving these problems. A major shift is the move from ``design then verify'' to ``specify then synthesize'' approaches to controller design that allow simultaneous synthesis of high-performance, robust control laws and correct-by-construction decision-making logic.
