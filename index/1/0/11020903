A homogeneous catalytic process for the selective conversion of methanol to ethanol or acetaldehyde. The process comprises contacting CO and H2 with a catalytically effective amount of an iron-cobalt carbonyl complex of the formula M[FeCo3(CO)12] where M is hydrogen or a cation and an iodide promoter; heating the resulting mixture at temperatures of from 100 DEG to 250 DEG C. at pressures of from 5 to 100 MPa. By controlling the reaction parameters of H2:CO ratio, temperature and reaction time, acetaldehyde or ethanol can be selectively produced.
