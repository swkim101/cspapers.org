Today, refactorings are supported in some integrated development environments (IDEs). The refactoring operations can only work correctly if all source code that needs to be changed is available to the IDE. However, this precondition neither holds for application programming interface (API) evolution, nor in team development. The research presented in this paper aims to support refactoring in API evolution and team development by extending IDE and version control to allow refactoring-aware merging and migration.
