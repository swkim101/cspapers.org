The Teradata Multimedia Object Manager is a general-purpose content analysis multimedia server designed for symmetric multiprocessing and massively parallel processing environments. The Multimedia Object Manager defines and manipulates user-defined functions (UDFs), which are invoked in parallel to analyze or manipulate the contents of multimedia objects. Several computationally intensive applications of this technology, which use large persistent datasets, include fingerprint matching, signature verification, face recognition, and speech recognition/translation.
