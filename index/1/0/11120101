Similarity searc h in time-series databases has received signi cant attention lately .P opular tec hniques for e cien t retrieval of time sequences in time-series databases has been to use Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Recently, the Discrete Wavelet T ransform (DWT) has gained popular interest in database domain and several proposals have been made to replace DFT by DWT for similarity search over time-series databases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of replacing DFT by DWT with a comprehensive analysis of the DFT and DWT as matching functions in time-series databases. Our results show that although the DWT based technique has several adv an tages,e.g., the D WThas complexity of O(N) whereas DFT is O(N logN), D WT does not reduce relativ e matching error and does not increase query precision in similarity searc h as suggested by previous works [1]. We conclude that, by exploring the conjugate property of DFT in real domain, the DFT-based and DWT-based techniques yield comparable results on similarity searc h in time-series databases.
