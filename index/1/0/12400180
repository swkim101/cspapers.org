The continual advancement in technology and formfactor of personal devices have made possible “memory archiving” and “life logging,” the recording of a person’s life through wearable and ubiquitous computing technologies. The purpose of this research is to minimize the total data recorded while maximizing the number of significant or user-preferred “captured moments.” This media is captured automatically based on the subject's arousal level and collaboratively employing nearby camera phones. The recording groupware application analyzes collective emotion for more accurate capture.
