In this paper we describe a use context for ubicomp technology seldom investigated: the industrial setting, and in particular, the oil and gas industry. We suggest that the field offers interesting challenges to the ubicomp field and briefly outline some design opportunities. In particular, we identify the need to ease flowing of activity across boundaries of space, physical/digital and varied systems. We also describe our grounded approach, starting with qualitative field studies and leading through to the design and implementation of novel prototypes. The contribution of this paper is a concrete description of this alternative use context and a sketching of potential ubicomp solutions to meet industrial needs.
