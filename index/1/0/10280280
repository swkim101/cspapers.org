A light-sensitive, color photographic silver halide multilayer material contains for the improvement of definition, grain and color rendition DIR-couplers which are substituted in coupling position by mercapto-azole-, mercaptobenz-azole- or mercapto-azine moieties, which themselves carry hydrophilic substituents. The DIR-couplers according to the invention may be used together with other couplers and additives or as sole color forming element and are noteworthy for their high color yields, inter- and intra-image effects. They may be added as well in hydrophobic state (in dispersed form) as in hydrophilic state (as alkaline solutions) and they may be used in single layers or as associated layers with a maximum three layers of a color forming unit and the layers may be arranged in any desired order within the whole combination of layers.
