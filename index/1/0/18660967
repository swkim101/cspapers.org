storage during execution, making the file system the bottleneck of overall performance. F’uthermore, such access require some application specific Quditv of Service (QoS) parameters be met. These include retrieval rate, its variation, timing drift, average and bursty errors, and the degree of synchronization. Unavilabiiity of such QoS parameters in conventional file systems result in failures to guarantee QoS parameters and thereby take advantage of application’s tolerauces. This paper presents an experimental
