In this paper, we present the design and development of a miniature robot that is able to run and jump. This robot can use wheeled locomotion to travel on the flat ground. When it encounters a large obstacle compared to its size, it can stand up and leap over the obstacle. The robot has a mass of 25 grams and a maximum size of 9 centimeters. Experimental results show that with a take-off angle 80Â°, the robot can jump up to 1.44 meter in height and 0.59 meter in distance. Moreover, it has on-board energy, control, and communication abilities, which enables tetherless or autonomous operation. With the multi-modal locomotion abilities, the robot is expected to have many applications ranging from environmental monitoring, search and rescue, to military surveillance.
