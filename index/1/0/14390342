We describe two experiments that compare the relative utility of pictures, labels, and the combination of both as navigational aids for computerized catalog browsing. The results point to the usefulness of example pictures as search aids in the context of menu traversal through hierarchically structured pictorial databases. We take this outcome to be a reflection of the disambiguating role that pictures can play for verbal category labels.
