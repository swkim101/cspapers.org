Considering the widespread influence of Ethernet, a surprising amount of confusion exists concerning various important aspects of its design. Our objective in writing this paper is to spare future designers of local area networks the searching and speculation in which we were forced to engage.
 We begin by describing the policies common to Ethernet-like systems and by using an analytic model to study their behavior. We then precisely describe the mechanisms used in Ethernet itself, exploring its detailed behavior by means of a simulation model. Results from the two models, and particularly from their comparison, provide insight into the nature of low-level protocols in local area broadcast networks.
