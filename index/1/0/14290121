Mobile devices with both WLAN adapter and cellular capability, which are also known as dual-mode mobile terminals, are facing various challenges and problems in conventional WLAN discovery mechanisms, including inefficiency in network discovery, unavoidable energy consumption for frequent WLAN scanning, and privacy information leaking in network probing. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called WISDOM (Wireless Indicator Supervised Data Offloading Manipulation), which can efficiently predict the availability of appropriate WLAN access points (APs) for mobile device without the need of turning on its WLAN adapter in advance. WISDOM takes advantage of historical cellular fingerprints (i.e., the pairs of Cell-ID and Received Signal Strength Indicator) to directly model the WLAN coverage, and perform WLAN availability prediction based on the models given a query cellular fingerprint. Similarity and Classification methods are introduced to work in the framework as prediction methods. We have developed a WISDOM prototype and performed simulation and real field tests under various situations. The results showed WISDOM along with the proposed predication methods could reach at least an average of 80% in accuracy and saving 60% of power consumption on average for mobile devices.
