Consider a digraph which has labels on its edges which are <italic>k</italic>-dimensional vectors. In this paper we show it is possible in polynomial time to determine if such a digraph contains a zero cycle, i.e., a cycle whose edge labels sum to the zero vector component-wise. This solves the open problem of finding cycles in dynamic graphs which was posed by Iwano and Steiglitz. Our solution has a time complexity of <italic>&Ogr;</italic>(|<italic>V</italic>| log(|<italic>V</italic>|)<italic>Z</italic>) where <italic>Z</italic> is the complexity of a linear programming problem. For the important cases of two and three dimensions we present <italic>&Ogr;</italic>(<italic>Z</italic>) time algorithms. The linear programming problems we solve have at most 2|<italic>E</italic>| variables and <italic>&Ogr;</italic>(|<italic>E</italic>| + |<italic>V</italic>| + <italic>k</italic>) constraints.
