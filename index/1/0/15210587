An automata theory course can be taught in an interactive, hands-on manner using a computer. At Duke we have been using the software tool JFLAP to provide interaction and feedback in CPS 140, our automata theory course. JFLAP is a tool for designing and running nondeterministic versions of finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines. Recently, we have enhanced JFLAP to allow one to study the proofs of several theorems that focus on conversions of languages, from one form to another, such as converting an NFA to a DFA and then to a minimum state DFA. In addition, our enhancements combined with other tools allow one to interactively study LL and LR parsing methods.
