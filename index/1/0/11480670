We propose a method for selecting home appliances using a smart glass, which facilitates the control of network-connected appliances in a smart house. Our proposed method is image-based appliance selection and enables smart glass users to easily select a particular appliance by just looking at it. The main feature of our method is that it achieves high precision appliance selection using user contextual information such as position and activity, inferred from various sensor data in addition to camera images captured by the glass because such contextual information is greatly related in the home appliance that a user wants to control in her daily life. We design a state-of-the-art appliance selection method by fusing image features extracted by deep learning techniques and context information estimated by non-parametric Bayesian techniques within a framework of multiple kernel learning. Our experimental results, which use sensor data obtained in an actual house equipped with many network-connected appliances, show the effectiveness of our method.
