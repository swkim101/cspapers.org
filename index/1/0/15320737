Olfaction is a challenging new sensing modality for intelligent systems. With the emergence of electronic noses (e-noses) it is now possible to train a system to detect and recognise a range of different odours. In this work, we integrate the electronic nose on a multi-sensing mobile robotic platform. We plan for perceptual actions and examine when, how and where the e-nose should be activated.Finally, experiments are performed on a mobile robot equipped with an e-nose together with a variety of sensors and used for object detection.
