The Lovasz local lemma (LLL)is a powerful tool that is increasingly playing a valuable role in computer science. The original lemma was nonconstructive; a breakthrough of Beck and its generalizations (due to Alon and Molloy and Reed)have led to constructive versions. However, these methods do not capture some classes of applications of the LLL. We make progress on this by providing algorithmic approaches to two families of applications of the LLL. The first provides constructive versions of certain applications of an extension of the LLL (modeling, e.g., hypergraph-partitioning and low-congestion routing problems); the second provides new algorithmic results on constructing disjoint paths in graphs. Our results can also be seen as constructive upper bounds on the integrality gap of certain packing problems. One common theme of our work is a "gradual rounding" approach.
