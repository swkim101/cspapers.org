This paper proves three lower bounds for variants of the following rangesearching problem: Given n weighted points inRd andn axis-parallel boxes, compute the sum of the weights within each box: (1) if both additions and subtractions are allowed, we prove that Ω(n log logn) is a lower bound on the number of arithmetic operations; (2) if subtractions are disallowed the lower bound becomes Ω(n(logn/loglogn)d-1), which is nearly optimal; (3) finally, for the case where boxes are replaced by simplices, we establish a quasi-optimal lower bound of Ω(n2-2/(d+1))/polylog(n).
