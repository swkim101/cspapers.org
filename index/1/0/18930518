Experience writing a production compiler based on an attribute grammar is related. The compiler is Intel Corporation's Pascal-86 compiler which runs on a microcomputer-based system. An attribute grammar was written describing semantic analysis, storage allocation and translation to intermediate code. Attribute evaluation is done in two alternating passes [J] and the program tree is kept in intermediate files on disk. Various techniques for optimizing the evaluator were tried. Their success is reported and compared with other ideas from the literature.
