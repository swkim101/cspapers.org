Predicting accurate demographic information about the users of information systems is a problem of interest in personalized search, ad targeting, and other related fields. Despite such broad applications, most existing work only considers age prediction as one of classification, typically into only a few broad categories. Here, we consider the problem of exact age prediction in social networks as one of regression. Our proposed method learns social representations which capture community information for use as covariates. In our preliminary experiments on a large real-world social network, it can predict age within 4.15 years on average, strongly outperforming standard network regression techniques when labeled data is sparse.
