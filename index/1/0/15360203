This paper presents a new collection based on DBpedia and INEX for evaluating semantic search performance. The proposed corpus is used to calculate the impact of considering document's structure on the retrieval performance of the Lucene and BM25 ranking functions. Results show that BM25 outperforms Lucene in all the considered metrics and that there is room for future improvements, which may be obtained using a hybrid approach combining both semantic technology and information retrieval ranking functions.
