We present a simple and efficient algorithm for determining the position of static occluding bodies within a scene viewed by one or more static cameras. All information about the occluding bodies is derived from the perimeter of a figure moving through the scene. Once the positions of the occlusions are learned, successful reasoning about the observability of future figures in the scene is demonstrated. The method is extended to derive an estimate of the 3D position of the occluding bodies from multiple views. Several experimental results are described.
