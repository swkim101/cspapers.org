This paper presents the parallel enhancements which allowed the port of the Teradata Database from TOS, a proprietary ldbit Operating System, to an SVR4 Unix system. It gives an architectural overview of how the Teradata Database solves the main VLDB problems: performance and reliability. We will present he transition from the Database Computer DBC/lOlZ nodes (Interface Processors-IFPs and Access Module Processors AMPS) to the virtual processors (vprocs), which run concurrently in, a collection of SMP nodes. We also present the Parallel Database Environment (PDE) add-on package to Unix that makes this possible. We will discuss the results of our performance enhancement work and the directions for the future.
