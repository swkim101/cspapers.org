Modeling and simulation play important roles in engineering research and design. These techniques are especially helpful in the early phases where limited detail is available about the design and where design changes are less costly. In addition, high-fidelity models can be employed at the later stages to complement testing. Models are also important research tools for understanding complex phenomena.
