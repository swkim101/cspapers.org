Reputation is often cited as an instrument to enforce norm compliance: agents that do not follow the norms have their reputation decreased. In the case where reputation is conceived as a collective process, a kind of shared voices as proposed by Conte & Paolucci, to change the reputation is not a simple task. In this paper we propose to instrument multi-agent organisation with reputation artifacts that publishes objective evaluations of the performance of the agents with respect to their behaviour within the organisation. The members of the organisation can then read these evaluations and build up their reputation of others. The artifact serves thus as an instrument that aid in the building of the reputation of the agents. The evaluation of the agents is not simply based on their obedience to norms, but also considers their pro-activeness and their contribution to the success of collective tasks that are being executed in the organisation. This proposal is detailed and exemplified in the context of the MOISE + organisational model and the ORA4MAS platform.
