Comprising an estimated 60,000 hosts, the DARPA Internet is the largest existing internet. This paper traces the routing information protocols used by Internet gateways to build routing tables that define the paths datagrams traverse as they travel between end systems. We articulate the weaknesses and limitations of the most commonly used routing protocols, including RIP, GGP, and HELLO and examine how the protocols interact with each other and with EGP. Finally, we trace the evolution of routing as the Internet has grown from a single backbone (ARPANET) to its present inclusion of the ARPANET, Milnet, and NSFnet cross-country networks.
