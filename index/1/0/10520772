This paper describes a dynamic simulation of a space habitat. The simulation is configurable and controllable via external programs. Several groups have been using the simulation to study the impact of artificial intelligence tools on space habitat design and control. We outline some of the AI challenges and invite the AI community to use our simulation to further NASA's exploration goals.
