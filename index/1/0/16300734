In distributed and high performance applications it it is necessary to discover the aggregate resource capabilities of the collaborating peers. Another requirement of these applications is to locate the resources meeting the given aggregate search criteria. In this paper we present an unstructured peer-to-peer approach to aggregate node selection for resource management. Our objective is to efficiently calculate the aggregate value and search the aggregate node whose attribute matches or falls in the proximity of this value. Our contribution also includes the inclusion of an explicit network for aggregate query routing. We evaluated our protocol for accuracy, efficiency and communication cost through detailed simulations.
