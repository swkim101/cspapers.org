Over the last ten years, our department's breadth-first introductory course has evolved independently of other survey courses in computer science. Due to its success, we duplicated the ideas into our course for non-majors, and this has also proven successful. None of the published resources match our vision for these courses, and so the department has developed its own. In this paper, we describe the design of the majors course, and we introduce a variety of resources developed for both courses. These resources, which could be useful in many other courses also, are freely available through the Web.
