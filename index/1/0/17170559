This paper presents the hardware register management and instruction block control flow sequencing provided by the PDF block processing section of the Piecewise Data Flow machine, a proposed high performance computer architecture. Combined, these capabilities provide the maximum allowed execution overlap of instruction blocks with minimum hardware contention and high hardware utilization.
