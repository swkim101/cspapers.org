One of the main concerns in today's processor design is the issue logic. Instruction-level parallelism is usually favored by an out-of-order issue mechanism where instructions can issue independently of the program order. The out-of-order scheme yields the best performance but at the same time introduces important hardware costs such as an associative look-up, which might be prohibitive for wide issue processors with large instruction windows. This associative search may slow-down the clock-rate and it has an important impact on power consumption. In this work, two new issue schemes that reduce the hardware complexity of the issue logic with minimal impact on the average number of instructions executed per cycle are presented.
