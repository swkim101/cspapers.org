Accent is a communication oriented operating system kernel being built at Carnegie-Mellon University to support the distributed personal computing project, Spice, and the development of a fault-tolerant distributed sensor network (DSN). Accent is built around a single, powerful abstraction of communication between processes, with all kernel functions, such as device access and virtual memory management accessible through messages and distributable throughout a network. In this paper, specific attention is given to system supplied facilities which support transparent network access and fault-tolerant behavior. Many of these facilities are already being provided under a modified version of VAX/UNIX. The Accent system itself is currently being implemented on the Three Rivers Corp. PERQ.
