The Eclipse platform (http://www.eclipse.org) is designed for building integrated development environments (IDEs) for object-oriented application development. Building on the success of the Eclipse Technology eXchange workshops at OOPSLA 2003, 2004, and 2005, we invite original papers that describe potential new uses of Eclipse and how the core Eclipse technology can be leveraged, improved and/or extended for research and teaching projects. Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop. Due to the popularity of this workshop in the past, this year's ETX will be a 1.5 day event. Workshop topics include (but are not limited to) the use of Eclipse for: IDEs, supporting the software development process, debugging or testing, design requirements/specification, modeling environments or frameworks, aspect-oriented programming, program analysis and transformation, such as for refactoring, optimization, or obfuscation, computer-based learning, software engineering education, teaching foundations of object-oriented programming courseware, teaching an introductory undergraduate programming course, web service applications, rich client application.
