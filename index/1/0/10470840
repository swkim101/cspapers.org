In response to attacks against enterprise networks, administrators increasingly deploy intrusion detection systems. These systems monitor hosts, networks, and other resources for signs of security violations. The use of intrusion detection has given rise to another difficult problem, namely the handling of a generally large number of alarms. In this paper, we mine historical alarms to learn how future alarms can be handled more efficiently. First, we investigate episode rules with respect to their suitability in this approach. We report the difficulties encountered and the unexpected insights gained. In addition, we introduce a new conceptual clustering technique, and use it in extensive experiments with real-world data to show that intrusion detection alarms can be handled efficiently by using previously mined knowledge.
