In this paper, we present a dead reckoning sensor to support reliable odometry on mobile robots. This sensor is based on a pair of optical mice rigidly connected to the robot body and its main advantages are 1) this localization system is independent from the kinematics of the robot, 2) the measurement given by the mice is not subject to slipping, since they are independent from the traction wheels, nor to crawling, since they measure displacements in any direction 3) it is a low-cost solution with a precision comparable to classical shaft encoders. We present the mathematical model of the sensor, its implementation, and some experimental evaluations using the standard UMBmark benchmark for odometry.
