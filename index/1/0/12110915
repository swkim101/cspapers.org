Dynamic information flow tracking (DIFT) is a promising solution to prevent various attacks on software running on a processor. Previous hardware solutions usually mandate drastic change to internal processor architecture. More recent ones to minimize the change have proposed external devices for DIFT. However, these approaches intrinsically suffer from the high overhead to communicate with their external devices. Consequently, they either significantly lose performance, or inevitably make invasive modifications to the processor inside. Our solution also rely on external hardware for DIFT, but unlike theirs, ours exploits the core debug interface (CDI) to tackle the communication issue. CDI is provided in most commercial processors for debugging so that we were able to build our system simply by plugging our hardware to the processor via CDI, precluding the need for altering the processor itself. Experiments show that our hardware efficiently performs DIFT mainly thanks to the support of CDI that helps us cut substantially down the communication costs.
