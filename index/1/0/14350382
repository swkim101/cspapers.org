In this demonstration, we present FIN10K, a web-based information system that facilitates the analysis of textual information in financial reports. The proposed system has three main components: (1) a 10-K Corpus, including an inverted index of financial reports on Form 10-K, several numerical finance measures, and pre-trained word embeddings; (2) an information retrieval system; and (3) two data visualizations of the analyzed results. The system can be of great help in revealing valuable insights within large amounts of textual information. The system is now online available at http: //clip.csie.org/10K/.
