Disk mirroring has found widespread use in computer systems as a method for providing fault tolerance. In addition to increasing reliability, a mirrored disk can also reduce I/O response time by supporting the execution of parallel I/O requests. The improvement in I/O efficiency is extremely important in a real-time system, where each computational entity carries a deadline. In this paper, we present two classes of real-time disk scheduling policies, RT-DMQ and RT-CMQ, for a mirrored disk I/O subsystem and examine their performance in an integrated real-time transaction system. The real-time transaction system model is validated on a real-time database testbed, called RT-CARAT. The performance results show that a mirrored disk I/O subsystem can decrease the fraction of transactions that miss their deadlines over a single disk system by 68%. Our results also reveal the importance of real-time scheduling policies, which can lead up to a 17% performance improvement over non-real-time policies in terms of minimizing the transaction loss ratio.
