In order to maintain and improve the quality of life of elderly and people with cognitive impairments in their home, we must elaborate assistive technologies that will alleviate the effects of cognitive decline. The use of ambient intelligence, such as smart homes, is a way to provide assistance services. However, managing these services is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose an organizational centered multi-agent system (OCMAS) architecture in order to manage these services in a smart home. This approach allows to ease the management of services and the deployment of new services in the smart home system dynamically.
