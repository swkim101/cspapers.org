Access to real-world database systems and their workloads is an invaluable source of information for database researchers. However, usually such full access is not possible due to tracing overheads, data protection, or legal reasons. In this paper, we present a tool set to analyze and compare synthetic and real-world database workloads, their characteristics, and access patterns. This tool set processes SQL workload traces and collects fine-grained access information without requiring direct read access to the production system. To gain insights into large real-world systems, we traced a live production enterprise system of a Global 2000 company and compare it with the synthetic benchmarks TPC-C and TPC-E.
