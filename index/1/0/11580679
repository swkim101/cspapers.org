This paper presents a closed-form solution for metric velocity estimation of a single camera using inertial measurements. It combines accelerometer and attitude measurements with feature observations in order to compute both the distance to the feature and the speed of the camera inside the camera frame. Notably, we show that this is possible by just using three consecutive camera positions and a single feature correspondence. Our approach represents a compact linear and multirate solution for estimating complementary information to regular essential matrix computation, namely the scale of the problem. The algorithm is thoroughly validated on simulated and real data and conditions for good quality of the results are identified.
