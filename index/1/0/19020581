A network representation based on a basic wordoverlap 
similarity measure between blogs is introduced. 
The simplicity of the representation renders 
it computationally tractable, transparent and insensitive 
to representation-dependent artifacts. Using 
Swedish blog data, we demonstrate that the representation, 
in spite of its simplicity, manages to capture 
important structural properties of the content 
in the blogosphere. First, blogs that treat similar 
subjects are organized in distinct network clusters. 
Second, the network is hierarchically organized as 
clusters in turn form higher-order clusters: a compound 
structure reminiscent of a blog taxonomy.
