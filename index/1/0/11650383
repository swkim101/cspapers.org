Techniques such as structured programming and the use of a restricted set of control structures have transformed computer programming into a well-understood discipline. A sequence of courses in computing based on these principles has been developed and is described in this paper. The teaching of general principles of computing is in keeping with the liberal arts philosophy which stresses general ideas rather than specific applications.
