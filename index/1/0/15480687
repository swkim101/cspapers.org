N. mPc [1], an interactive environment for the design and evaluation o f microprocessor-based systems, has been developed and implemented at Case Western Reserve University. N.mPc contains five separate tools which work together to produce a functional register transfer level simulation of multiple processor, heterogeneous target systems. A system block diagram is shown in Figure 1.
 A meta assembler, metaMicro [2], allows the user to specify the Format, mnemonics, and associated bit patterns of the target instruction set. It maps mnemonics into bit strings, and outputs the instructions in a control/memory allocation graph which is machine independent.
