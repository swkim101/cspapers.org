The most important property of an STNU is whether it is dynamically controllable (DC) whether there exists a strategy for executing the controllable time-points that guarantees that all constraints will be satisfied no matter how the uncontrollable durations turn out. This paper provides a novel mapping from STNUs to Timed Game Automata (TGAs) that: (1) explicates the deep theoretical relationships between STNUs and TGAs; and (2) enables the memoryless strategies generated from the TGA to be transformed into equivalent STNU execution strategies that reduce the real-time computational burden for the executor. The paper formally proves that the STNU-to-TGA encoding properly captures the execution semantics of STNUs.
