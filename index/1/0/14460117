While accurate and complete modeling of the Internet topology at the Autonomous System (AS) level is critical for future protocol design, performance evaluation, simulation and analysis, still it remains a challenge to construct its accurate representation. In this paper, we collect BGP route announcements of ASes from Looking glass (LG) servers. By querying LG servers, we build an AS topology estimate of around 116 K AS links, from which we discover 11 K new AS links and 686 new ASes. We conclude that collecting BGP traces from LG servers can help enhance the current view of the AS topology from the BGP collector projects (e.g., RouteViews).
