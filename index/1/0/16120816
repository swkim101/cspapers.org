In todayâ€™s technological life, everyone is quite familiar with the importance of security measures in our lives. So in this regard, many attempts have been made by researchers and one of them is flying robots technology. One well-known usage of flying robot, perhaps, is its capability in security and care measurements which made this device extremely practical, not only for its unmanned movement, but also for the unique manoeuvre during flight over the arbitrary areas. In this research, the automatic landing of a flying robot is discussed. The system is based on the frequent interruptions that is sent from main microcontroller to camera module in order to take images; these images have been distinguished by image processing system based on edge detection, after analysing the image the system can tell whether or not to land on the ground. This method shows better performance in terms of precision as well as experimentally.
