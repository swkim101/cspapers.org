Interactive software is currently used for learning andentertainment purposes. This type of software is not very commonamong blind children because most computer games and electronictoys do not have appropriate interfaces to be accessible withoutvisual cues.
This study introduces the idea of interactive hyperstoriescarried out in a 3D acoustic virtual world for blind children. Wehave conceptualized a model to design hyperstories. ThroughAudioDoom we have an application that enables testing cognitivetasks with blind children. The main research question underlyingthis work explores how audio- based entertainment and spatial soundnavigable experiences can create cognitive spatial structures inthe minds of blind children.
AudioDoom presents first person experiences through explorationof interactive virtual worlds by using only 3D auralrepresentations of the space.
