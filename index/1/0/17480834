This paper describes the adaptation of an existing test collection 
for image retrieval to enable diversity in the results set to be 
measured. Previous research has shown that a more diverse set of 
results often satisfies the needs of more users better than standard 
document rankings. To enable diversity to be quantified, it is 
necessary to classify images relevant to a given theme to one or 
more sub-topics or clusters. We describe the challenges in 
building (as far as we are aware) the first test collection for 
evaluating diversity in image retrieval. This includes selecting 
appropriate topics, creating sub-topics, and quantifying the overall 
effectiveness of a retrieval system. A total of 39 topics were 
augmented for cluster-based relevance and we also provide an 
initial analysis of assessor agreement for grouping relevant 
images into sub-topics or clusters.
