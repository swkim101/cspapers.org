With the advent of online social networks, the use of information hidden in social networks for recommendation has been extensively studied. Unlike previous work regarded social influence as regularization terms, we take advantage of network embedding techniques and propose an embedding based recommendation method. Specifically, we first pre-train a network embedding model on the users' social network to map each user into a low dimensional space, and then incorporate them into a matrix factorization model, which combines both latent and pre-learned features for recommendation. The experimental results on two real-world datasets indicate that our proposed model is more effective and can reach better performance than other related methods.
