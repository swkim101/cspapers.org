The generation of complex movement patterns, in particular in cases where one needs to smoothly and accurately join trajectories, is still a difficult problem in robotics. This paper presents a novel approach for joining of several dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) based on a modification of the original formulation for DMPs. The new method produces smooth and natural transitions in position as well as velocity space. The properties of the method are demonstrated by applying it to simulated handwriting generation implemented on a robot, where an adaptive algorithm is used to learn trajectories from human demonstration. These results demonstrate that the new method is a feasible alternative for trajectory learning and generation and its accuracy and modular character has potential for various robotics applications.
