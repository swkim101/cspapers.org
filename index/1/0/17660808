We organized a machine translation (MT) task at the Seventh NTCIR Workshop. Participating groups were requested to machine translate sentences in patent documents and also search topics for retrieving patent documents across languages. We analyzed the relationship between the accuracy of MT and its effects on the retrieval accuracy.
