We present QURSED, a system that automates the development of web-based query forms and reports (QFRs) for semi-structured XML data. Whereas many tools for automated development of QFRs have been proposed for relational datasets, QURSED- to the best of our knowledge, is the first tool that facilitates development of web-based QFRs over XML data. The QURSED system is available online at http://db.cse.buffalo.edu/qursed.
