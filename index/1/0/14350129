Despite the burst in the availability of 00 analysis and design methodologies, languages, database management systems, and tools, relatively little work has been done in the area of 00 design quality assurance, assessment., and improvement. We badly need a better understanding of the properties of 00 system design, in the small and in the large, and their effect on quality factors such as maintainability, evolvability, and reusabiitym The understanding of desirable and non-desimble properties may contribute to improvement of risk assessment and product selection, better planning, more accurate assessment of maintenance efforts, improved productivity evaluation, a better foundation of design methods, improved system evolvability, and eventually to better design practices.
