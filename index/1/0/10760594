In this paper, we report on an empirical study on initiative conflicts in human-human conversation. We examined these conflicts in two corpora of task-oriented dialogues. The results show that conversants try to avoid initiative conflicts, but when these conflicts occur, they are efficiently resolved by linguistic devices, such as volume.
