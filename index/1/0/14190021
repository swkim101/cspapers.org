In geometric pattern matching, we are given two sets of points P and Q in d dimensions, and the problem is to determine the rigid transformation that brings P closest to Q. under some distance measure. More generally, each point can be modelled as a ball of small radius, and we mav wish to find a transformation approximating the closest d&axe between P and Q. This problem has many applications in domains such as computer vision and computational chemistry In this paper we present improved algorithms for this problem, by allowing the running time of our algorithms to depend not only on n, (the number of points in the sets), but also on A, the diameter of the point set. The deoendence on A also allAws us to effectively *process point se& that occur in practice, where diameters tend to be small ([EVW91]). Our algorithms are also simple to implement, in contrast to much of the earlier work. To obtain the above-mentioned results, we introduce a novel discretization technique to reduce geometric pattern matching to combinatorial pattern matching. In addition, we address various generalizations of the classical problem first posed by Erd8s: “Given a set, of n points in the plane, how many pairs of points can be exactly a unit distance apart?“. The combinatorial bounds we prove enable us to obtain improved results for geometric pattern matching and may have other applications.
