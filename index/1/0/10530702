An abstract machine is described for the CLP(<inline-equation> <f><sc>R</sc></f> </inline-equation>) programming language. It is intended as a first step toward enabling CLP(<inline-equation> <f><sc>R</sc></f> </inline-equation>) programs to be executed with efficiency approaching that of conventional languages. The core Constraint Logic Arithmetic Machine (CLAM) extends the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) for compiling Prolog with facilities for handling real arithmetic constraints. The full CLAM includes facilities for taking advantage of information obtained from global program analysis.
