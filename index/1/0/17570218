Physicalnet is a fully implemented middleware for wireless networks of sensors and actuators (WNSAs). Based on a lightweight service oriented architecture (SOA), Physicalnet allows the users to create administrative domains, in which owners of the nodes can share and protect their resources so that multiple applications can simultaneously use the same sensors and actuators with conflict resolution mechanisms. By using a general programming abstraction, named "bundle", Physicalnet allows programming across networks and administrative domains, and has a good support for node mobility. Other features of Physicalnet include using the Java language, supporting heterogeneous devices, and providing a chain of user tools.
