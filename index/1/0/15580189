This paper defines multiset-valued linear index grammar and unordered vector grammar with dominance links. The former models certain uses of multiset-valued feature structures in unification-based formalisms, while the latter is motivated by word order variation and by "quasi-trees", a generalization of trees. The two formalisms are weakly equivalent, and an important subset is at most context-sensitive and polynomially parsable.
