Using eye-tracking, we investigate how searchers interact with Web search engines which get affected by nonsensical results. We conduct a user survey to choose "stupid" components for our laboratory experiment and explore the most conspicuous ones. This research provides insights about searchers' interactions with different kinds of "stupid" search components, such as organic search results, vertical results, ads and automatic misspell correction. We investigate the influence of each class of "stupid" components on users' attitude to a search engine. We found that sticking in memory of the impression about the "stupidity" of the search engine depended on whether the users were finally satisfied with their searches, or did not find the answer. Experimental results show that classes of "stupid" components can be differentiated by their influence on users' attitude. The most negative impression is caused by word losses, word collocation breaks and inappropriate misspell corrections.
