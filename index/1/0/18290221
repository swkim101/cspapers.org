An effective story undcrstander must be able to reason about characters in the story, their affects, actions, plans, and goals, as well as the settings and important points of the story. In many systems this has been done with separate inference mechanisms for each class of knowledge structure. This paper proposes a story understander with a unified frame-based inference component used on each class of knowledge structure.
