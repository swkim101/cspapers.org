Visually extracted 2D and 3D information have their own advantages and disadvantages that complement each other. Therefore, it is important to be able to switch between the different dimensions according to the requirements of the problem and use them together to combine the reliability of 2D information with the richness of 3D information. In this article, we use 2D and 3D information in a feature- based vision system and demonstrate their complementary properties on different applications (namely: depth prediction, scene interpretation, grasping from vision and object learning)1.
