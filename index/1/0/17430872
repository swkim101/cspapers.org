The project KENSUR aiming in breaking down a compiler into a set of concurrent processes and in having them executed onto a network of processors is currently developed at I.R.I.S.A.
 This paper discusses three main aspects of the construction of this network.
 i) The various steps involved in the design of such a distributed system are described and the architecture adapted to the logical structure and dynamic characteristics of the application is presented.
 ii) The architecture of the currently implemented prototype is presented and problems with inter-processor communications and memory sharing are discussed.
 iii) The kernel system facilities for process management and synchronisation are described.
