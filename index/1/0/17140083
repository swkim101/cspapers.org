Apart from the layout of digital printed wiring boards (PWB's), no specific development has yet been reported on the layout of analog PWB's which contains not only placement and routing but also artwork to generate a variety of geometric wire patterns and assembly drawings, according to specifications. In this paper, we describe an interactive artwork system for such analog PWB's, which consists mainly of two programs; one is for generating wire patterns, and the other is for generating assembly drawings. This system has been in production use and has greatly contributed to the reduction of time and cost incurred in laying out wire patterns on analog PWB's.
