One of the most interesting developments in computer music in the past year has been the introduction of a new class of program, the computer accompanist. These programs do just what their name suggests: they play the accompanyment to a solo played by a live performer. On the surface, such programs appear to be no more than yet another version of “music-minus-one” records. What is different, and of intense interest from the perspective of human-computer interaction, is that this class of programs not only listens to the soloist, but exercises some degree of musical intelligence in making decisions about their performance. The programs behave like a human accompanist in that they are governed by the tempo and dynamics of the soloist. And, like a good accompanist, they do their best to adapt in a musical fashion when the soloist makes mistakes, plays extra notes, or leaves notes out. This panel presents the work of the two people who pioneered this field, Barry Vercoe and Roger Dannenberg. Vercoe’s presentation will takes the form of a video-taped demonstration, a brief talk, and some musical examples. Dannenberg will supplement his verbal presentation with a live performance/demonstration.
