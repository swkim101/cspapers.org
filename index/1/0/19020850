The projection-based force reflection (PBFR) algorithms were previously demonstrated to substantially improve stability characteristics of the force reflecting teleoperator systems and haptic interfaces without transparency deterioration in the steady state; however, the transient response of the PFBR algorithms suffers from relatively slow force convergence. In particular, the high frequency component of the contact force, which is very important for the haptic perception of stiff surfaces, is typically filtered out. In this paper, a solution to this problem is proposed which is based on the idea to separate different frequency bands in the force reflection signal and consequently apply the projection-based principle to the low-frequency component, while reflecting the high-frequency component directly. It is shown that, for bilateral teleoperators with irregular communication delays, stability can always be achieved by implementing the above described force reflection scheme, if the cut-off frequency of the complementary filters is sufficiently high and a certain weighting coefficient in the force reflection algorithm is sufficiently low. Experimental results demonstrate that substantial simultaneous improvement of stability and transparency is achieved using the proposed method.
