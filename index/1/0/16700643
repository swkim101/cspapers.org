This paper describes a 6 DOFs haptic cooperative platform dedicated to CAD objects simulation and virtual prototyping tasks. This system is based on several distributed physical engines linked together by a network subject to time delay. To deal with the destabilizing effect of time delay, a wave variable transformation is used. The wave variable formalism is adapted to the platform, therefore the behavior of each physical engine is similar. Several prototyping tasks have been tested on this system. A case is presented where two users are manipulating two distinct objects and interacting with each other.
