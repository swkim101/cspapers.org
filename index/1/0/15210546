A large number of images are continuously uploaded to popular photo sharing websites and online social communities. In this demonstration we show a novel application which automatically classifies images in a live photo stream according to their attractiveness for the community, based on a number of visual and textual features. The system effectively introduces an additional facet to browse and explore photo collections by highlighting the most attractive photographs and demoting the least attractive.
