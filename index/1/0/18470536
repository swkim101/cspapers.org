The known record complexity estimates for approximating polynomial zeros rely on geometric constructions on the complex plane, which achieve the initial isolation of the zeros and/or their clusters. We modify Weyl’s classical geometric construction for approximating all the it polynomial zeros in order to more rapidily achieve sufficiently strong their isolation. For approximating the isolated clusters of zeros, we propose a new extension of Newton’s iteration techniques yielding quadratic global convergence (right from the start), under substantially milder requirement to their initial isolation than one needs in the known algorithms.
