The rapid growth of wireless communications services and networks has led departments to consider offering elective courses on the topic. Textbooks exist that can help support such a course, but providing students with hands-on wireless networking experience can be difficult and expensive.We present the outline of a wireless networking course that can be offered with minimal resources, and describe our experiences using the approach. The students who took the initial offering of the course gained hands-on experience with wireless networking, did traditional sockets programming, and acquired the theoretical foundations of both traditional and wireless networking.Students implement a simplified IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ethernet MAC layer as a course project. In our case, the implementations took advantage of the Cybiko, a $50 wireless handheld computer targeted at teenagers. Our materials are currently being ported to other platforms, including Bluetooth-enabled Palms and networks of workstations. The latter platform will allow this project to be conducted without any special resources.
