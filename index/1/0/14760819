When I was first asked to talk to you, I had two questions. My first question was, “Do I have to relate what I have to say to design automation?” The answer was “No”. That seemed to me a bit odd but I accepted that. The second question was. “Do I have to talk all by myself for all of 40 minutes?” and the answer to that was “May be”. But I did find out last night that that's not necessary. I found out that I can ask out to indicate your agreement and disagreement, and to speak up and discuss and argue with me all during my talk. So my talk does no have to be an address or a lecture or a monologue, but instead can be an argument or a controversy. This is good and this pleases me, and this room is not too large for a good discussion.
 Now let me establish two rules with regard to this argument. The first rule is this: that if you don't understand any word which I use, you should hold up your hand and ask me to explain it. If you allow me to use a word that you don't understand, then I will choose some one of you and ask you to explain it. The other the rule this: that if you ask me a question that perplexes me and that I don't know how to answer. I will simply say, “Let's talk about that later.”
