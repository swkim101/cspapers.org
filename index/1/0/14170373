A system used by Gilbert Associates, Inc. to produce, via computer, electrical elementary wiring diagrams directly from Boolean expressions is described here. Discussion is concentrated on the aspect of using a functional input format to create circuits for control of power plant systems and equipment. Information is processed on a single medium of communication for all responsible participants. A “Functional Diagram” contains information from and for system, control, instrumentation, and circuit engineers, reviewers, management, subcontractors, clients, and computer input personnel and output interpreters. The Functional Diagram includes a logic table, circuit auxiliary information, notation for revision and development history, and provisions for special input and applications. All data used or created by the Elementary Wiring Diagram Design System, e.g. hardware and wiring diagram correlations, wire mark lists, switch developments, etc., are maintained in reference files. The Functional Diagram centralizes inter-communication of discipline and is a direct computer input sheet. Logic table usage is emphasized in this paper.
