These are hallmark challenges for important problems, such as humanoid locomotion. In order to ensure broad applicability, we assume domain expertise is minimal and limited to a generative model. In order to make the method responsive, computational costs that scale linearly with the amount of samples taken from the generative model are required. We bring to bear a concrete method that satisfies all these requirements; it is a receding-horizon open-loop planner that employs cross-entropy optimization for policy construction. In simulation, we empirically demonstrate near-optimal decisions in a small domain and effective locomotion in several challenging humanoid control tasks.
