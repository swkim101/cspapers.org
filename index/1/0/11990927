This paper describes the design and initial prototype implementation of a knowledge base management system (KBMS) for controlling database software development and maintenance. The KBMS employs a version of the conceptual modelling language CML to represent knowledge about the tool-aided development process of an information system from requirements analysis to conceptual design to implementation, together with the relationship of these system components to the real-world environment in which the information system is intended to function. A decision-centered documentation methodology facilitates communication across time and among multiple developers (and possibly users), thus enabling improved maintenance support.
