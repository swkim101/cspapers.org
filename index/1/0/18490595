In Pareti (2012) I presented an approach to the annotation of attribution defining it as a relation intertwined albeit independent from other linguistic levels and phenomena. While a portion of this relation can be identified at the syntactic level (Skadhauge and Hardt, 2005) and part of it can overlap with the argument of discourse connectives (Prasad et al., 2006), attribution is best represented and annotated as a separate level. The present work will present the results of an inter-annotator agreement study conducted in order to validate the annotation scheme described in previous work (Pareti and Prodanof, 2010). The scheme takes a lexicalised approach to attribution and is an extension and modification of the one adopted in the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2006). It comprises a set of elements, identified by the text spans expressing them, and a set of features. Preliminary applications of the scheme to annotate attribution in different languages (English and Italian) and genres (news, spoken dialogues and mailing thread summaries) will also be presented and discussed.
