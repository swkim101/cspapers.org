The purpose of this research is to detect low usability web pages from the behavior of users, such as browsing time, mouse movement and eye movement. We experimented to investigate the relation between the quantitative data viewing behavior of users and web usability evaluation by subjects. We analyzed the data to detect low usability web pages using discriminant analysis. Low usability web pages, 94.4% (17pages / 18pages = detectable pages / low usability pages) were detectable from the moving speed of gazing points and the amount of wheel rolling of a mouse. Moreover, this detection reduced the number of web pages which should be evaluated by half (46% = 89 pages / 192 pages = detected pages / all pages).
