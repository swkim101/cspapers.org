This paper describes a testbed and method for characterizing the dynamic response of the type of spatial displacement transducers commonly used in virtual environment (VE) applications. The testbed consists of a motorized rotary swing arm that imparts known displacement inputs to the VE sensor. The experimental method involves a series of tests in which the sensor is displaced back and forth at a number of controlled frequencies that span the bandwidth of volitional human movement. During the tests, actual swing arm angle and reported VE sensor displacements are collected and time stamped. Because of the time stamping technique, the response time of the sensor can be measured directly, independent of latencies in data transmission from the sensor unit and any processing by the interface applications running on the host computer. Analysis of these experimental results allows sensor time delay and gain characteristics to be determined as a function of input frequency. Results from tests of several differnt VE spatial sensors (Ascension, Logitech, and Polhemus) are presented here to demonstrate use of the testbed and method.
