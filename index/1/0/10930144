Traditional web application development often encounters tight coupling problem between access control logic and business logic. It is hard to configure and modify access control policies after a system has been deployed. In this demonstration, we present SecTag, a multi-policy supported secure web tag framework, to address this problem. We define a series of general-purpose secure attributes that meet the demand of fine-grained access control in web presentation layer. We also design a set of high interactive secure tags, which encapsulate secure features to provide reusable secure components for web development. A running example of SecTag is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
