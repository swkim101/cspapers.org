The test is computationally simple, relying on no external resources and only uses a set of trained word vectors. Experiments show that the proposed method is competitive with state of the art and displays high accuracy in context-specific compositionality detection of a variety of natural language phenomena (idiomaticity, sarcasm, metaphor) for different datasets in multiple languages. The key insight is to connect compositionality to a curious geometric property of word embeddings, which is of independent interest.
