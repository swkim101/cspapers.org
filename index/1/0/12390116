In this paper, a hybrid disambiguation method for the prepositional phrase (PP) attachment and interpretation problem is presented. 1 The data needed, semantic PP interpretation rules and an annotated corpus, is described first. Then the three major steps of the disambiguation method are: explained. Cross-validated evaluation results', for German (88.6-94.4% correct for binary attachment ambiguities, 83.392.5% correct for interpretation ambiguities) show that disambiguation methods combining interpretation! rules and statistical methods might yield significantly better results than nonhybrid disambiguation methods. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n The problem of prepositional phrase (PP) attachment ambigu!ty is one of the most famous problems in natural language processing (NLP). In recent years, many statistical solutions have been proposed: lexical associations (see (Hindle and Rooth, 1993)); error-driven transformation learning (see (Brill and Resnik, 1994), extensions by (Ye h and Vilain, 1998)); backedoff estimation (see (Collins and Brooks, 1995), extended to the multiple PP attachment problem by (Merlo et al., 1997)); loglinear model (see (Franz, 1996b), (Franz, 1996a, pp. 97108)); maximum:entropy model (see (Ratnaparkhi, 1998; Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994)). The disambiguation method in this paper has two key features: First, it tries to solve the 1This disambiguat ion method was developed for an NLI in the Virtuelle Wissensfabrik ( Virtual Knowledge Factory, see (Knoll et al., 1998)), a project funded by the German s ta te Nordrhein-Westfalen, which supported this research in part .

Second, it is hybrid as it combines more traditional PP interpretation rules and statistical methods.
