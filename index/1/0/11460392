In this paper, we investigate the problem of face clustering in real-world videos. In many cases, the distribution of the face data is unbalanced. In movies or TV series videos, the leading casts appear quite often and the others appear much less. However, many clustering algorithms cannot well handle such severe unbalance between the data distribution, resulting in that the large class is split apart, and the small class is merged into the large ones and thus missing. On the other hand, the data distribution proportion information may be known beforehand. For example, we can obtain such information by counting the spoken lines of the characters in the script text. Hence, we propose to make use of the proportion prior to regularize the clustering. A Hidden Conditional Random Field (HCRF) model is presented to incorporate the proportion prior. In experiments on a public data set from real-world videos, we observe improvements on clustering performance against state-of-the-art methods.
