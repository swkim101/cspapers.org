GROOP is an object-oriented toolkit for creating 3D computer graphics applications. It is designed for application developers who are not familiar with computer graphics, but are familiar with object-oriented programming. While application programmers are able to quickly create animated 3D graphical objects, the toolkit is also sophisticated enough for experience programmers. In addition to creating stationary 3D objects, the toolkit is used to construct animated objects. Sophisticated reusable articulated objects have been created for use in a variety of applications, similar to static 2D and 3D clip art available today.
