Many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of tutoring as a teaching strategy. Though much attention has recently been focussed on using the web to extend the reach of the university classroom to high achieving students, comparatively less attention has been paid to the potential of the web to bring personalized tutoring to at-risk students. In this paper, we describe Tutoring From the Desktop, a program in which high school students in California use Google Plus Hangouts to tutor students in Kohlapur, India. We show how a simple structured program can be used to over- come the barriers of time-zones, accents and much more.
