A streamlined and simplified variant of the usage-centered process that is readily integrated with lightweight methods is outlined. Extreme programming and other so-called agile or lightweight methods promise to speed and simplify applications development. However, as this paper highlights, they share with the "unified process" and other heavyweight brethren some common shortcomings in the areas of usability and user interface design. Usage-centered design is readily integrated with these lightweight methods. As in extreme programming , ordinary index cards help streamline the process of modeling and prioritizing for design and implementation in successive increments. Links to selected Web resources on extreme programming, agile modeling, and other agile processes are also provided.
