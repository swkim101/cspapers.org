The vision sense of standalone robots is limited by line of sight and onboard camera capabilities, but processing video from remote cameras puts a high computational burden on robots. This paper describes the Distributed Robotic Vision Service, DRVS, which implements an on-demand distributed visual object detection service. Robots specify visual information requirements in terms of regions of interest and object detection algorithms. DRVS dynamically distributes the object detection computation to remote vision systems with processing capabilities, and the robots receive high-level object detection information. DRVS relieves robots of managing sensor discovery and reduces data transmission compared to image sharing models of distributed vision. Navigating a sensorless robot from remote vision systems is demonstrated in simulation as a proof of concept.
