In this paper we will present three systems, ATLAS, THAM and VISULEX, which have been designed and implemented at GETA (Study Group for Machine Translation) in collaboration with IFCI (Institut de Formation et de Conseil en Informatique) as tools operating around the ARIANE-78 system. We will describe in turn the basic characteristics of each system, their possibilities, actual use, and performance.
