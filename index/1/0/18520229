This paper reports an experimental system of autonomous omni directional mobile tables and their automatic rearrangement. This system 1. detects the position of meeting tables using a camera on ceiling, 2. makes a route from the detected position by a motion planning and 3. arranges the table robots to the desired positions. We developed 4 table robots as multiple omni-directional mobile robots and constructed a position detecting system using LEDs (Light Emitting Diode) attached on the tables. A camera is fixed on the ceiling. We also developed a motion planning algorithm for the robots. Consequently, the table robots can move from an arbitrary arrangement to an arbitrary arrangement. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was confirmed.
