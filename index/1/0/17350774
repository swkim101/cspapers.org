This paper describes a possibility of a running humanoid robot based on the physical properties of an existing humanoid robot HRP-2L. To generate running motion, we develop a general method to control the total linear/angular momentum of a multi-link system. By this method, we can generate a reliable running pattern. Conducting simulations which take into account physical restrictions, we show that our humanoid robot can run at least at 0.5 m/s.
