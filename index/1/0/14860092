We present TinyWifi, a nesC code base extending TinyOS to support Linux powered network nodes. It enables developers to build arbitrary TinyOS applications and protocols and execute them directly on Linux by compiling for the new TinyWifi platform. Using TinyWifi as a TinyOS platform, we expand the applicability and means of evaluation of wireless protocols originally designed for sensornets towards inherently similar Linux driven ad hoc and mesh networks.
