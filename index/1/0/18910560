Additions and enhancements to software are prevalent issues within software development. When developers want to make enhancements to a piece of software they first have to build up an understanding of the relevant parts of the system. There are a number of challenges within this: where is the best place to add changes, what to reuse and identifying possible ripple effects. This research aims to investigate the utility of feature location techniques to address these challenges. Feature location can help in automating what traditionally is seen as a manual activity, i.e., searching within code. Feature location techniques may lead to improved software evolution by reducing the amount of noise the developer needs to look through to find code of interest for the three challenges above. However these challenges do not appear to be directly addressed within the feature location literature. This research examines how we can leverage the potential of feature location to create feature addition and enhancement techniques to address the above challenges uncovering techniques that help with positioning, reusing and evolving code.
