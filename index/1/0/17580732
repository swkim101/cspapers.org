Theoretical results have had much greater impact on computing practice than we are normally aware of, and the practical significance of theoretical results can be expected to become more prominent in the future. We discuss the past and present significance for data processing specialists of some results in analysis of algorithms, languages, and program proofs, and argue for a greater emphasis on computer science theory in data processing curricula.
