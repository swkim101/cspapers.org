The increasing proliferation of mobile handsets, and the migration of the information access paradigm to mobile platforms, leads researchers to study the energy consumption of this class of devices. The literature still lacks metrics and tools that allow software developers to easily measure and optimize the energy efficiency of their code. Energy efficiency can definitely improve user experience increasing battery life. This paper aims to describe a technique to adapt the execution of a mobile application, based on the actual energy consumption of the device, without using external equipment.
