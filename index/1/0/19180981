Increasing maritime traffic coupled with narrow waterways makes vessel schedule coordination for just-in-time arrival critical for navigational safety. Our contributions are: 1) We formulate the maritime traffic management problem based on the real case study of Singapore waters; 2) We model the problem as a variant of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP), and formulate mixed-integer and constraint programming (MIP/CP) formulations; 3) To improve the scalability, we develop a combinatorial Benders (CB) approach that is significantly more effective than standard MIP and CP formulations. We also develop symmetry breaking constraints and optimality cuts that further enhance the CB approach's effectiveness; 4) We develop a realistic maritime traffic simulator using electronic navigation charts of Singapore Straits. Our scheduling approach on synthetic problems and a real 55-day AIS dataset results in significant reduction of the traffic density while incurring minimal delays.
