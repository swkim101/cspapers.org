This paper presents the mechanical design of an ankle rehabilitation robotic device based on a 2-dof, redundantly actuated parallel mechanism. The parallel mechanism introduced in this paper has the advantage of mechanical and kinematic simplicity when compared to existing platforms while at the same time it is fully capable of carrying out all the exercises required by ankle rehabilitation protocols. The proposed device makes use of actuation redundancy to eliminate singularity and greatly improve the workspace dexterity. In addition, the requirements for high torque capacity and back-drivability are satisfied with the employment of a custom made cable driven linear electric actuator that combines the high force capacity with excellent back-drivability. The analysis undergoes the optimal design towards the maximization of manipulator workspace, dexterity, torque output and compactness of the device. Finally, the performance of the custom linear actuator and the prototype of the rehabilitation device are shown.
