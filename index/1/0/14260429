We propose a universal relation scheme database model based on the assumption that there is a unique connection among any set of attributes in a relational database. We use the notion of object ([Sc],[MU]) to give a database designer the ability to control how connections in the database are to be made. We show how semantic considerations that follow naturally from the unique connection assumption constrain how objects and the underlying base relations must be syntactically related. We illustrate and motivate our definitions and constraints with several simple examples.
