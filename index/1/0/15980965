We study gender discrimination of human faces using a combination of psychophysical classification and discrimination experiments together with methods from machine learning. We reduce the dimensionality of a set of face images using principal component analysis, and then train a set of linear classifiers on this reduced representation (linear support vector machines (SVMs), relevance vector machines (RVMs), Fisher linear discriminant (FLD), and prototype (prot) classifiers) using human classification data. Because we combine a linear preprocessor with linear classifiers, the entire system acts as a linear classifier, allowing us to visualise the decision-image corresponding to the normal vector of the separating hyperplanes (SH) of each classifier. We predict that the female-to-maleness transition along the normal vector for classifiers closely mimicking human classification (SVM and RVM [1]) should be faster than the transition along any other direction. A psychophysical discrimination experiment using the decision images as stimuli is consistent with this prediction.
