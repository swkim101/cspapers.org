In this thesis, we propose new validation schemes, COREV and R*COREV. for scheduling transactions optimistically in client-serverbased mobile database systems. In the mobile database system environment, validation throughput could be seriously degraded due to waiting time in validation process resulting from various delay factors in data transfer through wireless channels. Unlike the previous approaches, our schemes remove the waiting time by rearranging commit order of transactions. R*COREV is devised to reduce abort ratio by reanaaging the serializable order of them. For preserving serialimbility corresponding to the substantial execution order, which could be perverted easily in mobile environments, we devised a new scheme for assigning transaction number, called setialorder restoration scheme for transaction numbering (SORT). It enables transactions to be executed in a serializable order and validated without any waiting time.
