This study investigates the effects of distance on user attitudes and behavior in long-distance (networked) humancomputer interaction. Two laboratory experiments are presented. In the first experiment (N=123), users are interviewed by a computer that they believe is eider located in the same room, located a few miles away, or located a few thousand miles away. Results indicate that the greater the perceived distance, the greater the tendency to distort responses (i.e., give dishonest answers) in order to present oneself in a positive light. In the second experiment {N=23), the effects of distance in a persuasion situation are investigated. Results indicate that persuasion is significantly more likely to occur when the computer is perceived as being proximate, as opposed to distant. Implications for long-distance human-computer interaction are discussed.
