FDNY's MICS computer-aided dispatch system is designed about dual PDP 11/45s and supported in fallback by dual INTEL 8080 micro-processors. The computer processes alarms, assigns available units, notifies these units by voice and hard copy terminals located in the fire stations, monitors status changes of firefighting units and incidents, and dynamically adjusts firefighting coverage for maximum effect.
 This paper describes the MICS environmental simulator that was used to test and validate the MICS system development effort. Some results on system performance are presented to depict how the environmental simulator was used for system acceptance testing. Finally, encouragement is given to developers of other large real-time systems to adopt a design approach which considers simulated load generation and performance monitoring to be an integral part of the overall applications and systems software.
