The Minimal Manual proposed by Carroll, Smith-Kerker, Ford, and Mazur [6] has been demonstrated to improve the performance of novices learning a word processing system. However, little research exists to suggest a practical methodology for implementing the important features of a minimal manual. Using the GOMS model, we incrementally modified a manual to include certain minimal manual features: reduced verbiage, focus on real tasks, and error recovery support. An evaluation of the manuals with novice users demonstrated significant improvements in learning performance when the manual was modified to be task-oriented with explicit procedural steps for accomplishing real tasks.
