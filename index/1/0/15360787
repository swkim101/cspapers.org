A method of visually tracking a known three-dimensional object is described. Predicted object position and orientation extrapolated from previous tracking data are used to find known features in one or more pictures. The measured image positions of the features are used to adjust the estimates of object position, orientation, velocity, and angular velocity in three dimensions. Filtering over time is included as an integral part of the adjustment, so that the filtering both smooths as appropriate to the measurements and allows stereo depth information to be obtained from multiple cameras taking pictures of a moving object at different times.
