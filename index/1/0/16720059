This contribution addresses the development of new web sites reusing already existing contents from external sources. Unlike common links to other resources, which retrieves the whole resource, we propose an approach where partial retrieval is possible: the unit for data reuse is a node in a DOM tree. This solution permits the partial reuse of external and heterogeneous web contents with no need for client (browser) modifications and just minor changes for web servers.
