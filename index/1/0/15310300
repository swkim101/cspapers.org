This paper describes a hybrid model, combining both analytical and simulation techniques, which was developed to study the performance of a netted computer based system. The computer based system that was modeled is the Facility Assignment and Control System (FACS). This system is presently being deployed within several Bell Operating Companies to inventory and assign central office and outside plant facilities. A key feature of the model is its ability to characterize the dynamic nature of FACS. An understanding of this dynamic nature is necessary in establishing important operational guidelines such as allowable CPU utilization, levels of multiprogramming and priority of transaction processing. In addition, the model allows the user to investigate the sensitivity of the system to a wide range of conditions. Typical study items could include the effect of various load scenarios, ability of the system to meet performance objectives, and different hardware configurations. As part of this paper, both the practical aspects of modeling a netted computer based system and the theoretical development of the hybrid model are considered.
