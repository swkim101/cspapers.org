Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) provide a solution to increase the utilization of the scarce radio frequency spectrum. Building testbeds for CRNs is one of the main challenges that can affect the wide deployability of such networks. Many testbeds were proposed for testing CRN routing protocols, but most of them are either pure simulations or require high deployment cost for buying and maintaining the needed hardware devices on a large scale. We propose CRESCENT: a modular framework for testing CRNs routing protocols with cost-efficient and large-scale deployability. CRESCENT is based on general purpose computers without the need for any special devices leveraging their built-in Wi-Fi interfaces as the default interface. The framework is built on top of Click modular router to ensure the ease of the development of new routing protocols while providing new modules that are essential for cognitive radio protocols.
