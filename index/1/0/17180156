Wordnets play a central role in many natural language processing tasks. This paper introduces a multilingual editing system for the Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW: Bond and Foster, 2013). Wordnet development, like most lexicographic tasks, is slow and expensive. Moving away from the original Princeton Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998) development workflow, wordnet creation and expansion has increasingly been shifting towards an automated and/or interactive system facilitated task. In the particular case of human edition/expansion of wordnets, a few systems have been developed to aid the lexicographersâ€™ work. Unfortunately, most of these tools have either restricted licenses, or have been designed with a particular language in mind. We present a webbased system that is capable of multilingual browsing and editing for any of the hundreds of languages made available by the OMW. All tools and guidelines are freely available under an open license.
