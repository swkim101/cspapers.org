This paper demonstrates two annotation tools related to Propbank: Cornerstone and Jubilee. Propbank is a corpus in which the arguments of each verb predicate are annotated with their semantic roles. Propbank annotation also requires the choice of a sense ID for each predicate, defined in the corresponding frameset file. Jubilee expedites the annotation process by displaying several resources of syntactic and semantic information simultaneously; easy access to each of these resources allows the annotator to quickly absorb and apply the necessary syntactic and semantic information pertinent to each predicate for consistent and efficient annotation. Cornerstone is a user-friendly XML editor, customized to allow frame authors to create and edit frameset files. Both tools have been successfully adapted to many Prop-bank projects; they run platform independently, are light enough to run as X11 applications and support multiple languages such as Arabic, Chinese, English, Hindi and Korean.
