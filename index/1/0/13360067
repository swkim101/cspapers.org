Research on event detection in Twitter is often obstructed by the lack of publicly-available evaluation mechanisms such as test collections; this problem is more severe when considering the scarcity of them in languages other than English. In this paper, we present EveTAR, the first publicly-available test collection for event detection in Arabic tweets. The collection includes a crawl of 590M Arabic tweets posted in a month period and covers 66 significant events (in 8 different categories) for which more than 134k relevance judgments were gathered using crowdsourcing with high average inter-annotator agreement (Kappa value of 0.6). We demonstrate the usability of the collection by evaluating 3 state-of-the-art event detection algorithms. The collection is also designed to support other retrieval tasks, as we show in our experiments with ad-hoc search systems.
