The World Wide Web is one of the most significant multi-media applications ever developed-and therefore securing the web is one of the most pressing problems. There exist a number of approaches for securing the World Wide Web which, however, usually pursue what one might call a low level approach without being able to give adequate consideration to the specific requirements of this multi-media (or hypertext) system. 
 
The subject of this paper is the realization of an adequate security system, which is capable of detecting the different media and structures within hypertext systems and therefore apply different cryptographic mechanisms to them; this resulted in the development of the system PLASMA (Platform for Secure Multimedia Applications). 
 
PLASMA is a security platform designed within the frame of the Berkom R&D-programme at the Fraunhofer-IGD in Darmstadt whose prototype was developed to provide a means for secure multimedia telecommunications. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of PLASMA, it was integrated into a W3 scenario. The advantages of PLASMA when used in the World Wide Web as well as the architecture created for the integration process are described in the following section.
