Filtering techniques are essential in order to ef ciently solve constraint satisfaction problems CSPs A blind search often leads to a com binatorial explosion the algorithm repeatedly nding the same local inconsistencies Main taining a local consistency can strongly reduce the search e ort especially on hard and large problems A good illustration are the good time performances on such problems of maintaining arc consistency during search compared to for ward checking which maintains a lower level of local consistency On the one hand arc consist ency consistency is the most used ltering technique because it cheaply removes some val ues that cannot belong to any solution On the other hand other k consistencies k have important space and time requirements because they can change the set of constraints They can only be used on very small CSPs Thus in this paper we study and compare the ltering techniques that are more pruningful than arc consistency while leaving unchanged the set of constraints As arc consistency they only re move inconsistent values in the domains and so can deal with large CSPs
