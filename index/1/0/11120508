xSICSIH is an X-based graphical interface for the SICSIM computer simulation tool. Its graphical portrayal of register-level components tmwforms the ‘black box” SICSIM machine into a ‘visual computer”, helping students understand how computers work. Single step, fast-ezecution, and breakpoints are among the control features helpful for debugging assembly language programs. Automatic disassembly and format conversions and displays for comparing expected to actual execution reduce fiwstmtion in debugging loader, macro processor, and assembler projects.
