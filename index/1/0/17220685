Squint is a Java library developed to support the use of event-driven programming and network applications in programming examples for a CS1 curriculum. We present the design of the library, emphasizing techniques employed to minimize the effort students expend learning features specific to the library. We also compare Squint to an established library that supports event-driven programming in CS1, emphasizing ways in which the two libraries support similar pedagogical approaches.
