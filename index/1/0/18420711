Introductory computer science courses should incorporate a problem solving approach as a pedagogical framework. Many first courses hand out problems to be solved and ask the students for solutions, but very few explicitly teach a problem solving methodology. The authors have developed a simple methodology called the “Problem Solving Process” (PSP) which focuses on the designing of computer programs for realistic problem situations in the introductory courses. This Problem Solving Process (PSP) is formulated to allow the integration of problem solving throughout the course. Through this integration, the course guarantees active student participation in learning about problem solving techniques as well as performing the act of problem solving.
