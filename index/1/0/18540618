This paper deals with the implementation of a self-tuning controller into a PLC (programmable logical controller) library. The polynomial method is used, and the parameters for controller are derived using delta-model together with the pole placement approach. The recursive least-squares method and directional forgetting are used to estimate the parameters of the delta-model. The algorithm was implemented in the Tecomat PLC library, product of Teco, Inc. The laboratory tests proved that the algorithm implementation was successful
