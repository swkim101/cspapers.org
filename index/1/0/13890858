Surgeons can benefit from the cooperation with a robotic assistant during the repetitive execution of precise targeting tasks on soft tissues, such as during brain cortex stimulation procedures in open-skull neurosurgery. Position-based force-to-motion control schemes may not be suitable solution to provide the manipulator with the high compliance desirable during guidance along wide trajectories. A new torque controller with non-linear force feedback (FFE) is presented to provide augmented haptic perception to the operator, during the instrument's placement on the tissue. The FFE controller was experimentally validated with a pool of non-expert users using brain-mimicking gelatin phantoms (8%-16% concentration). Besides providing hand tremor rejection for a stable holding of the tool, the FFE controller was proved to allow for a safer tissue contact with respect to both robotic assistance without force feedback and freehand executions (50% and 75% reduction of the indentation depth, respectively). Future work will address the evaluation of the safety features of the FFE controller with expert surgeons on a realistic brain phantom, also accounting for unpredictable tissue motions as during seizures due to cortex stimulation.
