In practice, encoding the layout of each information source is impossible. This work presents a novel semantic search approach capable of extracting information from general tables. Semantic ontology allows our agents to read tables in the same knowledge domain with different layouts. In addition, a system of layout syntax and a set of transformation rules are defined to transform tables into databases without losing their semantic meanings.
