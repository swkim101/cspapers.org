Collaborative software development is nowadays inconceivable without optimistic version control systems (VCSs). Without such systems the parallel modification of one artifact by multiple users is impracticable. VCSs proved successful in the versioning of code, but they are only conditionally appropriate to the management of model versions. Conflicts which may occur when two different versions of one model are merged are detected in an unsatisfactory manner and consequently, automatic conflict resolution is hardly offered. In this work, a generic framework allowing precise conflict detection and intelligent conflict resolution for models is proposed.
