In the past decades, machine learning models, especially supervised learning algorithms, have been widely used in various real world applications. However, no matter how strong a learning model is, it will suffer from the prediction errors when it is applied to real world problems. Due to the black box nature of supervised learning models, it is a challenging problem to fix the supervised learning models by further learning from the failure cases it generates. In this paper, we propose a novel Local Patch Framework (LPF) to locally fix supervised learning models by learning from its predicted failure cases. Since the learning models are generally globally optimized during training process, our proposed LPF assumes that most of the learning errors are led by local errors in the model. Thus we aim to break the black boxes of learning models by identifying and fixing the local errors of various models automatically. The proposed LPF has two key steps, which are local error region subspace learning and local patch model learning. Through this way, we aim to fix the errors of learning models locally and automatically with certain generalization ability on unseen testing data. Experiments on both classification and ranking problems show that the proposed LPF is effective and outperforms the original algorithms and the incremental learning model.
