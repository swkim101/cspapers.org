A grid job's requirements description is very important, and raises interesting issues for resource management and scheduling within a grid environment. Several languages such as Globus Resource Specification language and European Data Grid JDL have been developed for describing grid jobs, the latest of which is Job Submission Description Language (JSDL). None of the current job description languages deal with applications or events, and all have limitation with regard to issues of time. 
 
In this paper we propose an extension of JSDL to cope with jobs' granularity, their composition, event and time. This extension will enable JSDL to support the description of application and their jobs flow, and allow the system to interrupt job according to event or time. It will also give the user the flexibility to determine the job execution times that assist to complete his/her job; expectation for job execution time is very difficult especially in heterogeneous environment. The new extension enables user to define and describe; more than one job and their relationship at the same time, event occurrence at any time during the job execution time and handle it, and job time. Our extensions have been evaluated on a simulated grid of 100 nodes which has shown better performance and excellent scheduling results of the grid. The introduction of event has also increased the reliability aspect of the grid.
