In this paper, we propose a new asymmetric robotic catapult based on the closed elastica. The conventional robotic catapults based on the closed elastica which the authors developed are the robotic elements for generating impulsive motions by utilizing a snap-through buckling. In a typical closed elastica, the two ends of an elastic strip are fixed to a passive rotational joint and an active rotational joint, respectively. Here we found that by adding only a range limitation to the passive rotational joint, compared to the conventional type, the deforming shape of the elastic strip becomes more complicated and 40% more elastic energy can be stored. Using this modification, we can develop a compact jumping robot which is able to leap over 700[mm] away and 200[mm] high.
