Subjective judgments in software engineering tasks are of critical importance but can be difficult to study with conventional means. Medical imaging techniques hold the promise of relating cognition to physical activities and brain structures. In a controlled experiment involving 29 participants, we examine code comprehension, code review and prose review using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We find that the neural representations of programming languages vs. natural languages are distinct. We can classify which task a participant is undertaking based solely on brain activity (balanced accuracy 79%, p
