In this paper we present a real-world application (the first of its kind) of machine listening in the context of a live concert in a world-famous concert hall - the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. A real-time music tracking algorithm listens to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra performing Richard Strauss' Alpensinfonie and follows the progress in the sheet music, i.e., continuously tracks the most likely position of the live music in the printed score. This information, in turn, is used to enrich the concert experience for members of the audience by streaming synchronised visual content (the sheet music, explanatory text and videos) onto tablet computers in the concert hall. The main focus of this paper is on the challenges involved in tracking live orchestral music, i.e., how to deal with heavily polyphonic music, how to prepare the data needed, and how to achieve the necessary robustness and precision.
