We investigate the problem of predicting the quality of automatic speech recognition (ASR) output under the following rigid constraints: i) reference transcriptions are not available, ii) confidence information about the system that produced the transcriptions is not accessible, and iii) training and test data come from multiple domains. To cope with these constraints (typical of the constantly increasing amount of automatic transcriptions that can be found on the Web), we propose a domain-adaptive approach based on multitask learning. Different algorithms and strategies are evaluated with English data coming from four domains, showing that the proposed approach can cope with the limitations of previously proposed single task learning methods.
