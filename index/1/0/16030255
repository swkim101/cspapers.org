In this paper we present our work towards developing a large-scale web application for digitizing, recognizing (via optical music recognition), correcting, displaying, and searching printed music texts. We present the results of a recently completed prototype implementation of our workflow process, from document capture to presentation on the web. We discuss a number of lessons learned from this prototype. Finally, we present some open-source Web 2.0 tools developed to provide essential infrastructure components for making searchable printed music collections available online. Our hope is that these experiences and tools will help in creating next-generation globally accessible digital music libraries.
