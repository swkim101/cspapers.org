Succinct is a data store that enables efficient queries directly on a compressed representation of the input data. Succinct uses a compression technique that allows random access into the input, thus enabling efficient storage and retrieval of data. In addition, Succinct natively supports a wide range of queries including count and search of arbitrary strings, range and wildcard queries. What differentiates Succinct from previous techniques is that Succinct supports these queries without storing indexes -- all the required information is embedded within the compressed representation. 
 
Evaluation on real-world datasets show that Succinct requires an order of magnitude lower memory than systems with similar functionality. Succinct thus pushes more data in memory, and provides low query latency for a larger range of input sizes than existing systems.
