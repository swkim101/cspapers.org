Parallel coordinates are an established technique to visualize high-dimensional data, in particular for data mining purposes. A major challenge is the ordering of axes, as any axis can have at most two neighbors when placed in parallel on a 2D plane. By extending this concept to a 3D visualization space we can place several axes next to each other. However, finding a good arrangement often does not necessarily become easier, as still not all axes can be arranged pairwise adjacently to each other. Here, we provide a tool to explore complex data sets using 3D-parallel-coordinate-trees, along with a number of approaches to arrange the axes.
