Motor Learning is heavily governed by sensory feedback, and artificially enhancing feedback influences learning as seen in our previous works. This study provides a model-based approach in determining the optimal gain schedules for augmented feedback on a visuomotor learning task. Using Gaussian process regression, we modeled the phenomenological process of learning to operate a robot with visual rotation. We then used Pontryagin's minimum principle to achieve the optimal feedback gain schedules that yield the fastest learning, the highest post-training performance, and both at the same time. Our results reveal that the instantaneous error feedback should be doubled (Ã—1.92) throughout the training if the fastest learning is desired. However if the highest post-training performance is desired along with the fastest learning, the feedback gain should be gradually varied from 1.92 to 1. This study explores a novel approach to optimize specific aspects of training for areas such as robotic-neuro-rehabilitation, teleoperation, sports coaching, and human-machine interactions.
