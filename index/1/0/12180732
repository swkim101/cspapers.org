In digital microfluidic biochips, cross-contamination of different biomolecule droplets is a major issue. Washing operations are introduced to clean the cross-contamination sites. Existing works have oversimplified assumptions on the washing behavior, which either assume unrealistic infinite washing capacity, or ignore the execution time constraint and/or the routing conflicts between functional and washing droplets. This paper presents the first practical droplet routing flow, which considers realistic issues including the finite washing capacity constraint, and the routing conflicts between washing and functional droplets. Effectiveness of the presented method are validated by real-life biochemical applications.
