This paper proposes a new unsupervised technique for clustering a collection of documents written by distinct individuals into authorial components. We high-light the importance of utilizing syntactic structure to cluster documents by author, and demonstrate experimental results that show the method we outline performs on par with state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we argue that this feature set out-performs previous methods in cases where authors consciously emulate each otherâ€™s style or are otherwise rhetorically similar.
