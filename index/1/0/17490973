Large display walls and personal devices such as Smartphones have complementary characteristics. While large displays are well-suited to multi-user interaction (potentially with complex data), they are inherently public and generally cannot present an interface adapted to the individual user. However, effective multi-user interaction in many cases depends on the ability to tailor the interface, to interact without interfering with others, and to access and possibly share private data. The combination with personal devices facilitates exactly this. Multi-device interaction concepts enable data transfer and include moving parts of UIs to the personal device. In addition, hand-held devices can be used to present personal views to the user. Our work will focus on using personal devices for true multi-user interaction with interactive display walls. It will cover appropriate interaction techniques as well as the technical foundation and will be validated with corresponding application cases.
