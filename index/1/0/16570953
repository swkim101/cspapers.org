This paper proposes an autonomous landing scheme for a small-scale flybarless helicopter equipped with low-cost navigation sensors. The main contribution of this paper is the design of a model-free motion controller that guarantees autonomous landing with prescribed transient and steady state response, despite the presence of external disturbances acting on the vehicle. The proposed control scheme is of low complexity and does not require any knowledge of the helicopter dynamic parameters. Hence, it can be easily implemented in embedded control platforms integrated on small-scale helicopters. In order to provide the controller with accurate estimation of the vehicle's state vector during the landing procedure, an asynchronous sensor fusion and state estimation algorithm, based on an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), has been also implemented. The performance and the efficiency of the overall scheme are experimentally verified using a small-scale flybarless helicopter in a real autonomous landing process.
