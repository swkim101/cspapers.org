Due to reasons of efficiency, digital logic simulation is normally performed by restricting timing accuracy to integral event timing. However, this restriction causes disadvantages which can be avoided if a sufficiently efficient event processing algorithm for nonintegral timing becomes available.
 The algorithm described here combines features of the standard linear list algorithm and the time-mapping algorithm often used for logic simulation. The combination results in a compromise between the timing accuracy of the former and the efficiency of the latter.
 The control mechanism required for the new algorithm can and should be directly exploited to improve the control and flexibility of the detailed simulation processing.
 Some of the advantages gained due to non-integral timing are described in the conclusions of this paper.
