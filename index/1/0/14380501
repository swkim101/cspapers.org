Spectrum sensing has been an active research area for the past two decades. Nonetheless, current spectrum sensing systems provide only coarse occupancy data. They lack information about the detailed signal patterns in each band and can easily miss fleeting signals like radar. 
 
This paper presents SpecInsight, a system for acquiring a detailed view of 4 GHz of spectrum in realtime. SpecInsight's design addresses the intrinsic conflict between the need to quickly scan a wide spectrum and the desire to obtain very detailed information about each band. Its key enabler is a learned database of signal patterns and a new scheduling algorithm that leverages these patterns to identify when to sample each band to maximize the probability of sensing active signals. 
 
SpecInsight is implemented using off-the-shelf USRP radios with only tens of MHz of instantaneous bandwidth, but it is able to sense 4 GHz of spectrum, and capture very low duty-cycle signals in the radar band. Using SpecInsight, we perform a large-scale study of the spectrum in 7 locations in the US that span major cities and suburban areas, and build a first-of-its-kind database of spectrum usage patterns.
