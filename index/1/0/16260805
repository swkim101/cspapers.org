Maturing technology has allowed the reliable deployment of robots into large-scale environments for monitoring and exploration applications. Planning techniques which ignore the value of information gathered during transit are able to operate efficiently in these environments and generate trajectories between specified starting and ending locations. Including the value of information gathered during transit increases the complexity of the problem and often leads to algorithms which are unable to scale up to large environments. This paper presents a method for planning informative surveys in large-scale unexplored environments. The proposed methodology does not require a starting or ending location as a constraint. Instead, robot operators are required to specify a survey template, which satisfies both vehicle constraints and the scientific objectives of the deployment. This constraint converts the exploration problem into an experimental design problem where the objective is to choose a location for the specified survey trajectory. A functional representation of the survey utility is learnt using a Gaussian process. This model allows the utility of candidate survey placements to be queried in a continuous space and in arbitrary locations. The proposed exploration method is demonstrated and validated on marine data. The objective is to design a survey which allows the spatial distribution of habitats in a large marine environment to be estimated accurately. The results show that the proposed exploration method is able to model the hidden survey utility function successfully and recommend informative survey placements.
