Face recognition under viewpoint and illumination changes is a difficult problem, so many researchers have tried to solve this problem by producing the pose- and illumination- invariant feature. Zhu et al. [26] changed all arbitrary pose and illumination images to the frontal view image to use for the invariant feature. In this scheme, preserving identity while rotating pose image is a crucial issue. This paper proposes a new deep architecture based on a novel type of multitask learning, which can achieve superior performance in rotating to a target-pose face image from an arbitrary pose and illumination image while preserving identity. The target pose can be controlled by the user's intention. This novel type of multi-task model significantly improves identity preservation over the single task model. By using all the synthesized controlled pose images, called Controlled Pose Image (CPI), for the pose-illumination-invariant feature and voting among the multiple face recognition results, we clearly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms by more than 4~6% on the MultiPIE dataset.
