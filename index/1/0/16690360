However, the boosting does not always have positive effect, it may also cause negative effect. Another issue of MBC is that it cannot deal with nonlinear separable data. In this paper, we show that MBC's process of using cluster relationship to boost the updating clusters phase may cause negative effect, i.e., cluster centroid may be skewed under some conditions. We propose a smart multi-task Bregman clustering (S-MBC) algorithm which identifies negative effect of the boosting and avoids the negative effect if it occurs. We then extend the framework of S-MBC to a smart multi-task kernel clustering (S-MKC) framework to deal with nonlinear separable data. We also propose a specific implementation of the framework which could be applied to any Mercer kernel. Experimental results confirm our analysis, and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods.
