We describe a Web-based interactive system, called PILOT, for testing computer science concepts. The strengths of PILOT are its universal access and platform independence, its use as an algorithm visualization tool, its ability to test algorithmic concepts, its support for graph generation and layout, its automated grading mechanism, and its ability to award partial credit to proposed solutions.
