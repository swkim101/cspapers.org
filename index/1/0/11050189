We present a novel attribute learning framework named Hypergraph-based Attribute Predictor (HAP). In HAP, a hypergraph is leveraged to depict the attribute relations in the data. Then the attribute prediction problem is casted as a regularized hypergraph cut problem, in which a collection of attribute projections is jointly learnt from the feature space to a hypergraph embedding space aligned with the attributes. The learned projections directly act as attribute classifiers (linear and kernelized). This formulation leads to a very efficient approach. By considering our model as a multi-graph cut task, our framework can flexibly incorporate other available information, in particular class label. We apply our approach to attribute prediction, Zero-shot and N-shot learning tasks. The results on AWA, USAA and CUB databases demonstrate the value of our methods in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.
