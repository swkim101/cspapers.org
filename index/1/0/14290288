A new methodology that employs the rate-dependent Prandtl-Ishlinskii model (RDPI) as a model and a compensator is suggested in this study for modeling and compensation of rate-dependent hysteresis nonlinearities of a piezoelectric actuator. The technique employs a restructuration of the model that ignores the need to derive an inverse model, which avoids the additional calculations required to formulate a compensator. The simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategy on modeling and compensation of hysteresis nonlinearities at various frequencies. The simulation results were followed by experimental study on a piezoelectric actuator that exhibits rate-dependent hysteresis nonlinearities. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be employed effectively for compensation of rate-dependent hysteresis nonlinearities without developing an inverse model.
