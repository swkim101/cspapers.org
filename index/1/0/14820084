We describe a powerful framework for designing e cient batch algorithms for certain large-scale dynamic problems that must be solved using external memory. The class of problems we consider, which we call colorable externaldecomposable problems, include rectangle intersection, orthogonal line segment intersection, range searching, and point location. We are particularly interested in these problems in two and higher dimensions. They have numerous applications in geographic information systems (GIS), spatial databases, and VLSI and CAD design. We present simpli ed algorithms for problems previously solved by more complicated approaches (such as rectangle intersection), and we present e cient algorithms for problems not previously solved in an e cient way (such as point location and higherdimensional versions of range searching and rectangle intersection). We give experimental results concerning the running time for our approach applied to the red-blue rectangle intersection problem, which is a key component of the extremely important database operation spatial join. Our algorithm scales well with the problem size, and for large problems sizes it greatly outperforms the well-known sweepline approach.
