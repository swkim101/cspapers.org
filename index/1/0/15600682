Diagnosability directly depends on the availability of observations, and can be guaranteed by different sets of sensors, possibly associated with different costs. In this paper, we tackle the problem of synthesizing observability requirements, i.e. automatically discovering a set of observations that is sufficient to guarantee diagnosability. We propose a novel approach with the following characterizing features. First, it fully covers a comprehensive formal framework for diagnosability analysis, and enables ranking configurations of observables in terms of cost, minimality, and diagnosability delay. Second, we propose two complementary algorithms for the synthesis of observables. Third, we describe an efficient implementation that takes full advantage of mature symbolic model checking techniques. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated over a comprehensive suite of benchmarks taken from the aerospace domain.
