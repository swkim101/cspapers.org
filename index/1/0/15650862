We consider the poblean of performin efficient seer& in a large database system. We wt a novel data slructurhig technique and show how a branch and bound search algorithm canusethepmposeddataorganktiontopnmetheseaxch space. Simulation results confirm that, using these techniquq a search can be expedited signikantly without incuring a large storage penalty. As a side benefik it is possible to organize the search to obtain suwessiveappro~tothe desired solution with considerable reduction in total search
