We outline a Data Structures project that visualizes the operation of depth first search (DFS) and breadth first search (BFS). We use color to illustrate how these two techniques differ as they traverse a search space. We present additional exercises that outline how students can further explore the underlying data structures, algorithmic concepts, and efficiency issues. We also provide a limited amount of student assessment to gauge the effectiveness of our approach.
