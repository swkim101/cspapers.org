Query processing with precomputed term pair lists can improve efficiency for some queries, but suffers from the quadratic number of index lists that need to be read. We present a novel hybrid index structure that aims at decreasing the number of index lists retrieved at query processing time, trading off a reduced number of index lists for an increased number of bytes to read. Our experiments demonstrate significant cold-cache performance gains of almost 25% on standard benchmark queries.
