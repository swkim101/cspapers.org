This paper reports the results of an empirical test of the performances of a large set of online list accessing algorithms. The dgorithms’ access cost performances were tested with respect to request sequences generated from the Calgary Corpus. In addition to testing access costs within the traditional dynamic list accessing model we tested all algorithms’ relative performances as data compressors via the compression scheme of Bentley et al. Some of the results are quite surprising and stand in contrast to someco mpetitive analysis theoretical results. For example, the randomized algorithms that were tested, all attaining competitive ratio less than 2, performed consistently inferior to quite a few deterministic algorithms that obtained the best performance. In many instances the best performance was obtained by deterministic algorithms that are either not competitive or not optimal.
