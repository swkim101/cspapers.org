Multi-processor and multi-core systems are becoming increasingly important in time critical systems. Shared resources, such as shared memory or communication buses are used to share data and read sensors. We consider realtime tasks constituted by superblocks, which can be executed sequentially or by a time triggered static schedule. Three models to access shared resources are explored: (1) the dedicated access model, in which accesses happen only in dedicated phases, (2) the general access model, in which accesses could happen at anytime, and (3) the hybrid access model, combining the dedicated and general access model. For resource access based on a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol, we analyze the worst-case completion time for a superblock, derive worst-case response times for tasks and obtain the relation of schedulability between different models. We conclude with proposing the dedicated sequential model as the model of choice for time critical resource sharing multi-processor/multi-core systems.
