We present a dependency-driven parser that parses both dependency structures and constituent structures. Constituency representations are automatically transformed into dependency representations with complex arc labels, which makes it possible to recover the constituent structure with both constituent labels and grammatical functions. We report a labeled attachment score close to 90% for dependency versions of the TIGER and TuBa-D/Z treebanks. Moreover, the parser is able to recover both constituent labels and grammatical functions with an F-Score over 75% for TuBa-D/Z and over 65% for TIGER.
