(WAIT) has made group projects a part of the learning experience of students in thre e computing science education courses. During the past two years there has been a continuing development of these group projects in which about one-hundred students have participated . The projects are now very much an integral part of the computing scienc e education courses for teachers. This paper examines a rationale for the inclusion o f group work in courses for Teacher Training in computing science education. It is argue d that group projects are a necessary component in teacher orientated courses. The conditions and arrangements for assessment and administration are discussed. The positionin g of the projects within a course are given. Outlines of two group assignments are presented and are used as illustrations of the principles and procedures described. Variou s areas of computing education, such as, computer assisted learning ; computer based instruction ; program design and program construction are covered by the assignments. Teachers ; and Computers in Learning. Each of these courses have major group projects a s a component of work and assessment. Each course is one semester in length. Compute r Assisted Learning introduces the author-languages COPILOT, PILOT and GNOSIS, while th e two other courses use the languages BASIC PLUS and FORTRAN IV, in discussion with th e application of programming to education. The major proposition of this paper is that a significant component of college o r university teacher-training courses in computer science education should involve student s in group projects. The approach adopted is first to reason for the proposition and the n to examine and evaluate some major group projects functioning at WAIT and use thos e examples to support the thesis .
