In this paper we present a structured methodology for evaluating cost of responses based on three factors: the response operational cost associated with the daily maintenance of the response, the response goodness that measures the applicability of the selected response for a detected intrusion and the response impact on the system that refers to the possible response effect on the system functionality. The proposed approach provides a consistent basis for response evaluation across different systems while incorporating security policy and properties of the specific system environment.
