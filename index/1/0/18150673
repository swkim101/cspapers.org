The proliferation of objectionable information on the Internet has reached a level of serious concern. To empower end-users with the choice of blocking undesirable and offensive websites, we propose a multimodal information filter, named MORF. In this paper, we present MORF's core components: its confidence-based classifier, a Cross-bagging ensemble scheme, and multimodal classification algorithm. Empirical studies and initial statistics collected from the MORF filters deployed at sites in the U.S. and Asia show that MORF is both efficient and effective, due to our classification methods.
