We introduce, TermSuite , a JAVA and UIMA-based toolkit to build terminologies from corpora. TermSuite follows the classic two steps of terminology extraction tools, the identiﬁcation of term candidates and their ranking, but implements new features. It is multilingually designed, scalable, and handles term variants. We focus on the main components: UIMA Tokens Regex for deﬁning term and variant patterns over word annotations, and the grouping component for clustering terms and variants that works both at morphological and syntactic levels.
