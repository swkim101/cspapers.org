Programs are often used in experimental sciences to test new models and theories against real-world data. One of the major bottlenecks in that process is the need to write the program which implements the new model. ø<subscrpt>0</subscrpt> is an automatic programming system which supports petroleum scientists in testing quantitative log interpretation models against log data from oil wells. The user (a petroleum scientist) describes a model by interacting with ø<subscrpt>0</subscrpt> in the natural terms of the domain. ø<subscrpt>0</subscrpt> then automatically writes a program which implements the model. The entire process takes from ten to twenty minutes and achieves results which previously required two to three weeks of effort.
