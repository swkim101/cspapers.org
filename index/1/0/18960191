In this paper we present a welfar e economic (marketbased) resour ce management model that is QoS-based, which models the actual price-formation process of an economy. This approach manages resour ce and QoS allocation optimally so that the total utility of thesystem is maximized through a tatonnement process, in which operating markets for each r esour ce is done sep arately. We use the constructs of application b ene t functions and resource demand functions to represent the system con guration and to solve the resour ce allocation pr oblems.
