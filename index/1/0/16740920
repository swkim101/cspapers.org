Online Social Networks (OSN) have changed the way information is produced and consumed. Organizing and retrieving unstructured data extracted from these platforms is not an easy task. Galean is a visual and interactive tool that aims to help journalists and historians, among others, analyze news events discussed on Twitter. In this tool, news events are visually represented by the very countries from where the news originated, the date when they happened and their impact in the OSN. Galean considers countries as entities, as opposed to mere geographical locations as most of the tools in the state of the art. As a consequence, it allows users to explore and retrieve news not only by their geographical and temporal context, but also by the relationship among countries. With this tool users can search for behavioral patterns of news events and observe how countries are associated in specific events. We expect our work to become a public tool that helps conduct historical analyses of social media news coverage over time.
