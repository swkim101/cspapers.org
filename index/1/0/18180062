Despite its merits the Turing test does not analyse intelligence in a practical way. The "intelligence" of psychologists is little better but consideration of psychological and neurological ideal experiments suggests that intelligence is judged on the basis of the decision-making in the chain 'input-decide-output'. We cannot separate any specific behaviour syndrome as 'intelligence'-display. 
 
Studying 'intellectual tasks' instead of 'intelligence' is little help since the criteria for identifying and assessing these are either anthropocentrically subjective or based on 'intelligence' itself. 
 
Intelligence is best seen as measuring the performance of the highest task selection and control mechanism in a machine. We cannot however escape the need to specify aims.
