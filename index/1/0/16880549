An algebra <italic>A</italic> is finitely presented if there is a finite set G of generator symbols, a finite set O of operator symbols, and a finite set Γ of defining relations x&Xgr;y where x and y are well-formed terms over G and O, such that <italic>A</italic> is isomorphic to the free algebra on G and O modulo the congruence induced by Γ.
 The uniform word problem, the finiteness problem, the triviality problem (whether <italic>A</italic> is the one element algebra), and the subalgebra membership problem (whether a given element of <italic>A</italic> is contained in a finitely generated subalgebra of <italic>A</italic>) for finitely presented algebras are shown to be ≤<supscrpt>m</supscrpt><subscrpt>log</subscrpt>-complete for P. The schema satisfiability problem and schema validity problem are shown to be ≤<supscrpt>m</supscrpt><subscrpt>log</subscrpt>-complete for NP and co-NP, respectively. Finally, the problem of isomorphism of finitely presented algebras is shown to be polynomial time many-one equivalent to the problem of graph isomorphism.
