In this paper, we describe a notification method with peripheral cognition technology that uses a human cognitive characteristic. The method achieves notification without interrupting users' primary tasks. We developed a shape changing device that change its shape to notify the arrival of information. Such behavior enables a user to easily find and accept notifications without interruption when their attention on the primary task decreases. The result of an experiment showed that the successful notification rate was 45.5%.
