This paper presents a method of evaluating unsupervised texture segmentation algorithms. The control scheme of texture segmentation has been conceptualized as two modular processes: (1) feature computation and (2) segmentation of homogeneous regions based on the feature values. Three feature extraction methods are considered: gray level co-occurrence matrix, Laws' texture energy and Gabor multi-channel filtering. Three segmentation algorithms are considered: fuzzy c-means clustering, square-error clustering and split-and-merge. A set of 35 real scene images with manually-specified ground truth was compiled. Performance is measured against ground truth on real images using region-based and pixel-based performance metrics.
