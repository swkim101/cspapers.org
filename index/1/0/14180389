In this paper we discuss the integration of active and passive approaches to robotic safety in an overall scheme for real-time manipulator control. The active control approach is based on the use of a supervisory visual system, which detects the presence and position of humans in the vicinity of the robot arm, and generates motion references. The passive control approach uses variable joint impedance which combines with velocity control to guarantee safety in worst-case conditions, i.e. unforeseen impacts. The implementation of these techniques in a 3-dof, variable impedance arm is described, and the effectiveness of their functional integration is demonstrated through experiments.
