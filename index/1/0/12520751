A method of stabilizing the biped locomotion in real-time is necessary to achieve biped locomotion that is stable and practical. We propose a new walk stabilization technique. First, we define the ZMP stability index. The proposed method compensate ZMP in real-time to control of inertia force and adjust feedback parameters according to the stability index. This results in altering the speed of walk instead of the walk pattern. As a result, we can compensate ZMP without changing the walking pattern and achieve both of the robustness against disturbances and high responsiveness for ZMP error correction. In this paper, after describing the proposed real-tune ZMP compensation method, the validity of the proposed method is tested using humanoid robot named 'morph3' that is created in our laboratory. Verification experiments, including simulation are performed and their results prove the validity of the proposed method.
