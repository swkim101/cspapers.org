This volume of proceedings presents the papers from the 2nd edition of the interdisciplinary workshop Re-coding Black Mirror, held on April 24, 2018 in Lyon, France and co-located with The WEB Conference (WWW2018). Participating to the topical debate of data ethics and algorithmic governance, Re-coding Black Mirror offers the research community tools to reflect on its role in the construction of the technological future and the potential societal implications. The workshop becomes a venue for computer scientists, data scientists and social scientists to create bridges of knowledge. The complexity of the societal phenomena emerging from the development in web technologies urge for interdisciplinary collaboration. Following the slightly futuristic approach to technology of the British-made sci-fi series Black Mirror, we called scientists to create their dystopic scenarios developed from their own existing technologies. Through this thought experiment, researchers considered potential ethical and social risks of technological advancements offering in some cases possible solutions.
