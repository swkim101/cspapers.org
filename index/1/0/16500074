Commercially available development platforms for flexible displays are not designed for rapid prototyping. To create a deformable interface, one that uses a functional flexible display, designers must be familiar with embedded hardware systems and corresponding programming. We introduce Flexkit, a platform that allows designers to rapidly prototype deformable applications. With Flexkit, designers can rapidly prototype using a thin-film electrophoretic display, one that is "Plug and Play". To demonstrate Flexkit's ease-of-use, we present its application in PaperTab's design iteration as a case study. We further discuss how dithering can be used to increase the frame rate of electrophoretic displays from 1fps to 5fps.
