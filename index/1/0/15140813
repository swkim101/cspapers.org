Immediately after each A* search, it runs an efficient procedure that updates the heuristic values of states that were just expanded by A*, making them more informed. Those updates allow GAA* to speed up subsequent A* searches. Being based on A*, it is simple to describe and communicate; however, it is outperformed by other incremental algorithms like the state-of-the-art D*Lite algorithm at goal-directed navigation. In this paper we show how GAA* can be modified to exploit more information from a previous search in addition to the updated heuristic function. Specifically, we show how GAA* can be modified to utilize the paths found by a previous A* search. Our algorithm — Multipath Generalized Adaptive A* (MPGAA*) — has the same theoretical properties of GAA* and differs from it by only a few lines of pseudocode. Arguably, MPGAA* is simpler to understand than D*Lite. We evaluate MPGAA* over various realistic dynamic terrain settings, and observed that it generally outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm D*Lite in scenarios resembling outdoor and indoor navigation.
