In this work, we propose a new concept for locomotion of a miniature jellyfish-like robot based on the interaction of mobile permanent magnets. The robot is 35 mm in length and 15 mm in width, and it incorporates a rotary actuator, a magnetic rotor, several elastic magnetic tails and a polymeric body embedding a wireless microcontroller and power supply. The novel magnetic mechanism is very versatile for numerous applications and can be tailored and adapted on the basis of different specifications. An analytical model of the magnetic mechanism allows to shape the robot design based on the specific application. The working principle of the robot together with the design, prototyping and testing phases are illustrated in this paper.
