The support of the superclass-subclass concept in object-oriented databases (OODB) makes an instance of a subclass also an instance of its superclass. As a result, the access scope of a query against a class in general includes the access scope of all its subclasses, unless specified otherwise. To support the superclass-subclass relationship efficiently, the index must achieve two objectives. First, the index must support efficient retrieval of instances from a single class. Second, it must also support efficient retrieval of instances from classes in a hierarchy of classes. In this paper, we propose a new index called the H-tree that supports efficient retrieval of instances of a single class as well as retrieval of instances of a class and its subclasses. The unique feature of H-trees is that they capture the superclass-subclass relationships. A performance analysis is conducted and both experimental and analytical results indicate that the H-tree is an efficient indexing structure for OODB.
