We present a robust real-time method which performs dense reconstruction of high quality height maps from monocular video. By representing the height map as a triangular mesh, and using efficient differentiable rendering approach, our method enables rigorous incremental probabilistic fusion of standard locally estimated depth and colour into an immediately usable dense model. We present results for the application of free space and obstacle mapping by a low-cost robot, showing that detailed maps suitable for autonomous navigation can be obtained using only a single forward-looking camera.
