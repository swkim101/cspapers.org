We present a framework for developing ontologies suitable for a dynamic environment, such as that for web services, and describe itsuse in a commercial system for resource discovery. This framework recognizes the importance of standards but allows for evolution in away that doesn't disrupt those adhering to the standards. The framework is based on the notion of discoverable resources which offer extensibility and security. The specific ontology we use in thesystem includes some salient features, such as attribute based matching rules and the corresponding constraint based search, attributes with dynamic values, and active queries.
