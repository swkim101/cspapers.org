We present a novel approach to processing continuous aggregate queries in sensor networks, which lifts the assumption of tree-based routing. Given a query workload and a special-purpose gateway node where results are expected, the query optimizer exploits query correlations in order to generate an energy-efficient distributed evaluation plan. The proposed algorithms, named STG and STS, identify common query sub-aggregates, and propose common routing structures to share the sub-aggregates at an early stage. Moreover, they avoid routing sub-aggregates of the same query through long-disjoint paths, thus further reducing the communication cost of result propagation. In this poster, we provide examples to illustrate the functionality and the communication savings of STG and STS compared to the existing tree-based approach.
