In the haemodialysis domain, we are implementing a caseIn the haemodialysis domain, we are implementing a casebased architecture aimed at configuring Temporal Abstractions (TA) to be applied to time series data. The advantage of a case-based approach is the one of “quickly” obtaining a suitable parameter configuration, simply by looking at the most similar already configured case, where configured cases are indexed by means of contextual information. The obtained configuration, together with the time series data, is then used as an input to a TA processing module, able to provide a set of qualitative states, trends and significant combinations of both as an output. TA processing results can finally be analysed to evaluate the whole reasoning activity, possibly leading to a revision of the case base content. The main contribution of this work focuses on the configuration of TA and on the design of the processing module to be exploited in RHENE, a system for case-based retrieval in haemodialysis, able to work both on raw time series data and on pre-processed (by means of TA) ones.
