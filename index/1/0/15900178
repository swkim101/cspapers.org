Markup languages, representations, schemas, and tools have significantly increased the ability for organizations to share their information. Languages, such as the Extensible Markup Language (XML), provide a vehicle for organizations to represent information in a common, machine-interpretable format. Although these approaches facilitate the collaboration and integration of inter-organizational information, the reality is that the schema representations behind these languages are reasonably difficult to learn, and automated schema integration (without semantics or ontology mappings) is currently an open problem. In this paper, we introduce an architecture and service-oriented infrastructure to facilitate organizational collaboration that combines the push features of the publish/subscribe protocol with storage of distributed registry capabilities.
