The exponential growth of the Web is resulting in vast amounts of online content. However, the information expressed therein is not at easy reach: what we typically browse is only an infinitesimal part of the Web. And even if we had time to read all the Web we could not understand it, as most of it is written in languages we do not speak. Rather than time, a key problem for a machine is language comprehension, that is, enabling a machine to transform sentences, i.e., sequences of characters, into machine-readable semantic representations linked to existing meaning inventories such as computational lexicons and knowledge bases.
