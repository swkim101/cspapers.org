High-security network transactions require the checking of the revocation status of public key certificates. On mobile systems this may lead to excessive delays and unacceptable performance. This paper examines small system requirements and options, with a view to improving performance. It is shown that the use of keyed hash functions (message authentication codes) with a pre-registration option reduces network latency and allows stateless servers.
