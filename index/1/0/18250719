The number of identified integer overflow vulnerabilities has been increasing rapidly in recent years. In this paper, we present a system, IntScope, which can automatically detect integer overflow vulnerabilities in x86 binaries before an attacker does, with the goal of finally eliminating the vulnerabilities. IntScope first translates the disassembled code into our own intermediate representation (IR), and then performs a path sensitive data flow analysis on the IR by leveraging symbolic execution and taint analysis to identify the vulnerable point of integer overflow. Compared with other approaches, IntScope does not run the binary directly, and is scalable to large software as it can just symbolically execute the interesting program paths. Experimental results show IntScope is quite encouraging: it has detected more than 20 zero-day integer overflows (e.g., CVE-2008-4201, FrSIRT/ADV-2008-2919) in widely-used software such as QEMU, Xen and Xine.
