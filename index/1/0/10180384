We address the problem of term elimination in DL-Lite ontologies by adopting techniques from classical forgetting theory. Speciﬁcally, we generalize our previous results on forgetting in DL-Lite core TBox to forgetting in DL-Lite bool KBs. We also introduce query-based forgetting, a parameterized deﬁnition of forgetting, which provides a unifying framework for deﬁning and comparing different deﬁnitions of forgetting in DL-Lite ontologies.
