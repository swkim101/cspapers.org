We study the role of visual reasoning as a computationally feasible heuristic tool in geometry problem solving. We use an algebraic notation to represent geometric objects and to manipulate them. We show that this representation captures powerful heuristics for proving geometry theorems, and that it allows a systematic manipulation of geometric features in a manner similar to what may occur in human visual reasoning.
