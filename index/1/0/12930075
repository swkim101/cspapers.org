The increasing utilization of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and wireless connectivity in modern vehicles has favored the emergence of security issues. Recently, several attacks have been demonstrated against in-vehicle networks therefore drawing significant attention. This paper presents an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on a regression learning approach which estimates certain parameters by using correlated/redundant data. The estimated values are compared to observed ones to identify abnormal contexts that would indicate intrusion. Experiments performed with real-world vehicular data have shown that more than 90% of vehicle speed data can be precisely estimated within the error bound of 3 kph. The proposed IDS is capable of detecting and localizing attacks in real-time, which is fundamental to achieve automotive security.
