The typical Internet user has data spread over several devices and across several online systems. We demonstrate an open-source system for integrating user's data from different sources into a single Knowledge Base. Our system integrates data of different kinds into a coherent whole, starting with email messages, calendar, contacts, and location history. It is able to detect event periods in the user's location data and align them with calendar events. We will demonstrate how to query the system within and across different dimensions, and perform analytics over emails, events, and locations.
