In this work, we describe an unsupervised framework for creating self-assist systems which can serve as virtual call center agents to guide the customer in performing different domain-dependent tasks (like troubleshooting a problem, changing settings etc.). We describe a framework for creating an intent graph from a corpus of knowledge articles from a given domain which is used in creating the dialogue system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in creating virtual self-assist agents.
