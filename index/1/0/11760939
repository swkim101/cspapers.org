An advanced communication system, the FlexRay system, has been developed for future automotive applications. It consists of time-triggered clusters, such as drive-by-wire in cars, in order to meet different requirements and constraints between various sensors, processors, and actuators. In this paper, an approach to static scheduling for FlexRay systems is proposed. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheduling method significantly reduces up to 36.3% of the network traffic compared with a past approach.
