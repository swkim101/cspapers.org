In this paper we present major design considerations for the development of international computer mail protocols. A simplified functional model for computer mail systems is introduced to serve as the basis of the discussion of the protocols. The general framework of the Reference Model for Open System Architecture proposed by the ISO is followed in the description of the computer mail protocol and design issues involved at each layer of the computer mail protocol are examined. The computer mail protocol is aimed at non-interactive communication between message system users.
