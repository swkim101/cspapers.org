We suggest a methodology and a language to permit the study of a system's behavior (functional validation, evaluation of global performances, critical situations). Every system is regarded as an interconnection of communicating modules functioning in a synchronous or asynchronous manner. The control section and the data section of each module are described separately in terms of respectively non-procedural and procedural sub-languages.
