In this thesis proposal we present a novel semantic embedding method, which aims at consistently performing semantic clustering at sentence level. Taking into account special aspects of Vector Space Models (VSMs), we propose to learn reproducing kernels in classification tasks. By this way, capturing spectral features from data is possible. These features make it theoretically plausible to model semantic similarity criteria in Hilbert spaces, i.e. the embedding spaces. We could improve the semantic assessment over embeddings, which are criterion-derived representations from traditional semantic vectors. The learned kernel could be easily transferred to clustering methods, where the Multi-Class Imbalance Problem is considered (e.g. semantic clustering of definitions of terms).
