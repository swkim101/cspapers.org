Answering a question of Rosenstiehl and Tarjan, we show that every plane graph with <italic>n</italic> vertices has a Fáry embedding (i.e., straight-line embedding) on the 2<italic>n</italic> - 4 by <italic>n</italic> - 2 grid and provide an &Ogr;(<italic>n</italic>) space, &Ogr;(<italic>n</italic> log <italic>n</italic>) time algorithm to effect this embedding. The grid size is asymptotically optimal and it had been previously unknown whether one can always find a polynomial sized grid to support such an embedding. On the other hand we show that any set <italic>F</italic>, which can support a Fáry embedding of every planar graph of size <italic>n</italic>, has cardinality at least <italic>n</italic> + (1 - <italic>&ogr;</italic>(1)) √<italic>n</italic> which settles a problem of Mohar.
