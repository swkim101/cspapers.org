Emerging memory technologies such as phase-change memory (PCM) and resistive RAMs (RRAM) have been proposed as promising candidates for future DRAM replacements. Due to the nature of how these memories operate, unique properties (such as non-destructive read and current-sensing) can be exploited to further subdivide memory and provide increasing parallelism with negligible overhead. In this work, we leverage these properties to design a finegrained non-volatile memory (FgNVM), featuring two-dimensional bank subdivision for tile-level parallelism (TLP) in a NVM memory bank, with much finer-granularity and increased parallelism than the one-dimensional bank subdivision for subarray-level parallelism (SALP) in a DRAM memory bank. With such new tile-level parallelism, three new memory access modes are proposed for further performance improvement and energy reduction: Partial-Activation, Multi-Activation, and Background Writes. Our experimental results show that the new architecture is highly effective in boosting non-volatile memory performance with significant energy reduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study fine-granularity memory access in emerging non-volatile memory architectures.
