In this paper, we describe the keyframe extraction and filtering process within the video content indexing system called Vitamin. The video content filtering system analyzes the source video and presents to the user a visual table of contents using thumbnail images. The tiltering process eliminates keyframes which do not contribute to the overall comprehension of the video contents. The user should he able to access particular points on a VHS tape, or MPEG file using this visual table of contents. We have analyzed over ten hours of video content from dierent movies, home videos, serials. and sitcoms. Our experhnents show that the number of keyframes is reduced to a manageable size, thus enabling only important visual information to be presented to the user.
