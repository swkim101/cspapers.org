CMPs enable simultaneous execution of multiple applications on the same platforms that share cache resources. Diversity in the cache access patterns of these simultaneously executing applications can potentially trigger inter-application interference, leading to cache pollution. Whereas a large cache can ameliorate this problem, the issues of larger power consumption with increasing cache size, amplified at sub-100nm technologies, makes this solution prohibitive. In this paper, in order to address the issues relating to power-aware performance of caches, we propose a caching structure that addresses the following: 1) Definition of application-specific cache partitions as an aggregation of caching units (molecules). The parameters of each molecule namely size, associativity and line size are chosen so that the power consumed by it and access time are optimal for the given technology. 2) Application-specific resizing of cache partitions with variable and adaptive associativity per cache line, way size and variable line size. 3) A replacement policy that is transparent to the partition in terms of size, heterogeneity in associativity and line size. Through simulation studies we establish the superiority of molecular cache (caches built as aggregations of molecules) that offers a 29% power advantage over that of an equivalently performing traditional cache
