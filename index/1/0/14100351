The mine detection hexapod robot COMET-III is driven by hydraulic power. Because of the strong nonlinear characteristic of the oil pressure system, conventional classic methods produce the flattery delay to the target orbit. In the unknown environment of minefield, the robot leg must follow correctly the walking orbit. The sliding mode control has strong robustness to parameter change or disturbance, and the preview control prevents the flattery delay by using a future target value. In this paper, we design a preview sliding mode controller, which incorporate the advantages of both control theory, and so improves control performance.
