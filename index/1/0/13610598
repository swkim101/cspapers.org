Software engineering involves the application of principles of computer science, management science, and other fields to the design and construction of software systems. Education in software engineering is fundamentally different from education in computer science, management science, or other constituent fields, even though it shares a large common area of concern. As we move toward the development of coordinated software engineering curricula, it is mandatory that we identify principles, not just random collections of techniques, on which to build them. Our research, teaching, and practical experience leads us to argue for five essential elements of any software engineering curriculum: computer science, management science, communication skills, problem solving, and design methodology. This paper will discuss these areas, illustrate their current application in courses, and indicate their implications for curriculum development.
