The software modeling community is primarily concerned with reducing the gap between problem and software implementation through the use of models that describe complex systems at multiple levels of abstraction and from a variety of perspectives. A model is an abstraction of some aspect of an existing or planned system. Models are created to serve particular purposes, for example, to present a human-understandable description of some aspect of a system or to present information in a form that can be mechanically analyzed.
