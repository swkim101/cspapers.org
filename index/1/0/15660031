The intricacy of real-time data service management increases mainly due to the emergence of applications operating in open and unpredictable environments, increases in software complexity, and need for performance guarantees. In this paper we propose an approach for managing the quality of service of real-time databases that provide imprecise and differentiated services, and that operate in unpredictable environments. Transactions are classified into service classes according to their level of importance. Transactions within each service class are further classified into subclasses based on their quality of service requirements. In this way transactions are explicitly differentiated according to their importance and quality of service requests. The performance evaluation shows that during overloads the most important transactions are guaranteed to meet their deadlines and that reliable quality of service is provided even in the face of varying load and execution time estimation errors
