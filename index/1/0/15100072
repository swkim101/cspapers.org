Resuming past work on coverage-based fault localization, we find that empirical assessments of its accuracy are subject to so many imponderables that they are of limited value. To improve on this situation, we have compiled a comprehensive list of threats to be considered when attempting such assessments in the future. In addition, we propose the establishment of theoretical lower and upper bounds of fault localization accuracy that depend on properties of the subject programs (including their test suites) only. We make a suggestion for a lower bound and show that well-known fault locators do not uniformly perform better.
