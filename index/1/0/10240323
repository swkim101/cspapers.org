In response to the technological development in recent years, many technology giants are making efforts toward Industry 4.0. However, many small-and medium-sized factories cannot even computerize and automate their factories, which is the foundation of Industry 4.0, due to inadequate capital and scale. This is because the majority of these factories are still using conventional machines in which the data cannot be digitized. Consequently, they cannot achieve the goal of Industry 4.0. This work therefore proposes a simple approach that facilitates the transition of these small-and medium-sized factories. The approach uses add-on triaxial sensors to aid in machine monitoring. The data obtained is analyzed for abnormalities using neural networks. Experiment results demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.
