In this paper we present our experience in applying Event Analyzer, a processing engine we have developed to extract patterns from a sequence of events, in the checking of medical orders of a CPOE system. We present some extensions we have implemented in Event Analyzer in order to fulfill the needs of those orders checking, as well as some performance evaluation results. We also outline some problems we are facing now to adapt Event Analyzer's pattern detection engine to support streaming orders in an on-line CPOE checking system.
