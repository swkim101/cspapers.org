This paper presents a control algorithm to guarantee stability and regulation performance for networked robotic systems with communication delay and packet loss. A local controller is developed to transform the robot dynamics so that the robot is passive with respect to an output signal containing position and velocity information. With the utilization of scattering transformation and a passive remote controller (for position regulation), the interconnected robotic system is passive and stable under time delay. Subsequently, we develop a packet management, called Wave-Variable Modulation (WVM), to deal with the proposed networked robotic system under packet loss. The passivity of the communication network can be preserved, and the performance of position regulation is guaranteed by using WVM. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control architecture.
