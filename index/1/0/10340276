In this paper we examine the lexical substitution task for the medical domain. We adapt the current best system from the open domain, which trains a single classifier for all instances using delexicalized features. We show significant improvements over a strong baseline coming from a distributional thesaurus (DT). Whereas in the open domain system, features derived from WordNet show only slight improvements, we show that its counterpart for the medical domain (UMLS) shows a significant additional benefit when used for feature generation.
