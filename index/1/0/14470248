A method that combines shape-based object recognition and image segmentation is proposed for shape retrieval from images. Given a shape prior represented in a multi-scale curvature form, the proposed method identifies the target objects in images by grouping oversegmented image regions. The problem is formulated in a unified probabilistic framework, and object segmentation and recognition are accomplished simultaneously by a stochastic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) mechanism. Within each sampling move during the simulation process, probabilistic region grouping operations are influenced by both the image information and the shape similarity constraint. The latter constraint is measured by a partial shape matching process. A generalized cluster sampling algorithm is presented in A. Barbu and S. Zhu (2003), combined with a large sampling jump and other implementation improvements, and greatly speeds up the overall stochastic process. The proposed method supports the segmentation and recognition of multiple occluded objects in images. Experimental results are provided for both synthetic and real images.
