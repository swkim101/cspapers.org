Design automation processors are best known for their ability to competently accomplish the more tedious tasks in computer design. Almost invariably they are restricted to tasks which occur after the logic design is completed (diagnosis, partitioning, assignment, routing, etc.). The procedure presented in this paper may be applied to take fuller advantage of the computer's capabilities.
