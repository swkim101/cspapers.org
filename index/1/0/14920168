We ran three studies designed to investigate the impact of user and task characteristics on user performance and satisfaction in different visualization contexts. Eye-tracking data collected in each study was analyzed to uncover possible interactions between user/task characteristics and gaze behavior during visualization processing. Finally, we investigated user models that can assess user characteristics relevant for adaptation from eye tracking data.
