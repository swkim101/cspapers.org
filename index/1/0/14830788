MAODV (Multicast Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector), a well-known multicast routing protocol in MANETs, has been proposed over ten years. It is originally designed for single-source multicast operation and thus inefficient when applied to multisource scenario. In addition, MAODV requires a route rediscovery procedure to recover multicast routing tree from partition of the tree and takes a long time to recover the multicast routing whenever the root of the tree is failed. By modifying the MAODV protocol, this research presented a multisource multicast routing and partition recovery scheme in MANETs. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed multisource multicast routing method can improve the bottleneck problem of MAODV in data delivery and the proposed partition recovery scheme can achieve shorter recovery time than that of MAODV with the lower control overhead.
