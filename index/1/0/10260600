In this paper a number of classification rule evaluation measures are considered. In particular the authors review the use of a variety of selection techniques used to order classification rules contained in a classifier, and a number of mechanisms used to classify unseen data. The authors demonstrate that rule ordering founded on the size of antecedent works well given certain conditions.
