We present Walkie-Markie - an indoor pathway mapping system that can automatically reconstruct internal pathway maps of buildings without any a-priori knowledge about the building, such as the floor plan or access point locations. Central to Walkie-Markie is a novel exploitation of the WiFi infrastructure to define landmarks (WiFi-Marks) to fuse crowdsourced user trajectories obtained from inertial sensors on users' mobile phones. WiFi-Marks are special pathway locations at which the trend of the received WiFi signal strength changes from increasing to decreasing when moving along the pathway. By embedding these WiFi-Marks in a 2D plane using a newly devised algorithm and connecting them with calibrated user trajectories, Walkie-Markie is able to infer pathway maps with high accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that Walkie-Markie is able to reconstruct a high-quality pathway map for a real office-building floor after only 5-6 rounds of walks, with accuracy gradually improving as more user data becomes available. The maximum discrepancy between the inferred pathway map and the real one is within 3m and 2.8m for the anchor nodes and path segments, respectively.
