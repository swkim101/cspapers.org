We prove that, for <i>k</i> â‰¥ 2, the <i>k-orientability threshold</i> for the random graph <i>G</i><sub><i>n, p</i></sub> coincides with the threshold at which the (<i>k</i> + 1)-core has average degree 2<i>k</i>. The proof involves the analysis of a heuristic algorithm that attempts to find a <i>k</i>-orientation of the random graph.
 The <i>k</i>-orientation threshold has several applications including offline balanced allocation with a limit of <i>k</i> on maximum bin-size, perfect hashing with a limit of <i>k</i> on maximum chain-length, and concurrent access to parallel memories through redundancy,
