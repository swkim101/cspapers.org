Parallel Test Paper Generation (k-TPG) is a biobjective distributed resource allocation problem, which aims to generate multiple similarly optimal test papers automatically according to multiple user-specified criteria. Generating high-quality parallel test papers is challenging due to its NP-hardness in maximizing the collective objective functions. In this paper, we propose a Collective Biobjective Optimization (CBO) algorithm for solving k-TPG. CBO is a multi-step greedy-based approximation algorithm, which exploits the submodular property for biobjective optimization of k-TPG. Experiment results have shown that CBO has drastically outperformed the current techniques in terms of paper quality and runtime efficiency.
