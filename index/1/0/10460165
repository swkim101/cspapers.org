This paper describes some of the research conducted with the aim to develop a proposal for an ISO standard for the annotation of semantic relations in discourse. A range of theoretical approaches and annotation efforts were analysed for their commonalities and their differences, in order to deﬁne a clear delineation of the scope of the ISO effort and to give it a solid theoretical and empirical basis. A set of 20 core discourse relations was identiﬁed as indispensible for an annotation standard, and these relations were provided with clear deﬁnitions and illustrative examples from existing corpora. The ISO principles for linguistic annotation in general and semantic annotation in particular were applied to design a markup language (DRelML) for discourse relation annotation.
