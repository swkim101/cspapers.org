Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems and Semantic Web are two novel technologies that face a lot of shortcomings if considered as isolated paradigms. We present an approach that utilizes ontologies to set up a peer profile containing all the data, necessary for peer-to-peer interoperability. Using this profile can help eliminate some major issues persistent in current P2P networks, such as security, resource aggregation, group management. We also consider applications of peer profiling for Semantic Web built on P2P networks, such as an improved semantic search for resources, not explicitly published on the Web, but available in a P2P system. We develop the ontology-based peer profile in RDF format and demonstrate its manifold benefits for peer communication and knowledge discovery in both P2P networks and Semantic Web.
