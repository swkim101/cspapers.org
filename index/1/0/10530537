Some queries on a relational database are analyzed. This analysis results in new concepts for a high-level data manipulation anguage. In the proposed language the cardinal number concept from set theory is applied, using semantic information on the contents of a database. Each query formulation in this language consists of a small number of easily manageable expressions. This means that the simple relational data structures also are reflected in the programs which operate on these structures.
