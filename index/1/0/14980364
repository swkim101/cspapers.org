A storage structure for B-trees is presented which is robust in that any pair of changes to structural fields of an instance of the structure can be detected, as well as many sets of larger numbers of changes. Included in the paper are a motivation for robustness as a design criterion, cost and performance implications of the B-tree implementation, and a solution to the subproblem of a robust implementation for each node's contiguous list of pointers and keys.
