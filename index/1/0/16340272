In the last years Blog Search has been a new exciting task in Information Retrieval. The presence of user generated information with valuable opinions makes this field of huge interest. In this poster we use part of this information, the readers' comments, to improve the quality of post snippets with the objective of enhancing the user access to the relevant posts in a result list. We propose a simple method for snippet generation based on sentence selection, using the comments to guide the selection process. We evaluated our approach with standard TREC methodology in the Blogs06 collection showing significant improvements up to 32% in terms of MAP over the baseline.
