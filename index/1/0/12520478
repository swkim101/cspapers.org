In this paper, we present Oyster, a Peer-to-Peer system for exchanging ontology metadata among communities in the Semantic Web. Oyster exploits semantic web techniques in data representation, query formulation and query result presentation to provide an online solution for sharing ontologies, thus assisting researchers in re-using existing ontologies.
