A computer controlled system for making positional measurements on a glass plate to an accuracy of 1 Î¼m is described. Through the use of a computer, the short-comings of the Do-all coordinate measuring machine (CMM) are overcome allowing the effective use of the inherent accuracy of the CMM. The result is a measurement system having greatly enhanced capability. A plate having an array of 208 data points can be measured in about two hours, whereas without the computer control measurement of such a large array with the CMM is not feasible.
