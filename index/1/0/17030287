We present a novel approach called Minimal Reconstruction Bias Hashing (MRH) to learn similarity preserving binary codes that jointly optimize both projection and quantization stages. Our work tackles an important problem of how to elegantly connect optimizing projection with optimizing quantization, and to maximize the complementary effects of two stages. Distinct from previous works, MRH can adaptively adjust the projection dimensionality to balance the information loss between projection and quantization. It is formulated as a problem of minimizing reconstruction bias of compressed signals. Extensive experiment results have shown the proposed MRH significantly outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art methods over several widely used benchmarks.
