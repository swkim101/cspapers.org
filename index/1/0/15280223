Gibbs sampling also known as Glauber dynamics is a popular technique for sampling high dimensional distributions defined on graphs. Of special interest is the behavior of Gibbs sampling on the Erdős‐Rényi random graph G(n,d/n), where each edge is chosen independently with probability d/n and d is fixed. While the average degree in G(n,d/n) is d(1 ‐ o(1)), it contains many nodes of degree of order log n/log log n.
