We propose a framework for efficiently disseminating large data items associated to locations where they are produced by vehicles and desired by drivers of different vehicles in a VANET. The framework consists of a scheme for aggregating drivers' demand for location dependent data using soft-state sketches, a scheme for understanding the condition of data dissemination, and a strategy for selecting data to be transmitted according to the aggregated demands and the condition of the existence of neighboring vehicles which have the same data.
