Because word boundaries are not apparently indicated in Asiart languages including Japanese, word indexing cannot simply be applied. Although dictionary-based text segmentation techniques enable word indexing, they have some problems such as dictionary maintenance. N-gram indexing, another conventional indexing method, suffers from increase in index size. This paper proposes a new statistical indexing method. We fist propose a segmentation method for Japanese text which uses statistical information of characters. It needs only a small amount of statistic information and computation, and does not need constant maintenance. We secondly propose a new indexing strategy which extracts some overlapping segments in addition to the segments extracted using the existing strategy. Thus it increases the effectiveness of retrieval.
