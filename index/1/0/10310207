Entity Linking (EL) systems' performance is uneven across corpora or depending on entity types. To help overcome this issue, we propose an EL workflow that combines the outputs of several open source EL systems, and selects annotations via weighted voting. The results are displayed on a UI that allows the users to navigate the corpus and to evaluate annotation quality based on several metrics.
