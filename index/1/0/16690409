In this paper, a new multifunctional compliant joint is introduced for the design of unibody robotic mechanisms. Developed in the demanding context of interventional MRI, the compliant joint integrates kinematic, actuation, braking and sensing functions. Such integration is performed thanks to multimaterial additive manufacturing. Design and experimental behavior of the component are presented. A robotic assistant built with the proposed component and made of a single element is then introduced. It offers interesting performances while being compact and MR-compatible.
