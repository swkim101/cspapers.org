Social networks mediate not only the relations between entities, but also the patterns of information propagation among them and their communication behavior. In this paper, we extensively study the temporal annotations (e.g., time stamps and duration) of historical communications in social networks and propose two novel tools -- communication motifs and maximum-flow communication motifs -- for characterizations of the patterns of information propagation in social networks. Using these motifs, we verify the following hypothesis in social communication network: 1) the functional behavioral patterns of information propagation within both social networks are stable over time; 2) the patterns of information propagation in synchronous and asynchronous social networks are different and sensitive to the cost of communication; and 3) the speed and the amount of information that is propagated through a network are correlated and dependent on individual profiles.
