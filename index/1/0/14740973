Transitive retrieval and triangulation have been proposed as ways to improve cross-language retrieval quality when translation resources have poor lexical coverage. We demonstrate that cross-language retrieval is viable for European languages with no translation resources at all; that transitive retrieval without translation does not suffer the drop-off in retrieval quality sometimes reported for transitive retrieval with translation; and that triangulation that combines multiple transitive runs with no translation can boost performance over direct translation-free retrieval.
