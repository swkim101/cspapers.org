This paper presents some preliminary results toward the automatic parallelization of uniprocessor FORTRAN code on distributed-memory parallel processors (DMPPs). The paper introduces Oxygen, a compiler for a DMPP under development at the Laboratory. The design of Oxygen and its parallelization strategy are discussed, and an analysis of its most significant components is presented, together with performance benchmarks. Oxygen carries out data consistency analysis at run-time; our results show that the overhead introduced is acceptable. Run-time data consistency analysis may also be the only viable approach to parallelize certain “hard” algorithms, as we will show in this study.
