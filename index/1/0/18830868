The Trans protocol is a communications protocol that exploits the broadcast capability of local area networks. Classical Markov models and queueing theory are used to analyze the performance of components of this protocol, but cannot be applied directly to determine the performance of the protocol as a whole. Instead, Laplace transforms of the distributions for the components are first derived and then combined into a transform for the entire protocol. This transform is evaluated by contour integration to yield the latency for the protocol.
