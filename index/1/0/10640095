Recent work has shown that monolithic integration of voltage regulators will be feasible in the near future, enabling reduced system cost and the potential for fine-grain voltage scaling (FGVS). More specifically, on-chip switched-capacitor regulators appear to offer an attractive trade-off in terms of integration complexity, power density, power efficiency, and response time. In this paper, we use architecture-level modeling to explore a new dynamic voltage/frequency scaling controller called the fine-grain synchronization controller (FG-SYNC+). FG-SYNC+ enables improved performance and energy efficiency at similar average power for multithreaded applications with activity imbalance. We then use circuit-level modeling to explore various approaches to organizing on-chip voltage regulation, including a new approach called reconfigurable power distribution networks (RPDNs). RPDNs allow one regulator to "borrow" energy storage from regulators associated with underutilized cores resulting in improved area/power efficiency and faster response times. We evaluate FG-SYNC+ and RPDN using a vertically integrated research methodology, and our results demonstrate a 10-50% performance and 10-70% energy-efficiency improvement on the majority of the applications studied compared to no FGVS, yet RPDN uses 40% less area compared to a more traditional per-core regulation scheme.
