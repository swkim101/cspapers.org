We study undirected networks with edge costs that satisfy the triangle inequality. Let <i>n</i> denote the number of nodes. We present an <i>O</i>(1)-approximation algorithm for a generalization of the metric-cost subset <i>k</i>-node-connectivity problem. Our approximation guarantee is proved via lower bounds that apply to the simple edge-connectivity version of the problem, where the requirements are for edge-disjoint paths rather than for openly node-disjoint paths. A corollary is that, for metric costs and for each <i>k</i>=1,2,…,<i>n</i>-1, there exists a <i>k</i>-node connected graph whose cost is within a factor of 24 of the cost of any simple <i>k</i>-edge connected graph. This resolves an open question in the area. Based on our <i>O</i>(1)-approximation algorithm, we present an <i>O</i>(log <i>r</i><inf>max</inf>)-approximation algorithm for the node-connectivity survivable network design problem where <i>r</i><inf>max</inf> denotes the maximum requirement over all pairs of nodes. Our results contrast with the case of edge costs of zero or one, where Kortsarz et al. [20]recently proved, assuming NP⊈, quasi-P, a hardness-of-approximation lower bound of 2<sup>log 1-ε<i>n</i></sup> for the subset <i>k</i>-node-connectivity problem, where ε denotes a small positive number.
