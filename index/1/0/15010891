Parameter expansion methods use auxiliaryparameters to speed up the convergence of EM or thedeterministic approximation of the target distributionin variational inference. In this paper, we describethe development of parameter-expanded algorithms forPCSP and VBCSP, leading to PCSP-PX and VBCSP-PX, whose convergence speed-up and high performanceare emphasized. The convergence speed-up in PCSP-PX and VBCSP-PX is a direct consequence of parame-ter expansion methods. The contribution of this study is the performance improvement in the case of CSP,which is a novel development. Numerical experimentson the BCI competition datasets, III IV a and IV 2ademonstrate the high performance and fast convergenceof PCSP-PX and VBCSP-PX, as compared to PCSP andVBCSP.
