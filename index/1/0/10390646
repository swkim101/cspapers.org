In this paper we focus on the storage resource. A basic model of the space time requirements of jobs in a computer system is described, and a number of its variations analyzed by means of diffusion approxmiations. Subject to the usual heavy traffic assumptions, the result of this analysis enable one to quantify the effects of limitations on both storage capacity and processing rates.
