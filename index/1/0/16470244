This paper describes a knowledge-based useroriented interface system which is unique in its combined use of data base, graphics, and AI technologies. All of the data presented to the user, as well as all of the data input by the user, is maintained and used as abstract “objects” using an AI object-oriented knowledge representation approach. However, the system employs a relational data base as both the storage media for all of the object information, and as the interface between the application and interface systems. The object-oriented approach allows both the application system and the user interface to operate upon the data, describe image layouts, manipulate viewing windows, and build display images using high-level commands. The use of the relational data base provides a ccmmon interface between many types of application systems and the user interface, and helps to maintain a clean separation between the functions of the application system and the user interactions.
