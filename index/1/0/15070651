A new approach to computer literacy is emerging, an approach that de-emphasizes the traditional overview of hardware and software and minimizes the teaching of traditional programming methodology. This paper describes the design and implementation of a literacy course intended to develop effective users of common applications software, including word processing, spreadsheets, graphics and database management. The paper continues by demonstrating how many academic computer science concepts can be effectively introduced using this approach.
