This paper proposes a visual tracking method which is robust to occlusion. This paper also integrates the visual tracking method and visual servo control into a vision-based control method with occlusion handling. The proposed method chooses a set of correctly extracted image features, and it then obtains an estimate of all the image features from the correctly extracted image features. The estimation procedure makes it possible to track image features even when occlusion occurs. The method has low computational complexity, since the image Jacobian is used for the image feature selection and estimation. In addition, even when the controller fails to track a moving image feature, it can find the failed image feature without a global search over the entire image plane. As a result, it can track the failed image feature again quickly.
