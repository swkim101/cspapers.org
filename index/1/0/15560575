CCN has been witnessed as a promising future Internet architecture. In-network caching has been paid much attention, but there is still no consensus on its usage, due to its non-negligible costs. Meanwhile, massive storage and bandwidth resources of end systems still remain underutilized. To this end, we present an End System Caching and Cooperation scheme in CCN, called ESCC to realize content distribution of CCN, without using costly in-network caching. ESCC enables fast content distribution through clients caching and sharing contents with each other. Experiments show that ESCC can achieve better performance than the universal caching. It is also quite simple, efficient, robust and has low overhead. ESCC could be a candidate substitute for the costly and unnecessary universal caching.
