Several applications require truly random bit sequences, whereas physical sources of randomness are at best imperfect. We consider a general model for these slightly-random sources (e,g. zener diodes), and show how to convert their output into 'random looking ' sequences, which we call quasi -random. We show that quasi-random sequences are indistinguishable from truly random ones in a strong sense. This enables us to prove that quasi-random sequences can be used in place of truly random ones for applications such as seeds for pseudo-random number generators, randomizing algorithms, and stochastic simulation experiments.
