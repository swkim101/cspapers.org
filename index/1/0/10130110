CruiseControl.rb is reincarnation of CruiseControl, an open source continuous integration tool, written in Ruby. Its basic purpose in life is to alert members of a software project when one of them checks something into source control that breaks the build.
 CruiseControl.rb was created by ThoughtWorks to meet the needs of a growing number of Ruby projects in the company. It is small and simple, takes about 10 minutes to install, has a streamlined web interface, and can be easily modified. This application takes the spirit and values of Ruby on Rails web development framework to the field of continuous integration.
