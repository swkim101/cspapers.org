Much of estimation of human internal state (goal, intentions, activities, preferences, etc.) is passive: an algorithm observes human actions and updates its estimate of human state. In this work, we embrace the fact that robot actions affect what humans do, and leverage it to improve state estimation. We enable robots to do active information gathering, by planning actions that probe the user in order to clarify their internal state. For instance, an autonomous car will plan to nudge into a human driver's lane to test their driving style. Results in simulation and in a user study suggest that active information gathering significantly outperforms passive state estimation.
