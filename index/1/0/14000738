The problem studied is that of learning problem solving heuristics by doing. The purpose is to explore the learning behavior of a highly constrained mechanism. The constraints are choosen on the basis of Dsychological considerations. Computer runs show that the constraints do not prevent successful learning. The learning style of the program turns out to be a function of the structure of the problem space.
