We propose an effective combination of multiple functional inks, including conductive silver ink, thermo-chromic ink, and regular inkjet ink, for a novel paper-based interface called Inkantatory Paper that can dynamically change the color of its printed pattern. Constructed with off-the-shelf inkjet printing using silver conductive ink, our system enables users to fabricate thin, flat, flexible, and low-cost interactive paper. We evaluated the characteristics of the conductive silver ink as a heating system for the thermo-chromic ink and created applications demonstrating the usability of the system.
