We consider the configuration formation problem in modular robotic systems where a set of singleton modules that are spatially distributed in an environment are required to assume appropriate positions so that they can configure into a new, user-specified target configuration, while simultaneously maximizing the amount of information collected while navigating from their initial to final positions. Each module has a limited energy budget to expend while moving from its initial to goal location. To solve this problem, we propose a budget-limited, heuristic search-based algorithm that finds a path that maximizes the entropy of the expected information along the path. We have analytically proved that our proposed approach converges within finite time. Experimental results show that our planning approach has lower run-time than an auction-based allocation algorithm for selecting modules' spots.
