In recent years, very important progress was made in both real-time digital computer communication and real-time digital voice communication, due to the growing importance of geographically distributed computation, the growing need for resource sharing, and the need for secure voice communication. The progress in digital voice communication—mainly aimed at low data rate and high fidelity speech communication—has led to various vocoding techniques such as LPC and CVSD. The progress in real-time computer communication—which is mainly aimed at low delays, high bandwidth and high cost-effectiveness—led to technologies such as packet switching, packet-radio, and satellite communication, as well as intercomputer communication protocols. It is the natural result of the progress in both areas that the use of packet switching technology be considered for voice communication. In this paper the issues involved in the application of packet-switching networks to real-time voice communication are identified and explained.
