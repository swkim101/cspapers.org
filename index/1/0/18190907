Whisper is a new wrist-worn handset, which is used by insertingthe fingertip into the ear canal. A received signal is conveyedfrom a wrist-mounted actuator to the ear canal via the hand and afinger by bone conduction. The users voice is captured by amicrophone mounted on the inside of the wrist. All components ofWhisper can be mounted on the wrist, and usability does not de-crease if the size of components is miniaturized. So, bothwearability and usability can be achieved together. The way Whisperis operated is similar to that of an ordinary telephone handset.Thus, onlookers may not look upon Whispers operation as talking tooneself, even if the associated PDA is controlled by voicecommands. Whis- per is especially effective in a noisy environment.Signals received via bone conduction can be heard clearly in thepresence of noise without raising the volume (-12 dB at noise = 90dB(A) in comparison to cellular phone hand- set). Whisper is alsoeffective in avoiding the annoying problem of the users voice beingraised in a noisy situa- tion. Feedback of the users utterance isboosted by bone conduction when covering the ear canal with afingertip, then the users voice does not need to raised in thepres- ence of noise (-6 dB at noise = 90 dB(A) in comparison tocellular phone handset). Whisper is useful as a voice interface fora wrist-worn PDA and cellular phone.
