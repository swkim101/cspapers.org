Outreach programs communicating the importance and diversity of computing to K-12 students are essential to improving attitudes toward computing. However, the effectiveness of outreach programs, and roadshows in particular, has only recently come under study. Just Be is an outreach roadshow program at Indiana University. It directly addresses stereotypical attitudes towards computing. This paper demonstrates, through statistical analysis of surveys given to college students who participated in a Just Be presentation prepared for high school students, that the Just Be roadshow effectively shifts attitudes for the better.
