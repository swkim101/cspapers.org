We present the outline of a class project in which entry-level students in our CS1 course spent a full day developing a text-based massively multi-player online role-playing game (MMORPG) using Scheme. We describe briefly our CS1 course, the specifics of the game we asked students to implement, and the project organization. Comments from the students about their experience are also presented.
