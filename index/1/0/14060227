This paper presents a hybrid magnetic-mechanical manipulation system for automated capsulorhexis utilizing a flexible catheter with a sharp edge magnetic tip. Vision based closed loop control is implemented to guide the tip on a circular path in the anterior eye segment. A continuous motion with high repeatability is achieved. The system shows the first catheter-based application of the electromagnetic manipulation system, OctoMag, for fast and safe ophthalmic surgery that potentially reduces the risk of complications and improves precision.
