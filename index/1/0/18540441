This paper presents a novel strategy for temporal coalescing. Temporal coalescing merges the temporal extents of value-equivalent tuples. A temporal extent is usually coalesced offline and stored since coalescing is an expensive operation. But the temporal extent of a tuple with now, times at different granularities, or incomplete times cannot be determined until query evaluation. This paper presents a strategy to partially coalesce temporal extents by identifying regions that are potentially covered. The covered regions can be used to evaluate temporal predicates and constructors on the coalesced extent. Our strategy uses standard relational database technology. We quantify the cost using the Oracle DBMS.
