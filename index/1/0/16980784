A line intersecting all polyhedra in a set f? is called a “stabber” for the set l?. This paper addresses some combinatorial and algorithmical questions about the set $(B) of all lines stabbing B. We prove that the combinatorial complexity of S(8) has an 0(n3+c) upper bound, where n is the total number of facets in B. This bound is almost tight. Within the same time bound it is possible to determine if a stabbing line exists and to find one.
