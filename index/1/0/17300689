We design, optimize and demonstrate the behavior of a tendon-driven robotic gripper performing fingertip and enveloping grasps. The gripper consists of two fingers, each with two links, and is actuated using a single active tendon. During unobstructed closing, the distal links remain parallel, creating exact fingertip grasps. Conversely, if the proximal links are stopped by contact with an object, the distal links start flexing, creating a stable enveloping grasp. We optimize the route of the active tendon and the parameters of the springs providing passive extension forces in order to achieve this behavior. We show how an additional passive tendon can be used as a constraint preventing the gripper from entering undesirable parts of the joint workspace. Finally, we introduce a method for optimizing the dimensions of the links in order to achieve enveloping grasps of a large range of objects, and apply it to a set of common household objects.
