Erasable-itemset mining is to find the itemsets (components) that can be eliminated if the products generated from them gain profit under a given threshold. In this paper, we consider the erasable-itemset integration problem to merge the erasable itemsets from two data sources. We propose an efficient merging algorithm, which can get the merged erasable itemsets directly or by rescanning partial data sources to reduce mining time. Experiments are also made to show that the proposed algorithm executes faster than the re-mining approach for merging erasable itemsets.
