The challenge in the creation of RE/SE (Requirements Engineering/Software Engineering) models automatically from NL (Natural Language) description of requirements is to discover the knowledge model within the language model. In this article, we present a new approach for analyzing and processing these two models. Our approach combines two technologies: The first is NLP (Natural Language Processing) which we use to construct a graphical model of the language and of the knowledge it simultaneously carries within it. Once the model has been built, we can extract structural analogies with a DM (Domain Model). The second is FCA (Formal Concept Analysis), with which we process these structures. FCA helps us in two ways: as an analytical tool to formalize the concepts, and as a technology to structure and visualize them. A case study is provided to demonstrate the applicability of our approach.
