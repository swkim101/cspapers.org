While hard disk drives are the most common secondary storage devices, their high power consumption and low shock-resistance limit them as an ideal mobile storage solution. On the other hand, flash memory devices overcome the main problems of hard disk drives, but they are still more expensive in the cost per bit over hard disk drives and can only support a limited number of erase cycles. In this paper, we show that combining the merits of a hard disk and a flash memory device can produce an energy-efficient secondary storage solution for mobile platforms. We propose an energy-efficient file placement technique for such heterogeneous storage systems. The proposed technique adapts an existing data concentration technique by separating read and write I/O requests. Experimental results show that the proposed technique reduces the energy consumption by up to 74.5% when the combination of a 1.8" disk and a flash memory is used instead of a single 2.5" disk, at the cost of small increase in the average response time.
