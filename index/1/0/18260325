This paper describes the benchmarking of an FPGA-based computing system that uses partially reconfigurable tiles for real-time allocation of hardware resources. This system was developed for use in the aerospace industry in order to provide redundancy for fault mitigation and real-time hardware reallocation to reduce mass associated with separate functional systems. In this paper, we present the results of performance studies on our Xilinx Virtex-6 platform using the Dhrystone, LINPACK and NAS-Kernel benchmarks. We further present the impact on power consumption as processors and hardware accelerators are brought online to increase performance.
