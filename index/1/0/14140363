In this showcase we will present live running simulations which are integrated into the Access Grid in a variety of different ways. An example of this is the use of vnc to distribute a desktop on which the simulation is being displayed. Another example is the redirection of the visualization into vic to make 3D animations available over the Access Grid. Other examples that will be explored are the use of SGI's OpenGL VizServer to direct the output of a graphics supercomputer located on the Grid to the AG locations. We will also utilize the ability of the next generation AG software to directly link with visualization toolkits such as vtk, AVS/Express, or COVISE as an integrated part of the Virtual Venue as this functionality has developed by the time of the SC2003 demonstrations. We also demonstrate steering in a collaborative setting using a steering service which is fully compliant with OGSI and with the proposed OGSA architecture. This can be integrated with current Grid middleware (e.g. GT2 and UNICORE) using a specially developed Perl hosting environment, OGSI:Lite.
