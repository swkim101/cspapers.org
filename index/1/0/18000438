In this paper, we present an action recognition system which consists of pressure insoles, with 16 pressure sensors, and an inertial measurement unit. By analysing the data measured from these sensors, we are able to recognised several human activities. In this circumstance, we focus on the detection of jumping, squatting, moving left and right. We also designed a parkour game on a mobile device to demonstrate the in-game control of an avatar by human action.
