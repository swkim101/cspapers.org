Instruction caches are analyzed both theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical analysis begins with a new model for cache referencing behaviorâ€”the loop model. This model is used to study cache organizations and replacement policies. It is concluded theoretically that random replacement is better than LRU and FIFO, and that under certain circumstances, a direct-mapped or set associative cache may perform better than a full associative cache organization. Experimental results using instruction trace data are then given. The experimental results are shown to support the theoretical conclusions.
