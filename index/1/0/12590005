Over the past few years, a team of Kennedy Space Center Civil Service software engineers has specified a standard language for test and ground aerospace operations. The language is intended to be used for test procedure definition for all levels of Space Shuttle flight and ground support hardware from line replaceable units through integrated vehicle testing, and will support both manual and automatic testing modes. That is, the language can not only be used to specify test procedures in the shop, but can also control and manage major integrated test sequencing and launch day operations. The language is called GOAL, for Ground Operations Aerospace Language. This paper will relate the language development and describe GOAL as it was defined in March, 1973.
