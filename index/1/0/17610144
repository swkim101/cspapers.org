This paper presents a project realized in the domain of risk management at a financial services subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler. The project resulted in the implementation of an innovative KDD approach designed to optimize the collection efforts in automobile financing. In contrast with the conventional “credit scoring” which is mainly geared towards assessing a customer’s credit worthiness at the time when she/he applies for a loan in this project we followed the credit life cycle downstream and focused on how to best deal with delinquent customers in an actual credit portfolio. The resulting Data Mining solution was implemented in the finance company’s systems environment and in daily operations.
