These methods often perform the two dependent tasks: relevant feature subset search and outlier scoring independently, consequently retaining features/subspaces irrelevant to the scoring method and downgrading the detection performance. This paper introduces a novel sequential ensemble-based framework SEMSE and its instance CINFO to address this issue. SEMSE learns the sequential ensembles to mutually refine feature selection and outlier scoring by iterative sparse modeling with outlier scores as the pseudo target feature. CINFO instantiates SEMSE by using three successive recurrent components to build such sequential ensembles. Given outlier scores output by an existing outlier scoring method on a feature subset, CINFO first defines a Cantelli's inequality-based outlier thresholding function to select outlier candidates with a false positive upper bound. It then performs lasso-based sparse regression by treating the outlier scores as the target feature and the original features as predictors on the outlier candidate set to obtain a feature subset that is tailored for the outlier scoring method. Our experiments show that two different outlier scoring methods enabled by CINFO (i) perform significantly better on 11 real-life high-dimensional data sets, and (ii) have much better resilience to noisy features, compared to their bare versions and three state-of-the-art competitors.
