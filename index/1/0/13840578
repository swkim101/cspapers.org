It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the WWW 2018 Developers' Track. We had 12 submissions in total, out of which 7 were papers for the proceedings (5 long, 2 short), and 5 were free-form formats that did not go in the proceedings. A lot of great publications are accompanied by great implementations that sometimes risk going almost unnoticed in favor of the more glamorous research results they helped produce. Likewisethe Web being a moving and ever-developing targeta lot of sometimes tedious and oftentimes less obvious work happens on standardization of future Web APIs and programming languages. The Developers' Track aims to put this implementation and standardization work front and center. It highlights research submissions that describe technically challenging Web applications of all sorts. Apart from classic papers (that we do understand are a fixed requirement for some people in order be allowed to the conference), the Developers' Track was not limited to formats that can be printed, and authors were encouraged to be creative in finding the most effective way to communicate their work, and we have included dynamic or interactive contributions.
