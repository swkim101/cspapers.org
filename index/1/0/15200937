We present the design of a scalable parallel pathline construction method for visualizing large time-varying 3D vector fields. A 4D (i.e., time and the 3D spatial domain) representation of the vector field is introduced to make a time-accurate depiction of the flow field. This representation also allows us to obtain pathlines through streamline tracing in the 4D space. Furthermore, a hierarchical representation of the 4D vector field, constructed by clustering the 4D field, makes possible interactive visualization of the flow field at different levels of abstraction. Based on this hierarchical representation, a data partitioning scheme is designed to achieve high parallel efficiency. We demonstrate the performance of parallel pathline visualization using data sets obtained from terascale flow simulations. This new capability will enable scientists to study their time-varying vector fields at the resolution and interactivity previously unavailable to them.
