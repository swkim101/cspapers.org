We propose an approach to cross-lingual named entity recognition model transfer without the use of parallel corpora. In addition to global de-lexicalized features, we introduce multilingual gazetteers that are generated using graph propagation, and cross-lingual word representation mappings without the use of parallel data. We target the e-commerce domain, which is challenging due to its unstructured and noisy nature. The experiments have shown that our approaches beat the strong MT baseline, where the English model is transferred to two languages: Spanish and Chinese.
