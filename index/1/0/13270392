We give an implementation of the Goemans-Williamson clustering procedure which is at the core of several approximation algorithms including those for Generalized Steiner Trees, Prize Collecting Travelling Salesman, 2-Edge Connected Subgraph etc. On a graph with <i>n</i> nodes and <i>m</i> edge, our implementation gives <i>&Ogr;</i> (<i>k</i>(<i>n</i> + <i>m</i>) <i>log</i><sup>2</sup> <i>n</i>) time approximation algorithms for all these problems at the expense of a slight additive degradation of 1/n<sup><i>k</i></sup> in the approximation factor, for any constant <i>k</i>.
