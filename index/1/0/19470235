Eight hour contextual observations have been conducted in the homes of 5 low socioeconomic status (SES) urban-dwelling older adults. The purpose of the observations was to understand the daily needs and challenges of older adults in order to design appropriate technology that can allow older adults to age-in-place (age at home). The long term goal of the study is to develop a suite of age-in-place technologies tailored to the lifestyle needs of low SES urban and rural-dwelling older adults. This paper presents initial findings and discusses how this ongoing research will be used to inform the design of future age-in-place technologies.
