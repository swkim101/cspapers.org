In a section of their 2007 paper, Gilpin, Sandholm, and Sorensen outline a technique for indexing poker hands that accounts for suit isomorphisms. Their implementation is specific to Texas Hold’em as it requires a large case analysis, and is not optimal as many cases are omitted. In this paper, we build on their ideas and provide a fast and optimal technique that generalizes beyond Texas Hold’em as well as provide an inverse mapping from an index to a canonical hand.
