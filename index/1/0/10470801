For biomedical information extraction, most systems use syntactic patterns on verbs (anchor verbs) and their arguments. Anchor verbs can be selected by focusing on their arguments. We propose to use predicate-argument structures (PASs), which are outputs of a full parser, to obtain verbs and their arguments. In this paper, we evaluated PAS method by comparing it to a method using part of speech (POSs) pattern matching. POS patterns produced larger results with incorrect arguments, and the results will cause adverse effects on a phase selecting appropriate verbs.
