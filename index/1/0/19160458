However, most existing studies adopt a two-step strategy, i.e., selecting the top-m features according to a calculated descending order and then performing K-means clustering, resulting in a group of sub-optimal features. To address this problem, we propose a Dependence Guided Unsupervised Feature Selection (DGUFS) method to select features and partition data in a joint manner. Our proposed method enhances the inter-dependence among original data, cluster labels, and selected features. In particular, a projection-free feature selection model is proposed based on l20-norm equality constraints. We utilize the learned cluster labels to fill in the information gap between original data and selected features. Two dependence guided terms are consequently proposed for our model. More specifically, one term increases the dependence of desired cluster labels on original data, while the other term maximizes the dependence of selected features on cluster labels to guide the process of feature selection. Last but not least, an iterative algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is designed to solve the constrained minimization problem efficiently. Extensive experiments on different datasets consistently demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.
