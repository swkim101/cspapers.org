Virtual machine systems have been implemented on a limited number of third generation computer systems, for example CP-67 on the IBM 360/67. The value of virtual machine techniques to ease the development of operating systems, to aid in program transferability, and to allow the concurrent running of disparate operating systems, test and diagnostic programs has been well recognized. However, from previous empirical studies, it is known that many third generation computer systems, e.g. the DEC PDP-10, cannot support a virtual machine system.
 In this paper, the hardware architectural requirements for virtual machine systems are discussed. First, a fairly specific definition of a virtual machine is presented which includes the aspects of efficiency, isolation, and identical behavior. A model of third generation-like computer systems is then developed. The model includes a processor with supervisor and user modes, memory that has a simple protection mechanism, and a trap facility. In this context, instruction behavior is then carefully characterized.
