The infinite dimensionality, varying, uncertainties or even unknown boundary conditions render the derivation and - in particular - the identification of accurate dynamics models for elastic link robots tedious and error prone. This contribution circumvents these challenges by the prior application of a model-free inner loop oscillation damping controller before modelling the robot's dynamics. Then, the damped dynamics of a multi elastic link robot arm under gravity can be modelled with high accuracy. An analytical and a data-driven model for the damped dynamics are proposed and quantitatively compared. Both models can explain motor currents as well as link strain measurements in real-time. The paper includes an experimental model validation with different payloads in the entire workspace of the robot.
