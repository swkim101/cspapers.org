MUG1 has been designed and implemented at the Technical University of Munich. Its purpose is the generation of efficient one-pass compilers. The main goals of the design were to offer a readable and easily modifiable compiler description language, and to build an efficiently usable system. Moreover the system was to detect certain classes of errors in the description, to allow for an exchange of alternative system modules such as parser generators, and to be portable.
 The paper discusses the most important design decisions in terms of their implications for attaining the design goals, and compares the resultant system with other compiler generating systems.
