We study the effect of boundary conditions on the relaxation time of the Glauber dynamics for the hardcore lattice gas model on the <i>n</i>-vertex regular <i>b</i>-ary tree of height <i>h</i>. The hard-core model is defined on independent sets weighted by an activity (or fugacity) λ on trees. Reconstruction studies the effect of a 'typical' boundary condition, i.e., fixed assignment to the leaves, on the root. The threshold for when reconstruction occurs (and a typical boundary influences the root in the limit <i>h</i> → ∞) has been of considerable recent interest since it appears to be connected to the efficiency of certain local algorithms on locally tree-like graphs. The reconstruction threshold occurs at ω ≈ ln <i>b/b</i> where λ = ω(1 + ω)<sup><i>b</i></sup> is a convenient re-parameterization of the model.
 We prove that for all boundary conditions, the relaxation time τ in the non-reconstruction region is fast, namely τ = <i>O</i> (<i>n</i><sup>1+<i>ob</i>(1)</sup>) for any ω ≤ ln <i>b/b</i>. In the reconstruction region, for all boundary conditions, we prove τ = <i>O</i> (<i>n</i><sup>1+Δ+ob(1)</sup>) for ω = (1 + ω) ln <i>b/b</i>, for every Δ > 0. In contrast, we construct a boundary condition, for which the Glauber dynamics slows down in the reconstruction region, namely τ = Ω (<i>n</i><sup>1+Δ-ob(1)</sup>) for ω = (1 + Δ) ln <i>b/b</i>, for every Δ > 0. The interesting part of our proof is this lower bound result, which uses a general technique that transforms an algorithm to prove reconstruction into a set in the state space of the Glauber dynamics with poor conductance.
