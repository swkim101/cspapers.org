In many application areas, such as the semantic web, knowledge management, distributed databases, it’s been recognized that we need an explicit way to represent meanings. A major issue in all these efforts is the problem of semantic interoperability, namely the problem of communication between agents using languages with different semantic. Following (Bonifacio, Bouquet, & Traverso 2002), we claim that a technological infrastructure for semantic interoperability between “semantically autonomous” communities must be based on the capability of representing local ontologies and mappings between them, rather than on the attempt of creating a global, supposedly shared, conceptualization. The goal of this paper is to define a theoretical framework and a concrete language for the specification of local ontologies and mappings between them.
