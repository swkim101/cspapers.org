Coupling is one of two fundamental attributes of software that significantly impact system quality. This work presents a method for measuring coupling in a software system using two matrices. The coupling calculation is performed in two major steps. The first step creates a matrix that captures the nature of the underlying software system. The second step produces a matrix that indicates the degree of coupling between each pair of system components, and also measures the overall system coupling.
