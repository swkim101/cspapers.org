Query logs, the patterns of activity left by millions of users, contain a wealth of information that can be mined to aid personalization. We perform a large-scale study of Yahoo! search engine logs, tracking 1.35 million browser-cookies over a period of 6 months. We define metrics to address questions such as 1) How much history is available?, 2) How do users' topical interests vary, as reflected by their queries?, and 3) What can we learn from user clicks? We find that there is significantly more expected history for the user of a randomly picked query than for a randomly picked user. We show that users exhibit consistent topical interests that vary between users. We also see that user clicks indicate a variety of special interests. Our findings shed light on user activity and can inform future personalization efforts.
