Block languages (e.g., Scratch, Snap!, Alice, App Inventor, Blockly) offer a gentle introduction to programming and have been adopted widely in both K-12 and CS0 courses. However, block languages often are dependent on the mouse/keyboard for input and typically are visual in their output and representation. Because of these dependencies, students with a disability (e.g., mobility limitations or vision impairment) generally are unable to use block languages, thereby reducing the opportunities for broader participation in computational learning activities. Given the increasing need to broaden the participation of computing to those with diverse skills and backgrounds, it is important that the tools used to initiate the earliest entre into computing do not erect immediate roadblocks that impede initial interest and opportunity. There are many variations of user interfaces and assistive technologies that benefit those who may have difficulties utilizing traditional Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), but these tools often cannot be used universally across block languages. As more block languages are being developed and integrated into K12 and University curriculum, it is imperative that accessible solutions are discussed and implemented. These discussions require participation from the block language developer community, accessible computing community, and those educators who encounter accessibility needs among the students in their classrooms. The goal of this lightning talk is to call attention to the need for more accessible block-based programming environments and to spark conversation surrounding possible standard accessibility APIs that could possibly be supported by block language environment tool developers.
