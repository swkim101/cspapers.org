In consideration of attention as a means for goal-directed behavior in non-stationary environments, we argue that the dynamics of attention should satisfy two opposing demands: long-term maintenance and quick transition. These two characteristics are contradictory within the linear domain. We propose the near saddle-node bifurcation behavior of a sigmoidal unit with self-connection as a candidate of dynamical mechanism that satisfies both of these demands. We further show in simulations of the 'bug-eat-food' tasks that the near saddle-node bifurcation behavior of recurrent networks can emerge as a functional property for survival in non-stationary environments.
