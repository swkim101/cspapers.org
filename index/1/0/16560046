Human interface plays an important role in information retrieval system. Vkual information is a good manmachine communication medium. Therefore, it is necessary to design a visual interface to interpret the pictorial information. Such a visual interface provides user-friendly operations. It is important to design advanced image database systems from a visual aspect. The algorithms of image retrieval operations have to suit user’s subjective viewpoint, such as a similarity measure, etc. This paper proposes an image retrieval scheme based on the assumption that end-users make use of image database systems. When a human being looks graphical materials like artistic paintings, he/she memorizes them using two patterns in his/her visual memory: the first pattern is that of looking roughly the whole image, the second is that of paying attention to specific objects such as a man or a desk. A user can divide the canvas into several area with appropriate color freely and put icons for representing objects. Moreover, the user can set detailed attributes of each object in order to reduce the number of candidates. Thus, by means of specifying the feature of a picture in the three levels (area, objects, attributes), an image retrieval system suited for humans’ sense can be realized. keywords—image database, subjective perception, graphical user interface, spatial relationship, image expression model, visual language
