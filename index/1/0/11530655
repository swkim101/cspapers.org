This paper explores a framework for recognition of image sequences using partially observable stochastic differential equation (SDE) models. Monte-Carlo importance sampling techniques are used for efficient estimation of sequence likelihoods and sequence likelihood gradients. Once the network dynamics are learned, we apply the SDE models to sequence recognition tasks in a manner similar to the way Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are commonly applied. The potential advantage of SDEs over HMMS is the use of continuous state dynamics. We present encouraging results for a video sequence recognition task in which SDE models provided excellent performance when compared to hidden Markov models.
