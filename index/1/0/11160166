Research on network intrusion detection has produced a number of interesting results. In this paper, I look back to the NetSTAT system, which was presented at ACSAC in 1998. In addition to describing the original system, I discuss some historical context, with reference to well-known evaluation efforts and to the evolution of network intrusion detection into a broader field that includes malware detection and the analysis of malicious behavior.
