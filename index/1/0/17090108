The purpose of this effort was the specification and design of a family of Communications Switching Systems, such that each design and implementation of the specification leads to a family member. Each set of design and implementation decisions chosen would lead to some appropriate desired member of the family. Basically, our methodology consists of the following six steps, System Modelling, Data Flow Modelling, Features Selection, Modules Selection, Hierarchicalization, and Abstract Machines Specification.
