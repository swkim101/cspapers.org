In this paper, we investigate the behavior of the various algorithms of TCP, the internet data transport protocol, over wireless links with correlated packet losses. For such a scenario, we show that the performance of NewReno is worse than the performance of Tahoe in many situations and even OldTahoe in a few situations on account of the inefficient fast recovery method of NewReno. We also show that random loss leads to sign.%csnt throughput deterioration when either the product of the square of the bandwidth-delay ratio and the loss probability when in the good state exceeds 1 or the product of the bandwidth-delay ratio and the packet success probability when in the bad state is less than two. The performance of Sack is always seen to be the best and the most robust thereby arguing for the implementation of TCP SACK over the wireless channel. We also show that under certain conditions the performance depends not only on the bandwidth-delay product but also on the nature of timeout whether coarse or fine. We have also investigated the effects of reducing the fast retransmit threshold.
