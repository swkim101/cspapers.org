Software Studio is a studio-based learning (SBL) curriculum designed to train students as professional software engineers. Traditional software engineering courses remain important, but suffer significant gaps in preparing students for professional engagement. We describe our curriculum model, highlight ways in which it fills these gaps, and offer a SWOT analysis. As practical guidance, we reflect on our missteps and successes in implementing Software Studio over the past five semesters. Finally, we suggest future directions for Software Studio.
