Recent work by Marcus, Spielman and Srivastava proves the existence of bipartite Ramanujan (multi) graphs of all degrees and all sizes. However, that paper did not provide a polynomial time algorithm to actually compute such graphs. Here, we provide a polynomial time algorithm to compute certain expected characteristic polynomials related to this construction. This leads to a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to compute bipartite Ramanujan (multi) graphs of all degrees and all sizes.
