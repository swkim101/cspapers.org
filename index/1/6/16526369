Informally, abstraction can be described as the process of mapping a representation of a problem into a new representation. The aim of the paper is to propose a theory of abstraction. The generality of the framework is tested by formalizing and analyzing some work done in the past; its efficacy by giving a procedure which solves the false proof problem by avoiding the use of inconsistent abstract spaces.
