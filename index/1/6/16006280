Domain adaptation has achieved promising results in many areas, such as image classification and object recognition. Although a lot of algorithms have been proposed to solve the task with different domain distributions, it remains a challenge for multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation. In addition, most of the existing algorithms learn a classifier on the source domain and predict the labels for the target data, which indicates that only the knowledge derived from the hyperplane is transferred to the target domain and the structure information is ignored. In light of this, we propose a novel algorithm for multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation. Generally speaking, we aim to preserve the whole structure from source domains and transfer it to serve the task on the target domain. The source and target data are put together for clustering, which simultaneously explores the structures of the source and target domains. The structure-preserved information from source domain further guides the clustering process on the target domain. Extensive experiments on two widely used databases on object recognition and face identification show the substantial improvement of our proposed approach over several state-of-the-art methods. Especially, our algorithm can take use of multi-source domains and achieve robust and better performance compared with the single source domain adaptation methods.
