The Assumption-Based Truth Maintenance System (ATMS) is an important tool in AI. So far its wider use has been limited due to the enormous computational resources which it requires. We investigate the possibility of speeding it up by using a modest number of processors in parallel. We begin with a highly efficient sequential version written in C and then extend this version to allow parallel execution on the Encore Multimax, a 16 node shared-memory multiprocessor. We describe our experiences in implementing this shared-memory parallel version of the ATMS, present detailed results of its execution, and discuss the factors which limit the available speedup.
