One of the key steps in high-speed control of a parallel robot is to define an efficient dynamic model. It is usually not easy to have such a model for parallel robots, since many of them have complex structures. Here, we propose a vector-based approach, which employs the robot leg orientations, to obtain a simplified inverse dynamic model. At the least, this vector-based methodology is pioneering, when combined with the observation of orientations by a calibrated camera, in the sense of solving the entire control-oriented (hard) modeling problem, both kinematics and dynamics, in an almost algebraic manner through the knowledge of only a nominal set of image features: the edges of the robot legs and their time derivatives. Proposed method is verified on a simulator of the Quattro robot with a computed torque control where the leg orientations are steered.
