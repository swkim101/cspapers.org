Savantis Systems' dbSwitchâ„¢ is an innovative commercial product providing database server virtualization and advancing a database utility model. The dbSwitch enables a new architecture, called a Database Area Network (DAN), which pools database server resources and shares them among multiple database applications. Specific benefits of the DAN architecture for enterprise data centers include server consolidation, improved utilization, high availability and capacity management. We describe the major components of the dbSwitch, namely routing of application requests to database instances, optimization of database server resources and capacity visualization and manipulation. We also relate dbSwitch to recent work on utility and grid computing.
