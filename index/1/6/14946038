Network MIMO (netMIMO) has potential for significantly enhancing the capacity of wireless networks with tight coordination of access points (APs) to serve multiple users concurrently. Existing schemes realize netMIMO by integrating distributed APs into one ``giant'' MIMO but do not scale well owing to their global synchronization requirement and overhead in sharing data between APs. To remedy this limitation, we propose a novel system, NEMOx, that realizes netMIMO downlink transmission for large-scale wireless networks. NEMOx organizes a network into practical-size clusters, each containing multiple distributed APs (dAPs) that opportunistically synchronize with each other for netMIMO downlink transmission. Inter-cluster interference is managed with a decentralized channel-access algorithm, which is designed to balance between the dAPs' cooperation gain and spatial reuse---a unique tradeoff in netMIMO. Within each cluster, NEMOx optimizes the power budgeting among dAPs and the set of users to serve, ensuring fairness and effective cancellation of cross-talk interference. We have implemented and evaluated a prototype of NEMOx in a software radio testbed, demonstrating its throughput scalability and multiple folds of performance gain over current wireless LAN architecture and alternative netMIMO schemes.
