The mortality related to cervical cancer can be substantially reduced through early detection and treatment. However, current detection techniques, such as Pap smear and colposcopy, fail to achieve a concurrently high sensitivity and specificity. In vivo fluorescence spectroscopy is a technique which quickly, noninvasively and quantitatively probes the biochemical and morphological changes that occur in pre-cancerous tissue. RBF ensemble algorithms based on such spectra provide automated, and near realtime implementation of pre-cancer detection in the hands of nonexperts. The results are more reliable, direct and accurate than those achieved by either human experts or multivariate statistical algorithms.
