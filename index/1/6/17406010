Specifications for a network design to connect the Apollo DOMAIN network with the VAX system are discussed in this paper. Three networking approaches were considered which represent three distinct chronological stages in the evolution of computer communications. Based on a comparison of data transfer rate and the installation cost among these three alternatives, the LAN, represented by the Ethernet, was recommended as the connecting hardware.
 The OSI Reference Model was used as a starting basis to discuss protocol issues to be built for the chosen LAN. Of particular interest are the transport, presentation, and application layers. The transport layer was designed to perform functions of the network and session layers in the OSI model. The presentation layer incorporated a text mapping algorithm to convert incompatible characters in filenames created on the VAX versus those on the Apollo. The application layer was designed with the capability to send and receive files between these two systems.
