In this paper, we present a real-time approach to local trajectory replanning for microaerial vehicles (MAVs). Current trajectory generation methods for multicopters achieve high success rates in cluttered environments, but assume that the environment is static and require prior knowledge of the map. In the presented study, we use the results of such planners and extend them with a local replanning algorithm that can handle unmodeled (possibly dynamic) obstacles while keeping the MAV close to the global trajectory. To ensure that the proposed approach is real-time capable, we maintain information about the environment around the MAV in an occupancy grid stored in a three-dimensional circular buffer, which moves together with a drone, and represent the trajectories by using uniform B-splines. This representation ensures that the trajectory is sufficiently smooth and simultaneously allows for efficient optimization.
