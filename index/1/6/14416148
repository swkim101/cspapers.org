Oracle Materialized Views (MVs) are designed for data warehousing and replication. For data warehousing, MVs based on inner/outer equijoins with optional aggregation, can be refreshed on transaction boundaries, on demand, or periodically. Refreshes are optimized for bulk loads and can use a multi-MV scheduler. MVs based on subqueries on remote tables support bidirectional replication. Optimization with MVs includes transparent query rewrite based on costbased selection method. The ability to rewrite a large class of queries based on a small set of MVs is supported by using Dimensions (new Oracle object), losslessness of joins, functional dependency, column equivalence, join derivability, joinback and aggregate rollup.
