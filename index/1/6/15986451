We describe a multi-perspective vision studio as a flexible high performance framework for solving complex image processing and machine vision problems on multi-view image sequences. The studio abstracts multi-view image data from image sequence acquisition facilities, stores and catalogs sequences in a high performance distributed database, allows customization of back-end processing services, and can serve custom client applications, thus helping make multi-view video sequence processing efficient and generic. To illustrate our approach, we describe two multi-perspective studio applications, and discuss performance and scalability results.
