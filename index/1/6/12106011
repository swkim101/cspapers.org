As chiplet systems increase in popularity, it is important to revisit the tradeoffs for converting a monolithic design to a chiplet system. Chip yield, reusability, performance binning, and floorplanning push us toward smaller chiplets. Meanwhile, inter-chiplet interconnect and assembly overheads push us toward larger chips both in terms of power and cost. This work explores the impacts of these considerations on the minimum chiplet size that makes sense. We examine the case of a large design that could be built as a single monolithic system on chip (SoC) or as a system of chiplets and show that optimal chiplet size depends on a wide range of parameters. Our analysis indicates that the smallest chiplet sizes that are viable cost-wise depends both on technology node and on type of logic. The optimal point appears to be 50-150mm2 in 40nm and 40-80mm2 in 7nm for microprocessor type logic. For random logic, the optimal point increases beyond 200mm2 in both cases. This makes the case for chipletization weaker in all but the largest SoCs.
