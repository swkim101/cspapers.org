Most collaborative filtering algorithms are based on certain statistical models of user interests built from either explicit feedback (eg: ratings, votes) or implicit feedback (eg: clicks, purchases). Explicit feedbacks are more precise but more difficult to collect from users while implicit feedbacks are much easier to collect though less accurate in reflecting user preferences. In the existing literature, separate models have been developed for either of these two forms of user feedbacks due to their heterogeneous representation. However in most real world recommended systems both explicit and implicit user feedback are abundant and could potentially complement each other. It is desirable to be able to unify these two heterogeneous forms of user feedback in order to generate more accurate recommendations. In this work, we developed matrix factorization models that can be trained from explicit and implicit feedback simultaneously. Experimental results of multiple datasets showed that our algorithm could effectively combine these two forms of heterogeneous user feedback to improve recommendation quality.
