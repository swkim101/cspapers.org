Although a computer science curriculum may use a single language as its "core" language, many curricula require students to learn and use multiple languages for course or practicum work. Students benefit from the exposure to other languages and other language models. However, a problem arising from the multi-lingual nature of a curriculum is the necessity to learn and use different development environments and language front-ends. GRASP (Graphical Representations of Algorithms, Structures, and Processes) is a software engineering tool currently being successfully utilized as a common development environment for the multi-lingual computer science curriculum at Auburn University. Besides providing a common front-end for different languages, GRASP also provides automated visualization of source code in the form of the control structure diagram and the complexity profile graph. This paper describes GRASP and its current use in the computer science curriculum. GRASP is freely available via the Internet at the following URL: http://www.eng.auburn.edu/grasp
