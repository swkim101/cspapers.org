We describe an approach to managing information about VLSI designs, founded upon database system methods. A database component provides a low-level flat-file interface to stored data. Built on top is a design data management system, supporting the hierarchical construction of a design from primitive cells, and organizing data about alternative design representations and versions. Programs to provide a tailored interface to design data are also provided. The system simplifies the rapid construction of new design tools by taking responsibility for design data management.
