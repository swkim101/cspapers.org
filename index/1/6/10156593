High Performance Computing has seen extraordinary growth in peak performance which has been accompanied by a significant increase in the difficulty of using these systems. High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) seek to address this gap by producing petascale computers that are usable by a broader range of scientists and engineers. One of the most important HPCS innovations is the concept of a flatter memory hierarchy, which means that data from remote processors can be retrieved and used very efficiently. A flatter memory hierarchy increases performance and is easier to program.
