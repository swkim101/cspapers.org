My comments are organized within the framework suggested by the Panel Chair, Barbara Grosz, which I find very appropriate. All of my comments pertain to the various issues raised by her; however, wherever possible I will discuss these issues more in the context of the "information seeking" interaction and the data base domain.The primary question is how the purpose of the interaction or "the problem context" affects what is said and how it is interpreted. The two separate aspects of this question that must be considered are the function and the domain of the discourse.
