A number of constraint-oriented, interactive graphical systems have been constructed. A typical problem in such systems is that, to define a new kind of constraint, the user must leave the graphical domain and write code in the underlying implementation language. This makes it difficult for less experienced users to add new kinds of constraints. As a step toward solving this problem, the system described here allows the graphical definition of constraints. An interface has been built in which a user can conveniently construct a new kind of object, annotating it with the relations that it must obey.
