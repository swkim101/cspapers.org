Synthesis and Model Checking are classical techniques for relating scenarios (here, Live Sequence Charts) and state machines, in the context of roundtrip Scenario-based Software Engineering. Unfortunately, current approaches do not scale up very well. To improve on this, we propose to lose some precision as a trade-off to gain ef(cid:2)ciency. Usual algorithms are turned into sound ones, which act locally on the speci(cid:2)cation and deliver results in acceptable time
