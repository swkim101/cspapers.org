In this paper we propose a novel fully probabilistic solution to the stereo egomotion estimation problem. We extend the notion of probabilistic correspondence to the stereo case which allow us to compute the whole 6D motion information in a probabilistic way. We compare the developed approach against other known state-of-the-art methods for stereo egomotion estimation, and the obtained results compare favorably both for the linear and angular velocities estimation.
