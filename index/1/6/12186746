The diminishing momentum of Dennard scaling leads to the ever increasing power density of integrated circuits, and a decreasing portion of transistors on a chip that can be switched on simultaneously-a problem recently discovered and known as dark silicon. There has been innovative work to address the “dark silicon” problem in the fields of power-efficient core and cache system. However, dark silicon challenges with Network-on-Chip (NoC) are largely unexplored. To address this issue, we propose DimNoC, a “dim silicon” approach, which leverages drowsy SRAM and STT-RAM technologies to replace pure SRAM-based NoC buffers. Specifically, we propose two novel hybrid buffer architectures: 1) a Hierarchical Buffer (HB) architecture, which divides the input buffers into a hierarchy of levels with different memory technologies operating at various power states; 2) a Banked Buffer (BB) architecture, which organizes drowsy SRAM and STT-RAM into separate banks in order to hide the long write-latency of STT-RAM. Our experiments show that the proposed DimNoC can achieve 30.9% network energy saving, 20.3% energy-delay product (EDP) reduction, and 7.6% router area decrease compared with the baseline SRAM-based NoC design.
