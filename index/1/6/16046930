The paper describes the Regional and National Tracing Systems being developed for the UK enabling public service records to be identified and located using unreliable and incomplete name and address information, and explains how CAFS provides an answer to a problem which would otherwise be insoluble. Topics covered include the sizing calculations, the main database organisation, the primary and secondary indexing structures and particular reference is made to the use of CAFS in 'fuzzy' and quorum searches.
