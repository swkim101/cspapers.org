I am delighted to be back once again at another meeting of the SHARE computer design group. When Mr. Pistilli telephoned me to extend his invitation, he indicated that I might follow up last year's talk with one on manpower training programs, so I might begin by attempting to summarize briefly the main points of my 1964 presentation.
 When I spoke to you last, I attempted to assess the economic and social implications of automation and I stated that the net effect was dependent on what one believed about the pace of changing technology. I discussed the various ways one could approach an estimate of the impact of automation, including the use of productivity statistics, expenditures on research and development, and capital-output ratios. I spoke about job-creation and job displacement, and I said I was not convinced that automation was having the job-displacing effects that was attributed to it; rather, I felt that it was compounding the growing population-employment problem.
