We describe the use of a hierarchical topic model for automatically identifying syntactic and lexical patterns that explicitly state ontological relations. We leverage distant supervision using relations from the knowledge base FreeBase, but do not require any manual heuristic nor manual seed list selections. Results show that the learned patterns can be used to extract new relations with good precision.
