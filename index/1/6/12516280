Multiple objects in the plane are called <i>pseudodisks</i> if they are convex and the boundaries of any two of them intersect transversely at most twice. Given a set of <i>n</i> (possibly intersecting) pseudodisks of <i>O</i>(1) complexity each and two points <i>s</i> and <i>t</i> in the plane, we develop an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) time algorithm for computing a shortest <i>s</i>-to-<i>t</i> path avoiding the pseudodisks. In over two decades, the previously best algorithms for this problem take <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> log <i>n</i>) time, even when all pseudodisks are pairwise-disjoint disks. Our technique is also applicable to a motion planning problem of finding a shortest path to translate a convex object in the plane from one location to another avoiding a given set of polygonal obstacles, improving the previously best known solution. Our algorithm actually solves a more general version of the motion planning problem. Further, as a by-product of our approach, we present an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) time algorithm for computing the visibility graph of a set of <i>n</i> (possibly intersecting) pseudodisks in the plane. The previously best known time bound of this visibility problem is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> log <i>n</i>). In addition, for <i>n</i> pairwise disjoint (non-polygonal) convex objects of <i>O</i>(1) complexity each in the plane, we compute a shortest <i>s</i>-to-<i>t</i> path avoiding all objects in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n + k</i>) time, where <i>k</i> is the size of the visibility graph of the objects.
