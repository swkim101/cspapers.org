The context of the research is a co-design project that has the goals of designing hardware systems to match application requirements and mapping applications to the hardware efficiently. To determine application requirements, we characterize the application using platform-independent locality metrics. Next we use locality data to predict cache performance of sequential versions of the application codes for various cache configurations. After using an analytical model to select a candidate set of cache configurations, we use architectural simulation to refine the selection for the target multicore systems.
