The demo will present CoSi, a system that enables context-sensitive interpretation of keyword queries on RDF databases. The techniques for representing, managing and exploiting query history are central to achieving this objective. The demonstration will show the effectiveness of our approach for capturing a user's querying context from their query history. Further, it will show how context is utilized to influence the interpretation of a new query. The demonstration is based on DBPedia, the RDF representation of Wikipedia.
