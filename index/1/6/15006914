This paper focuses on network delays as they apply to voice transmission. First the nature of the problem is discussed and this is followed by a review of circuit, packet and hybrid switching. The concept of introducing delay to resolve contention in speech interpolation is also noted, and when applied to both voice and data messages, forms a basis for a relatively new and so-called “transparent” approach to network design. The second part of the paper deals with experimental work. First, external link considerations involving subnet access by frame synchronous vocoders is discussed, and an experimental software interface is described which exploits the 60 to 65% idle time in voice calls. Secondly, based on the simulation of variable network delays, first indications are that with 180 ms “hangover”, the perceptable threshold of variable delay is about 200 ms average. Finally, suggestions for further works on performance analysis and subjective testing are made.
