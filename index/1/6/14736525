This paper reviews the recent advances of SOI for digital CMOS VLSI applications with particular emphasis on the design issues and advantages resulting from the unique SOI device structure. The technology/device requirements and design issues/challenges for high-performance, general-purpose microprocessor applications are differentiated with respect to low-power portable applications. Particular emphases are placed on the impact of floating-body in partially-depleted devices on the circuit operation, stability, and functionality. Unique SOI design aspects such as parasitic bipolar effect and hysteretic V/sub T/ variation are addressed. Circuit techniques to improve the noise immunity and global design issues are discussed.
