Computer Based Messaging Systems (CBMS) is a growing but complex application of computer networking technology. Though in its infancy, CBMS presents opportunities and challanges for research into the technology of distribution systems. In this paper a multi-layered model of CBMS is developed and detailed. At each layer an inventory of functions is presented, and tradeoffs are discussed. Options for packaging CBMS range from robust centralized schemes to highly distributed intelligent terminals supported by ancillary name/address binding services, etc. Much research in the functional distribution of the CBMS application is yet required, but the development of comprehensive models, such as that of this paper, is an important step in the design process.
