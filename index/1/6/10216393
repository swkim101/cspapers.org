This paper describes one of the new methodologies for IC design currently being used at the CNET. The main features detailed are the symbolic layout method called MDMOS and the integrated CAD system CASSIOPEE. Its most significant advantages are design safety, elimination of costly and inefficient checks and supply of technical specifications which are always up-to-date. This methodology is described in its entirety starting from the logical description, and including all stages up to masks generation.
