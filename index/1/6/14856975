The wireless Bluetooth standard, generally used for short range point-to-point communication between mobile devices, can in principle connect any number of stations into a multi-hop network. For this purpose a "scatternet" must be built up, which is a collection of small overlapping "piconets". Bluetooth technology is basically well-suited to some types of wireless sensor networks, but such deployment has been been limited due to the difficulty in setting up and maintaining a scatternet. We demonstrate the SFX algorithm, an extension of the earlier SHAPER procedure. The SFX algorithm builds up a scatternet by a decentralized procedure with the properties of self-organization, self-optimization, and self-healing. The procedure has been verified by deployment in a photovoltaic power plant.
