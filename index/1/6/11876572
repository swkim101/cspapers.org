Information technology is playing a more and more critical role in many large organizations and enterprise software systems have become increasingly integrated to better support the goals of these organizations. As a consequence, it is a major engineering challenge to assure quality of a software system that is to be deployed in an enterprise environment containing many thousands of interconnected systems. To address this challenge, we propose the use of a scalable emulation environment enabling real-time system testing in large-scale settings. In this work, we discuss the main concepts of our approach, present Reac2o, a prototype implementation of such an emulation environment, and illustrate its applicability in the context of identity management.
