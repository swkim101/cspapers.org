We describe the harvesting and subsequent analysis of tweets that are linked to media reports on public health events in order to identify which Internet resources are being referred to in these tweets. The aim was to automatically detect resources that are traditionally not considered mainstream media, but play a role in the discussion of public health events on the Internet. Interestingly, our initial evaluation of the results showed that most references related to public health events lead to traditional news media sites, even though URLs to non-traditional media receive a higher rank. We will briefly describe the Medical Information System (MedISys) and the methodology used to obtain and analyse tweets.
