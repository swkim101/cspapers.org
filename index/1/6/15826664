In this paper we introduce the concept of a wearable assistant for swimmer, called SwimMaster. The SwimMaster consists of acceleration sensors with micro-controllers and feedback interface modules that swimmer wear while swimming. With four different evaluation studies and a total of 22 subjects we demonstrate the functionality and power of the SwimMaster system. We show how a wide range of swim parameters can be monitored and used for a continuous swim performance evaluation. These parameters include the time per lane, the swimming velocity and the number of strokes per lane. Also swim style specific factors like the body balance and the body rotation are extracted. Finally three feedback modalities are tested and evaluated. With these means we show the ability of the SwimMaster to assist a swimmer in achieving the desired exercise goals by constantly monitoring his/her swim performance and providing the necessary feedback to achieve the desired workout goals.
