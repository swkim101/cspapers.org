Predicting important performance parameters of computer networks, recognizing potential bottlenecks, comparing design alternatives are factors of decisive importance in building complex computer networks. In this respect, computer aided simulation has proved to be a very effective design tool in a number of practical applications. It is shown by the example of the MOSAIC modeling system how a simulator applicable on a broad basis could be adapted to the specific characteristics of a class of existing computer networks.
 The class of computer networks chosen for modeling is based on DECnet communication software. Modeling concentrates mainly on the DECnet protocols and their hierarchies. The paper indicates the adaptations necessary to adjust the MOSAIC kernel system adequately to DECnet computer networks and summarizes the results of a rather extensive validation for the modeling system, comprising calibration and accuracy establishment, which has been carried out successfully.
