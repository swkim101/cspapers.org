This paper presents a semantic model for parallel systems with a scheduling mechanism that is useful for expressing and proving a wider range of properties than semantic models that do not consider scheduling.We formally describe a number of properties related to scheduling and deadlock, including "Fairness" and "Fullness", and show that schedulers with these properties behave in desirable ways.Lastly, we prove and conjecture some proof rules for scheduled systems and outline briefly the relation of this work to modelling protection in parallel systems.
