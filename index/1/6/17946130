This video shows the results of the project on the mechatronic development of the Twente humanoid head. The mechanical structure consists of a neck with four degrees of freedom (DOFs) and two eyes (a stereo pair system) which tilt on a common axis and rotate sideways freely providing a three more DOFs. The motion control algorithm is designed to receive, as an input, the output of a biological-inspired vision processing algorithm and to exploit the redundancy of the joints for the realization of the movements. The expressions of the humanoid head are implemented by projecting light from the internal part of the translucent plastic cover.
