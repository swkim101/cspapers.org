This paper introduces a system architecture which allows a high degree of restructuring so that system resources may be tailored to processing requirements. The proposed system organization consists of a large number of byte-slice processors interconnected through a system of busses. Each processor is capable of communicating with every other processor in the system and any number of adjacent processors may be strung together to create a wider arithmetic capability than is possible with a single processor. Processors may be organized into a number of independent teams while processor teams may, in turn, be organized in a hierarchical fashion to allow for concurrent processing. Processor teams may function either in cooperation with or completely independent of other processor teams.
 All communication throughout the system consists of information packets containing the data to be transferred and a series of tags which indicate the destination address for the data and the action to be taken by the processor upon receipt of the information packet.
 Two types of busses are employed; Conventional busses and the circulating loop (or Pierce loop). The circulating loop moves an information packet in a fixed direction a uniform distance in each unit of time and therefore allows independent data transfer operations to be carried out simultaneously. Several examples illustrate the utility of the proposed architecture.
