The aim of this paper is to propose an efficient digital water-marking algorithm on geographical data. Our algorithm is fast, blind and robust. Thus, the original data is not needed in order to prove the authorship of the document and the watermark is resiliant against many transformations applied on the document.
 The method we propose is based on a modification of parts of the data selected upon local criterias and a secret key. The local criterias use topological properties of a Delaunay mesh build on the original map. The local modifications of parts of the document introduce a statistical slant inside the document. The detection algorithm is a simple detection of this slant.
 Experimental results illustrate the resiliance of the algorithm against different tranformations such as rotation, translation, data shuffling and cropping.
