Servers that consist of multiple nodes and sockets are interconnected together with a high-bandwidth, low latency processor interconnect network, such as Intel QPI or AMD Hypertransport technologies. The different nodes exchange packets through routers which communicate with other routers. A key component of a router is the routing table which determines which output port an arriving packet should be forwarded through. However, because of the flexibility (or programmability) of the routing tables, we show that it can result in security vulnerability. We describe the procedures for how the routing tables in a processor-interconnect router can be modified. Based on these modifications, we propose new system attacks in a server, which include both performance attacks by degrading the latency and/or the bandwidth of the processor interconnect as well as a livelock attack that hangs the system. We implement these system on an 8-node AMD server and show how performance can be significantly degraded. Based on this vulnerability, we propose alternative solutions that provide various trade-off in terms of flexibility and cost while minimizing the routing table security vulnerability.
