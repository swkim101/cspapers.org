Clustering of short texts, such as snippets, presents great challenges in existing aggregated search techniques due to the problem of data sparseness and the complex semantics of natural language. As short texts do not provide sufficient term occurring information, traditional text representation methods, such as ``bag of words" model, have several limitations when directly applied to short texts tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to improve the performance of short texts clustering by exploiting the internal semantics from original text and external concepts from world knowledge. The proposed method employs a hierarchical three-level structure to tackle the data sparsity problem of original short texts and reconstruct the corresponding feature space with the integration of multiple semantic knowledge bases -- Wikipedia and WordNet. Empirical evaluation with Reuters and real web dataset demonstrates that our approach is able to achieve significant improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
