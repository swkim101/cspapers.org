Several quantities of interest in combinatorics and number theory, including the length of the largest prime factor of a random number, are distributed asymptotically according to a law discovered by Dickman in 1930. There are corresponding distributions for the second-largest length, third-largest length, and so on. To generate random variates with these distributions, one can use a simple “random bisection” process, together with a priority queue. The long-term behavior of the queue poses an interesting algorithm analysis problem. We show: 1) The expected size of the queue is bounded, and its steady state can be explicitly expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function. 2) The expected time at which the n-th largest length is known is n + O(1). 3) With high probability, the queue will never be larger than O(logn), if the process is run for n steps. 4) The expected waiting time until the queue is empty (a renewal event) is O(1). All bounds are computed explicitly (in some cases via interesting multidimensional integrals).
