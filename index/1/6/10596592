Performing link prediction in Knowledge Bases (KBs) with embedding-based models, like with the model TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) which represents relationships as translations in the embedding space, have shown promising results in recent years. Most of these works are focused on modeling single relationships and hence do not take full advantage of the graph structure of KBs. In this paper, we propose an extension of TransE that learns to explicitly model composition of relationships via the addition of their corresponding translation vectors. We show empirically that this allows to improve performance for predicting single relationships as well as compositions of pairs of them.
