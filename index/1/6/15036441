Time delay in attitude sensors is one of the performance limiting factors in controlling the satellite attitude. In this paper, we investigate attitude control of a fully actuated satellite in presence of constant and known delay in attitude measurement. The proposed controller consists of a matrix gain which is computed by solving a time varying matrix differential equation depending on the time delay. We assume that the moment-of-inertia matrix of the satellite is unknown. The controller guarantees asymptotic convergence of the satellite attitude and angular velocity to their desired values in presence of delay. Finally, a simulation example is presented that illustrates performance of the proposed controller in presence of delayed attitude measurement.
