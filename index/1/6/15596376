The resource management system is designed to support location-transparent access to resources and to improve performance in a distributed internetwork environment. In this environment, access to one of several machines that have a given resource is determined by the effective bandwidth and reliability of internetwork communications, the ability to interact with the machines offering the resources, and the load on those machines. Using these criteria, the resources management system enables applications to determine and obtain access to the “best” copy of a resource. Should the resource become unavailable from one machine, the resource management system can dynamically direct the applications to another machine known to offer the same resource. This paper discusses some of the problems that motivated the design, an implementation for a UNIX workstation environment, and future directions for the resource management system.
