Animals are able to accelerate rapidly from rest with incredible dexterity but these transient motions are poorly understood. Here we present the first examination of the time optimal behaviour of a quadruped sprinting from rest. We develop a planar multi-body model and employ modern trajectory optimization methods to produce a motion without prescribing periodicity or foot contact order. Our trajectories produce several similarities with racing greyhounds. These results will inspire the design of feedback controllers for future manoeuvrable quadruped robots.
