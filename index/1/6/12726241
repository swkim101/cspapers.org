Dividing web pages into fragments has been shown to provide significant benefits for both content generation and caching. In order for a web site to use fragment-based content generation, however, good methods are needed for dividing web pages into fragments. Manual fragmentation of web pages is expensive, error prone, and unscalable. This paper proposes a novel scheme to automatically detect and flag fragments that are cost-effective cache units in web sites serving dynamic content. We consider the fragments to be interesting if they are shared among multiple documents or they have different lifetime or personalization characteristics. Our approach has three unique features. First, we propose a hierarchical and fragment-aware model of the dynamic web pages and a data structure that is compact and effective for fragment detection. Second, we present an efficient algorithm to detect maximal fragments that are shared among multiple documents. Third, we develop a practical algorithm that effectively detects fragments based on their lifetime and personalization characteristics. We evaluate the proposed scheme through a series of experiments, showing the benefits and costs of the algorithms. We also study the impact of adopting the fragments detected by our system on disk space utilization and network bandwidth consumption.
