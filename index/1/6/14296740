Rainbow is a Java and web-based distributed database system designed for academic purposes, and serves as an exercise to understand concepts of distributed transactions and transaction management including concurrency control, atomic actions, data replication, and fault tolerance. The motivation for the Rainbow project is twofold. First, Rainbow can be used as a teaching tool. Graduate students taking Distributed Database (or Database Implementation courses) can gain a better understanding and experience of issues involved in transaction processing in a distributed environment [1][2][4]. The second motivation is to use Rainbow as a research tool to conduct scientific experiments on distributed database and transaction processing. To achieve these goals, Rainbow allows the user to configure and program the distributed environment, transactions, and transaction management protocols, and to observe local as well as global executions (history and measured behavior and performance). Rainbow also lends itself as an open system that can be easily changed and extended by students and researchers.
