Design, internal structure, implementation experience and a number of unique features of the SAMPLER/3000 performance evaluation tool are presented. This package can be used to produce program CPU and wait time profiles in several levels of detail in terms of code segments, procedure names and procedure relative addresses. It also provides an accurate profile of the operating systems code which is exercised to service requests from the selective parts of the user code. Programs can be observed under natural load conditions in a single user or shared environment. A program's CPU usage is determined in terms of direct and indirect cost components. The approaches to determine direct and indirect CPU times are described. A program counter sampling technique in virtual memory domain is discussed. Certain interesting aspects of data analysis and on-line data presentation techniques are described. The features of the computer architecture, the services of the loader and compilers which relate to the operation of the tool are discussed. A case study is finally presented.
