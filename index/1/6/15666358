The temperature field model for laser rapid prototyping is established by the mathematical treatment of laser power input. Temperature fields with different process conditions are numerical simulated, and the temperature is Gaussian distribution as the intensity distribution on laser beam cross-section. Temperature fields for laser rapid prototyping ware measured by thermal imager in real time. The simulation results agree with the experimental measurement. Experiments show that the temperature field model can be used for computer analysis and optimizing of laser rapid prototyping processing.
