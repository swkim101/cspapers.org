The general principles for constructing workload models are reviewed. The differences between static and dynamic workload models are introduced and the importance of the classification phase for the implementation of both types of workload models is pointed out. All the operations required for constructing static workload models have been connected in a package. Its main properties and fields of application are presented. The results of an experimental study performed with the package on a batch and interactive workload show its ease of use and the accuracy of the model obtained.
