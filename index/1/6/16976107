This paper discusses a template-based approach to aid in introducing the upper-division undergraduate (or first year graduate) to the rapidly emerging message passing parallel computing paradigm. Our template library facilitates an accelerated MPI programming learning environment that can realistically be included as one topic among many in an algorithms course. One template module is based on a backtracking solution to the satisfiablity problem (SAT), which the student first solves in the sequential setting. With the aid of a modified template, the student then develops a simple parallel SAT solver. The template includes such things as I/O functions, allowing the student to focus on the algorithm itself. The parallel part is partially provided by the template, with indicators given in places where the student needs to plug in missing MPI function calls. The students are excited about this hands-on-experience in the increasingly important world of message passing parallel computing, which might be missed if their curriculum does not include a course devoted to this topic.
