The Tactical Language and Culture Training System (TLCTS) helps people quickly acquire communicative skills in foreign languages and cultures. More than 20,000 learners worldwide have used TLCTS courses. TLCTS utilizes artificial intelligence technologies in multiple ways: during the authoring process, and at run time to process learner speech, interpret learner actions, control the response of non-player characters, and evaluate and assess learner performance and proficiency. This paper describes the architecture of TLCTS and the artificial intelligence technologies that it employs, and presents results from multiple evaluation studies that demonstrate the benefits of learning foreign language and culture using this approach.
