Social networks have become the de facto online resource for people to share, comment on and be informed about events pertinent to their interests and livelihood, ranging from road traffic or an illness to concerts and earthquakes, to economics and politics. This has been the driving force behind research endeavors that analyse such data. In this paper, we focus on how Content Networks can help us identify events effectively. Content Networks incorporate both structural and content-related information of a social network in a unified way, at the same time, bringing together two disparate lines of research: graph-based and content-based event discovery in social media. We model interactions of two types of nodes, users and content, and introduce an algorithm that builds heterogeneous, dynamic graphs, in addition to revealing content links in the network's structure. By linking similar content nodes and tracking connected components over time, we can effectively identify different types of events. Our evaluation on social media streaming data suggests that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, while showcasing the significance of hidden links to the quality of the results.
