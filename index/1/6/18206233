Today's web consists of dynamic web sites with a wide range of functionality, whereby most of the sites are based on Content Management Systems (CMS). CMSs became a de facto standard as basic frameworks for web applications, because they provide lots of existing features and a high usability. Even though typical CMSs come along with lots of core functions, the most of them are extensible through different extension types. Through these extensions CMS-based applications become fully adequate web applications. One of the most popular CMSs is Joomla, which is extensible through external functionality. During the development and maintenance of both external functionality and concrete Joomla-based sites, some obstacles occur. One of the most substantial obstacle occurs when a new version of the core CMS platform is released. A further migration process is always an extremely time-consuming process. Through the use of model-driven development (MDD) a lot of the invested development and maintenance effort can be reduced, especially when new platform versions appear frequently. This paper proposes an MDD approach to the Joomla CMS, and contains several use cases for both forward engineering and reverse engineering of Joomla extensions and Joomla-based web sites with concrete data which shall be used for a faster and simpler migration process.
