This paper describes the use of a board game as a device for introducing graph theory to computer science students. By experiencing a hands-on demonstration of graphs, students can better understand the basic principles of graph theory and can better design algorithms and programs which manipulate graph data. The programming assignment tied to the game forces the students to come to grips with the algorithmic aspects of graph theory, including the proper choice of data structures and the implementation of graph algorithms.
