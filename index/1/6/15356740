An efficient management of multiversion data with branched evolution is crucial for many applications. It requires database designers aware of tradeoffs among index structures and policies. This paper defines a framework and an analysis method for understanding the behavior of different indexing policies. Given data and query characteristics the analysis allows determining the most suitable index structure. The analysis is validated by an experimental study.
