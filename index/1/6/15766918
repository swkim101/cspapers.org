In this paper we propose the integration of intelligent components technologies (natural language and discourse management) in voice web interfaces to make them smarter. We describe how we have integrated reusable components of dialogue management and language processing in a multilingual voice system to improve its friendliness and portability. The dialogue management component deals with complex dialogue phenomena, such as user-initiative dialogues, and follows the information state-based theory. The resulting dialogue system supports friendly communication (through the telephone and the web) in several languages: English, Spanish, Catalan and Italian. The dialogue system has been adapted to guide the users to access online public administration services.
