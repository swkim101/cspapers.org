There have been many courses and modes of instruction proposed for training in-service elementary and secondary teachers in computer science. In this paper, we argue-qualitatively-our position regarding appropriate topics and media for this audience. We present the outlines and objectives of two consecutive introductory computer science courses which we have developed and taught over the past five years. The courses are substantive, yet accessible to primary and secondary teachers having little or no background in mathematics or computer science.
