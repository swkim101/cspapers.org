This paper describes LP, a program that learns new techniques for solving equations by examining worked examples. Unlike most of the work in this field, e.g. (Neves, 1978), where the equations used have been very simple, LP uses complex equations, see below. LP can learn from one example, using concepts from the planning field. 
 
In order to be able to successfully use a new technique, LP learns many different types of information. To learn new rewrite rules, LP compares consecutive lines in the worked example, finding differences between them. It also learns the strategic purpose of the steps, by considering the worked example as a type of plan for solving the equation. LP extracts the necessary information, and builds a plan which is stored for future use. LP executes the plan in a flexible way to solve new equations.
