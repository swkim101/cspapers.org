The objective of Shape-from-Template (SfT) is to infer an object's shape from a single image and a 3D object template. Existing methods are called thin-shell SfT as they represent the object by its outer surface. This may be an open surface for thin objects such as a piece of paper or a closed surface for thicker objects such as a ball. We propose volumetric SfT, which specifically handles objects of the latter kind. Volumetric SfT uses the object's full volume to express the deformation constraints and reconstructs the object's surface and interior deformation. This is a challenging problem because for opaque objects, only a part of the outer surface is visible in the image. Inspired by mesh-editing techniques, we use an As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) deformation model that softly imposes local rigidity. We formalise ARAP isometric SfT as a constrained variational optimisation problem which we solve using iterative optimisation. We present strategies to find an initial solution based on thin-shell SfT and volume propagation. Experiments with synthetic and real data show that our method has a typical maximum relative error of 5% in reconstructing the deformation of an entire object, including its back and interior for which no visual data is available.
