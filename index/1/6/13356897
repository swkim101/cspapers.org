An on-line problem is one in which an algorithm must handle a sequence of requests, satisfying each request without knowledge of the future requests. Examples of on-line problems include scheduling the motion of elevators, finding routes in networks, allocating cache memory, and maintaining dynamic data structures. A competitive algorithm for an on-line problem has the property that its performance on any sequence of requests is within a constant factor of the performance of any other algorithm on the same sequence. This paper presents several general results concerning competitive algorithms, as well as results on specific on-line problems.
