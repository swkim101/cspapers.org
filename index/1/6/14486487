A new detection criterion based on the change in the marginal information redundancy is presented. By establishing a link with information theory we are able to give an intuitive interpretation of our criterion. The usefulness of the new criterion is demonstrated for a case study of human movement initiation detection from force and torque signals in activity of daily living tasks. Using the new criterion, we achieve a performance that is more in agreement with expert decisions compared with traditional thresholding techniques and the advanced wavelet-based detector and energy detectors.
