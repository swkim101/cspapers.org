We present cSPADE, an ecient algorithm for mining fre- quent sequences considering a variety of syntactic constraints. These take the form of length or width limitations on the sequences, minimum or maximum gap constraints on con- secutive sequence elements, applying a time window on al- lowable sequences, incorporating item constraints, and Ãžnd- ing sequences predictive of one or more classes, even rare ones. Our method is ecient and scalable. Experiments on a number of synthetic and real databases show the utility and performance of considering such constraints on the set of mined sequences.
