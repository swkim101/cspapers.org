The Internet of Things (IOT) has been widely applied in many fields, while the IOT data are always large volume, update frequently and inherently multi-dimensional, these characteristics bring big challenges to the traditional DBMSs. The traditional DBMSs have rich functionality and can deal with multi-attributes access efficiently, they can not scale good enough to deal with large volume data and can not support high insert throughput. The cloud-based database systems have good scalability, but they don't support multi-dimensional access natively.In order to deal with the large volume of IOT data, we propose an update and query efficient index framework (UQE-Index) based on key-value store that can support high insert throughput and provide efficient multi-dimensional query simultaneously. We implemented a prototype based on HBase and did comprehensive experiments to test our solution's scalability and efficiency.
