The computer science capstone experience is designed to bridge the gap from university expectations to those of industry. Yet trying to solve this problem with a single course sequence, even one spanning the senior year, has some shortcomings, in terms of learning outcomes which can be achieved, and also instructional strategies that can be employed. We describe here an alternative plan which first provides a junior year of practice on a client-based project integrated with learning design and other related topics, followed by a senior year in which students can work more independently to hone these skills on a harder year-long project with another client. This two-year sequence, with scaffolding provided at first that is gradually removed, has proven to be especially effective in preparing undergraduates for a career in the soft- ware industry. The approach also integrates well with the need for these students to become proficient at working in engineering teams.
