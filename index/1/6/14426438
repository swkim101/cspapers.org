A class of policies called stationary delayed resolution policies have been proposed recently for sharing finite number of buffers at a store-and-forward node in a message switching network [9]. It has been shown that with respect to the total weighted throughput these policies comprise the optimal class of policies. In this paper, we present methods to obtain an optimal policy from the class of stationary delayed resolution policies for given values of the parameters.
 A method based upon policy iteration technique for Markov decision processes is used to obtain the optimal delayed resolution policy. It is shown that the policy iteration technique while useful in obtaining the exact optimal policy becomes intractable for practical values of buffer sizes and number of message classes. A class of policies called SRS delayed resolution policies is proposed. It is shown that the best SRS delayed resolution policies closely approximate the performance of the optimal delayed resolution policies.
