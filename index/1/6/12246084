The reliability of the Internet of Things is critical because the services of it will be concerned with real life, although the low cost may limit the number of links of each computer. In this paper, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of wireless regular graphs of which the number of links of each node is bounded. We derive the exact reliability polynomials for four regular graphs that are important candidates. The reliability polynomials are directly derived from the Tutte polynomial, which is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory. To make the Tutte polynomials for graphs, we use the fastest program that was recently developed. As a result, we found that the torus graph of width three or more is the most reliable bounded degree network.
