In the densely-populated urban areas, pedestrian flows often cross each other and congestion occurs. It may cause discomfort feeling or pedestrian accidents. In order to reduce the congestion or the risk of accidents, it is required to control swarm flows of pedestrian. This paper proposes an implicit control method of the crossing pedestrian flows. Pedestrian flow is modeled with the continuum fluid model and its congestion degree is calculated as the fluid density. From a simulation of the crossing flows with the continuum model, it is verified that diagonal stripe pattern of the congestion degree emerges. Moreover, the authors propose an implicit control method to improve average flow velocity by moving guides. Focusing on periodic phenomenon of the crossing flows, we investigate the relationship between its temporal and spatial frequency and a periodic motion of guides. From this relationship, a control method based on the temporal and spatial frequency is proposed.
