Object recognition and pose estimation from RGB-D images are important tasks for manipulation robots which can be learned from examples. Creating and annotating datasets for learning is expensive, however. We address this problem with transfer learning from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) that are pre-trained for image categorization and provide a rich, semantically meaningful feature set. We incorporate depth information, which the CNN was not trained with, by rendering objects from a canonical perspective and colorizing the depth channel according to distance from the object center. We evaluate our approach on the Washington RGB-D Objects dataset, where we find that the generated feature set naturally separates classes and instances well and retains pose manifolds. We outperform state-of-the-art on a number of subtasks and show that our approach can yield superior results when only little training data is available.
