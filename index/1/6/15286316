Usually the focus of evaluation within Information Retrieval has been placed largely upon the system. However, the individual user and their submitted queries are typically the greatest source of variation in the search process. This demonstration paper presents Fu-Finder, a fun and enjoyable game that measures the user's querying abilities (or search-fu). This game provides useful data for the study of user querying behaviour and assesses how well users can find specific web pages using different search engines.
