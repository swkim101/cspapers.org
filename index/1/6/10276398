Forward decoding kernel machines (FDKM) combine large-margin classifiers with hidden Markov models (HMM) for maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptive sequence estimation. State transitions in the sequence are conditioned on observed data using a kernel-based probability model trained with a recursive scheme that deals effectively with noisy and partially labeled data. Training over very large datasets is accomplished using a sparse probabilistic support vector machine (SVM) model based on quadratic entropy, and an on-line stochastic steepest descent algorithm. For speaker-independent continuous phone recognition, FDKM trained over 177,080 samples of the TIMIT database achieves 80.6% recognition accuracy over the full test set. without use of a prior phonetic language model.
