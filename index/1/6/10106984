Based on a statistical mechanics approach, we develop a method for approximately computing average case learning curves for Gaussian process regression models. The approximation works well in the large sample size limit and for arbitrary dimensionality of the input space. We explain how the approximation can be systematically improved and argue that similar techniques can be applied to general likelihood models.
