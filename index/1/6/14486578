Pedagogy of large lecture classes has traditionally focussed on deemphasizing the problems their size creates. This approach has yielded valuable practical advice for instructors. However, this paper argues that there are pedagogical advantages to the large lecture format and that exploiting these advantages can further improve classroom instruction. I present some advantages of large classes and anecdotes that demonstrate how to exploit these advantages.
