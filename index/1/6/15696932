In this paper, we investigate the problem of identifying inconsistent hosts in large-scale enterprise networks by mining multiple views of temporal data collected from the networks. The time-varying behavior of hosts is typically consistent across multiple views, and thus hosts that exhibit inconsistent behavior are possible anomalous points to be further investigated. To achieve this goal, we develop an effective approach that extracts common patterns hidden in multiple views and detects inconsistency by measuring the deviation from these common patterns. Specifically, we first apply various anomaly detectors on the raw data and form a three-way tensor (host, time, detector) for each view. We then develop a joint probabilistic tensor factorization method to derive the latent tensor subspace, which captures common time-varying behavior across views. Based on the extracted tensor subspace, an inconsistency score is calculated for each host that measures the deviation from common behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two enterprise-wide network-based anomaly detection tasks. An enterprise network consists of multiple hosts (servers, desktops, laptops) and each host sends/receives a time-varying number of bytes across network protocols (e.g.,TCP, UDP, ICMP) or send URL requests to DNS under various categories. The inconsistent behavior of a host is often a leading indicator of potential issues (e.g., instability, malicious behavior, or hardware malfunction). We perform experiments on real-world data collected from IBM enterprise networks, and demonstrate that the proposed method can find hosts with inconsistent behavior that are important to cybersecurity applications.
