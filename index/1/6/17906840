P-log is a probabilistic logic programming language, which combines both logic programming style knowledge representation and probabilistic reasoning. In earlier papers various advantages of P-log have been discussed. In this paper we further elaborate on the KR prowess of P-log by showing that: (i) it can be used for causal and counterfactual reasoning and (ii) it provides an elaboration tolerant way for non-naive conditioning.
