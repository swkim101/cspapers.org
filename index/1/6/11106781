The objective of this paper is to design an embedding method mapping local features describing image (e.g. SIFT) to a higher dimensional representation used for image retrieval problem. By investigating the relationship between the linear approximation of a nonlinear function in high dimensional space and state-of-the-art feature representation used in image retrieval, i.e., VLAD, we first introduce a new approach for the approximation. The embedded vectors resulted by the function approximation process are then aggregated to form a single representation used in the image retrieval framework. The evaluation shows that our embedding method gives a performance boost over the state of the art in image retrieval, as demonstrated by our experiments on the standard public image retrieval benchmarks.
