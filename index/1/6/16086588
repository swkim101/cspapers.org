Abstract—This paper proposes a new approach for tackling the multi-attribute decision making problems under uncertainty or the decision maker’s imprecise judgment environment. In this paper fuzzy grey relational analysis for multi-attribute decision making is extended to fuzzy environment. A new algorithm for fuzzy grey relational analysis for the evaluation of information technology outsourcing service providers is put forward.  At last, a numerical example illustrates the application of our approach.
