A hardware approach to the design of data driven computers using a microprogrammed processor as a building block is proposed. The data driven computer is a network of processors virtually implementing the data flow program graph. The flexibility of microprogramming provides a wide variety of possible implementations for the fixed data driven network structure. Due to the proposed organization of communication the network is deadlock-free.
