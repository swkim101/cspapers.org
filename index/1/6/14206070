Traditional synthesis techniques optimize CMOS circuits in two phases: i) logic minimization and ii) library mapping phase. Typically, the structures and the sizes of the gates in the library are chosen to yield good synthesis results over many blocks or even for an entire chip. Consequently this approach precludes an optimal design of individual blocks which may need custom structures. The authors present a new transistor level technique that optimizes CMOS circuits both structurally and size-wise. The technique is independent of a library and hence can explore a design space much larger than that possible due to gate level optimization. Results demonstrate a significant improvement in circuit performance of the resynthesized circuits.
