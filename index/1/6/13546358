We consider a fundamental problem in computational learning theory: learning an arbitrary Boolean function which depends on an unknown set of <i>k</i> out of <i>n</i> Boolean variables. We give an algorithm for learning such functions from uniform random examples which runs in time roughly <i>(n<sup>k</sup>)<sup>ω/(ω + 1)</sup>,</i> where <i>ω < 2.376</i> is the matrix multiplication exponent. We thus obtain the first polynomial factor improvement on the naive <i>n<sup>k</sup></i> time bound which can be achieved via exhaustive search. Our algorithm and analysis exploit new structural properties of Boolean functions.
