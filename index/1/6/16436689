Authorship attribution (AA) aims to identify the authors of a set of documents. Traditional studies in this area often assume that there are a large set of labeled documents available for training. However, in the real life, it is hard or expensive to collect a large set of labeled data. For example, in the online review domain, most reviewers (authors) only write a few reviews, which are not enough to serve as the training data for accurate classification. In this paper, we present a novel two-view co-training framework to iteratively identify the authors of a few unlabeled data to augment the training set. The key idea is to first represent each document as several distinct views, and then a co-training technique is adopted to exploit the large amount of unlabeled documents. Starting from 10 training texts per author, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of co-training for authorship attribution with limited labeled data. Two methods and three views are investigated: logistic regression (LR) and support vector machines (SVM) methods, and character, lexical, and syntactic views. The experimental results show that LR is particularly effective for improving co-training in AA, and the lexical view performs the best among three views when combined with a LR classifier. Furthermore, the co-training framework does not make much difference between one classifier from two views and two classifiers from one view. Instead, it is the learning approach and the view that plays a critical role.
