We consider recurrent analog neural nets where each gate is subject to Gaussian noise, or any other common noise distribution whose probability density function is nonzero on a large set. We show that many regular languages cannot be recognized by networks of this type, for example the language {w e {O, I}*| w begins with O}, and we give a precise characterization of those languages which can be recognized. This result implies severe constraints on possibilities for constructing recurrent analog neural nets that are robust against realistic types of analog noise. On the other hand we present a method for constructing feed forward analog neural nets that are robust with regard to analog noise of this type.
