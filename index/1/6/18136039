This paper presents a hybrid architecture for local area networks (LANs) which combines the advantages of token ring and mesh networks while remaining relatively simple. Each node may have two communication channels. The first is a token ring and is used for short or prioritized message data transmissions. The other consists of an arbitrary collection of data links, which are used for relatively high volume and low priority data messages. With this architecture, a LAN can be installed in the form of token ring and can be upgraded and “tuned” to its application environment by the insertion of node-to-node data links.
Simulation results indicate that even with rather simple network control and routing algorithms, performance is improved over token ring due to data transmission concurrency greater than one.
