This paper describes work on the development of symbolic registration and change analysis techniques applied to the problem of the comparison of pairs of images of a scene to generate descriptions of the changes in the scene. Unlike earlier work in change analysis, all the matching and later analysis is performed symbolically. We also discuss techniques for the generation of symbolic descriptions of images, both the segmentation and feature extraction problems. These techniques have been applied to several different scenes and in this paper we present the results for two of these scenes.
