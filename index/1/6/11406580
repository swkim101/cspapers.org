The SensorFly system is a novel, low-cost, miniature controlled-mobile aerial sensor network. Mobility permits the network to be autonomous in deployment, maintenance and adapting to the environment, overcoming the reliance of traditionally fixed networks on human intervention, large infrastructure or inefficient random methods. We wish to demonstrate the novel hardware design, flight control and collaborative localization capabilities of the SensorFly system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the lightest realized flying sensor system in existence, with a weight of 30g and low mass production cost of ~$100. Developed under severe weight, cost, energy and processing power constraints, we show that this system is a viable and capable mobile sensor network platform.
