This paper describes an experimental stereo vision based motion planning system for humanoid robots. The goal is to automatically generate arm trajectories that avoid obstacles in unknown environments from high-level task commands. Our system consists of three components: 1) environment sensing using stereo vision with disparity map generation and on-line consistency checking, 2) probabilistic mesh modeling in order to accumulate continuous vision input, and 3) motion planning for the robot arm using RRTs (rapidly exploring random trees). We demonstrate results from experiments using an implementation designed for the humanoid robot H7.
