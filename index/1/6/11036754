Current research in automatic subjectivity analysis deals with various kinds of subjective statements involving human attitudes and emotions. While all of them are related to subjectivity, these statements usually touch on multiple dimensions such as non-objectivity, uncertainty, vagueness, non-objective measurability, imprecision, and ambiguity, which are inherently different. This paper discusses the differences and relations of six dimensions of subjectivity. Conceptual and linguistic characteristics of each dimension will be demonstrated under different contexts.
