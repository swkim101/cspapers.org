The proper structuring of the implementation levels in a digital computer system is an important attribute for all aspects of the product. That is to say, the design, development, testing, production and maintenance of the product are facilitated by a well-structured design of the software and hardware components. This paper discusses digital computer system structuring in general, followed by descriptions of the logical and physical architecture of the DATASAAB FCPU (<u>F</u>lexible <u>C</u>entral <u>P</u>rocessing <u>U</u>nit). The implementation of a vector arithmetic instruction is presented to provide a more thorough insight into the operational aspects of the FCPU. Finally, the benefits derived from the structuring of this hardware product are presented.
