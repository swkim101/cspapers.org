Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in inaccessible areas may buffer large volumes of data in flash or SRAM memories for infrequent retrieval across poor uplinks (intermittent, asymmetric, or slow). Such conditions require: 1) minimal round-trip interaction (as in ARQ-based protocols), 2) tolerance of unbounded channel losses (which overwhelms fixed-rate FEC), and 3) low resource consumption on the sender. We present design considerations for the use of online codes [1] for bulk data transfer, and experimental results that show appropriate tradeoffs for use in WSNs.
