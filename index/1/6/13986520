Adaptivity is an important mechanism used to handle the dynamic characteristics of the Internet infrastructure. It is commonly employed to allow distributed applications to monitor and subsequently respond to the ephemeral faults and variable performance that have characterized the Internet since its conception [1]. More recently, adaptation mechanisms were integrated into overlay networks, a technology proposed to improve on the perceived limitations of end-to-end communication using the existing Internet routing infrastructure.
