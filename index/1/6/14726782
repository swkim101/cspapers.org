A method is presented for incremental development of high performance parallel programs, using an application from molecular dynamics as a case study. The method uses the technique of overhead analysis, which aims to explain experimental observations using models of execution behaviour, as a means of determining successive steps in program development. The case study illustrates how this technique can be applied to the complexities of real-world parallel computations.
