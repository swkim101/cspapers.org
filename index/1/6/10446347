Tracking human gait accurately and robustly constitutes a key factor for a smart robotic walker, aiming to provide assistance to patients with different mobility impairment. A context-aware assistive robot needs constant knowledge of the user's kinematic state to assess the gait status and adjust its movement properly to provide optimal assistance. In this work, we experimentally validate the performance of two gait tracking algorithms using data from elderly patients; the first algorithm employs a Kalman Filter (KF), while the second one tracks the user legs separately using two probabilistically associated Particle Filters (PFs). The algorithms are compared according to their accuracy and robustness, using data captured from real experiments, where elderly subjects performed specific walking scenarios with physical assistance from a prototype Robotic Rollator. Sensorial data were provided by a laser rangefinder mounted on the robotic platform recording the movement of the user's legs. The accuracy of the proposed algorithms is analysed and validated with respect to ground truth data provided by a Motion Capture system tracking a set of visual markers worn by the patients. The robustness of the two tracking algorithms is also analysed comparatively in a complex maneuvering scenario. Current experimental findings demonstrate the superior performance of the PFs in difficult cases of occlusions and clutter, where KF tracking often fails.
