In many cases, a user turns to search engines to find information about real-world situations, namely, political elections, sport competitions, or natural disasters. Such temporal querying behavior can be observed through a significant number of event-related queries generated in web search. In this paper, we study the task of detecting event-related queries, which is the first step for understanding temporal query intent and enabling different temporal search applications, e.g., time-aware query auto-completion, temporal ranking, and result diversification. We propose a two-step approach to detecting events from query logs. We first identify a set of event candidates by considering both implicit and explicit temporal information needs. The next step further classifies the candidates into two main categories, namely, event or non-event. In more detail, we leverage different machine learning techniques for query classification, which are trained using the feature set composed of time series features from signal processing, along with features derived from click-through information, and standard statistical features. In order to evaluate our proposed approach, we conduct an experiment using two real-world query logs with manually annotated relevance assessments for 837 events. To this end, we provide a large set of event-related queries made available for fostering research on this challenging task.
