There have been various approaches to enhance physical performances by adding visuals and/or audio according to the motions of performers. However, these methods were too simple to explain the performers' will of their body expression. Furthermore, they did not consider exceeding the physical limitation of body expression, such as providing the sense of faster movement of arms by changing colors in costumes dynamically. We propose a new LED performance system to expand the expression capability of human body. We can create new generation performances by combining body expression and lighting effects.
