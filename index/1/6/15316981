Despite the recent security improvements in Adobe's PDF viewer, its underlying code base remains vulnerable to novel exploits. A steady flow of rapidly evolving PDF malware observed in the wild substantiates the need for novel protection instruments beyond the classical signature-based scanners. In this contribution we present a technique for detection of JavaScript-bearing malicious PDF documents based on static analysis of extracted JavaScript code. Compared to previous work, mostly based on dynamic analysis, our method incurs an order of magnitude lower run-time overhead and does not require special instrumentation. Due to its efficiency we were able to evaluate it on an extremely large real-life dataset obtained from the VirusTotal malware upload portal. Our method has proved to be effective against both known and unknown malware and suitable for large-scale batch processing.
