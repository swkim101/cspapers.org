Full-text database systems require an index to allow fast access to documents based on their content. We propose an inverted file indexing scheme based on compression. This scheme allows users to retrieve documents using words occurring in the documents, sequences of adjacent words, and statistical ranking techniques. The compression methods chosen ensure that the storage requirements are small and that dynamic update is straightforward. The only assumption that we make is that sufficient main memory is available to support an in-memory vocabulary; given this assumption, the method we describe requires at most one disc access per query term to identify an-
