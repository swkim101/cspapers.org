This research investigates a space model server for indoor location-based services which require fine-grained spatial data. Functional and non-functional requirements for a space model server that supports such services are identified. A system architecture is proposed that scales well in terms of model size, query loads and types of services. The space model reuses a schema for network-based space layouts which supports high spatial resolution and efficient local queries. Properties of a query language used to extract partial models from the space model server are investigated. System implementation and validation are discussed.
