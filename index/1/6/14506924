We address the problem of dispersing a large number of autonomous mobile robots toward building wireless ad hoc sensor networks performing environmental monitoring and control. For the purpose, we propose the adaptive triangular mesh generation algorithm that enables robots to generate triangular meshes of various sizes adapting to changing environmental conditions. A locally interacting, geometric technique allows robots to generate each triangular mesh with their two neighbor robots. Specifically, we have assumed that robots are not allowed to have the identifier, any pre-determined leaders or common coordinate systems, and any explicit communication. Under such minimal conditions, the positions of the robots were shown to converge to the desired distribution, which was mathematically proven and also verified through extensive simulations. Our preliminary results indicate that the proposed algorithm can be applied to the problem regarding the coverage of an area of interest by a swarm of mobile sensors.
