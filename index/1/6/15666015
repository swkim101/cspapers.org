Using longitudinal survey data from women in the CRA-W Graduate Cohort program, we measured the prevalence of observed or experienced sexism and its impact on departure from Computer Science and Computer Engineering (CSE) doctoral programs. Our data suggest that sexist behavior is perceived less often by these women than it is by women in general. In addition, few of the women who observe sexism are motivated by it to think of leaving their CSE doctoral programs. Nevertheless, when their reason for thinking of leaving is due to sexism they observed or experienced, the odds of women actually departing are at least 21 times greater than if they thought of leaving for any other reason.
