This paper presents the novel mobile robotic gait rehabilitation system MOPASS and the first results from its usability testing in the clinics. Consisting of an adjustable mobile platform and a modular powered orthosis attached to the platform, the MOPASS system is able to cope with individual needs of patients during the overground walking training. The control system of MOPASS allows generation of individual gait patterns. The adjustment of the gait patterns to the patient is done over a graphical user interface by simple manipulation of the gait pattern curves displayed on the screen. The first results on the system application were obtained in two clinics with 20 patients in total. The results show a high degree of acceptance by both, therapists and patients, and indicate good prospects for the MOPASS system.
