The vision of the Semantic Web has stimulated the development of Web-scale architectures for discovering implicit associations from multiple heterogeneous data and knowledge sources. In biomedicine, using W3C-established standards and Linked Data principles, data publishers have transformed and linked several datasets to create a huge web of Life Sciences Linked Open Data (LSLOD). However, mining the LSLOD cloud is still very difficult and often impossible for biomedical researchers due to several challenges: structural heterogeneity, lack of vocabulary reuse, inconsistencies, and incompleteness. To discover drug-adverse reaction associations and their mechanistic explanations, I have developed a novel architecture that combines information retrieval and association discovery. The architecture demonstrates favorable AUROC statistics against baseline methods in pharmacovigilance, and provides confidence values on underlying biological mechanisms. I quantify the several challenges associated with mining the LSLOD cloud for biomedical applications through an empirical analysis of more than 40 different sources. Ideally, the architecture can be extended in other domains to realize the goal of implicit association discovery.
