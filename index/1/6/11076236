This paper presents a multiple autonomous robots collaboration model. On the basis of the research of autonomous robots belief and action in multirobot system by using nonlinear logic, we define autonomous agent's intention, which ensures every robot's action is Pareto rational, by using game theory. We also present intention generation algorithm, which ensures all autonomous robots without meta-level control can make joint plans collaboratively so as to achieve the best equilibrium state, at the conflict situation.<<ETX>>
