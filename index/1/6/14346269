Many real-world applications have requirements to support moving spatial keyword queries. For example a tourist looks for top-k "seafood restaurants" while walking in a city. She will continuously issue moving queries. However existing spatial keyword search methods focus on static queries and it calls for new effective techniques to support moving queries efficiently. In this paper we propose an effective method to support moving top-k spatial keyword queries. In addition to finding top-k answers of a moving query, we also calculate a safe region such that if a new query with a location falling in the safe region, we can directly use the answer set to answer the query. To this end, we propose an effective model to represent the safe region and devise efficient search algorithms to compute the safe region. We have implemented our method and experimental results on real datasets show that our method achieves high efficiency and outperforms existing methods significantly.
