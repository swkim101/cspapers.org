In a breakthrough result, Razborov (2003) gave optimal lower bounds on the communication complexity of every function f of the form f(x,y)=D(|x AND y|) for some D:{0,1,...,n}->{0,1}, in the bounded-error quantum model with and without prior entanglement. This was proved by the multidimensional discrepancy method. We give an entirely different proof of Razborov's result, using the original, one-dimensional discrepancy method. This refutes the commonly held intuition (Razborov 2003) that the original discrepancy method fails for functions such as DISJOINTNESS. More importantly, our communication lower bounds hold for a much broader class of functions for which no methods were available. Namely, fix an arbitrary function f:{0,1}n/4->{0,1} and let A be the Boolean matrix whose columns are each an application of f to some subset of the variables x1,x2,...,xn. We prove that the communication complexity of A in the bounded-error quantum model with and without prior entanglement is Omega(d), where d is the approximate degree of f. From this result, Razborov's lower bounds follow easily. Our result also establishes a large new class of total Boolean functions whose quantum communication complexity (regardless of prior entanglement) is at best polynomially smaller than their classical complexity. Our proof method is a novel combination of two ingredients. The first is a certain equivalence of approximation and orthogonality in Euclidean n-space, which follows by linear-programming duality. The second is a new construction of suitably structured matrices with low spectral norm, the pattern matrices, which we realize using matrix analysis and the Fourier transform over (Z2)n. The method of this paper has recently inspired important progress in multiparty communication complexity.
