In this paper, we investigate some issues related to the efficient provision of end-to-end delay guarantees in the context of the Guaranteed (G) Services framework [16]. First, we consider the impact of reshaping traffic within the network on the end-to-end delay, the end-to-end jitter, as well as per-hop buffer requirements. This leads us to examine a class of traffic disciplines that use reshaping at each hop, namely rate-controlled disciplines. In this case, it is known that it is advantageous to use the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling policy at the link scheduler [8]. For this service discipline, we determine the appropriate values of the parameters that have to be exported, as specified in [16]. Subsequently, with the help of an example, we illustrate how the G service traffic will typically underutilize the network, regardless of the scheduling policy used. We then define a Guaranteed Rate (GR) service, that is synergetic with the G service framework and makes use of this unutilized bandwidth to provide rate guarantees to flows. We outline some of the details of the GR service and explain how it can be supported in conjunction with the G service in an efficient manner.
