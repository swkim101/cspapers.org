In the past year, there has been significant interest in promoting the idea of applying scientific principles to information security. The main point made by information security professionals who brief at conferences seems to be that our field of information security is finally mature enough to begin making significant strides towards applying the scientific approach. Audiences everywhere enthusiastically agree and thrash themselves for bypassing science all along, bemoaning the fact that we could be "so much further along" if we only did science. Of course, after the presentation is over, everyone goes back to the methods that have been used throughout our generation to generate prototypes and tools with no regard for the scientific principles involved.
