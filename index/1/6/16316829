Using robots in introductory computer science classes has recently become a popular method of increasing student interest in computer science. This paper describes the development of a new curriculum for a CS 2 course, Imperative Problem Solving and Data Structures, based upon Scribbler 2 robots with standard C. The curriculum contains eight distinct modules with a primary topic theme, readings, labs, and project at the end. Each module resulted from collaboration among former CS 2 students and a faculty member, utilizing an iterative process with revisions. Each lab includes a survey to obtain student feedback that will allow the course to evolve and better fit the needs of future CS 2 students. All materials discussed here are available online for use by others.
