We propose a probabilistic-logical framework for group decision-making. Its main characteristic is that we derive group preferences from agents' beliefs and utilities rather than from their individual preferences as done in social choice approaches. This can be more appropriate when the individual preferences hide too much of the individuals' opinions that determined their preferences. We introduce three preference relations and investigate the relationships between the group preferences and individual and subgroup preferences.
