Contemporary DRAM systems have maintained impressive scaling by managing a careful balance between performance, power, and storage density. In achieving these goals, a significant sacrifice has been made in DRAM's operational complexity. To realize good performance, systems must properly manage the significant number of structural and timing restrictions of the DRAM devices. DRAM's use is further complicated in many-core systems where the memory interface is shared among multiple cores/threads competing for memory bandwidth.
