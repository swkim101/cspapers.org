We describe the functional requirements and design reasoning leading to a user-interface for an automated clinical neurophysiological monitoring system. The design provides a versatile, high-performance system in which computer-naive users have access to functions typically requiring dedicated training.
The system provides real-time data acquisition, signal processing, and graphical output, specifically tailored for the diagnosis and characterization of cases of epilepsy. The development of a user-interface was based on a collaborative effort, in which designers and users worked with a common functional model, and developed working metaphors for system operations. In addition, an interactive screen was designed to facilitate the management of multiple concurrent operations in an intuitive and easy to learn fashion.
