Most researches on internal mobile robot are going on based on the invasive clamping functions which generate the propulsion through a direct contact with organic tubes. This paper proposes a novel locomotion mechanism, which moves fundamentally based on a spiral profile and generates the additional force by transferring the rotational movement to the linear movement. The essence of proposed mobile microrobot is development of a rotation-linear movement interface mechanism and a non-invasive clamping function. This paper introduces the working principle and analyzes the behavior of mobile robot. Finally we validate the performance of robot as non-invasive locomotion mechanism by experiments.
