In this paper, two techniques have been presented for slippage detection. They are independent of sensor signal type and are promising for general use on tactile array sensors. The first method is based on frequency analysis of the correlation coefficient sequence of sensor array data sampled as time evolves. The main idea is that a slippage causes heavier fluctuation in the sensor signal distribution and values than a static case. The second approach employs 2-D cross correlation to detect displacements of the sliding object from tactile images, which makes it possible to estimate the slippage velocity using commercially available sensors rather than custom hardware. Experiments have been implemented to evaluate the proposed approaches. It can be seen that the first method is capable of detecting both translational and rotational slippage. Also, it works well in dynamic environments. Additionally, the ability of the second method to detect slippage velocity has been confirmed in the experiment.
