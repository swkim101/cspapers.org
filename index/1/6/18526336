The proliferation of a wide range of wireless devices operating in the crowded 2.4 GHz ISM band is becoming a major challenge for emerging low-power wireless networks in indoor applications. Recent studies show that Cross Technology Interference (CTI) can significantly reduce the overall delivery ratio of such networks. CTI subsequently decreases the network performance and drains their scarce resources of radio spectrum and energy. In this work, we present the design and preliminary evaluation results of an energy-efficient packet recovery mechanism that exploits (i) physical layer information available by 802.15.4-compliant radios and (ii) time diversity of wireless channel, to mitigate cross technology interference effects on low-power wireless networks.
