The clock networks of modern circuits must be able to operate in multiple corners and multiple modes (MCMM). Earlier studies on clock network synthesis for MCMM designs focus on the legalization of an initial clock network that has timing violations in different corners or modes. We propose a mode reconfigurable clock tree (MRCT) that is based on a correct-by-construction approach. An MRCT consists of multiple clock trees. Depending on the active mode, the MRCT is reconfigured such that one of the clock trees is activated to deliver the clock signal. To limit the overhead, the bottom part of the network (closer to the clock sinks) is shared among all of the clock trees, and only the top part of the network (closer to the clock source) is mode reconfigurable. The reconfiguration is realized using or-gates and a single one-input-multiple-output demultiplexer. The MRCT is constructed in a bottom-up fashion by iteratively merging subtrees to form larger subtrees. When two sub-trees cannot be merged because of mode-incompatible constraints, an or-gate is inserted to separate the incompatible modes. Corner-incompatible constraints are resolved by reducing safety margins of appropriate skew constraints. The experimental results show that for a set of synthesized MCMM circuits with 715 to 13, 216 sequential elements, the proposed approach can achieve high yield.
