An architecture for resource management in a computer system is presented. The architecture is a subset of an APL-like higher level language machine architecture. The approach provides for a natural division of function between software and microcode/hardware. Any object in the system can be managed as a resource, and the fact that an object is managed can be transparent to the program using the object. Finally the resource management concepts are related to the current resource management problems of effective third-party control of resources, intelligent work scheduling, and deadlock resolutions.
