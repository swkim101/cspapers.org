There are no known polynomial time algorithms for graph isomorphism. For certain classes of graphs, however, efficient algorithms have been found. In particular, there is a polynomial time algorithm for isomorphism of planar graphs [4,5].
 This paper presents a generalization of the third theorem to the projective plane, allowing a straightforward adaptation of the planar algorithm to the projective plane. Gary Miller has subsequently generalized my result to surfaces of arbitrary genus, so that there is now a graph isomorphism algorithm which is polynomial for any fixed genus.
