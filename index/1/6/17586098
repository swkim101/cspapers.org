We propose a novel grip-type master hand called MeisterGRIP that measures grip force in terms of a force vector distribution. This device is expected to allow intuitive robot manipulation using vision-based haptic-sensing technology. Furthermore, it can be used for general-purpose manipulation and is tolerant to individual differences in hand size and grasping posture. We constructed MeisterGRIP and evaluated the accuracy of the measured grip force. Furthermore, we constructed and exhibited a complete robot manipulation system using MeisterGRIP to demonstrate the possibility of using MeisterGRIP as a general-purpose master hand.
