This paper gives Needham-Schroeder style third-party-based authentication and key-distribution protocols that do not use conventional cryptosystems such as DES. The new protocols use polynomial interpolation and secure keyed one-way hash functions, and are efficient compared with protocols using conventional cryptosystems. The same techniques are generalized to develop protocols for secure broadcast and for secure communication.
