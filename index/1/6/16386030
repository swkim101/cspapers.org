A real-time obstacle avoidance algorithm is presented for autonomous mobile robots equipped with a CCD as its only sensing modality. The approach uses segmentation technique to segregate ground from other fixtures. It uses a simple computation for the threshold value. The processing speed of the algorithm is fast enough that it can avoid some active obstacles. The algorithm was tested in various lighting conditions in an indoor environment and is remarkably robust. Results of the different thresholding techniques are also presented in conjunction with our computation of the threshold value.
