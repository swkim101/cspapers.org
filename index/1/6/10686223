We study the performance of a simple one-bend packet routing algorithm on arrays with no buffering in the routing switches, under a stochastic model in which new packets are continuously generated at each node at random times and with random destinations. We prove that on the two dimension torus network our algorithm is stable for an arrival rate that is within a constant factor of the hardware bandwidth. Furthermore, we show that in the steady state the expected time a packet spends in the system is optimal (up to a constant factor). Sharper results (in terms of the constants) are obtained for the ring (dimension one torus).
