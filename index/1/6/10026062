We propose a cost-effective hot event detection system over Sina Weibo platform, currently the dominant microblogging service provider in China. The problem of finding a proper subset of microbloggers under resource constraints is formulated as a mixed-integer problem for which heuristic algorithms are developed to compute approximate solution. Preliminary results show that by tracking about 500 out of 1.6 million candidate microbloggers and processing 15,000 microposts daily, 62% of the hot events can be detected five hours on average earlier than they are published by Weibo.
