Due to several complementary technological advances related to computer systems, there has lately been an increased interest in the architecture of computers. This increased interest has forced changes in and additions to the computer science curriculum. In this paper, an academic program is described which has been found to be highly successful in terms of student interest and learning. The role of computer architecture in this program is explored, and conclusions are drawn regarding this role.
