This paper proposes a new model which describes the presentation and behaviour of user interfaces. The behaviour of the user interface is specified as an event flow graph consisting of components as its nodes and the paths through which events are sent as its edges. A meta-level function is introduced to describe user interfaces whose constituent components change through user interaction. The reusability of objects is augmented by representing their presentation and be-Raviour as a connected subgraph of the event flow graph. User interface development systems based on this model can create the user interface under a totally visual environment.
