The growth of public DNA sequence and metagenomic data over the last two decades has been exponential. Bioinformatics researchers are confronted with analysis of massive data sets, while the problem is still growing at an alarming rate in the near future. In this paper, we integrate many open source software tools in biological sequences analysis to construct an effective cloud-based microbial metagenomics analysis tool. The proposed method incorporates the Hadoop framework, with combination of data analysis and data storage, which makes the analysis tools more efficient to work with Big Data behind the ever growing metagenomic DNA sequences.
