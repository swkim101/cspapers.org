This paper provides an introduction to the major research directions in biodiversity informatics. The biodiversity enterprise is a vast and complex information domain. I describe the need to build infrastructure for this domain, major research thrusts needed to improve its work practices, and areas of research that could contribute to the advancement of the field. I emphasize that the science of biodiversity is fundamentally an information science, worthy of special attention from the computer and information science communities because of its distinctive attributes of scale and socio-technical complexity.
