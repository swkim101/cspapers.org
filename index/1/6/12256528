A computer program is described which was developed for LSI (large scale integrated) systems to resolve the uncertainties in transient delays prior to building the physical logic systems. This computer program represents a departure from the conventional logic simulation programs where unit delays are assumed for individual logic elements. The program takes into account all physical circuit variables at the mask composite stage in the design cycle. Transient delays are computed and inserted into the logic simulation program.
