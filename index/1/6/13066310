In this paper we describe the general structure of a computer aided system for Interactive Conceptual Design (INCOD) of Data Bases. First of all, motivations are given for a system as INCOD that allows the incremental definition of a conceptual schema of a Data Base according both to a top-down and a bottom-up strategy. Afterwards, the general features, functions and architecture of the system are described.
