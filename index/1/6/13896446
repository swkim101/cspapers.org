Perching allows Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) avoid the power costs and electrical and acoustic noise of sustained flight, for long-term surveillance and reconnaissance applications. This paper presents a dynamic model that clarifies the requirements for repeatable perching on walls and ceilings using an opposed-grip mechanism and dry adhesive technology. The model predicts success for perching over a range of initial conditions. The model also predicts the conditions under which other directional attachment technologies, such as microspines, will succeed. Experiments conducted using a launching mechanism for a range of different landing conditions confirm the predictions of the model and provide insight into future design improvements that are possible by modifying a few key damping and stiffness parameters.
