In this paper, we present the concept of grouping individuals and detecting their proximity by emitting/receiving inaudible tones using their mobile phones. The inspiration stems from uniforms metaphor (of different colors) that groups subjects based on the roles, occupations or teams. The goal is to get an insight into the social context and social interaction patterns.
