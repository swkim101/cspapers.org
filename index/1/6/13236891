This study aims to develop the fibrous optical actuator including the photochromic molecules, which isomerize in reversible by optical energy. This actuator is expected to be eco-friendly, lightweight, small-sized, flexible and noiseless. In this paper, we produce the prototype by diffusing /spl beta/-carotene in the crystal structure of nylon-6 filament. We investigate the feasibility of the proposed actuator to apply to robots and mechatronics experimentally.
