UML is a universal, standard modeling language. It can be applied to the modeling of any system with static framework and dynamic action. However, UML lacks precise semantics which might lead to problems, such as inconsistencies, redundancies and so on. In order to detect the UML behavior diagrams, a dynamic description logic and a sound and complete tableau-based satisfiability-checking decidable algorithm for UML are presented in this paper. This logic is a combination of a typical action theory and the description logic ALCQI, with the feature that actions are treated as citizens. Actions can be expressed in the construction of concepts and formulas. Reasoning tasks on concepts and actions can be realized with the help of the tableau-based satisfiability-checking decidable algorithm, which makes this logic more capable for the UML behavior diagrams.
