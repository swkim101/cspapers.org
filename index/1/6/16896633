The Stony Brook Robot Design Team has focused on two main areas of research in the creation of NavBot, our new robot created for the American Association of Artificial Intelligence's (AAAI) Scavenger Hunt Event: navigation and computer vision. The purpose is to create an intelligent machine that is able to navigate the conference floor for specific objects at the AAAI Conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
 
To achieve the desirable speeds required in a rescue robot, NavBot utilizes high-rpm servo motors with a manually adjustable gear train. The two 12V servo motors enhance the maneuverability of the robot by providing minor adjustments in the robot's speed as it navigates an area. The manually adjustable gear trains allow NavBot to function in different environments. This is achieved by controlling the force and the speed required for maneuverability in the terrain. NavBot also utilizes a dual-track motion system to handle rough terrain. To enhance the power of NavBot, it was designed with a light aluminum skeleton. In addition to the large space provided for necessary electrical and computer equipment, the skeleton serves as a secure casing that prevent, damage to vital parts.
