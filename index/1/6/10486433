CAMEX is an expert system designed to plan machining processes for CNC (Computerized Numerical Control) cutting machines. At the present state of development it is constrained to parts for which 2 1/2 D description is sufficient. For this kinds of parts, CAMEX is able to read a drawing of a workpiece from an ordinary CAD file, to understand its 3-dimensional structure and generate a plan for producing the workpiece. CAMEX is implemented in FRANZ LISP on an APOLLO workstation
