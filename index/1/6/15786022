We present an original approach to build rapidly and reliably a 3D description of the environment of a mobile robot by means of passive stereovision using three cameras. This technique has been successfully applied to many indoor scenes and has proved faster than a previously developed binocular stereo technique, while providing more reliable and more accurate results. Moreover, the algorithm is highly parallelisable and has indeed been parallelised, thus highly increasing its speed. Results showing the construction of the 3D visual map of a complex indoor scene are included.
