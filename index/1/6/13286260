A hierarchical logic design system based on frames and demons is proposed in this paper. Featuring a graphic editor which puts the design information into frames and a symbolic simulator which consists of demons (data-driven functions stored in frames), the system is flexible enough for a designer to easily add his own functions, such as monitoring functions of design constraints.
