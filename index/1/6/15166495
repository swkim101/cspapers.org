The full integration of information retrieval (IR) features into a database management system (DBMS) has long been recognized as both a significant goal and a challenging undertaking. By full integration we mean: i) support for document storage, indexing, retrieval, and update, ii) transaction semantics, thus all database operations on documents have the ACID properties of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability, iii) concurrent addition, update, and retrieval of documents, and iv) database query language extensions to provide ranking for document retrieval operations. It is also necessary for the integrated offering to exhibit scaleable performance for document indexing and retrieval processes, To identify the implementation requirements imposed by the desired level of integration, we layered a representative IR application on Oracle Rdb and then conducted a number of database load and document retrieval experiments. The results of these experiments suggest that infrastructural extensions are necessary to obtain both the desired level of IR integration and scaleable performance. With the insight gained from our initial experiments, we developed an approach, called cooperative indexing, that provides a framework to achieve both scalability and full integration of IR and RDBMS technology. Prototype implementations of system-level extensions to support cooperative indexing were evaluated with a modified version of Oracle Rdb. Our experimental findings validate the cooperative indexing scheme and suggest alternatives to further improve performance.
