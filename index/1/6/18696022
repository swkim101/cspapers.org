Advertising (ad) revenue plays a vital role in supporting free websites. When the revenue dips or increases sharply, ad system operators must find and fix the root-cause if actionable, for example, by optimizing infrastructure performance. Such revenue debugging is analogous to diagnosis and root-cause analysis in the systems literature but is more general. Failure of infrastructure elements is only one potential cause; a host of other dimensions (e.g., advertiser, device type) can be sources of potential causes. Further, the problem is complicated by derived measures such as costs-per-click that are also tracked along with revenue. 
 
Our paper takes the first systematic look at revenue debugging. Using the concepts of explanatory power, succinctness, and surprise, we propose a new multi-dimensional root-cause algorithm for fundamental and derived measures of ad systems to identify the dimension mostly likely to blame. Further, we implement the attribution algorithm and a visualization interface in a tool called the Adtributor to help troubleshooters quickly identify potential causes. Based on several case studies on a very large ad system and extensive evaluation, we show that the Adtributor has an accuracy of over 95% and helps cut down troubleshooting time by an order of magnitude.
