We consider motion planning in the presence of obstacles for redundant robotic systems subject to repetitive task constraints. For this open problem, we present a novel control-based randomized planner which produces cyclic, collision-free paths in configuration space and guarantees continuous satisfaction of the task constraints. In particular, the proposed algorithm relies on bidirectional search and loop closure in the task-constrained configuration space. Planning experiments on a simple 3R planar robot and the KUKA LWR-IV 7-dof manipulator are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
