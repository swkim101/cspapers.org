This paper proposes FRAGWRAP which maps scent to real objects in real-time. To achieve this purpose, we leverage fragrance-encapsulated soap bubble with projection mapping technique. Since human olfaction is known as combined utilization of his/her eyes and nose, we encapsulate fragrance into bubble soap to stimulate the nose and also project 3D image of the fragrance to the bubble soap in real-time. In this video, we present our first prototype which automatically inserts fragrance into a soap bubble and also projects images to the moving bubble. All system is activated by speech recognition.
