As part of our research into a general purpose data management system for musical information, a major focus has been the development of tools to support a data model for music. This paper first outlines the various types of information that fall under the purview of our proposed data manager. We consider extensions to the entity-relationship data model to implement the notion of hierarchical ordering, commonly found in musical data. We then present examples from our schema for representing musical notation in a database, taking advantage of these extensions.
