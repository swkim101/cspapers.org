We propose a conversion of bilingual sentence pairs and the corresponding word alignments into novel linear sequences. These are joint translation and reordering (JTR) uniquely defined sequences, combining interdepending lexical and alignment dependencies on the word level into a single framework. They are constructed in a simple manner while capturing multiple alignments and empty words. JTR sequences can be used to train a variety of models. We investigate the performances of ngram models with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing, feed-forward and recurrent neural network architectures when estimated on JTR sequences, and compare them to the operation sequence model (Durrani et al., 2013b). Evaluations on the IWSLT German!English, WMT German!English and BOLT Chinese!English tasks show that JTR models improve state-of-the-art phrasebased systems by up to 2.2 BLEU.
