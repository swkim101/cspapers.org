This paper describes a novel paradigm for representing many types of information about documents in a manner particularly suited to text categorization by a trivial empirical rule induction system. It also has potential application to full-text retrieval paradigms. The paradigm allows many different types of document predicates to be combined together with logical dependencies being controlled for. This is shown to be justified by any reasonable model of descriptor inference, and the effect of increasing representation sophistication is shown for two corpora.
