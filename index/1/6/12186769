If we're ever to get programs to reason intelligently about activities that are governed by laws, weâ€™ll need a clear understanding of such concepts as obligations, politics, disputes, and enforcement. Our work on this topic started when we tried to build a program that could understand some legal correspondence from l'i'th-century England, and its current application is in a program that simulates social interaction among small groups such as families and schools. While the long-range applications are in natural language processing, this work is primarily concerned with fundamental issues of representation.
