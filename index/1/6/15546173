This paper presents a robot capable of painting colorful pictures with a visual control system like human artists. It can use only five basic colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, white and black) to mix a variety of colors. After receiving a picture, the Robot Artist creates the artwork in two stages-the underpainting and the refinement. In the underpainting stage, it covers the canvas with a thin layer of acrylic paint, which can effectively set the basic tone of the painting. In the second stage, the robot uses the camera attached to its wrist to obtain the current artwork and refine it repeatedly. During the refinement, the methodology of non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) is also introduced to generate hand-painted strokes, which will be painted on the canvas to refine the artworks.
