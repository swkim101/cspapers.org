In this paper, we propose a novel anti-phase tremor compensation method using surface electromyography (SEMG) and accelerometer (ACC). The usefulness of the SEMG signal is that it precedes the generated joint movement by 20â€“100 ms (electromechanical delay, EMD). Hence by detecting the tremor in advance, there is enough time window to do the necessary computation and to actuate the antagonist muscle by Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). This is also possible because the time taken for FES to actuate the muscle is significantly less than that of the neural signal, as detected by SEMG. Specifically, what is proposed in this paper is algorithm to an estimate the EMD and to determine when to start/stop the FES such that anti-phase tremor cancellation. Experimental result from one Essential Tremor patient show 57% reduction in tremor power as measured by the ACC.
