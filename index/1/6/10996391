There is no generally accepted way to define wavelets on permutations. We address this issue by introducing the notion of coset based multiresolution analysis (CMRA) on the symmetric group, find the corresponding wavelet functions, and describe a fast wavelet transform for sparse signals. We discuss potential applications in ranking, sparse approximation, and multi-object tracking.
