In this paper, we present a novel multi-image motion deblurring method utilizing the coded exposure technique. The key idea of our work is to capture video frames with a set of complementary fluttering patterns to preserve spatial frequency details. We introduce an algorithm for generating a complementary set of binary sequences based on the modern communication theory and implement the coded exposure video system with an off-the-shelf machine vision camera. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on various challenging examples with quantitative and qualitative comparisons to other computational image capturing methods used for image deblurring.
