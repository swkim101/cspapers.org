In this paper, we describe T@gz, a system designed for effortless and instantaneous sharing of enterprise knowledge through routine email communications and powerful harvesting of such enterprise information using text analytics techniques. T@gz is a system that enables dynamic, non-intrusive and effortless sharing of information within an enterprise and automatically harvests knowledge from such daily interactions. It also allows enterprise knowledge workers to easily subscribe to new information. It enables self organization of information in conversations while it carefully avoids requiring users to substantially change their usual work-flow of exchanging emails. Incorporating this system in an enterprise improves productivity by: "discovery of connections between employees with converging interests and expertise, similar to social networks naturally leading to formation of interest groups, avoiding the problem of information lost in mountains of emails," creating expert profiles by mapping areas of expertise or interests to organizational map. Harvested information includes folksonomy appropriate to an organization, tagged and organized conversations and expertise map.
