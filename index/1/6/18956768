Twitter as an information dissemination tool has proved to be instrumental in generating user curated content in short spans of time. Tweeting usually occurs when reacting to events, speeches, about a service or product. This in some cases comes with its fair share of blame on varied aspects in reference to say an event. Our work in progress details how we plan to collect the informal texts, clean them and extract features for blame detection. We are interested in augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with self-developed association rules in getting the most out of the data for training and evaluation. We aim to test the performance of our approach using human-induced terror-related tweets corpus. It is possible tailoring the model to fit natural disaster scenarios.
