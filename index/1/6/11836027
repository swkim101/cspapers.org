Feature models are widely used in domain engineering to capture common and variant features among systems in a particular domain. However, the lack of a widely-adopted means of precisely representing and formally verifying feature models has hindered the development of this area. This paper presents an approach to modeling and verifying feature diagrams using Semantic Web ontologies.
