Theory resolution constitutes a set of complete procedures for building nonequational theories into a resolution theorem-proving program so that axioms of the theory need never be resolved upon. Total theory resolution uses a decision procedure that is capable of determining inconsistency of any set of clauses using predicates in the theory. Partial theory resolution employs a weaker decision procedure that can determine potential inconsistency of a pair of literals. Applications include the building in of both mathematical and special decision procedures, such as for the taxonomic information furnished by a knowledge representation system.
