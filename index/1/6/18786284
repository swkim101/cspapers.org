Various performance parameters are defined which characterize the quality of service offered by a layer of the OSI model. In particular the parameters for the Transport and Network are considered. The set of parameters are classified into:
 i) Connection related parameters; and ii) Access point related parameter;
 We further make an analysis of the relation between the parameters of the service provided by the Transport layer and the parameters of the Network service used by the Transport protocol, depending on the class of Transport protocol used. This is an example of a hierarchical approach to the evaluation of performance measures for the N-layer service in terms of performance measures of the (N-1)-layer service in conjunction with the performance measures of the N-layer protocol entity.
