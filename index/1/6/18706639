Color functionality for personal computers is currently limited and does not adequately address user needs. By introducing principles of color theory and design to interface tools we can provide users with innovative ways to manipulate color. This paper describes color tools based on a uniform perceptual color space that account for the relativity of color. Color interface ideas based on such user-oriented color models and approaches are suggested.
