We present applications in various domains of a system built around a syntax directed editor: the Mentor system.
 The main characteristics of the system are the abstract representation of data, programmability of the command language, and language independance.
 The applications presented belong to the area of program editing and manipulation, extensions of programming languages through the development of preprocessors, processing of multi-formalism documents and program portability.
