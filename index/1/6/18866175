We define a class of program schemata arising from the subrecursive programming language Loop. In this preliminary report on Loop schemata we show how to assign functional expressions to these schemata (as one aspect of the problem of assigning meaning to these programs), and we outline a solution to the schemata equivalence problem. Schemata equivalence is reduced to questions about formal expressions. Certain subcases of the problem are easily shown solvable, and although we claim that the general problem is solvable, we do not present the complete solution here because of its complexity.
