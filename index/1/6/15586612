We formulate multi-view 3D shape reconstruction as the computation of a minimum cut on the dual graph of a semi- regular, multi-resolution, tetrahedral mesh. Our method does not assume that the surface lies within a finite band around the visual hull or any other base surface. Instead, it uses photo-consistency to guide the adaptive subdivision of a coarse mesh of the bounding volume. This generates a multi-resolution volumetric mesh that is densely tesselated in the parts likely to contain the unknown surface. The graph-cut on the dual graph of this tetrahedral mesh produces a minimum cut corresponding to a triangulated surface that minimizes a global surface cost functional. Our method makes no assumptions about topology and can recover deep concavities when enough cameras observe them. Our formulation also allows silhouette constraints to be enforced during the graph-cut step to counter its inherent bias for producing minimal surfaces. Local shape refinement via surface deformation is used to recover details in the reconstructed surface. Reconstructions of the Multi- View Stereo Evaluation benchmark datasets and other real datasets show the effectiveness of our method.
