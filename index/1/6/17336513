We demonstrate the ReaSoN portal, consisting of interactive web-based tools for visualizing, exploring, querying, and integrating academic social networks. We describe how these networks are automatically extracted from bibliographic and citation databases, discuss notions of visibility in such networks which enable a rich set of social network analysis, and demonstrate our novel tools for the visualization and exploration of social networks.
