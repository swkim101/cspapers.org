Within the framework of constraint satisfaction problem, we propose a new scheme of cooperative parallel search. The cooperation is realized by exchanging nogoods (instantiations which can't be extended to a solution). We associate a process with each solver and we introduce a manager of no-goods, in order to regulate exchanges of nogoods. Each solver runs the algorithm Forward-Checking with Nogood Recording. We add to algorithm a phase of interpretation, which limits the size of the search tree according to the received nogoods. Solvers differ from each other in ordering variables and/or values by using different heuristics. The interest of our approach is shown experimentally. In particular, we obtain linear or superlinear speed-up for consistent problems, like for inconsistent ones, up to about ten solvers.
