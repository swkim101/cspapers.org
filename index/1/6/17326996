With the growing use of vector supercomputers, efficient and accurate data structure analyses are needed. What we propose in this paper is to use the quite general framework of Cousot's abstract interpretation for the particular analysis of multi-dimensional array indexes. While such indexes are integer tuples, a relational integer analysis is first required. This analysis results of a combination of existing ones that are interval and congruence based. Two orthogonal problems are directly concerned with the results of such an analysis, that are the parallelization/vectorization with the dependence analysis and the data locality problem used for array storage management. After introducing the analysis algorithm, this paper describes on a complete example how to use it in order to optimize array storage.
