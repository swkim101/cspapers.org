This paper describes a set of experimental 
results produced from the TIPSTER 
SUMMAC initiative on user directed 
summaries: document summaries generated in 
the context of an information need expressed 
as a query. The summarizer that was 
evaluated was based on a set of existing 
statistical techniques that had been applied 
successfully to the INQUERY retrieval system. 
The techniques proved to have a wider utility, 
however, as the summarizer was one of the 
better performing systems in the SUMMAC 
evaluation. The design of this summarizer is 
presented with a range of evaluations: both 
those provided by SUMMAC as well as a set of 
preliminary, more informal, evaluations that 
examined additional aspects of the summaries. 
Amongst other conclusions, the results reveal 
that users can judge the relevance of 
documents from their summary almost as 
accurately as if they had had access to the 
documentâ€™s full text.
