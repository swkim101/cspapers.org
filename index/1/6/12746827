This paper describes the design and implementation of PEST0 (Portable Explorer of Snuctured Objects), a user interface that supports browsing and querying of object databases. PEST0 allows users to navigate the relationships that exist among objects. In addition, users can formulate complex object queries through an integrated query paradigm (“query-in-place”) that presents querying as a natural extension of browsing. PEST0 is designed to be portable to any object database system that supports a high-level query language; in addition, PEST0 is extensible, providing hooks for specialized predicate formation and object display tools for new data types (e.g., images or text). uniformly and manipulated using an object-oriented dialect of SQL. One component of this project, which is joint work between IBM Almaden and the University of Wisconsin, is the development of a graphical user interface called PEST0 (Portable Explorer of STructured Objects). We refer to the PEST0 interface as a query/browser, as it marries navigational object browsing’ with declarative querying; it integrates browsing and querying via a “query-in-place” paradigm that provides a powerful yet natural user interface for exploring the contents of object databases.
