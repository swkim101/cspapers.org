In this chapter, we consider the problem of identifying an unknown parametrized family of chaotic dynamical systems from a variety of its time series data with a change in the bifurcation parameters. In an experimental situation, in which no a priori analytical knowledge of the dynamical systems is available, we present an algorithm for estimating the underlying bifurcation parameters of the chaotic time series. First, we construct a “qualitatively similar” parametrized family of nonlinear predictors from the sets of chaotic time series. These chaotic time series are then characterized in terms of the “qualitatively similar” bifurcation parameters of the nonlinear predictors. Numerical experiments using the Rössler equations show the efficiency of the algorithm.
