Formal education in computer architecture rests upon the integration of numerous specialized courses. One such course, a new laboratory concerning contemporary, register-transfer level digital design, is described. Design in the course proceeds at the level of interconnection of memories, arithmetic logic units, I/O interfaces, and buses, rather than at the individual gate level associated with traditional combinational and sequential logic design. The principle items of hardware used in the laboratory are DEC Register Transfer Modules, the DEC PDP/16M, and the INTEL SIM8-01 Microcomputer. Numerous software packages have been developed to support activities within the lab including an RTM simulator, a graphical simulation of an RTM control sequencer, a PDP/16M assembler, a microcode generator, and SIM8-01 utility routine, assembler, and simulator. During one fourteen-week term, students are expected to complete six assigned lab projects and one special project. Examples of projects are described. A critique based upon the students' reactions and the technician's experience with the equipment is given together with proposals for future additions to the course.
