Having a mechanism to validate the opinions and to identify experts in a forum could help people to favor one opinion against another. To achieve this, some solutions have already been introduced, including social network analysis techniques and reputation modeling. However, neither of these solutions considers the users' knowledge to identify an expert. In this paper, a novel method is proposed which estimates users' knowledge based on the forum itself, and identifies the possible areas of expertise associated with each user.
