In these models, variational inference approaches that exploit exact model symmetries are often forced to ground the entire problem, while methods that exploit approximate symmetries (such as by constructing an over-symmetric approximate model) offer no guarantees on solution quality. In this paper, we present a method based on a lifted variant of the generalized dual decomposition (GenDD) for marginal MAP inference which provides a principled way to exploit symmetric sub-structures in a graphical model. We develop a coarse-to-fine inference procedure that provides any-time upper bounds on the objective. The upper bound property of GenDD provides a principled way to guide the refinement process, providing good any-time performance and eventually arriving at the ground optimal solution.
