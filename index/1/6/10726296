This paper presents a software simulator for a central processing unit. The simulator features two modes of operation. In the first mode, students enter individual control signals for the multiplexers, function controls for the ALU, memory read/write controls, register addresses, and clock pulses for the registers required for a single CPU cycle via a graphical user interface. In the second mode, students write a control sequence in a text window for the cycles necessary to implement a single instruction set architecture (ISA) instruction. The simulator parses the sequence and allows students to single step through its execution showing the color-coded data flow through the CPU. The paper concludes with a description of the use of the software in the Computer Organization course and its availability for download on the Internet.
