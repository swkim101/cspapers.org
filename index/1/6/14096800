We seek to leverage knowledge about information organization in a domain to effectively and efficiently meet targeted information needs of expert users. The semantic components model represents document content in a manner that is complementary to full text and keyword indexing. Semantic component instances are segments of text about a particular aspect of the main topic of the document and may not correspond to structural elements in the document. This paper describes the semantic components model and presents experimental evidence from a large interactive searching study showing that semantic components, used to supplement full text and keyword indexing and to extend the query language, enhanced the retrieval of domain-specific documents in response to realistic queries posed by real users.
