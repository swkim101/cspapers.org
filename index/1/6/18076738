Applying graph clustering algorithms in real world networks needs to overcome two main challenges: the lack of prior knowledge and the scalability issue. This paper proposes a novel method based on the topological features of complex networks to optimize the clustering algorithms in real-world networks. More specifically, the features are used for parameter estimation and performance optimization. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world networks extracted from the web. Experimental results show improvement both in terms of Adjusted Rand index values as well as runtime efficiency.
