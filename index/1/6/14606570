We propose a novel reranking method to extend a deterministic neural dependency parser. Different to conventional k-best reranking, the proposed model integrates search and learning by utilizing a dynamic action revising process, using the reranking model to guide modiÔ¨Åcation for the base outputs and to rerank the candidates. The dynamic reranking model achieves an absolute 1.78% accuracy improvement over the deterministic baseline parser on PTB, which is the highest improvement by neural rerankers in the literature.
