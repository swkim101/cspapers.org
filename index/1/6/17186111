Simulation is an essential means for evaluating WSN applications. As many WSN applications embrace in-network data processing functionalities, more sophisticated simulation tools with data-enriched test case scenarios, such as extensive environment input and accurate hardware models, are necessary. This work devises TOSSIM DB, a data-enriched WSN simulation framework, allowing unmodified applications to be evaluated as if virtually deployed in a third-party environment. Notable features of TOSSIM DB include i) integrating third-party sensor datasets as virtual test scenarios, ii) emulating the statistical properties of sensor devices, and iii) seamless integration with the TinyOS tool-chain.
