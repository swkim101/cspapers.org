Over the last 15 years object-oriented (00) systems have become increasingly popular. Systems built on the object-oriented paradigm have powerful representational capabilities due to their inherent ability to represent conceptual entities as objects. This power of representation has been applied to the development of many types of applications; multimedia information processing systems, artificial intelligence systems, CAD/CAM systems, process control systems, and CASE systems are all familiar examples. In addition, database management systems and distributed object management systems have become popular in recent years, with many vendors offering products.
