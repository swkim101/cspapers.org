EPOS's operating system structure, firmware structure, functional distribution, and restructuring are described. EPOS processors are functionally specialized to user functions as well as operating system functions. The performance improvement by functional specialization is generally expected to be two-to-ten times. The objective of job scheduling is to maximize the total system performance by assigning each job to the best suited processor. For this purpose and for easy maintenance, jobs can be reassigned dynamically. Graceful degradation is also mentioned.
