Programming assignments in my discrete mathematics course have changed recently due to an influx of non-computer science students with little or no programming experience. Programming problems are now assigned in a simple to learn, easy to write, mathematical-like functional programming language that requires no previous programming experience. In theory, all students begin on the same basis. Exposure to the concepts of functional programming is an essential part of computer science and mathematics curricula. For most students this is the only exposure to functional programming. Functional programming and discrete mathematics are a natural combination. One week of lectures and perhaps a small monetary investment is all that is required. An instructor totally unfamiliar with functional programming can easily learn enough in a week or so to present a simple introduction to the topic. Introducing functional programming concepts in discrete mathematics was very successful. Students found the exposure to functional programming to be an insight they had never experienced before and enthusiastically recommended an introduction to functional programming be a permanent part of the course.
