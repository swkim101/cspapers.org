Current solutions for managing music in mobile contexts are inconvenient as they require considerable effort and visual attention. We describe a novel system for exploring music and generating playlists in mobile contexts, and present findings from our formative usability evaluations. The system provides audio-tactile feedback and is controlled by manipulating a device's orientation. The system plays songs associated with the current orientation. A spatial gesture or other command is then used to lock the orientation into a playlist. We evaluated two iterations of a prototype of the system and found that users were successful in exploring music and generating playlists with the system. We found that certain orientations are more common than others. Also, manipulating the prototype felt more natural while walking than sitting. Personalization of the music mapping was requested by users and seen as beneficial for usability.
