In this paper, a traction/braking force distribution algorithm for omni-directional all-wheel-independent-drive vehicles is proposed as a tool to enhance driving stability. In the proposed algorithm, the amount of the traction or braking force on each driving wheel can be determined so as to generate a desired tangential force, yaw moment and centripetal force independently. The algorithm considers omni-directional steering command and is capable of handling both traction and braking force commands. The algorithm is applicable on vehicles with at least three independent driving wheels. Simulations have been conducted to illustrate the use of the proposed force distribution method in enhancing vehicles stability.
