The problems associated with file design have recently received increased attention. One approach to their solution has been the development of file models. These models can be employed to study alternate file structures and aid the file design process. In this paper, a single model and cost function is developed to characterize most of the file structure alternatives and the selection of file structures for a design problem is automated. A file design system is developed that can be used by a file designer to select good file organizations from a large number of alternatives. The computer program which implements the model uses analytic optimization techniques to select file organizations. The output of the design system is a class of file structures specified by its average characteristics and the details of the actual file structure can be determined by simulation or other techniques.
