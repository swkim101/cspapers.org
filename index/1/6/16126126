The optical trap is a powerful non-contact approach for manipulating micron sized objects. Teleoperation of optical tweezers can be performed by coupling with a haptic interface, which allows an efficient robotic device to control positions and get force feedback. This provides users direct and intuitive microscopic interactions. The major difficulty in order for haptic devices to generate a reliable tactile sensation lies in its high frequency requirement of more than 1 kHz. This paper presents a fast force feedback teleoperation system for optical tweezers that attains this high frequency. The used force sensor is a novel event-based camera that transmits output as a continuous stream of asynchronous temporal events thus enabling high speed event-based visual processing. This new sensor is compared to a conventional frame based one to show advantages of our setup. A complex task of exploiting three dimensional target surface is performed demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of the presented method. This is the first time microspheres are used to touch targets of arbitrary form and color, which may interest broad-reaching biological and physical applications.
