We investigate the combination of several sources of information for the purpose of subjectivity recognition and polarity classification in meetings. We focus on features from two modalities, transcribed words and acoustics, and we compare the performance of three different textual representations: words, characters, and phonemes. Our experiments show that character-level features outperform wordlevel features for these tasks, and that a careful fusion of all features yields the best performance.1
