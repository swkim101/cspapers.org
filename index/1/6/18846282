The Rational Unified Process® (RUP®) is a software engineering process framework. It captures many of the best practices in modern software development in a form that is suitable for a wide range of projects and organizations. It embeds object-oriented techniques and uses the UML as the principal notation for the several models that are built during the development. The RUP is also an open process framework that allows software organizations to tailor the process to their specific need, and to capture their own specific process know-how in the form of process components. Many process components are now developed by various organizations to cover different domains, technologies, tools, or type of development, and these components can be assembled to rapidly compose a suitable process. This tutorial will introduce the basic concepts and principles, which lie under the RUP framework, and show concrete examples of its usage.
