In this demo, we design a monitoring system based on sensor network for zoologists to research the activity budget of Rhinopithecus roxellana. We designed the hardware platform of the system for wild deployment and presented an analysis of the relationship between environmental factors and survival conditions of Rhinopithecus roxellana. The system can locate and track Rhinopithecus roxellana by individual identification. The prototype has been deployed in Wildlife Reserve of Qiling Mountain, China.
