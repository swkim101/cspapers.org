The demanding performance objectives that real-time database systems (RTDBS) face necessitate the use of priority resource scheduling. This paper introduces a Priority Memory Management (PMM) algorithm that is designed to schedule queries in RTDBS. PMM attempts to minimize the number of missed deadlines by adapting both its multiprogramming level and its memory allocation strategy to the characteristics of the offered workload. A series of simulation experiments confirms that PMM's admission control and memory allocation mechanisms are very effective for real-time query scheduling.
