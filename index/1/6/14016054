The group Steiner problem is a classical network design problem where we are given a graph and a collection of groups of vertices, and want to build a min-cost subgraph that connects the root vertex to at least one vertex from each group. What if we wanted to build a subgraph that two-edge-connects the root to each group---that is, for every group g âŠ† V, the subgraph should contain two edge-disjoint paths from the root to some vertex in g? What if we wanted the two edge-disjoint paths to end up at distinct vertices in the group, so that the loss of a single member of the group would not destroy connectivity?
 In this paper, we investigate tree-embedding techniques that can be used to solve these and other 2-edge-connected network design problems. We illustrate the potential of these techniques by giving poly-logarithmic approximation algorithms for two-edge-connected versions of the group Steiner, connected facility location, buy-at-bulk, and the k-MST problems.
