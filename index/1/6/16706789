This paper presents a novel approach to deal with uncertainty in grasping. The basic idea is to initiate a caging manipulation state and then shrink fingers into immobilization to perform a practical grasping. Thanks to flexibility from caging, this procedure is intrinsically safe and gains tolerance towards uncertainty. Besides, we demonstrate that the minimum caging is immobilization and consequently propose using three or four fingers to manipulate planar convex objects in a grasping-by-caging way. Experimental results with physical simulation show the robustness and efficacy of our approach. We expect its leading benefits in saving finger number, conquering low-friction materials and especially, dealing with pose/shape uncertainty.
