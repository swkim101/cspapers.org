This paper proposes impedance control of redundant Drive joints with double actuation (RDJ-DA) to produce compliant motions with the future goal of higher bandwidth. First, to reduce joint inertia, a double-input-single-output mechanism with one internal degree of freedom (DOF) is presented as part of the basic structure of the RDJ-DA. Next, the basic structure of RDJ-DA is further explained and its dynamics and statics are derived. Then, the impedance control scheme of RDJ-DA to produce compliant motions is proposed and the validity of the proposed controller is investigated using numerical examples.
