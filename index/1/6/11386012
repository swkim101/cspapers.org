This paper describes features of a program development environment of particular use for student programmers. The environment contains tools for both textual and graphical program development. The textual tools include those now commonly found in interactive programming environments: interactive interpreter, language-based editor, debugger. The tools are provided for four languages in the “Pascal family:” Pascal, C, Modula-2 and Fortran. An important student-oriented feature of the environment is the capability for rapid switching between languages, allowing features in different languages to be compared side by side. The environment also provides a graphical program interface that students may use to test their programs interactively. The graphical interface is based on the notion of the control panel, through which students may interact with gauges and knobs to view and animate program data structures and output.
