We propose adaptive granularity to combine the best of fine-grained and coarse-grained memory accesses. We augment virtual memory to allow each page to specify its preferred granularity of access based on spatial locality and error-tolerance tradeoffs. We use sector caches and sub-ranked memory systems to implement adaptive granularity. We also show how to incorporate adaptive granularity into memory access scheduling. We evaluate our architecture with and without ECC using memory intensive benchmarks from the SPEC, Olden, PARSEC, SPLASH2, and HPCS benchmark suites and micro-benchmarks. The evaluation shows that performance is improved by 61% without ECC and 44% with ECC in memory-intensive applications, while the reduction in memory power consumption (29% without ECC and 14% with ECC) and traffic (78% without ECC and 66% with ECC) is significant.
