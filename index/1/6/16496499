This work presents a novel quantum security VoIP phone, called Qphone. Qphone integrates quantum key distribution (QKD) and VoIP steganography, and achieves peer-to-peer communication with information-theoretical security (ITS) guaranteeing. Qphone consists of three parts, a real-time QKD system, RT-QKD, a steganography software, VS-Phone, and an audio encryption and authentication hardware, AE-KEY. RT-QKD explores QKD technologies, and is able establish a shared key between two peers ensuring ITS. VS-Phone utilizes VoIP steganography to protect transmission channels of sensitive information. Qphone can provide efficient and real-time security protections to meet different security demands.
