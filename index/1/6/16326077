Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have been used to complement classroom instruction in recent years, and have been shown to facilitate learning. We incorporate an ITS named Intelligent Learning Materials Delivery Agent (ILMDA) into our CS1 course and collect evidence to validate two hypotheses: (1) The ITS improves student learning, (2) The ITS "learns" to tutor the students more efficiently and/or effectively. Our method of inquiry includes collecting data tracked while a student interacts with the ITS, post-test scores, and exam scores. We also use control and treatment groups, as well as different versions of the ILMDA in our experiments. Based on the results, we see indications that support the above two hypotheses.
