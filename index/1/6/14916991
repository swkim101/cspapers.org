The development of user inteijaces is often facilitated by the use of a drawing editor. The user interface specialist draws pictures of the different “states” of the inte~ace and passes these specifications on to the programmer. The user interface specialist might also use the drawing editor to demonstrate to the programmer the interactive behavior that the interface should exhibit; that is, he might demonstrate to the programmer the actions that an end-user can pe~orm, and the graphical manner by which the application should respond to the end-user’s stimuli. From the specljications, and the in-person demonstrations, the programmer implements a protoppe of the interface. DEMO is a User Interface Development System (UIDS) that eliminates the programmer from the above process. Using an enhanced drawing editor, the user interface specialist demonstrates the actions of the end-user and the system, just as he would if the programmer were watching. However no programmer is necessary: DEMO recorak these demonstrations, makes generalizations from them, and automatically generates a prototype of the inte~ace.
