A simplified version of the Hueckel operator was worked out to preserve all the advantages of the original one with a running time considerably shorter. Its concept is based on there interpretation of the Hueckel operator as a template matching method. This reinterpretation renders some theoretical and computational simplifications possible. As a result, an optimal edge-shaped template is constructed by linear combination of two suitably chosen original ones. The parameters of this optimal template characterize the edge segment found in a picture area.
