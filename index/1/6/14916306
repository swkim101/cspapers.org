Interactive computer aids for integrated circuit layout usually offer a choice between slow, high-precision plotters or fast, low-resolution interactive media. A system, called GRAFOS, has been designed, which attempts to overcome resolution limitations by the use of symbolic referencing. It employs a symbolic routing language through which both the electrical connectivity and the geometry of the circuit interconnections are specified. This paper presents the syntax and symbology of the GRAFOS language, together with examples illustrating its adaptability to a variety of routing styles, e.g. slant lines, custom layout, polycell routing. Also included is a brief description of the GRAFOS operating system.
