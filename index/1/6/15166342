A human can easily find his or her way in an unfamiliar building, by walking around and reading the floor-plan. We try to mimic and automate this human thinking process. More precisely, we introduce a new and useful task of locating an user in the floor-plan, by using only a camera and a floor-plan without any other prior information. We address the problem with a novel matching-localization algorithm that is inspired by human logic. We demonstrate through experiments that our method outperforms state-of-the-art floor-plan-based localization methods by a large margin, while also being highly efficient for real-time applications.
