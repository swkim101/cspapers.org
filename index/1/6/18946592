This poster focuses on the study of term context dependence in the application of sentence retrieval. Based on Markov Random Field (MRF), three forms of dependence among query terms are considered. Under different assumptions of term dependence relationship, three feature functions are defined, with the purpose to utilize association features between query terms in sentence to evaluate the relevance of sentence. Experimental results have proven the efficiency of the proposed retrieval models in improving the performance of sentence retrieval.
