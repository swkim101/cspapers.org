for 0 5 ir 5 iz 5 n and 0 5 jr 5 j2 5 m We introduce the shortest path in complete bipartite &graph (SPCB) problem: Given a weighted complete bipartite digraph G = (X, Y, E) with X = (20,. . , ,z,} and Y = {yc,. . . , ym}, find a shortest path from zc to x,, in G. For arbitrary weights, the problem needs at least st(nm) time to solve. We show if the weight matrices are concave, the problem can be solved in O(n + m log n) time. As applications, we discuss the traveling salesman problem for points on a convex polygon and the minimum latency tour problem for points on a straight line. The known algorithms for both problems require O(n2) time. Using our SPCB algorithm, we show they can be solved in O(n log n) time. These results solve two open questions posed by Marcotte and Suri [lo]; and by Afrati et. al. [l]. Concave matrices were first discussed in [12] and have been very successfully used in solving various problems (see [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 131 and the references cited within). In this paper, we show that if both A and B are concave, the SPCB problem can be solved in O(n + mlog n) time. (Even for this special case, no algorithm with o(nm) running time is previously known). In designing our algorithm, we extend the algorithms by Wilber for solving the least weight subsequence problem [ll] and the algorithm in [3] for solving the column minima searching problem in monotone matrices. The concavity of matrices plays a crucial role in our algorithm.
