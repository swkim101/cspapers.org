With the steady increase of videos published on media sharing platforms such as Dailymotion and YouTube, more and more efforts are spent to automatically annotate and organize these videos. In this paper, we propose a framework for classifying video items using both textual features such as named entities extracted from subtitles, and temporal features such as the duration of the media fragments where particular entities are spotted. We implement four automatic machine learning algorithms for multiclass classification problems, namely Logistic Regression (LG), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We study the temporal distribution patterns of named entities extracted from 805 Dailymotion videos. The results show that the best performance using the entity distribution is obtained with KNN (overall accuracy of 46.58%) while the best performance using the temporal distribution of named entities for each type is obtained with SVM (overall accuracy of 43.60%). We conclude that this approach is promising for automatically classifying online videos.
