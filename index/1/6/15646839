The processing of spatial joins can be greatly improved by the use of filters that reduce the need for examining the exact geometry of polygons in order to find the intersecting ones. Approximations of candidate pairs of polygons are examined using such filters. As a result, three possible sets of answers are identified: the positive one, composed of intersecting polygon pairs; the negative one, composed of non-intersecting polygon pairs; and the inconclusive one, composed of the remaining pairs of candidates. To identify all the intersecting pairs of polygons with inconclusive answers, it is necessary to have access to the representation of polygons so that an exact geometry test can take place. This article presents a polygon approximation for spatial join processing which we call four-colors raster signature ( 4CRS ). The performance of a filter using this approximation was evaluated with real world data sets. The results showed that our approach, when compared to other approaches presented in the related literature, reduced the inconclusive answers by a factor of more than two. As a result, the need for retrieving the representation of polygons and carrying out exact geometry tests is reduced by a factor of more than two, as well.
