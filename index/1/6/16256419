MRI compatibility, which often is a requirement for the new medical soft robot projects, greatly reduces available actuation methods and sensors. An example of such project is STIFF-FLOP, which aims to develop a soft silicone manipulator actuated by pressure. The current arm construction and method of actuation cause several undesirable effects, which pose problems for actuation and sensing. In this paper, the authors identify the source of those negative effects and propose improvements over the current construction to eliminate or limit their influence. The new construction concept is tested and compared with the current one. Possible ideas for further development are also proposed.
