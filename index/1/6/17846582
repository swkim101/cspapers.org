The paper presents transformations from UML 2.0 Sequence Diagrams to Time Petri nets with inhibitor arcs. The transformation is not restricted to messages calls and responses, but also to some of the new Sequence Diagrams operators. This model-to-model transformation is based on metamodels and is useful to improve semantics, as Petri nets can be executed by simulation and formally proved. The advantages of this multi-formalism approach are that different views are represented, complex systems development is done based on several levels of detail, and complexity is managed with abstraction and modularization.
