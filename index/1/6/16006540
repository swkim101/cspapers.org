By their very nature, memory based algorithms such as KNN or Parzen windows require a computationally expensive search of a large database of prototypes. In this paper we optimize the searching process for tangent distance (Simard, LeCun and Denker, 1993) to improve speed performance. The closest prototypes are found by recursively searching included subsets of the database using distances of increasing complexity. This is done by using a hierarchy of tangent distances (increasing the Humber of tangent. vectors from 0 to its maximum) and multiresolution (using wavelets). At each stage, a confidence level of the classification is computed. If the confidence is high enough, the computation of more complex distances is avoided. The resulting algorithm applied to character recognition is close to three orders of magnitude faster than computing the full tangent distance on every prototypes.
