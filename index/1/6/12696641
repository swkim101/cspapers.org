This paper presents an informal security model for the use of data base management systems supporting Naval surveillance applications. The paper discusses why conventional security models are inadequate for data base needs. Also, the Naval surveillance system environment is described, followed by a description of the model and its application to Naval surveillance systems. The model itself is made up of subjects (the users), objects (the data), operators, and policies. The paper concludes with a discussion of directions for model evolution and the observation that, although designed for a particular class of data base applications, the model is surprisingly general.
