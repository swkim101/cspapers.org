My dissertation proposes a vision in which anybody can modify any interface of any application. Realizing this vision is difficult because of the rigidity and fragmentation of current interfaces. Specifically, rigidity makes it difficult or impossible for a designer to modify or customize existing interfaces. Fragmentation results from the fact that people generally use many different applications built with a variety of toolkits. Each is implemented differently, so it is difficult to consistently add new functionality. As a result, researchers are often limited to demonstrating new ideas in small testbeds, and practitioners often find it difficult to adopt and deploy ideas from the literature. In my dissertation, I propose transcending the rigidity and fragmentation of modern interfaces by building upon their single largest commonality: that they ultimately consist of pixels painted to a display. Building from this universal representation, I propose pixel-based interpretation to enable modification of interfaces without their source code and independent of their underlying toolkit implementation.
