This practitioner report stems from a project, ANI's Digital Archive System. The report focuses on the benefits derived from a decision to ignore the popular wisdom of acquiring one of the many commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) systems and build a document management system in-house instead. The approach, building on the existing set of object-oriented systems, provided the benefits of more specific features and total lower cost.
