In hand-sketched drawings, nearly identical strokes may have different meanings to a user. For instance, a scribble could signify either that a shape should be filled in or that it should be deleted. This work describes a method for determining user intention in drawing scribbles in the context of a pen-based computer sketch. Our study shows that given two strokes, a circle and a scribble, two features (bounding ratio and density) can quickly and effectively determine a user's intention.
