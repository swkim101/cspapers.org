Many organizations have developed websites to support high school computer science (CS) teachers by providing them with collections of teaching resources. Yet rarely do these sites take into account the unique challenges of new CS teachers who often have not had formal training in CS. In response to a documented lack of teachers' engagement on these sites, we interviewed 17 CS teachers to learn more about the ways in which these sites are and are not meeting teachers' needs for curriculum resources. We discuss our findings about how teachers use, adapt, and share resources and then provide several suggestions for designing resource sharing sites that support teachers who have varying levels of experience teaching CS.
