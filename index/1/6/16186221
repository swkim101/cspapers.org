Current Intra-Cardia defibrillators make use of simple classification algorithms to determine patient conditions and subsequently to enable proper therapy. The simplicity is primarily due to the constraints on power dissipation and area available for implementation. Sub-threshold implementation of artificial neural networks offer potential classifiers with higher performance than commercially available defibrillators. In this paper we explore several classifier architectures and discuss micro-electronic implementation issues.
