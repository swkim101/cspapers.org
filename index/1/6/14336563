Studies have found that following Test-Driven Development (TDD) can improve code and testing quality. However, a preliminary investigation was consistent with concerns raised by other educators about programmers resisting TDD. In this paper, we describe an adaptive, pedagogical system for tracking and encouraging students' adherence to TDD. Along with an empirical evaluation of the system, we discuss challenges and opportunities for persuading student behavior through adaptive technology.
