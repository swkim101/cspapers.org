Most of wireless sensor network (WSN) research topics consider how to save the energy of the sensor node. However, in some WSN applications, such as in the monitoring of an earthquake or forest wildfire, transmitting emergency data packets to the sink node in time is much more important then saving power. In this letter, we propose a hybrid cluster-based (HC) WSN model. The HC WSN model provides a feasible cluster-based WSN architecture, which can save the energy of the sensor node when things are normal, but will transmit emergency data packets in an efficient manner to the sink node from the simulation analysis during an emergency.
