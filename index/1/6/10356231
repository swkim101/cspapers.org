A reversal on a permutation of (1,. . . , n} is a transformation that reverses the order of a block of two or more consecutive elements of the permutation. The problem of determining the smallest number of reversals required to transform a given permutation to the identity (or to sort the permutation by reversals) has been shown to be NP-hard. In this paper we present a polynomial-time 3/2-approximation algorithm for the problem. This an improvement over the previous best known polynomial-time algorithm, which had approximation ratio 714.
