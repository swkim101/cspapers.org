An autonomous robot requires a map of the environment for many tasks. Yet, in many cases, this map is unavailable and the robot must build one in real-time, in the so-called integrated exploration task. Several integrated exploration approaches adopt some sort of loop-closing strategy combined with an online simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technique. This is important because the robot can reduce the uncertainty about its pose by revisiting known areas. One solution for environment exploration is to use the vector field computed from the numeric solution of a Boundary Value Problem (BVP). This approach is called BVP Path Planner and generates smooth and free of local minima potential fields. However, this planner cannot actively close loops and does not scale well in large scenarios. In this paper we present a technique which performs active loop closure using the BVP Path Planner. Our proposal takes advantage of the potential of unexplored regions, and induces the robot to close loops by placing dynamic barriers at the visited space. The update of the potential field is boosted using a local window charged by a Voronoi diagram of the environment containing global information. We show through experimental results the effectiveness of the technique with a thorough discussion of its characteristics.
