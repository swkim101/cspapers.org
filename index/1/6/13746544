Often, we would like to subject the text generated by the RNNLM to constraints, in order to overcome systemic errors (e.g. word repetition) or achieve application-specific goals (e.g. more positive sentiment). In this paper, we present a method for training RNNLMs to simultaneously optimize likelihood and follow a given set of statistical constraints on text generation.  The problem is challenging because the statistical constraints are defined over aggregate model behavior, rather than model parameters, meaning that a straightforward parameter regularization approach is insufficient.  We solve this problem using a dynamic regularizer that updates as training proceeds, based on the generative behavior of the RNNLMs.  Our experiments show that the dynamic regularizer outperforms both generic training and a static regularization baseline.  The approach is successful at improving word-level repetition statistics by a factor of four in RNNLMs on a definition modeling task.  It also improves model perplexity when the statistical constraints are $n$-gram statistics taken from a large corpus.
