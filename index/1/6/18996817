We present a new, sizeable dataset of noun– noun compounds with their syntactic analysis (bracketing) and semantic relations. Derived from several established linguistic resources, such as the Penn Treebank, our dataset enables experimenting with new approaches towards a holistic analysis of noun–noun compounds, such as joint-learning of noun–noun compounds bracketing and interpretation, as well as integrating compound analysis with other tasks such as syntactic parsing.
