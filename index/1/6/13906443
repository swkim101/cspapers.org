Inductive reasoning is an important way to generate knowledge from the propositions reflecting facts or directly from data We intend to extract new knowledge in the form of definitions given as fixed point equations. An appropriate fixed point theory is outlined in favour of our aim. This theory suggests the so called generative fixed point equation system as the form of hypothesis that we are looking for. The defining formulas in these equations use only bounded quantifiers but the relation to be defined may also negatively occur. An inductive inference method is presented as to find the hypothetical equation system from the increasing set of experimentel data such that its solutions would fit all the information.
