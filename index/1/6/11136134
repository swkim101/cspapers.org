The existing scheme for result verification in a distributed grid system is replication. This scheme suffers from collusion and redundant execution of the jobs leading to high resource consumption. In order to combat these issues, a scheme called quizzing is proposed in the three-tier grid architecture. Some tasks of given jobs itself are given as quiz queries instead of separate set of quiz queries in order to avoid the differentiation of jobs from quiz queries at the Service Providerpsilas (SP) site. This leads to the better resource utilization compared to the simple quiz-based result verification scheme. The trustworthiness of SP is computed based on the quiz-based result verification scheme. In order to improve the resource utilization at the SPpsilas site further, an Optimized Heuristic scheduling scheme is proposed as grid service in this paper.
