Modern industrial robots are fast and have very good repetitional accuracy, which have made them indispensable in many manufacturing applications. However, they are usually programmed to follow desired trajectories and only get feedback from position sensors. This works fine as long as the environment is very well structured, but does not give good robustness to objects not being positioned or gripped accurately. A solution is to use additional sensing, such as force sensors and vision. How to combine the data from the different sensors and use it in a good way to control the robot is still an area of research. This paper describes an assembly scenario where a switch should be snapped into place in a box. Force sensing is used to resolve the uncertain position of the parts and detect the snap at the end of the operation. During the assembly an uncertain distance is estimated to improve the performance. By performing the assembly several times, learning is used to generate feed-forward data, which is used to speed up the assembly.
