We have investigated the properties of neurons in inferior temporal (IT) cortex in monkeys performing a pattern matching task. Simple back-propagation networks were trained to discriminate the various stimulus conditions on the basis of the measured neuronal signal. We also trained networks to predict the neuronal response waveforms from the spatial patterns of the stimuli. The results indicate that IT neurons convey temporally encoded information about both current and remembered patterns, as well as about their behavioral context.
