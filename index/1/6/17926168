We present, in this paper, an experiment in learning basic Information Systems (IS) concepts through practice in a self teaching environment. Students with no formal background in the area, engaged in a role playing game to produce a requirements document for a fictitious organisation, which was then implemented by students with a technical background. We used staff observations and student feedback, collected in different ways, to assess the experiment against the set goals. Students, who were very enthusiastic, learned about important aspects of IS analysis and design through their own group experience. Our own observations can also be used in a more general study of IS human factors.
