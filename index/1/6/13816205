Vehicles increasingly include features that rely on hi-tech sensors and recording; however, little is known of public attitudes toward such recording. We use two studies, an online survey (n=349) and an interview-based study (n=15), to examine perceptions of vehicle-based sensing and recording. We focus on: 1) how vehicle-based recording and sensing may differ from perceptions of current recording; 2) factors that impact comfort with vehicle-based recording for hypothetical drivers versus bystanders; and 3) perceptions of potential privacy-preserving techniques. We find that vehicle-based recording challenges current mental models of recording awareness. Comfort tends to depend on perceived benefits, which can vary by stakeholder type. Perceived privacy in spaces near cars can also impact comfort and reflect mental models of private spaces as well as the range of potentially sensitive activities people perform in and near cars. Privacy-preserving techniques may increase perceived comfort but may require addressing trust and usability issues.
