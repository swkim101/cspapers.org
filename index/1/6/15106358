We consider the problem of determining an unknown quantity x by asking “yes-no” questions, where some of the answers may be erroneous. In particular, we focus on a linearly bounded model of errors where for some known constant r, 0 < r < 1 2 , each initial sequence of i answers is guaranteed to have no more than ri errors. This model allows the errors to occur in a somewhat malicious way: for example, we must deal with a scenario where all errors occur in the last few answers. The problem is examined under the following variations: kinds of questions allowed (comparison or membership), nature of the domain of the searched quantity (bounded [x ∈ {1, . . . , n}, for some fixed n] or unbounded [x is any positive integer]). In the bounded domain, the only previous bound on the number of questions which works for the entire range 0 < r < 1 2 (with either comparison or membership questions) is O(n2 1 1−2r ). We improve this significantly by showing that O(log n) membership questions are enough. The upper bound on number of comparison questions needed is improved to O(n2 1 1−r ), which is o(n) even when r gets arbitrarily close to 12 . In the unbounded domain, where now n is the number being searched, we show that O(log n) membership questions or O([n log n]2 1 1−r ) comparison questions are enough. The problem is solved using the framework of chip games. Author was supported by DARPA Contract N00014-87-K-825 and National Science Foundation Grant CCR-8914428.
