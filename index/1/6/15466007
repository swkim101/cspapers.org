In this paper, we report on the development of a projection mapping system that can project RGB light patterns that are enhanced for three-dimensional (3-D) scenes using a GPU-based high-frame-rate (HFR) vision system synchronized with HFR projectors. Our system can acquire 512Ã—512 depth images in real time at 500 fps. The depth image processing is accelerated by installing a GPU board for parallel processing of a gray-code structured light method using infrared (IR) light patterns projected from an IR projector. Using the computed depth images, suitable RGB light patterns to be projected are generated in real time for enhanced application tasks. They are projected from an RGB projector as augmented information onto a 3-D scene with pixel-wise correspondence even when the 3-D scene is time-varied. Experimental results obtained from enhanced application tasks for time-varying 3-D scenes such as (1) depth-based color mapping and (2) augmented reality (AR) spirit level, confirm the efficacy of our system.
