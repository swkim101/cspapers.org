In this work, we present a flying saucer, a kind of unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV), lifted based on Coandă effect. Coandă effect is an interesting fluid dynamic phenomenon that the interaction between the flow and curved surfaces produce attraction, which results in the lifting of the object. The flying saucer adopting Coandă effect is easy to hover while keeping its posture stable, and vertical take-off and landing(VTOL) is possible. Its design procedures via optimization and manufacturing procedures are explained in details, and the preliminary tests in the indoor and outdoor are successfully demonstrated.
