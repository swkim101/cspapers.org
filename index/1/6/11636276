A language processor is to find out a most promising sentence hypothesis for a given word lattice obtained from acoustic signal recognition. In this paper a new language processor is proposed, in which unification grammar and Markov language model are integrated in a word lattice parsing algorithm based on an augmented chart, and the island-driven parsing concept is combined with various preference-first parsing strategies defined by different construction principles and decision rules. Test results show that significant improvements in both correct rate of recognition and computation speed can be achieved.
