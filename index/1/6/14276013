Multiprocessors * Akhilesh Kumar and Laxmi N. Bhuyan Department of Computer Science Texas A&M University College Station, TX 77843-3112, USA. E-mail: {akhil,bhuyan}( .lcs.t amu.edu In this paper, performance of wormhole routed 2-D torus network with virtual channels has been evaluated for cachecoherent shared-memory multiprocessors with execution-driven simulation. The traffic in such systems is very different from the traffic in message-passing environment. We show the imDact of number of virtual channels. flit buffers Der virtual-channel, and internal links. The study shows t~at 4 virtual channels per link is most efficient for 2-D torus networks. The number of flit buffers per virtual channel has a considerable impact and 2 to 4 flit buffers are usually enough. The number of internal links makes a difference on the performance for applications, such as MP3D, that generate large contention for shared variables.
