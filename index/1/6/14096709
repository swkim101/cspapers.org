In recent years, with the rapid development of satellite technology including On Board Processing (OBP) and Inter Satellite Link (ISL), satellite network devices such as space IP routers have been experimentally carried in space. However, there are many difficulties to build a future satellite network with current terrestrial Internet technologies due to the distinguished space features, such as the severely limited resources, remote hardware/software upgrade in space. In this paper, we propose OpenSAN, a novel architecture of software-defined satellite network. By decoupling the data plane and control plane, OpenSAN provides satellite network with high efficiency, fine-grained control, as well as flexibility to support future advanced network technology. Moreover, we also discuss some practical challenges in the deployment of OpenSAN.
