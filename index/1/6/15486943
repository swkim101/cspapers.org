The modeling and control of a vectoring tricopter UAV are developed in this article. The UAV is actuated by three thrust motors, each guided by suitable actuators, thus forming a platform able to independently track any desired attitude and trajectory. The derivation of the equations of motion is followed by the development of a vectoring controller that is supplemented by an allocation strategy. Both are based on geometric feedback linearization techniques, resulting in a singularity-free control law, taking into account the inertia effects of the main body, of the motors, and of the vectoring dynamics (actuators). A stability proof is developed validating the effectiveness of the control strategy under bounded disturbances. Simulations showcase the developed controller and tricopter performance.
