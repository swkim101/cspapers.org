LandScan (LANguage Driven SCene ANalysis) is presented as an integrated vision system which covers most levels of both vision and natural language processing. Computations are both data-driven and query-driven. In the report we focus on the design of the vision and control modules. Future work will investigate in more detail the design of the natural language interface. The data-driven system employs active control of stereo cameras for image acquisition, and dynamically constructs a surface model from multiple aerial views of an urban scene. The query-driven system allows the user's natural language queries to focus analysis to pertinent regions of the scene. This is different than many image understanding systems which present a symbolic description of the entire scene regardless of what portions of that picture are actually of interest.
