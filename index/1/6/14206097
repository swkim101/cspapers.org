We have constructed two research resources of Japanese lexical simplification. One is a simplification system that supports reading comprehension of a wide range of readers, including children and language learners. The other is a dataset for evaluation that enables open discussions with other systems. Both the system and the dataset are made available providing the first such resources for the Japanese language.
