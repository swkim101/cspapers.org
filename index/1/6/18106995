Cycorp has developed a knowledge acquisition system, based on Cyc, that can engage a user in a natural-language mixed-initiative dialogue. In order to achieve a intelligent dialogue with the user, it employs explicit topicand user-modeling, a system of prioritized interactions, and a transparent agenda to which either the user or the system can add interactions at any time. Interactions initiated by the Cyc system are directed at closing system-perceived knowledge gaps, at optimizing the inferential utility of existing and added knowledge, and at generally facilitating the userâ€™s knowledge-entry task. This is done both deductively, in response to explicit knowledgeelicitation rules, and inductively, from the existing content of the Cyc Knowledge Base.
