Gait analysis provides insightful information about people condition, progress of rehabilitation treatments and fall risk. This analysis is frequently performed in very specific conditions, because it often implies the use of treadmills, cameras and/or wearable sensors. Alternatively, gait can be analyzed using a smart rollator, equipped with a basic set of sensors. This work proposes a methodology to obtain relevant gait parameters using a simple, cheap source of information: wheel odometry and handlebar force sensors. The main advantages of this approach are that users are not bothered with extra equipment. Besides, monitoring can be performed anywhere, even during everyday conditions and for extended periods of time. We have tested our system with a set of rehabilitation patients with different disabilities. Preliminary results have successfully proven that extracted parameters are coherent with reported effects of their specific condition.
