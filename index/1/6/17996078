This paper describes the VITE system, a visual workspace that supports two-way mapping for projecting structured information to a two-dimensional workspace and updating the structured information based on user interactions in the workspace. This is related to information visualization, but reflecting visual edits in the structured data requires a two-way mapping from data to visualization and from visualization to data. VITE provides users with an interface for designing two-way mappings. Mappings are reusable on different datasets and may be switched within a task. An evaluation of VITE was conducted to study how people use two-way mapping and how two-way mapping can help in problem solving tasks. The results show that users could quickly design visual mappings to help their problem-solving tasks. Users developed more sophisticated strategies for visual problem-solving over time.
