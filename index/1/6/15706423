In tfus paper a new approach to Iockrng multwerslon objects and classes is proposed, called the stamp locking approach. The main notion of this approach is a stamp lock defined as an extension of a classical lock m such a way that It contains the mfonnatlon about the pesition of locked nodes m the mhentance and the version derivation hrerarch]es. The main advantage of ttns method is simple Iockmg strategy following from the lack of intentional locks concerning these hrerarchles. In most cases, setting one stamp lock only, panting to the nodes or to the subtree roots M snfftclent to lock a hrerarchy nodes or subtrees. To determme stamp lock compatibility, it is sufficient to compare lock modes and appropriate pointers. Advantages of dre stamp Iockurg method become parhcrrlarly beneflc]al m the case of a database contammg many classes and many vers]ons of obJects. Tins M a typ]cal case of design and software engmeemg databases where classes, being the artifacts of the des]gn process, have usually many superclasses and objects are avadable m many versions.
