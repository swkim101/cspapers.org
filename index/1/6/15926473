In this paper, we propose an optimal decomposition approach to large-scale multi-view stereo from an initial sparse reconstruction. The success of the approach depends on the introduction of surface-segmentation-based camera clustering rather than sparse-point-based camera clustering, which suffers from the problems of non-uniform reconstruction coverage ratio and high redundancy. In details, we introduce three criteria for camera clustering and surface segmentation for reconstruction, and then we formulate these criteria into an energy minimization problem under constraints. To solve this problem, we propose a joint optimization in a hierarchical framework to obtain the final surface segments and corresponding optimal camera clusters. On each level of the hierarchical framework, the camera clustering problem is formulated as a parameter estimation problem of a probability model solved by a General Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the surface segmentation problem is formulated as a Markov Random Field model based on the probability estimated by the previous camera clustering process. The experiments on several Internet datasets and aerial photo datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach method generates more uniform and complete dense reconstruction with less redundancy, resulting in more efficient multi-view stereo algorithm.
