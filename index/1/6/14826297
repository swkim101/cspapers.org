Monitoring the location of customer equipment is an important problem in the direct broadcasting sateMte indw try. This is because the service providers wotdd We to pr~ vent unauthorized movement of a customer’s set top terminal (STT) from a home to a pubtic venue, or acro~ an international border, due to tious kancid, copyright and po~ticd issues. h this paper we study four schemw for detecting the movement of the an STT using the ~ting (or emerging) communication tiastructttre. We start with the currently used scheme which is based on the telephone network’s ~ or Cm (cdlw-~) featurw, and show how it can be undermined. Then we suggest three new schem= which are more robust than the cder ~ scheme one that that uses the Globrd Positioning System (GPS), one that uses the cefldar phone’s enhanced 911 (E911) service, and one that measur~ the tim~Werenceof-arriti of the sateMte’s broadcast. We ~ the accuracy, featur~ and vtdnerabtities of ed scheme. We *O present possible attacks that Mow pirates to coned their movement when these schemw are employed. due to pirated decoders. Therefore the management of the decryption keys is central to the d=ign of such systems (see [MQ95]). An important aspect of key management is how the keys for the n% b~g period are dodoaded into the customer’s STT. Modern DBS systems typicWy use a “callback” (or %eturn path”) scheme for this purpose Once every b~ig period, the STT makw a phone cdl to the service provider, authenticate itse~, and dodoads the new keys.
