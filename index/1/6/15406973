The use of cameras is becoming more prevalent by the day owing to the variety of applications they have. However, each application requires a specific placement of the cameras for best performance. Therefore, determining this placement has been a problem of much work in the field of computer vision. However, most of the current approaches deal with a scene that does not change once the cameras have been placed. In this paper a system is developed and successfully tested that can not only distribute cameras around a scene such that the observability is improved, but can reorganize the cameras if the pattern of activity within a scene changes with time. The cameras can be distributed in either two or three dimensional space, and this was tested with the use of mobile robotic cameras and stationary cameras.
