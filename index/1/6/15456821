In this paper I present a novel Machine Learning approach to the acquisition of stochastic string transductions based on Pair Hidden Markov Models (PHMMs), a model used in computational biology. I show how these models can be used to learn morphological processes in a variety of languages, including English, German and Arabic. Previous techniques for learning morphology have been restricted to languages with essentially concatenative morphology.
