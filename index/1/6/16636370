Hiero translation models have two limitations compared to phrase-based models: 1) Limited hypothesis space; 2) No lexicalized reordering model. We propose an extension of Hiero called PhrasalHiero to address Hieroâ€™s second problem. Phrasal-Hiero still has the same hypothesis space as the original Hiero but incorporates a phrase-based distance cost feature and lexicalized reodering features into the chart decoder. The work consists of two parts: 1) for each Hiero translation derivation, find its corresponding discontinuous phrase-based path. 2) Extend the chart decoder to incorporate features from the phrase-based path. We achieve significant improvement over both Hiero and phrase-based baselines for ArabicEnglish, Chinese-English and GermanEnglish translation.
