Indoor object localization can enable many ubicomp applications, such as asset tracking and object-related activity recognition. Most location and tracking systems rely on either battery-powered devices which create cost and maintenance issues or cameras which have accuracy and privacy issues. This paper introduces a system that is able to detect the 3D position and motion of a battery-free RFID tag embedded with an ultrasound detector and an accelerometer. Combining tags' acceleration with location improves the system's power management and supports activity recognition. We characterize the system's localization performance in open space as well as implement it in a smart wet lab application. The system is used to track real-time location and motion of the tags in the wet lab as well as recognize pouring actions performed on the objects to which the tag is attached. The median localization accuracy is 7.6cm -- (3.1, 5, 1.9)cm for each (x, y, z) axis -- with max update rates of 15 Sample/s using single RFID reader antenna.
