Recently the FCC opened three 10 MHz bands for unlicensed use. In order to operate in UPCS bands, devices must comply with rules known as the UPCS etiquette (United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 15(d)). In this paper we study channel sharing between two or more collocated systems under the asynchronous UPCS etiquette. In particular we show that under heavy load individual systems have a tendency to hold the channel for hundreds of milliseconds, thus blocking all traffic in other, competing systems. We have calculated the distribution of the blocking time for two versions (or interpretations) of the UPCS etiquette. The impact of the average blocking time on delay sensitive traffic is discussed and possible improvements achieved through a tradeoff between system capacity and average blocking time are investigated.
