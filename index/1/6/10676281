In the past, on-site cooperative education has been the primary means of providing practical experience for computer science students. On-campus cooperative education is proposed as a viable alternative. This paper describes on-campus cooperative education as practiced at BYU. Advantages and disadvantages for the sponsoring company, university, students, faculty, and company personnel involved are also presented. The last part of the paper describes several guidelines which, if followed, should improve the educational experience.
