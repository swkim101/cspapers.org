This paper describes the concept of and a system for configuration control for evolutional software products, in which a wide spectrum of varied software products are being continuously evolved, along with rapid advancements in hardware technologies. The system contains a database for dealing with the overall configuration structure, including hierarchical product structure with change status, master file directories, difficulty occurrences and user information. The data representing the configuration can be in more abstract or macroscopic level than the traditional software configuration control, since the configuration manager should control the overall outlines for all software products. The concept and system described in the paper have been used for intelligent terminal software product management in NEC's Data Terminals Division.
