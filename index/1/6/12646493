This report discusses experiences applying AspectJ [1] to modularize crosscutting concerns in a middleware product line at IBMÂ®. Aspect oriented programming techniques were used to cleanly separate platform specific facilities for aspects such as error handling, performance monitoring and logging from base components, permitting those components to be reused in multiple environments. The initiative also guided the design of the AspectJ Development Tools (AJDT) for Eclipse, and influenced the technical direction of the AspectJ implementation.
