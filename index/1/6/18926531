Until now, all the approaches are theoretical and no implementation has been proposed. In this paper we present the first reasoner that takes as input RCC-5 or RCC-8 networks with variables and constants and decides their consistency. We investigate the performance of the reasoner experimentally using real-world networks and show that we can achieve significantly better times by geometry simplification and parallelization.
