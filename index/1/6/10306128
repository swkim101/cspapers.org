Automatically recognizing human activities in a body sensor network (BSN) enables many human-centric applications. Many current works recognize human activities through collecting and analyzing sensor readings from on-body sensor nodes. These sensing-based solutions face a dilemma. On one hand, to guarantee data availability and recognition accuracy, sensing-based solutions have to either utilize a high transmission power or involve a packet retransmission mechanism. On the other hand, enhancing the transmission power increases a sensor node's energy overheads and communication range. The enlarged communication range in consequence increases privacy risks. A packet retransmission mechanism complicates on-body sensor nodes' MAC layer and hence increases energy overheads. In contrast to the sensing-based solutions, we build Radio Sense, a prototype system that exploits wireless communication patterns for BSN activity recognition. Using Radio Sense, we benchmark three system parameters (transmission (TX) power, packet sending rate, and smoothing window size) to design algorithms for system parameter selection. The algorithms aim to balance accuracy, latency, and energy overheads. In addition, we investigate the minimal amount of training data needed for reliable performance. We evaluate our Radio Sense system with multiple subjects' data collected over a two-week period and demonstrate that Radio Sense achieves reliable performance in terms of accuracy, latency, and battery lifetime.
