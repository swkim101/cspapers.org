The human and the agent may share certain goals, but are essentially self-interested. This paper extends selection processes to settings in which the actions available to the human are ordered and thus the user may be influenced by the advice even though he doesn't necessarily follow it exactly. In this work we also consider the case in which the user obtains some observation on the sate of the world. We propose several approaches to model human decision making in such settings. We incorporate these models into two optimization techniques for the agent advice provision strategy. In the first one the agent used a social utility approach which considered the benefits and costs for both agent and person when making suggestions. In the second approach we simplified the human model in order to allow modeling and solving the agent strategy as an MDP. In an empirical evaluation involving human users on AMT, we showed that the social utility approach significantly outperformed the MDP approach.
