We propose XQGen, a stand-alone, algebra-based XPath generator to aid engineers in testing and improving the design of XML query engines. XQGen takes an XML schema sketch and user configurations, such as number of queries, query types, duplication factors, and branching factors as input, and generates a set of queries that comform to the schema and configurations. In addition, given a set of label-paths as workload input, XQGen is capable of generating query sets that honor the workload.
