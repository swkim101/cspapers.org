We present the design of a reliable nurse call system based on wireless embedded devices and multi-hop protocols. Our work is motivated by the need for such system during annual summer camps for people with muscular dystrophy and the lack of suitable alternative solutions. We describe how our prototype meets the reliability and real-time requirements of such system, and report on results from a two-week deployment during a camp with 13 affected boys in July 2013.
