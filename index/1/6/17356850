Object-oriented class frameworks are promising alternatives to traditional languages and their parallelizing compilers due to their higher at&action facilities for encapsulating parallelism and distribution. We claim that language feature6 already available in cxisiting object-oriented languages such aa C* for constructing class t&reworks can be maximally exploited for achieving 6cp6ration of parallelism and data distribution, without language extaxsions or ad-hoc methodologies. We first model parallel computation a6 crtiered application of a function onto 6tructurcd elements. and, ba6cd on the model, we construct a class fmmcwcrk which formulates 1) data distribution 66 hierarchical decomposition of the 6tructured elements to layered objects and 2) parallelism as nested rruversuls across these objects. We evaluate the feasibiity of our proposal on the Pujitsu APlOtXl parallel computer by extending the EPEE class framework.
