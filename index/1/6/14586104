This paper describes an attempt to generate Japanese sentences from conceptual representation. This generator infers the temporal order of events included in the conceptual representation using causal chains and MOPs. Appropriate conjunctives between the events and case markers for subjects are used based on the representation. This generator was first built as part of the Machine Translation Project in the Computer Science Department of Yale University in 1982. It has been subsequently improved at ETL in Japan. About 15 stories are parsed into conceptual representations from Spanish newspaper stories(Lytinen and Schank, 1982) and then Japanese sentences are generated.
