The Spy is a performance evaluation tool for the Mesa environment that uses a new extention to the PC sampling technique. The data collection process can use information in the run time call stack to determine what code is responsible for the resources being consumed. The Spy avoids perturbing the user environment when it executes, provides symbolic output at the source-language level, and can be used without recompiling the program to be examined. Depending upon how much complication the user asks for during data collection, the Spy steals between .3% and 1.8% of the cycles of a fast machine, and between 1.08% and 35.9% of the cycles on a slow machine.
