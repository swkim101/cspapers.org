ABSTRACT Re ommender systems apply statisti al and knowledge disovery te hniques to the problem of making produ t re ommendations during a live ustomer intera tion and they are a hieving widespread su ess in E-Commer e nowadays. In this paper, we investigate several te hniques for analyzing large-s ale pur hase and preferen e data for the purpose of produ ing useful re ommendations to ustomers. In parti ular, we apply a olle tion of algorithms su h as traditional data mining, nearest-neighbor ollaborative ltering, and dimensionality redu tion on two di erent data sets. The rst data set was derived from the web-pur hasing transa tion of a large Eommer e ompany whereas the se ond data set was olle ted from MovieLens movie re ommendation site. For the experimental purpose, we divide the re ommendation generation pro ess into three sub pro esses{ representation of input data, neighborhood formation, and re ommendation generation. We devise di erent te hniques for di erent sub pro esses and apply their ombinations on our data sets to ompare for re ommendation quality and performan e.
