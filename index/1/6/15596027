Precise positioning of an automobile to within lane-level precision can enable better navigation and context-awareness. However, GPS by itself cannot provide such precision in obstructed urban environments. In this paper, we present a system called CARLOC for lane-level positioning of automobiles. CARLOC uses three key ideas in concert to improve positioning accuracy: it uses digital maps to match the vehicle to known road segments; it uses vehicular sensors to obtain odometry and bearing information; and it uses crowd-sourced location of estimates of roadway landmarks that can be detected by sensors available in modern vehicles. CARLOC unifies these ideas in a probabilistic position estimation framework, widely used in robotics, called the sequential Monte Carlo method. Through extensive experiments on a real vehicle, we show that CARLOC achieves sub-meter positioning accuracy in an obstructed urban setting, an order-of-magnitude improvement over a high-end GPS device.
