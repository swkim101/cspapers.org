The growing use of Object-Oriented Databases (OODBs) has necessitated the inclusion of OODBs in introductory database courses. Typically, such an analysis is conducted after the explication of the dominant industry standard: the Relational Database model (RDB). Like the RDB model, the OODB model can be easily motivated. Unlike the RDB model, an established data model with defined normal forms, the OODB model cannot be easily evaluated for "goodness". We address this deficiency by examining the criteria of coupling and cohesion in database design. This approach affords the instructor the ability to better present OODBs as well as the opportunity to re-emphasize critical software engineering concepts.
