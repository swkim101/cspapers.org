We present disputant relation-based method for classifying news articles on contentious issues. We observe that the disputants of a contention are an important feature for understanding the discourse. It performs unsupervised classification on news articles based on disputant relations, and helps readers intuitively view the articles through the opponent-based frame. The readers can attain balanced understanding on the contention, free from a specific biased view. We applied a modified version of HITS algorithm and an SVM classifier trained with pseudo-relevant data for article analysis.
