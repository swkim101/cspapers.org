INTRODUCTION While the general area of parallel processing and speeific topics are included in the ACM currieuhun guidelines, parallel processing is still a relatively new, but important, part of computer scienee education. Several approaches are possible including a distinct track within the major, a single course in parallel algorithms or the introduction of individual topics in a variety of cxwrses. Some universities have well established programs while others are in a developmental phase. The field is changing rapidly enough that schools with established programs need to monitor their curriculum.
