Proximity-aware scoring functions lead to significant effectiveness improvements for text retrieval. For XML IR, we can sometimes enhance the retrieval quality by exploiting knowledge about the document structure combined with established text IR methods. This paper introduces modified proximity scores that take the document structure into account and demonstrates the effect for the INEX benchmark.
