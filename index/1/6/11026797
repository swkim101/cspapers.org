This paper presents a method of topological localization in a home environment using only low-cost sonar sensors. The proposed method utilizes a relative motion model to obtain a prior information of node probability. Moreover, the size of a local gridmap used for gridmap matching is determined adaptively by an entropy test of node probability. The proposed method results in a reliable and convergent localization result even under the uncertainty and sparsity of sonar sensros. Experimental results verify performance of the proposed topological localization in a real home environment.
