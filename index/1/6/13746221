In this work we propose a new image watermarking approach using data modulation. This technique consists at first step in getting the first color in case of RGB image which is a two dimensional matrix. Then the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is applied to that matrix and the Watermark signal is inserted into the DCT values. This Watermark signal is obtained after amplitude modulation of the original speech signal. After inserting the watermark signal, the inverse of DCT is applied in order to produce the watermarked asset. The extraction process is performed by subtracting the original DCT coefficients from the watermarked image ones. After extracting the modulated signal, it is demodulated in order to recover the original signal.
