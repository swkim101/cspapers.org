A discipline is described for generating, by nonlinear programming, finished designs of large structural systems involving large sets of nonlinear, nonconvex, discontinuous constraints. The set of techniques which are used to extend the cutting-plane method to handle this situation have to do with manipulating the large expressions with a symbolic manipulation language (PL/I-FORMAC), smoothing the deleterious effects of discontinuities and local optima on convergence, and forcing convergence to a set of commercially available values for the structural components. A comparison is made between a design accomplished by human effort and a design generated by the described methods for the same geometric and loading situation.
