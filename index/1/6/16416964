User performance as well as system related considerations should be part of the DBMS selection process. However, appropriate procedures and measures for determining user performance characteristics of a DBMS are lacking. This paper describes a methodology and proposes a set of measures for determining the user performance level of the data model and data language of a DBMS. The methodology was applied to three DBMS's having different data models and data languages and the results of its application are discussed.
