Numerous widely publicized cases of theft and misuse of private information underscore the need for audit technology to identify the sources of unauthorized disclosure. We present an auditing methodology that ranks potential disclosure sources according to their proximity to the leaked records. Given a sensitive table that contains the disclosed data, our methodology prioritizes by relevance the past queries to the database that could have potentially been used to produce the sensitive table. We provide three conceptually different measures of proximity between the sensitive table and a query result. One measure is inspired by information retrieval in text processing, another is based on statistical record linkage, and the third computes the derivation probability of the sensitive table in a tree-based generative model. We also analyze the characteristics of the three measures and the corresponding ranking algorithms.
