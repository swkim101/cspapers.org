We present a technique to automatically synthesize a multithreaded in-order pipeline from a high-level unpipelined datapath specification. This work extends the previously proposed transactional specification (T-spec) and synthesis technology (T-piper). The technique not only works with instruction processors but also flexible enough to accept any sequential datapath. It maintains previously proposed non-threaded pipeline features and is enhanced with multithreading features. We report a design space exploration study of 32 multithreaded x86 processor pipelines, all synthesized from a single T-spec.
