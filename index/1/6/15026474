Information spread in in databases cannot be found by current search engines. A database search engine is capable to access and advertise database on the WWW. Jungle is a database search engine prototype developed at Aalborg University. Operating through JDBC connections to remote databases, Jungle extracts and indexes database data and meta-data, building a data store of database information. This information is used to evaluate and optimize queries in the AQUA query language. AQUA is a natural and intuitive database query language that helps users to search for information without knowing how that information is structured. This paper gives an overview of AQUA and describes the implementation of Jungle.
