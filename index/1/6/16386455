Social news websites have gained significant popularity in the last few years. The participants of such websites are not only allowed to share news links but also to annotate, to evaluate and to comment them. To quantify interestingness and attractiveness of the user generated content in respect to the original link source we introduce the User Generated Content add-on (UGC+) index. Based on the definition of UGC+ we also propose a concept for comparing groups of links filtered by different properties, e.g. authorship or topic-categories. We apply the proposed measure on the Spanish Digg-clone Men√©ame.
