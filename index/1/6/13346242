This study describes a novel, pure vision-based, method of obtaining the 3DOF attitude of an aircraft through the use of panoramic images of the sky. An iterative optimisation algorithm is applied to estimate the rotation of the aircraft in 3DOF by minimising the sum of absolute differences between two video frames of the sky. This method is unaffected by cumulative integration error, as all estimations are computed with respect to an initial reference image. Furthermore, the adverse effects resulting from movement of objects in the sky or changes in light intensity are ameliorated through the use of an adaptive reference image. Overall, the results illustrate the potential of this system to produce attitude estimates with an accuracy rivalling and in some cases surpassing those of two alternative vision-based methods, and an industry standard IMU.
