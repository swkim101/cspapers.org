Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has seen substantial development in recent decades. In MIS, particularly in laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) surgery, the surgical site is always crowded. One potential solution is the magnetic anchored and guidance system (MAGS), which liberates instruments from constraint of the accessing port. Current MAGS are all made by rigid components, which relies on articulated joints to maneuver inside the surgical cavity. Moreover, fabricating and assembling the MAGS are difficult due to the small size of the components. In this work, we present the design, modeling, fabrication and testing of a novel soft MAGS endoscope system. The system includes the external controller and the internal unit, which contains a soft body, two magnets and a replaceable wireless camera. It is compact, safe, lightweight and easy to make. Experimental results show that the system could offer stable maneuvering both in lab settings and in porcine model.
