A mini-slot, appended to the data slot in the distributed scheduling multiple access (DSMA) protocol described in [1], for the transmission of acknowledgement packets is described and analyzed. The resulting DSMA with fixed slot acknowledgement (DSMA/FSA) presents a better alternative to sending a separate acknowledgement packet for each received data packet. With priority requests, DSMA/FSA appears to be a viable media access protocol for integrated voice and data services in a local area network.
