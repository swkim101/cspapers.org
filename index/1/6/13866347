This paper examines the efficiency of various strategies for searching in an unknown environment. The model is that of the simple random walk, which can be taken as a representation of a function with a bounded derivative that is difficult to compute. Let X1, X2+,. be independent and identically distributed with Prob(Xj = 1) = Prob(Xj = -1) = 1/2, and let Sk=X1+X2 + + Xk. Thus Sk is the position of a symmetric random walk on the line after k steps. The number of the Sk that have to be examined to determine their maximum Mn = max{S0, Sn} is ˜n/2 as n→ ∞, but that is a worst case result. Any algorithm that determines Mn with certainty must examine at least (c0 + o(l))n1/2 of the Sk on average for a certain constant co > 0, if all random walks with n steps are considered equally likely. There is also an algorithm that on average examines only (co + o(l))n1/2 of the Sk to determine Mn. Different results are obtained when one allows a nonzero probability of error, or else asks only for an estimate of Mn. It is also shown that a global search (one that can ask for any value Sk at any time) for the exact maximum is faster by a factor of log n (when comparing average running times) than a linear sequential one that can skip through some values but cannot go back. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
