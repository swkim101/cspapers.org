In this paper, we present a method for inferring social roles of agents (persons) from their daily activities in long surveillance video sequences. We define activities as interactions between an agent's position and semantic hotspots within the scene. Given a surveillance video, our method first tracks the locations of agents then automatically discovers semantic hotspots in the scene. By enumerating spatial/temporal locations between an agent's feet and hotspots in a scene, we define a set of atomic actions, which in turn compose sub-events and events. The numbers and types of events performed by an agent are assumed to be driven by his/her social role. With the grammar model induced by composition rules, an adapted Earley parser algorithm is used to parse the trajectories into events, sub-events and atomic actions. With probabilistic output of events, the roles of agents can be predicted under the Bayesian inference framework. Experiments are carried out on a challenging 8.5 hours video from a surveillance camera in the lobby of a research lab. The video contains 7 different social roles including “manager”, “researcher”, “developer”, “engineer”, “staff”, “visitor” and “mailman”. Results show that our proposed method can predict the role of each agent with high precision.
