Relevance Feedback has proven very effective for improving retrieval accuracy. A difficult yet important problem in all relevance feedback methods is how to optimally balance the original query and feedback information. In the current feedback methods, the balance parameter is usually set to a fixed value across all the queries and collections. However, due to the difference in queries and feedback documents, this balance parameter should be optimized for each query and each set of feedback documents. In this paper, we present a learning approach to adaptively predict the optimal balance coefficient for each query and each collection. We propose three heuristics to characterize the balance between query and feedback information. Taking these three heuristics as a road map, we explore a number of features and combine them using a regression approach to predict the balance coefficient. Our experiments show that the proposed adaptive relevance feedback is more robust and effective than the regular fixed-coefficient feedback.
