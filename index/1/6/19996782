In this paper, a pair of very simple ground stubs is used to design a single band-notched characteristic in a compact planar-monopole antenna for ultrawide band (UWB) applications. The single-band notch covers the wireless area network (WLAN) band from 5.15 GHz to 5.825 GHz. The center-notch frequency and notch bandwidth can be adjusted using the dimensions of the ground stubs. Prototype of the proposed antenna is designed and fabricated. The band-notched characteristics, return loss, radiation patterns, peak gains and efficiencies of the antenna are studied using both computer simulation and measurements.
