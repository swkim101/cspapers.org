In the multi-agent based semantic web service composition, each of the agent capability is used to serve a particular service request. In this paper, two variations of semantic web service composition process have been presented. The variations are based on the concept that the negotiation between the service requester and the service providers has been performed before the selection of final service provider or after the final service provider has been selected. Further, based upon one of the model, a novel multi-agent based semantic web service composition approach has been presented.
