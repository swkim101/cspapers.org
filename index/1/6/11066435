Recently, online social networks are becoming increasingly popular platforms for social interactions. Understanding how information propagates in such networks is important for personalization and recommendation in social search. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Community-level Information Diffusion (HCID) model to capture the information diffusion process in social networks. We introduce the notion of users' topic popularity as to enable our model to depict the information diffusion process which is both topic-aware (which topic the information is concerned with) and source-aware (where the information comes from). Instead of assuming homogeneity of social communities, we propose the notion of community hierarchy, where information diffusion across inter-level communities is uni-directional from the higher levels to the lower ones. We design a Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer model parameters and propose prediction methods for two information diffusion prediction tasks, the retweet prediction and the cascade prediction. Comparison experiments are conducted on two real datasets. Results show that our model achieves substantial improvement compared with the existing work.
