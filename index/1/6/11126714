Many classification algorithms require that the training data contain only discrete attributes. To use such an algorithm when there are numeric attributes, all numeric values must first be converted into discrete values--a process called discretization. This paper describes ChiMerge, a general, robust algorithm that uses the Ï‡2 statistic to discretize (quantize) numeric attributes.
