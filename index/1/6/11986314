A metasearch engine is a system, which is connected to different search engines. In response to a user query, it invokes suitable search engines for the query, merges the information returned by these search engines and output the merged result. There are two types of metasearch engines: one type for unstructured data (mostly text) and the other for structured data. In comparison to a text search engine, a metasearch engine can have a higher coverage of the Web and can have more timely information. A metasearch engine for structured data facilitates comparison shopping and services and is convenient to use. In this talk, we discuss the problems and their potential solutions. In addition, challenges and unsolved problems are sketched.
