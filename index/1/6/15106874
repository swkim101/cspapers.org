High speed, low latency obstacle avoidance is essential for enabling Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) to function in cluttered and dynamic environments. While other systems exist that do high-level mapping and 3D path planning for obstacle avoidance, most of these systems require high-powered CPUs on-board or off-board control from a ground station. We present a novel entirely on-board approach, leveraging a light-weight low power stereo vision system on FPGA. Our approach runs at a frame rate of 60 frames a second on VGA-sized images and minimizes latency between image acquisition and performing reactive maneuvers, allowing MAVs to fly more safely and robustly in complex environments. We also suggest our system as a light-weight safety layer for systems undertaking more complex tasks, like mapping the environment. Finally, we show our algorithm implemented on a lightweight, very computationally constrained platform, and demonstrate obstacle avoidance in a variety of environments.
