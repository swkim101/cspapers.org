Selective attention can enable a vision system to perform eeectively. The high-level vision component developed here uses Bayesian networks combined with a deictic representation to (1) create a dynamic structure to reeect the spatial organisation of the data and (2) measure task relatedness. Together these give at-tentional focus making the reasoning relevant to the task.
