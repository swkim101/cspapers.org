In large data warehousing environments, it is often advantageous to provide fast, approximate answers to complex decision support queries using precomputed summary statistics, such as samples. Decision support queries routinely segment the data into groups and then aggregate the information in each group (group-by queries). Depending on the data, there can be a wide disparity between the number of data items in each group. As a result, approximate answers based on uniform random samples of the data can result in poor accuracy for groups with very few data items, since such groups will be represented in the sample by very few (often zero) tuples.
In this paper, we propose a general class of techniques for obtaining fast, highly-accurate answers for group-by queries. These techniques rely on precomputed non-uniform (biased) samples of the data. In particular, we propose congressional samples, a hybrid union of uniform and biased samples. Given a fixed amount of space, congressional samples seek to maximize the accuracy for all possible group-by queries on a set of columns. We present a one pass algorithm for constructing a congressional sample and use this technique to also incrementally maintain the sample up-to-date without accessing the base relation. We also evaluate query rewriting strategies for providing approximate answers from congressional samples. Finally, we conduct an extensive set of experiments on the TPC-D database, which demonstrates the efficacy of the techniques proposed.
