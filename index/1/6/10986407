We present a jaw, face, or head movement (face-related movement) recognition system called CanalSense. It recognizes face-related movements using barometers embedded in earphones. We find that face-related movements change air pressure inside the ear canals, which shows characteristic changes depending on the type and degree of the movement. We also find that such characteristic changes can be used to recognize face-related movements. We conduct an experiment to measure the accuracy of recognition. As a result, random forest shows per-user recognition accuracies of 87.6% for eleven face-related movements and 87.5% for four OpenMouth levels.
