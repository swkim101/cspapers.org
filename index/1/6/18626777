We present the design of simple, centimeter-scale modular actuation units (“Active Cells”) and passive compliant nodes that are electromechanically networked to create macroscopically deformable Modular Active Cell-based Structures (MACROs). Each Active Cell is a single degree-of-freedom linear actuator (a “muscle unit”), consisting of fiberglass end-pieces connecting two strands of Nitinol shape-memory alloy and a passive biasing spring. The Nitinol strands are coiled into a tight spring to increase deformations when activated through resistive heating. In-depth examination of the optimization of Nitinol coils with an antagonistic spring is presented, resulting in large repeatable axial cell strains of up to 25%. The design of these cellular muscle units to obtain maximal repeatable stroke is presented, allowing for the construction of larger networks of cells (MACRO modules, akin to a biological “tissue”) that can be customized to a target application. Finally, experimental demonstration of the construction and actuation of some simple MACRO modules is described.
