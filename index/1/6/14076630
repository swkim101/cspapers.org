This paper describes the design and implementation of a new, simplified, entry-level RoboCup league and its integration into an introductory robotics and artificial intelligence curriculum. This E-League allows teams to focus on individual aspects such as hardware platform development or multi agent coordination, because the league provides modular solutions for several components and lets teams concentrate on chosen area(s) instead of requiring that all teams solve all aspects of a coordinated RoboCup team.
