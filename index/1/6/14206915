Most theoretical and empirical studies of population codes make the assumption that underlying neuronal activities is a unique and unambiguous value of an encoded quantity. However, population activities can contain additional information about such things as multiple values of or uncertainty about the quantity. We have previously suggested a method to recover extra information by treating the activities of the population of cells as coding for a complete distribution over the coded quantity rather than just a single value. We now show how this approach bears on psychophysical and neurophysiological studies of population codes for motion direction in tasks involving transparent motion stimuli. We show that, unlike standard approaches, it is able to recover multiple motions from population responses, and also that its output is consistent with both correct and erroneous human performance on psychophysical tasks.
