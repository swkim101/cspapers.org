T3D edge detection from a depth image is an important technique of 3D object recognition in preprocessing. There are three types of 3D edges in a depth image called jump, convex roof, and concave roof edges. Conventional 3D edge detection based on ring operators has been proposed. The conventional ring operator can detect three types of 3D edges by classifying the response of Fourier transforms. Since the conventional method needs to apply Fourier transforms to all pixels of a depth image, real-time processing cannot be done due to high computational cost. Therefore, this paper presents a fast and reliable method of detecting three types of 3D edges by using a decision tree. The decision tree is trained under supervised learning from numerous synthesized depth images and labels by capturing depth relations between candidate pixels and pixels on a ring operator to classify 3D edges. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method has 25 times faster than the conventional method. This paper also presents some examples of 3D line and 3D convex corner detection based on results obtained with the proposed method.
