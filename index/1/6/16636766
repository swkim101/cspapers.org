Resources for research are not always easy to explore, and rarely come with strong support for identifying, linking and selecting those that can be of interest to scholars. In this work we introduce a model that uses state-of-the-art semantic technologies to interlink structured research data and data from Web collaboration tools, social media and Linked Open Data. We use this model to build a platform that connects scholars, using their profiles as a starting point to explore novel and relevant content for their research. Scholars can easily adapt to evolving trends by synchronizing new social media accounts or collaboration tools and integrate then with new datasets. We evaluate our approach by a scenario of personalized exploration of research repositories where we analyze real world scholar profiles and compare them to a reference profile.
