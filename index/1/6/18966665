With the advent of specialized VLSI and WSI hardware components the finite difference algorithms for solving differential equations become more attractive. This paper presents a novel computer architecture dedicated to compute boundary value problems. Improvement in speed and reliability can be obtained by means of WSI technology; however, a fault/defect tolerant scheme must be designed. Here we present a time redundancy approach which uses all the available computational resources; this is there is no spare or idle processors.
This special purpose WSI parallel architecture runs as a loosely coupled MIMD (multi-instruction multi-data streams) machine and may execute more than 100 million instructions per second. The main features of this boundary value engine (BVE) are: 1) local communication -connections are limited to nearest neighbor; 2) cell regularity -all processors, memories and buses are identical; and 3) fault-tolerance -faulty modules are discarded by means of a novel time redundancy approach. As the feature size continues to shrink, the architecture can easily be extended to accommodate more computational cells.
