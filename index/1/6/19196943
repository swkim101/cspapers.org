Existing methods model this learning as a mapping process by first encoding the input sequence to a fixed-sized vector, followed by decoding the target sequence from the vector. Although simple and intuitive, such mapping model is task-specific, unable to be directly used for different tasks. In this paper, we propose a star-like framework for general and flexible sequence-to-sequence learning, where different types of media contents (the peripheral nodes) could be encoded to and decoded from a shared latent representation (SLR) (the central node). This is inspired by the fact that human brain could learn and express an abstract concept in different ways. The media-invariant property of SLR could be seen as a high-level regularization on the intermediate vector, enforcing it to not only capture the latent representation intra each individual media like the auto-encoders, but also their transitions like the mapping models. Moreover, the SLR model is content-specific, which means it only needs to be trained once for a dataset, while used for different tasks. We show how to train a SLR model via dropout and use it for different sequence-to-sequence tasks. Our SLR model is validated on the Youtube2Text and MSR-VTT datasets, achieving superior performance on video-to-sentence task, and the first sentence-to-video results.
