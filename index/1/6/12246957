Physically-based simulation software is commonly used for developing and testing low-level robot control algorithms. In order to facilitate the development and evaluation of higher-level robot behaviors, broader-based simulations are needed. Examples include software for simulating 3D vision, motion planning for obstacle avoidance, and integrating vision and planning. In addition to modeling the general interaction between the robot and its environment, the software can be used as a graphical user interface for directly controlling or interacting with a robot operating in the real world. This paper describes our current efforts toward building a large-scale software simulation framework for the development and testing of high-level behaviors for humanoid robots. We view this as a potential useful tool for the visualization and development of robotic systems, as well as an interactive, task-level programming interface for robots.
