While a remote computing solution such as VNC is an effective technology for PC users to access a remote computer, it is not as effective while being used from smartphones. In this paper, we propose techniques to improve remote computing from smartphones that help deliver near-PC level experience to users. We introduce a key building block called smart-macros that have the robustness of application macros but at the same time possess the generality of raw macros. Using smart-macros we design and prototype SmartVNC, a remote computing solution for smartphones. We show using experimental studies and a trace based analysis of real user activity, that SmartVNC can improve user experience considerably.
