The standard approach to modeling uncertainty is probability theory. In recent years, researchers, motivated by varying concerns including a dissatisfaction with some of the axioms of probability and a desire to represent information more qualitatively, have introduced a number of generalizations and alternatives to probability, including Dempster-Shafer belief functions [Shafer, 1976], possibility measures [Dubois and Prade, 1990], lexicographic probability [Blume et al., 1991], and many others. Rather than investigating each of these approaches piecemeal, I consider here an approach to representing uncertainty that generalizes them all, and lets us understand their commonalities and differences. A plausibility measure [Friedman and Halpern, 1995] associates with a set a plausibility, which is just an element in a partially ordered space. The only real requirement is that if is a subset of , then the plausibility of is less than equal to the plausibility of . Probability measures are clearly plausibility measures; every other representation of uncertainty that I am aware of can also be viewed as a plausibility measure. Given how little structure plausibility measures have, it is perhaps not surprising that plausibility measures generalize so many other notions. This very lack of structure turns out to be a significant advantage. By adding structure on an “as needed” basis, it is possible to characterize what is required to ensure that a plausibility measure has certain properties of interest. This both gives insight into the essential features of the properties in question and makes it possible to prove general results that apply to many representations of uncertainty. In this paper, I discuss three examples of this phenomenon.
