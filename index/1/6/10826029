Gateways in very high speed internets will need to have low processing requirements and rapid responses to congestion. This has prompted a study of the performance of the Random Drop algorithm for congestion recovery. It was measured in experiments involving local and long distance traffic using multiple gateways. For the most part, Random Drop did not improve the congestion recovery behavior of the gateways A surprising result was that its performance was worse in a topology with a single gateway bottleneck than in those with multiple bottlenecks. The experiments also showed that local traffic is affected by events at distant gateways.
