Context representations are a key element in distributional models of word meaning. In contrast to typical representations based on neighboring words, a recently proposed approach suggests to represent a context of a target word by a substitute vector, comprising the potential fillers for the target word slot in that context. In this work we first propose a variant of substitute vectors, which we find particularly suitable for measuring context similarity. Then, we propose a novel model for representing word meaning in context based on this context representation. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art results on lexical substitution tasks in an unsupervised setting.
