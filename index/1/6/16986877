The paper presents two approaches to interactively refining user search formulations and their evaluation in the new High Accuracy Retrieval from Documents (HARD) track of TREC-12. One method consists of asking the user to select a number of sentences that may represent relevant documents, and then using the documents, whose sentences were selected for query expansion. The second method consists of showing to the user a list of noun phrases, extracted from the initial document set, and then expanding the query with the terms from the phrases selected by the user.
