A data graph is obtained from a data structure by masking out the specific data items at the nodes of the structure and concentrating only on the linkages in the structure. Structural uniformities in data graphs can often be exploited to facilitate and systematize the accessing of nodes in the graph and the implementation of the graph in a computer. This paper presents a model for data graphs which can be used to study such uniformities. The main results reported characterize, in terms of structural uniformities, those classes of data graphs which can be implemented by “relative addressing” and by “relocatable relative addressing”.
