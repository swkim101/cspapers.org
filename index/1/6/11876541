Qooqle is a mobile-based system that frees people from the confines of search boxes by integrating digital information directly into their everyday activities. By allowing casual expressions through speech and gesture with mobile phones, Qooqle's multi-modal user interface enables people to engage with one another while accessing the information world more naturally. Through the analysis of social media data, Qooqle retrieves relevant information to the users based upon the physical world context they are situated in. Combining mobile, cloud computing, and social media, Qooqle draws people closer to computing and makes computers less visible. The Qooqle system uses Speech Recognition and Gesture Recognition to achieve its natural user interface. It uses Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and other Data Mining techniques to search through people's speech and gestures in the physical world as well as their online social media data for relevant information retrieval.
