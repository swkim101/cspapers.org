This paper deals with the design, fabrication and characterization of a new micro-tools changer for a micromanipulation station including three translation stages (X-Y-Z manipulator) and a new piezoelectric microgripper. This system can be implemented in confined workspaces such as a scanning electron microscope (SEM) or more generally in a micro-factory station by the reduction of the manipulator's size and the flexibility gain. The principle of this micro-tools changer is based on the use of a thermal glue whose state (liquid or solid) is controlled by surface mounted device (SMD) electrical resistances. Such system allows hundreds of automatic micro-tools exchanges with a maximum position error between two consecutive tools exchanges of respectively 4.2, 2.8 and 5.4 /spl mu/m on the X, Y and Z axis. To validate the use of the micromanipulation station in a SEM, an experimental comparison of the working principle in low (vacuum) and high (air) pressure has also been established through thermal and degassing studies.
