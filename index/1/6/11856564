Although the Web has abundant information, it does not necessarily contain the latest, most recently updated information. In particular, interactive map websites and the accompanying street view applications often contain information that is a few years old and are somewhat outdated because street views can change quickly. In this work, we propose Hidden View - a human computation mobile game that enables the updating of maps and street views with the latest information. The preliminary implementation of the game is described and some results collected from a sample user study are presented. This work is the first step towards leveraging human computation and an individual's familiarity with different points-of-interest to keep maps and street views up to date.
