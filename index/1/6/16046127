Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques have become very relevant since they require a small set of labeled data. In this scenario, graph-based SSL algorithms provide a powerful framework for modeling manifold structures in high-dimensional spaces and are effective for the propagation of the few initial labels present in training data through the graph. An important step in graph-based SSL methods is the conversion of tabular data into a weighted graph. The graph construction has a key role in the quality of the classification in graph-based methods. Nevertheless, most of the SSL literature focuses on developing label inference algorithms without studying graph construction methods and its effect on the base algorithm performance. This PhD project aims to study this issue and proposes new methods for graph construction from flat data and improves the performance of the graph-based algorithms.
