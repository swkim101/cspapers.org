This paper describes a new approach for the static viewing and editing of an animated interface that has been created with a Programming By Demonstration system. The approach is based on an event-based, multipletimeline view that extends the traditional single timeline view found in systems such as Director. The result is a reduction in the amount of frame branching required to build an interface, and an ability to display some multithreaded interfaces not in the range of the single timeline approach.
