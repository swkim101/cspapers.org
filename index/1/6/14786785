In time-sensitive systems writing to and reading from the communication medium is on a purely time-triggered but asynchronous basis. Writes and reads can occur at any time and the data are stored and sustained until overwritten. We study how to maintain data semantics when the duration of the actions change from specification to implementation.In doing so, we rely on tag systems formerly introduced by the authors. The exibility of tag systems allows handling the problem in a formal, yet tractable way.
