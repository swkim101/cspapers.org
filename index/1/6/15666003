One of the more controversial topics to appear within the field of Computer Science has been the theory of Structured Programming and the specific tools and techniques associated with this generic title. With respect to this topic, it is the intent of this paper to provide a documented history of the research, prototyping and deliberate implementation of the Structured Programming Technology within the United States Army Computer Systems Command. Structured Programming as used within the context of this paper involves the concepts of structured code, top down development, walkthrus, program design language, design and documentation tools, program support library and a programming team. The USACSC experience is viewed as not just another case study but rather an organizational change impacting a large number (500 COBOL programmers) of personnel, standards, and normal operating procedures.
 One of the more intriguing topics to appear within the field of Computer Science has been the theory of Structured Programming and the specific tools and techniques associated with this generic title. After several years of discussion, pilot projects, technical articles and more discussions, the basic questions remain: What does the technology buy you? What does it cost you? How does one implement the technology on a large scale in a software production shop?
 With respect to these questions, and many others that the Software community shares regarding Structured Programming, it is the intent of this paper to provide a documented history of the research, prototyping and deliberate implementation of the Structured Programming Technology within the United States Army Computer Systems Command (USACSC).
