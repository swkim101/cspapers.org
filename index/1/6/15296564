This paper presents an adaptive controller for the bilateral teleoperation of a system composed by a single local manipulator and multiple cooperative remote manipulators handling a common object. First, the nonlinear operational space dynamical behavior of the complete teleoperation system is derived. Then, under the assumptions that the remote manipulators are rigidly grasping a non-deformable object and that the communications may induce constant time-delays, it is proved that velocities and position-orientation error between the local manipulator end-effector and the object asymptotically converge to zero. Simulations results are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
