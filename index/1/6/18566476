In this paper a bilateral teleoperation scheme is proposed to compensate force perturbations due to repetitive motions of the environment. Based on a Repetitive-Generalized Predictive Controller (R-GPC), it allows to reject periodical disturbances as those generated by respiration motion under breathing apparatus while in contact with the environment. The proposed method is detailed and experimental results are presented for the first time, using a 1-DOF teleoperation testbed.
