Matrix factorization (MF) has become the most popular technique for recommender systems due to its promising performance. Recently, distributed (parallel) MF models have received much attention from researchers of big data community. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called distributed stochastic alternating direction methods of multipliers (DS-ADMM), for large-scale MF problems. DS-ADMM is a distributed stochastic variant of ADMM. In particular, we first devise a new data split strategy to make the distributed MF problem fit for the ADMM framework. Then, a stochastic ADMM scheme is designed for learning. Finally, we implement DS-ADMM based on message passing interface (MPI), which can run on clusters with multiple machines (nodes). Experiments on several data sets from recommendation applications show that our DS-ADMM model can outperform other state-of-the-art distributed MF models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.
