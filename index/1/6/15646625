Automatically detecting verbal irony (roughly, sarcasm) in online content is important for many practical applications (e.g., sentiment detection), but it is difficult. Previous approaches have relied predominantly on signal gleaned from word counts and grammatical cues. But such approaches fail to exploit the context in which comments are embedded. We thus propose a novel strategy for verbal irony classification that exploits contextual features, specifically by combining noun phrases and sentiment extracted from comments with the forum type (e.g., conservative or liberal) to which they were posted. We show that this approach improves verbal irony classification performance. Furthermore, because this method generates a very large feature space (and we expect predictive contextual features to be strong but few), we propose a mixed regularization strategy that places a sparsity-inducing `1 penalty on the contextual feature weights on top of the `2 penalty applied to all model coefficients. This increases model sparsity and reduces the variance of model performance.
