We demonstrate QuickUML, a tool which supports iterative design and code development by providing facilities to draw UML class diagrams, to generate Java code from such diagrams, and also to automatically generate a UML class diagram from a collection of Java source code files. We also discuss how use of the tool provides general support for teaching students the importance of design in software development.
