This paper presents performance evaluation of silhouette-based action recognition from virtual human silhouette(VIHASI), which is publicly available. We especially evaluate action recognition performance based on tensor analysis. We applied tensor analysis for the silhouette data itself after sampling the same number of silhouette frames from given sample frames. Geometric manifold embedding based on tangent bundle is applied and shows better performance compared with baseline performance.
