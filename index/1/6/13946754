We have built KaBOB (Knowledge Base of Biomedicine) by integrating information from over 20 existing biomedical data sources about humans and seven major model organisms. The knowledge base is modeled in OWL and grounded in 14 prominent OBOs (Open Biomedical Ontologies). It is comprised of over 419 million RDF triples. Queries can be posed to KaBOB in terms of biomedical concepts and abstractions, instead of requiring knowledge of source-specific encodings and terminology.
