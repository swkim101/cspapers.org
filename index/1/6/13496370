A program is described which answers questions about processes. It is assumed that such questions should be answerable using as data only procedures for performing (simulating) the actions. Thus, the same procedure that is used to simulate the making of a sandwich can be listed to tell, in English, how to make a sandwich or can be examined to predict results and side effects such as the dirtying of a knife or the consumption of cheese. A wide variety of questions is answered with very few distinct answering processes. Sample output is provided.
