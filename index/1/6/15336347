This paper examines the applicability of LEGO Mindstorms to the intermediate-level computer science curriculum, which traditionally includes courses such as Computer Organization and Operating Systems. We describe three open-laboratory projects that employ Mindstorms in exploring systems-level programming topics and present results from student evaluations of the projects over the last two years. An interesting feature of the projects is that they do not involve robotics or robot construction but instead focus on the Mindstorms programmable brick as a platform in its own right.
