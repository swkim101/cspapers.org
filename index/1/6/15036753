Service robotics products are becoming a reality. This paper describes three core technologies that enable the next generation of service robots. They are low-cost, make use of low-cost hardware, and prepare for a short time-to-market for product development. The first technology is an object recognition system, which can be used by the robot to interact with the environment The second technology is a vision-based navigation system (vSLAM/spl trade/), which simultaneously can build a map and localize the robot in the map. Finally, the third technology is a flexible and rich software platform (ERSP/spl trade/) that assists developers in rapid design and prototyping of robotics applications.
