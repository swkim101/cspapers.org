This paper presents a quadrocopter flying in rhythm to music. The quadrocopter performs a periodic side-to-side motion in time to a musical beat. Underlying controllers are designed that stabilize the vehicle and produce a swinging motion. Synchronization is then achieved by using concepts from phase-locked loops. A phase comparator combined with a correction algorithm eliminate the phase error between the music reference and the actual quadrocopter motion. Experimental results show fast and effective synchronization that is robust to sudden changes in the reference amplitude and frequency. Changes in frequency and amplitude are tracked precisely when adding an additional feedforward component, based on an experimentally determined look-up table.
