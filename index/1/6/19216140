Kinematic calibration of a robotic manipulator determines its fabricated dimensions that inevitably deviate, due to manufacturing tolerances, from the specified/designed geometry. Conventional calibration methods achieve this goal by deriving a system of constraint equations from the kinematic structure. Workspace coordinates and the corresponding joint space coordinates are experimentally obtained so that these constraint equations can be solved for the optimal geometric parameters that best fit the data. This paper proposes an alternative kinematic calibration method that leverages response surface methodology to obtain empirical models of direct and inverse kinematics from the same experimental data. The advantages the proposed method include nullifying the requirements of deriving constraint equations and performing joint sensor calibration. In addition, since the developed models are empirical in nature, whether closed-form solutions to the direct or the indirect model is available becomes conveniently inconsequential. Both physical and simulation experiments were conducted on a 3-PSS/S to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method.
