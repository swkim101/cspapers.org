Neuromorphic systems recently gained increasing attention for their high computation efficiency. Many designs have been proposed and realized with traditional CMOS technology or emerging devices. In this work, we proposed a spiking neuromorphic design built on resistive crossbar structures and implemented with IBM 130nm technology. Our design adopts a rate coding scheme where pre- and post-neuron signals are represented by digitalized pulses. The weighting function of pre-neuron signals is executed on the resistive crossbar in analog format. The computing result is transferred into digitalized output spikes via an integrate-and-fire circuit (IFC) as the post-neuron. We calibrated the computation accuracy of the entire system through circuit simulations. The results demonstrated a good match to our analytic modeling. Furthermore, we implemented both feedforward and Hopfield networks by utilizing the proposed neuromorphic design. The system performance and robustness were studied through massive Monte-Carlo simulations based on the application of digital image recognition. Comparing to the previous crossbar-based computing engine that represents data with voltage amplitude, our design can achieve >50% energy savings, while the average probability of failed recognition increase only 1.46% and 5.99% in the feedforward and Hopfield implementations, respectively.
