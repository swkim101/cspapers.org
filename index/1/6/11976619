Sensor networks exploiting mobile robots have recently been proposed to provide more efficient sensing tasks in disruption tolerant networks [2, 3]. We call such a sensor network composed of mobile robots, Mobile Sensor Network (MSN). Multiple robots in MSN not only cooperate to accomplish difficult or dangerous tasks that cannot be done by human beings, but their movement is also a key idea of constructing an efficient MSN. MSN has unique characteristics that are not observed in both mobile ad hoc networks and wireless sensor networks, i.e., intentional mobility, disruption or delay tolerance, and explicit collaboration. Therefore, conventional routing schemes developed for such networks would fail in this context. In this paper, we propose a communication paradigm for MSN called Wireless Interactive SEnsing Robot (WISER) protocol. A major feature is a criteria of selecting between physical movement and wireless transmission at each hop. Easiness of movement are included in path decision. WISER also provides QoS guarantee and a concept of session establishment for transferring a large volume of data.
