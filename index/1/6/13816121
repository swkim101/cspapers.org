Knowledge graphs capture very little temporal information associated with facts. In this work, we address the problem of identifying time intervals of knowledge graph facts from large document collections annotated with temporal expressions. Prior approaches in this direction have leveraged limited metadata associated with documents in large collections (e.g., publication dates) or have limited techniques to model the uncertainty and dynamics of temporal expressions. Our approach to identify time intervals for time-sensitive facts in knowledge graphs leverages a time model that incorporates uncertainty and models them at different levels of granularity (i.e., day, month, and year). Evaluation on a temporal fact benchmark using two large news archives amounting to more than eleven million documents show the quality of our results.
