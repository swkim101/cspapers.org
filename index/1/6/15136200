A linguistic model and its implementation for the description of three-dimensional compositions, primarily as they occur in building construction are presented. The model, while it also provides for irregular compositions, it facilitates the derivation of standard orthogonal arrangements by the use of the junction operator, which does not require the explicit definition of positioning coordinates for each element in the composition.
