Most CS1 assignments are "known answer" assignments, requiring students to implement already-solved problems with no user but their grader and themselves. In this paper, we present Poogle: a freely available framework for designing unknown-answer assignments. Poogle assignments are open-ended, graphical, and multi-user. Poogle makes it easy for students to share their creations with their users: fellow students and the general public. We present two freely available CS1 assignments based on Poogle and discuss outcomes from use of one of them in a CS1 course.
