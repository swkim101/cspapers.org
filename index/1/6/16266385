Edges of an image is characterised by a boundary that's why it has a significant importance in the field of image processing. This paper presents the modified Sobel edge detection technique which gives sharp thin and noise free edges. Canny edge detection can filter out the useless information than the remaining information defines the structural information of the image. First of all make the image smooth by using a mask than Sobel operator use gradient method to find edges in an image. Gradient method is very useful in camera processing technique. It is used to blend the colors in horizontal and in vertical direction.
