A Command Entity (CE) is a goal-oriented intelligent agent specifically designed to command and control other agents. The CE niche, most often a military battlefield, is a complex, dynamic, adversarial environment in which a CE must balance the needs for thorough planning with the need for quick reactions to changing conditions. We describe the requirements of this environment, and how it constrains the design of CEs. Examples from several CE designs are used. The paper concentrates on the areas of planning, knowledge and teamwork.
