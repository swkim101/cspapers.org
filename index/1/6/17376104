Providing knowledge workers with access to experts and communities-of-practice is central to sharing expertise and crucial to organizational performance, adaptation, and even survival. This paper covers ongoing research to develop an Expert Locator prototype, a model-based system for detecting experts and broader communities-of-practice. The underlying expertise model is extensible and supports aggregation of evidence across diverse sources. The prototype is being used to locate critical expertise in key project areas, and current evaluation indicates its potential effectiveness.
