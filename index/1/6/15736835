Expertise selection is the process of choosing an expert from a list of recommended people. This is an important and nuanced step in expertise location that has not received a great deal of attention. Through a lab-based, controlled investigation with 35 enterprise workers, we found that presenting additional information about each recommended person in a search result list led the participants to make quicker and better-informed selections. These results focus attention on a currently understudied aspect of expertise location--expertise selection--that could greatly improve the usefulness of supporting systems. We also asked participants to rate the type of information that might be most useful for expertise selection on a paper prototype containing 36 types of potentially helpful information. We identified sixteen types of this information that may be most useful for various expertise selection tasks.
