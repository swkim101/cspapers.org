Current trends for high-performance systems are leading us towards hardware over-provisioning where it is no longer possible to run each component at peak power without exceeding a system or facility wide power bound. In such scenarios, the power consumed by individual components must be artificially limited to guarantee system operation under a given power bound. In this paper, we present the design of a power scheduler capable of enforcing such a bound using dynamic system-wide power reallocation in an application-agnostic manner. Our scheduler is expected to achieve better job runtimes than a naive power scheduling approach without requiring a priori knowledge of application power behavior.
