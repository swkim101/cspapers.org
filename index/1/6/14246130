We propose a competence partitioning strategy for Web search result presentation: the unmodified head of a ranked result list is combined with a clustering of documents from the result list tail. We identify two principles to which such a clustering must adhere to improve the user's search experience: (1) Avoid the unwanted effect of query aspect repetition, which is called shadowing here. (2) Avoid extreme clusterings, i.e., neither the number of cluster labels nor the number of documents per cluster should exceed the size of the result list head. We present measures to quantify the shadowing effect, and with Faceted Clustering we introduce an algorithm that optimizes the identified principles. The key idea of Faceted Clustering is a dynamic, user-controlled reorganization of a clustering, similar to a faceted navigation system. We report on evaluations using the AMBIENT corpus and demonstrate the potential of our approach by a comparison with two well-known clustering search engines.
