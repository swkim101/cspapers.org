In open multiagent systems individual components act in an autonomous and uncertain manner, thus making it difficult for the participating agents to interact with one another in a reliable environment. A reputation model can however predict the behavior of the agents and can optimize the issues related with dynamism. In this paper we present a critical analysis of an existing model for open MAS (FIRE) against our proposed swarm intelligence based reputation model. The model not only provides an optimum solution to various issues of reputation but also provides the mechanism of getting information from various sources.
