A new approach to achieving a natural-motion-picture dedicated multi-media authoring system is proposed. The main point of this approach, discussed in this paper, is that the user’s environment or interface is improved to encourage user’s creativity, with image processing and recognition technology. According to the discussion, a prototype motion picture authoring system dtat has several image-processing functions is developed. The newly developed functions include object extraction of the picture, semi-automatic visualization of motion pictures structure, and certain descriptions of the scene. Result of using the prototype shows the appropriateness of the proposed approach.
