Linear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in hybrid systems, both as physical models or as software control modules. Therefore we need an unbounded-time reachability analysis that can cope with industrial-scale hybrid system models with hundreds of variables. Abstract acceleration is a method developed for the unbounded-time polyhedral reachability analysis of linear software loops that has made promising progress in recent years. The method relies on a relaxation of the solution of the linear recurrence equation, leading to a precise convex over-approximation of the set of reachable states. It has been shown to be competitive with alternative approaches using set-based simulation or constraint solving. This paper explains the basic concepts of the technique, surveys recent advances of the technique towards the application to hybrid discrete and continuous-time linear dynamical systems, and formulates challenges to be tackled.
