This paper reports on the development and validation of the elastodynamics model of an innovative underwater soft-bodied robot inspired by cephalopods. The vehicle, for which the model is devised, is propelled by a discontinuous activation routine which entails the collapse of an elastic shell via cable transmission and its following passive re-inflation under the action of the elastic energy stored in the shell walls. Activation routine and thrust characterization have been determined to depend massively on the capability of the shell to elastically return to its unstrained state, hence an accurate description of the dynamics of the shell during all stages of actuation and at various degrees of deformation is essential. The model, based on a geometrically exact Cosserat theory, is validated against measurement achieved from an ad-hoc experimental apparatus, bringing evidence of its aptness at capturing the key parameters of the system. Eventually the model is employed for simulating a proper propulsion routine in water demonstrating that, upon suitable parametrization of the internal and external hydrodynamics, it can reliably be employed for the realistic quantitative characterization of the cephalopod-inspired robot.
