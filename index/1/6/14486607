Since their discovery 30 years ago, interior point methods deliver the most competitive algorithms for large scale optimization. Surprisingly, even when games of incomplete information can be formulated as a linear program, interior point methods have been discarded in favor of usually less attractive methods. This paper describes how specialized interior point methods can also scale to large games.
