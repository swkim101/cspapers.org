The paper describes the application of a prob-abilistic localization technique for indoor mobile robot navigation based on a qualitative, topological representation of the environment. From the characterization of the uncertainties related to motor behaviors and landmark recognition , a Markov-based localization system has been developed, which maintains and updates a probability distribution for all landmarks contained in a topological map. A reliable measure of successful localization has also been deened on two quantities, namely distribution entropy and a posteriori landmark conformance. Experimental tests have shown the probabilistic localizer is robust enough to cope with false positives and missed perceptions for over a hundred of runs inside the buildings of our Department .
