In this paper we consider a problem of delayed bilateral teleoperation control. We exploit a recent parameterization of all feasible teleoperator admittance matrices to propose a control synthesis procedure based on admittance shaping. This leads to an intuitive performance-oriented controller design that reveals important trade-offs inherent to bilateral teleoperaton. In particular, this allows a trade-off between performance and passivity, that is not accessible while using classical passivity-based methods. The proposed controller design is illustrated with simulations and a simple 1 DOF experimental case study.
