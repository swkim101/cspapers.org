Answering real-time queries, especially over probabilistic data, is becoming increasingly important for service providers. We study anytime query processing algorithms, and extend the traditional query execution plan with a timing component. Our focus is how to determine this timing component, given the queries' deadline constraints. We consider the common multicore processors. Specifically, we propose two query optimization modes: offline periodic optimization and online optimization. We devise efficient algorithms for both offline and online cases followed by a competitive analysis to show the power of our online optimization. Finally, we perform a systematic experimental evaluation using real-world datasets to verify our approaches.
