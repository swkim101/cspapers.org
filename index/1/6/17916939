Fault-tolerance is an important consideration in large systems. Broadly, there are two approaches to coping with faults. The first is the "reconfiguration" approach [3, 9], in which faults are identified and isolated in real time. This is done concurrently with computation, and is often a significant overhead. A second, different approach is to devise algorithms that work despite unreliable information, without singling out the faulty information. This latter approach has been the focus of much recent work [6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 16]. Here we adopt a new approach to this latter paradigm.
