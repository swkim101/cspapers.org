Establishing user requirements is well recognized as a critical step in the development of useful and usable systems (e.g., [5]). Recent innovations in human-computer interaction design address new methods for effective requirements gathering, such as Participatory Design and Contextual Inquiry (e.g., [7], [9]). However, even when projects use these methods successfully to collect vrdid requirement descriptions, it remains a challenge to establish a process that makes direct use of those descriptions during software development [11]. Valuable requirements information can be lost as it is reinterpreted during the development of functional specifications and the implementation of the proposed system. We describe the several steps we have taken to keep an ongoing and evolving understanding of user requirements under consideration by system designers and developers as they face the “real” (to them) requirements of adapting function to the constraints of computer platforms, project cost, and delivery schedule. The specific work reported here applies to the design of software for a clinical workstation used to review medical information. However, we believe the lessons we learned, maintaining the influence of user requirements throughout the development process, will apply in other practical system development situations.
