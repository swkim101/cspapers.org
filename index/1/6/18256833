In addition to the special field topology, a parking garage wireless sensor network restricts power consumption and data transmission time in terms of hardware equipment and service management. Without the consideration of node load or packet collision in the route of data transmission from a sensor to the sink node, the node will not only exhaust the energy but also may not transmit the data to the control center in time for real-time response in case of some sudden occurrences or during the rush hour. The research adopts the multi-transmission power of sensor node to raise the linkage of topology and construct a model based on the linear programming technology. It aims to decentralize the load of the sensor nodes around the sink node and build a routing mechanism with load balance to enhance the network lifetime. Moreover, it complies with the TDMA MAC mechanism with space reuse to reduce the packet collision issue of sensor data transmission. According to the simulation results, the proposed mechanism avoids packet collision, raises network lifetime, reduce the time cost for data collection, and fulfill the service requirements of a smart parking garage.
