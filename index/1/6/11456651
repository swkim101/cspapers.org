In this paper an optimal state feedback design as a power system stabilizer (PSS) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) is presented. The problem of selecting the parameters of the state feedback PSS for a multi machine power system is converted to an optimization problem solved by PSO with the eigenvalue-based objective functions. Both the relative stability of low-frequency modes and the practical implementation of PSSs as Considerations for a stable system are included in the constraints. The locally measured states are fed back at the AVR reference input of each machine after multiplication by suitable feedback gains. The obtained stabilizer is confirmed by eigenvalue analysis and simulation results of a multi machine power system under different operating conditions and exposed to small disturbances.
