The paper maintains that fixed priority process based preemptive scheduling is, arguably, more convenient, flexible and responsive than conventional cyclic scheduling for the construction of new generation software intensive satellite control systems. Predictable usage of preemptive priority based scheduling, however, demands the support of mature static analysis techniques. Worst case response time analysis models can be constructed which minimise the embodied pessimism and maximise useful processing. The paper presents the design and implementation of an Ada programming model and associated worst case response time analysis tools aimed to support the construction of highly predictable, highly efficient on-board control systems.
