Speeding up the development process of Web Services, while adhering to high quality software standards is a typical requirement in the software industry. This is why industry specialists usually suggest "driven by" development approaches to tackle this problem. In this paper, we propose such a methodology that employs Specification Driven Development and Behavior Driven Development in order to facilitate the phases of Web Service requirements elicitation and specification. Furthermore, we introduce gherkin2OAS, a software tool that aspires to bridge the aforementioned development approaches. Through the suggested methodology and tool, one may design and build RESTful services fast, while ensuring proper functionality.
