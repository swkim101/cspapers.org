The paper presents methods of space allocation applicable to architectural design. These techniques have been developed in the past twenty years and are presented in this paper in such a way that they may also be applied to other desciplines. Four categories are presented that identify the variations in the dimensioning of the elements, either unit dimension or variable dimension, and the variation in the shape of the boundary, either a simple rectangle or a multi-faceted boundary.
