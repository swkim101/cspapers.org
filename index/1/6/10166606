In this demo, we present a wiki-style platform -- WikiBABEL -- that enables easy collaborative creation of multilingual content in many non-English Wikipedias, by leveraging the relatively larger and more stable content in the English Wikipedia. The platform provides an intuitive user interface that maintains the user focus on the multilingual Wikipedia content creation, by engaging search tools for easy discoverability of related English source material, and a set of linguistic and collaborative tools to make the content translation simple. We present two different usage scenarios and discuss our experience in testing them with real users. Such integrated content creation platform in Wikipedia may yield as a by-product, parallel corpora that are critical for research in statistical machine translation systems in many languages of the world.
