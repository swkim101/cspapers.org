Community Question Answering (CQA) service provides a platform for increasing number of users to ask and answer for their own needs but unanswered questions still exist within a fixed period. To address this, the paper aims to route questions to the right answerers who have a top rank in accordance of their previous answering performance. In order to rank the answerers, we propose a framework called Question Routing (QR) which consists of four phases: (1) performance profiling, (2) expertise estimation, (3) availability estimation, and (4) answerer ranking. Applying the framework, we conduct experiments with Yahoo! Answers dataset and the results demonstrate that on average each of 1,713 testing questions obtains at least one answer if it is routed to the top 20 ranked answerers.
