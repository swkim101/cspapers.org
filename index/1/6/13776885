Pilot-Jobs have become one of the most successful abstractions in distributed computing. In spite of extensive uptake, there does not exist a well defined, unifying conceptual model of pilot-jobs which can be used to define, compare and contrast different implementations. This presents a barrier to extensibility and interoperability. This paper is an attempt to, (i) provide a minimal but complete model (P*) of pilot-jobs, (ii) establish the generality of the P* Model by mapping various existing and well known pilot-jobs frameworks such as Condor and DIANE to P*, (iii) demonstrate the interoperable and concurrent usage of distinct pilot-job frameworks on different production distributed cyberinfrastructures via the use of an extensible API for the P* Model (Pilot-API).
