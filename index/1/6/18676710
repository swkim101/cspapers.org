Regression-based techniques have shown promising results for people counting in crowded scenes. However, most existing techniques require expensive and laborious data annotation for model training. In this study, we propose to address this problem from three perspectives: (1) Instead of exhaustively annotating every single frame, the most informative frames are selected for annotation automatically and actively. (2) Rather than learning from only labelled data, the abundant unlabelled data are exploited. (3) Labelled data from other scenes are employed to further alleviate the burden for data annotation. All three ideas are implemented in a unified active and semi-supervised regression framework with ability to perform transfer learning, by exploiting the underlying geometric structure of crowd patterns via manifold analysis. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.
