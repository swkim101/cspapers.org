Mobile phones are becoming the central tools for communicating and can help us keep in touch with friends and family on-the-go. However, they can also place high demands on attention and constrain interaction. My research concerns how to design communication mechanisms that mitigate these problems to support self-expression for informal communication on mobile phones. I will study how people communicate with camera-phone photos, paper-based sketches, and projected information and how this communication impacts social practices.
