Operating robots in an outdoor setting poses interesting problems in terms of interaction. To interact with the robot there is a need for a flexible computer interface. In this paper a PDA-based (personal digital assistant, i.e. a handheld computer) approach to robot interaction is presented. The system is designed to allow non-expert users to utilise the robot for operation in an urban exploration setup. The basic design is outlined and a first set of experiments are reported.
