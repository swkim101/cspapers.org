A method developed for the computer aided layout of MOS standard-cell-circuits is described. In this method placement and routing are performed automatically using a SIEMENS 4004/151 computer. Resulting data are linked with the topographical description of the cells and displayed to the user on a CRT for further work.
 After discussing the concept of the standard-cell approach and a representation of the employed algorithms, the superiority of the described method with respect to the quality of the design and the time and cost of preparing is demonstrated in an example in which a comparison is made with results obtained using the conventional method.
