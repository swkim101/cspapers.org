When browsing a long video using a traditional timeline slider control, its effectiveness and precision degrade as a video's length grows. When browsing videos with more frames than pixels in the slider, aside from some frames being inaccessible, scrolling actions cause sudden jumps in a video's continuity as well as video frames to flash by too fast for one to assess the content. We propose a content-aware dynamic timeline control that is designed to overcome these limitations. Our timeline control decouples video speed and playback speed, and leverages video content analysis to allow salient shots to be presented at an intelligible speed. Our control also takes advantage of previous work on elastic sliders, which allows us to produce an accurate navigation control.
