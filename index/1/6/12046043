The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides a principled general model for planning under uncertainty. However, solving a general POMDP is computationally intractable in the worst case. This paper introduces POMDP-lite, a subclass of POMDPs in which the hidden state variables are constant or only change deterministically. We show that a POMDP-lite is equivalent to a set of fully observable Markov decision processes indexed by a hidden parameter and is useful for modeling a variety of interesting robotic tasks. We develop a simple model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning algorithm to solve POMDP-lite models. The algorithm performs well on large-scale POMDP-lite models with up to 1020 states and outperforms the state-of-the-art general-purpose POMDP algorithms. We further show that the algorithm is near-Bayesian-optimal under suitable conditions.
