An approach to detection of phishing webpages based on visual similarity is proposed, which can be utilized as a part of an enterprise solution for anti-phishing. A legitimate webpage owner can use this approach to search the Web for suspicious webpages which are visually similar to the true webpage. A webpage is reported as a phishing suspect if the visual similarity is higher than its corresponding preset threshold. Preliminary experiments show that the approach can successfully detect those phishing webpages for online use.
