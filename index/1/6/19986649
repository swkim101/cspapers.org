This paper presents an intelligent method to detect statistic obstacles and generate an optimum and safe path for an autonomous mobile robot. An USB Camera is used to capture the robot environmental top-view image. Then image processing programs are used to extract the mobile robot initial position, the goal position and the static obstacles positions. The optimum path from the start position to the goal position avoiding all obstacles is generated, using an adequate path optimizing algorithm. Then a PID controller is designed to ensure the effective robot path following. First, the Dual-PID controller is simulated with different robot typical trajectories such as circular trajectory and eight-shape trajectory. Then the whole solution is simulated with real robot scenario.
