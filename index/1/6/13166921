In this paper we describe Conference Live, a semantic Web application to browse conference data. Conference Live is a Web and mobile application based on conference data from the Semantic Web Dog Food server, which provides facilities to browse papers and authors at a specific conference. Available data for the specific conference is enriched with social features (e.g. integrated Twitter accounts of paper authors), scheduling features (calendar information are attached for paper presentations and social events), the possibility to check and add feedback to each paper and to vote for papers, if the conference includes sessions where participants can vote, as it is popular e.g. for poster sessions. As use case we report on the usage of the application at the Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) in May 2014.
