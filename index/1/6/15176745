This paper presents a method to generate discrete switching commands for a camera orientation system exhibiting quantization and flexibility to achieve smooth-pursuit like movements. Existing vibration suppression techniques and camera positioning devices have shown notable results but focused only on point-to-point movements. A desired motion profile can be generated by incorporating a classical feedback controller with PWM quantization but each unit actuator is required to produce high-frequency switching that can potentially damage the complaint mechanism. The proposed controller generates pulse-like switching commands for smooth-pursuit like motion to match the velocity of an object of interest. Then, switching commands for vibration suppression are generated to avoid high-frequency switching. The proposed method has been evaluated by using a robotic system which has a total of 32 piezoelectric actuator. The experiment results show that the camera orientation system successfully achieved dynamic vision given the proposed commands in an open-loop manner.
