To facilitate the collection of patient biosignals, designing extensible sensing devices in which sensor management is simplified is essential. This paper presents BioScope, an extensible sensing system that facilitates collecting data used in nursing assessments. We conducted experiments to demonstrate the potential of the system. The results obtained in this study can be applied in improving the design, thus enabling BioScope to facilitate data collection in numerous potential applications.
