A new kind of RMS, based on a close merge of TMS and ATMS, is proposed. It uses the TMS graph and interpretation and the ATMS multiple context labelling procedure. In order to fill in the problems of the ATMS environments in presence of nonmonotonic inferences, a new kind of environment, able to take into account hypotheses that do not hold, is defined. These environments can inherit formulas that hold as in the ATMS context lattice. The dependency graph can be interpreted with regard to these environments; so every node can be labelled. Furthermore, this leads to consider several possible interpretations of a query.
