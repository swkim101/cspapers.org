We consider the problem of identifying correlations in data streams. Surprisingly, our work seems to be the first to consider this natural problem. In the centralized model, we consider a stream of pairs (i,j) ∈ [n]2 whose frequencies define a joint distribution (X,Y). In the distributed model, each coordinate of the pair may appear separately in the stream. We present a range of algorithms for approximating to what extent X and Y are independent, i.e., how close the joint distribution is to the product of the marginals. We consider various measures of closeness including ℓ1, ℓ2, and the mutual information between X and Y. Our algorithms are based on "sketching sketches", i.e., composing small-space linear synopses of the distributions. Perhaps ironically, the biggest technical challenges that arise relate to ensuring that different components of our estimates are sufficiently independent.
