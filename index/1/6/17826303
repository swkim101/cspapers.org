Efficient and effective discovery of resource and knowledge from the Internet has become an imminent research issue, especially with the advent of the Information Super-Highway. A multiple layered database (MLDB) approach is proposed to handle the resource and knowledge discovery in global information base. A preliminary experiment shows the advantages of such an approach. Information retrieval, data mining, and data analysis techniques can be used to extract and transform information from a lower layer database to a higher one. Resources can be found by controlled search through different layers of the database, and knowledge discovery can be performed efficiently in such a layered database.
