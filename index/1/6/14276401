This paper reports on the innovation process in one organization that has recently adopted and implemented an EMS. The paper traces the innovation process through four stages: conception of an idea: proposal; decision to adopt; and implementation. Important factors from the innovation literature are considered as explanators of the innovation process involving EMS in this particular organization.
