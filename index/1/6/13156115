POGIL (Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning) is a form of active learning where students work collaboratively through activities designed to guide them to discover concepts on their own. POGIL is based on the principle that students will learn and retain more when they construct their own understanding of the computer science (CS) content. Working in groups of three to four, students develop process skills, such as problem solving, communication, and teamwork. This special session will first provide SIGCSE attendees the opportunity to experience a CS POGIL activity for themselves. We will then discuss different ways that instructors might adopt POGIL for use in their classroom, and how the adoption of POGIL by multiple instructors in a department can change the culture of the department.
