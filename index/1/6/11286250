This paper is a report on the current (1975 May) status of the Study Group on Data Base Management Systems in the United States. While the official purpose of this Study Group is an investigation of standardization potential in the area of data base management systems, an important by-product of the work of the Group has been the development of a set of requirements for effective data base management systems. As no existing or proposed implementation of a data base management system satsified these requirements, nor comprehends more than a fraction of the concepts involved, it is appropriate to explicate these ideas in the present forum.
