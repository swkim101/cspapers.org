There is great imbalance in the richness of information on the web and the succinctness and poverty of search requests of web users, making their queries only a partial description of the underlying complex information needs. Finding ways to better leverage contextual information and make search context-aware holds the promise to dramatically improve the search experience of users. We conducted a series of studies to discover, model and utilize contextual information in order to understand and improve users' searching and browsing behavior on the web. Our results capture important aspects of context under the realistic conditions of different online search services, aiming to ensure that our scientific insights and solutions transfer to the operational settings of real world applications.
