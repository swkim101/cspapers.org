This is a sample Simulation tools help creating a low cost and efficient development of embedded system. SID is an open source simulator software that consists library of components for modelling hardware and software components. A component can be written in C/C++ and Tcl/Tk. Currently, the SID simulation toolkit only provides support for C++ and Tcl/Tk. Tcl/Tk is used to create GUI-based components. However, we have observed that Tcl/Tk components causing slow simulation response. Developing GUI using Tcl/Tk is also inflexible. Thus it is not proper for developing the cutting-edge products with rich graphics. In this work, we introduced the idea of Java as an alternative platform for developing components in SID. We enabled this possibility by developing a bridge module for SID using socket and JNI. SID API in Java is also proposed to ensure the compatibility and simplicity of SID components in Java.
