This paper presents a novel architecture for communication protocols that takes advantage of object mobility, allowing applications to specify the behavior of protocols for each individual message. This is achieved by opening the implementation of protocols and letting the application program associate a set of possibly customized meta-objects to every message, separately adapting diierent aspects of the service provided by the protocol.
