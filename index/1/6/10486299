A well known problem in computer vision and photogrammetry is the precise online mapping of the surrounding scenery. Due to the nature of single projective sensor configurations with inherent 7-DoF, error accumulation and scale drift is still a problem for vision based systems. This is especially relevant for difficult motion trajectories. However, it is desirable to use cheap small form factor systems, e.g., small UAVs with a single camera setup.
