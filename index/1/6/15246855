However, such component on analytical healthcare data processing is largely missed from current healthcare information technology (HIT) or health informatics (HI) curricula. This paper conducts a preliminary analysis on how healthcare business intelligence can be incorporated into a HIT program. A general framework and several exemplar implementation strategies are presented. They can be used to guide the development and improvement of HIT curriculum.
