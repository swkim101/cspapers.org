This paper presents a general motion planning framework for body shape control of snake robots. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework for straight line path following control, and for implementing body shape compliance in environments with obstacles. Compliance is achieved by assigning mass-spring-damper dynamics to the shape curve defining the motion of the robot. The performance of the control strategies is illustrated with simulation results.
