Writing in Computer Science education is typically writing to communicate to a professional audience--also known as "writing in the discipline." (WID) A few Computer Science educators have promoted "writing to learn" (WTL) for active learning. A gap exists between these two forms of writing that inhibits the general adoption of writing in Computer Science. We propose that "bridging" informal WTL assignments to formal disciplinary writing as a way of promoting general adoption of writing across all courses, thus improving thinking and writing skills for all Computer Science students. We include examples of assignments that bridge writing to learn and writing in the discipline.
