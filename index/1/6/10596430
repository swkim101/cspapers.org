High motion performance, stiffness, and accuracy are crucial for industrial robot applications, but these requirements are in practice contradictory. Using a novel type of robot, the so called Gantry Tau, new combinations of stiffness and accuracy are in principle possible, except for the backlash in the drive-trains of each joint.
