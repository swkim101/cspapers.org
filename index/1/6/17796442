This paper presents the robotic hammering task performed by single arm and dual arm. In order to analyze optimal hammering task, the analytical model of external and internal impulses are taken as the measure. Desired hammering task implies that the hammer simultaneously exerts maximum external impulse on nail and minimum internal impulses on robot or human joints. The advantages of dual arm manipulator with muscles over dual arm without muscles and single arm model with muscle and without muscle are presented. Moreover, the effective mass in nailing operation is experimentally obtained for two different materials and it is integrated into the external impulse model of the hammering task. Furthermore, the hammering workspace is optimized by considering the minimum internal and maximum external impulses.
