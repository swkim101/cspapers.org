The Web today includes many pages intended to deceive search engines, and attain an unwarranted result ranking. Since the links among web pages are used to calculate authority, ranking systems would benefit from knowing which pages contain content to be trusted and which do not. We propose and compare various trust propagation methods to estimate the trustworthiness of each page. We find that a non-trust-preserving propagation method is able to achieve close to a fifty percent improvement over TrustRank in separating spam from non-spam pages.
