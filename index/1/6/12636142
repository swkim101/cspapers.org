In human-robot collaborative tasks, incorporating qualitative information provided by humans can greatly enhance the robustness and efficacy of robot state estimation. We introduce an algorithmic framework to model qualitative information as quantitative constraints on and between states. Our approach, named Sequentially Constrained Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, integrates Hamiltonian dynamics into Sequentially Constrained Monte Carlo sampling. We are able to generate samples that satisfy arbitrarily complex, non-smooth and discontinuous constraints, which in turn allows us to support a wide range of qualitative information. We evaluate our approach for constrained sampling qualitatively and quantitatively with several classes of constraints. SCHMC significantly outperforms the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method) and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method, in terms of both the accuracy of the sampling (for satisfying constraints) and the quality of approximation. Compared to Sequentially Constrained Monte Carlo (SCMC), which supports similar kinds of constraints, our SCHMC approach has faster convergence rates and lower parameter sensitivity.
