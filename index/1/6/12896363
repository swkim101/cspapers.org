A powerful methodology for specifying scenario-based requirements of reactive systems is described, in which behavioral requirements are "played in" directly from the system's GUI or some abstract version thereof, and full behavior can then be "played out" freely, just as if a conventional system model were present. The approach is supported and illustrated by a tool we have built, which we call the play-engine. The ideas appear to be relevant to many stages of system development, including requirements engineering, specification, testing, and implementation.
