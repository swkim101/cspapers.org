The allocation of resources in an array computer using either an SW-banyan or a tree interconnection network is implemented in hardware. A generalized solution for the resource allocation problem in such machines is presented. The solution reduces network node blockage and node distances and supports differing network topologies and decentralized scheduling. The mechanism presented is shown to reduce significantly the amount of computational work required in software allocation of resources.
