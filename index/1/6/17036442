The multifunctional cursor (MC) is a technique for representing multiple operations in direct manipulation user interfaces. Icons for each of several simultaneously-available operations are overlaid into the cursor image. The MC improves user interface practice by removing syntactic inconsistencies, by reducing cognitive load, and by providing support for repeated operations.
