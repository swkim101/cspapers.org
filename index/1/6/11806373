This paper introduces NEUROExos, an elbow powered exoskeleton for rehabilitation. The NEUROExos is provided with three novel characteristics which address the major problems arising in rehabilitation robotics. A double-shell link structure allows for a comfortable human-robot interaction, while a 4-DOF passive mechanism gives a perfect kinematic compatibility with the user. Moreover, NEUROExos is powered by a variable impedance antagonistic actuator, which provides the exoskeleton with a software-controllable passive compliance. We present the main characteristics of the exoskeleton, with a focus on the actuation and control of the platform. Additionally, results on a healthy subject show the relevance of this design during a prototypical rehabilitation task
