Object database management systems (ODBMS) are now established as the database management technology of choice for a range of challenging data intensiv e applications. Furthermore, the applications associated with object databases typically have stringen t performance requirements, and some are associated with very large data sets. Ho w ever, despite the demands made on object databases by applications, there has been surprisingly little work on parallel object databases. This paper presents the arc hitecture and some preliminary performance results for the Polar ODMG compliant parallel object database. The architecture described has been implemented in a shared-nothing environment on a network of PCs. The paper describes how OQL queries are compiled, parallelized and executed in this environment, and includes some preliminary performance results for OQL queries using the 007 benchmark.
