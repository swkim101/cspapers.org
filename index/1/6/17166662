Any scientific publication aims to advance the field of knowledge that it deals with, and therefore the editorial 
staff will always be seeking the most revolutionary papers among all of those received. On the other hand, the 
reviewersâ€™ task is usually a much more conservative one, as reviewers are responsible for verifying the realism 
of the methods proposed and the veracity of the claimed results.
