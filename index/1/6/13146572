The analysis and representation of complex line drawings is treated and applied. A method for rating the complexity of drawings is developed and compared with the difficulties of human subjects in memorizing them. The problem of isolating and recognizing these memorized figures embedded in more extensive patterns is then investigated. Differing types of embedment are defined by their effect on the original components of the memorized figures. Degrees of embedment are calculated for each memorized figure and compared with experimental results. Predictions are made for human difficulties in recognizing a simple figure under various conditions of embedment.
