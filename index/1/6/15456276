ABSTRACT To understand how people search for a known target item in an unordered pull-down menu, this research presents cognitive models that vary serial versus parallel processing of menu items, random versus systematic search, and different numbers of menu items fitting into the fovea simultaneously. Varying these conditions, models were constructed and run using the EPIC cognitive architecture. The selection times predicted by the models are compared with selection times of human subjects performing the same menu task. Comparing the predicted and observed times, the models reveal that 1) people process more than one menu item at a time, and 2) people search menus using both random and systematic search strategies.
