We propose a panoramic viewing system, which applies the technique of Anamorphosis, mapping a 2D display onto a cylindrical mirror. In this system, a distorted scene image is shown on a flat panel display or tabletop surface. When a user places the cylindrical mirror on the display, the original image appears on the cylindrical mirror.By simply rotating the cylinder, a user can decide the direction to walk-through in VR world.
