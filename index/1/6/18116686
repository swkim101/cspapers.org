An Interactive Simulation System (ISS) is presented. ISS is an integrated interactive CAD system for logic design, and is configurated "module oriented" to support structured logic design. An Interactive Simulator (IS) is used for design verification. A designer can control simulation steps interactively in IS, and he can find design errors early using a good interactive interface. A Structured Hardware Design Language (SHDL) is used to describe logic designs.
