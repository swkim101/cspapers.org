In this paper, the well-known problem of codependence between inverse dynamics torque and contact force in bimanual object manipulation is addressed. The common contact constraint, namely rigid grasping, is exploited to decompose the set of dynamics equations into two orthogonally decoupled sets. Subsequently, the inverse dynamics control is formulated in a sub-manifold that is independent of the contact force, leading to analytically correct solutions that do not need to resort to common approximations for the aforementioned codependence problem. The contact force is also analytically computed and, therefore, can be optimally distributed using the torque redundancy. Relying on this prediction is most significant in situations where a force sensor at the end-effector is not present or is faulty. Even in the availability of sensory data, the predicted force may be used to correct typically noisy or delayed when filtered measurements, resulting in improved robustness. Simulation experiments on a planar bimanual manipulation model are presented.
