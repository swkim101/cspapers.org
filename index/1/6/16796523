The performance (throughput and delay) of the multihop broadcast communication networks is studied via a simulation model that includes channel access, transmission scheduling, buffer, management, and hop-by-hop acknowledgment protocols. The parameters considered are the data and acknowledgment packets transmission probabilities, timeout periods, and buffer sizes. The performance of echo acknowledgment, all-active acknowledgment, and a mixed acknowledgment scheme based on nodes connectivities are also studied.
 Systems parameters that yield best performance for each configuration are given. Our studies reveal that the string configuration yielded better throughput than the star configuration; further, echo acknowledgment yield better performance than active acknowledgment in a string multihop broadcast network.
