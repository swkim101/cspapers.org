Two of the most important parameters of a computer are its processor speed and physical memory size. We study the relationship between these two parameters by experimentally evaluating the intrinsic memory and processor requirements of various applications. We also explore how hardware prices are changing the cost effectiveness of these two resources. Our results indicate that several important applications are “memory-bound,” i.e., can benefit more from increased memory than from a faster processor.
