This paper presents a portion of the register-transfer level computer aided design (RT-CAD) research at Carnegie-Mellon University. This part of the research involves the design and construction of an allocator, consisting of a set of algorithms and data structures which synthesize hardware at the logical level from a behavioral description. Preliminary results indicate the allocators performance compares favorably with a human designer.
