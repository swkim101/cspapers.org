This paper shows the implementation and evaluation of the Entity Linking or Named Entity Disambiguation system used and developed at Bloomberg. In particular, we present and evaluate a methodology and a system that do not require the use of Wikipedia as a knowledge base or training corpus. We present how we built features for disambiguation algorithms from the Bloomberg News corpus, and how we employed them for both single-entity and joint-entity disambiguation into a Bloomberg proprietary knowledge base of people and companies. Experimental results show high quality in the disambiguation of the available annotated corpus.
