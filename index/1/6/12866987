The background to this work is the simulation of a planner who operates in a dynamic environment, by recognising the plans of others and predicting future events. The domain is that of a driver who must negotiate a route, obeying traffic regulations, and taking account of and avoiding collisions with other vehicles - The world of the driver is represented by a changing world model; the channel of communication between planner and this world model are actions from planner (driver's mind) to world, and perceptions from world to planner. Simulating a dynamic world model has been an important aspect of this work, and it is the implementation of this which is discussed below. Some new techniques of simulating physical processes have been developed.
