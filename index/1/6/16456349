A system for generating control data comprises an imput component having a movable member, a position detecting component for detecting a position of the movable member and for outputting a position signal, a random access memory component for storing control data therein, a writing component for writing the control data in the random access memory component, an analog to digital converting component for converting the position signal to a digital position signal and for outputting the digital position signal as a read address, a reading component for reading out the control data from the read address of the random access memory component, and output component for outputting the control data read out from the random access memory component.
