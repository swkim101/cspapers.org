In this paper, we resolve the issue of stepping over a large obstacle by exploiting the redundancy of pelvis rotation and the versatility of foot trajectories for the humanoids. The control framework consists of a motion pattern that exploits the redundancy of pelvis rotation to enlarge the kinematic workspace, a generic foot trajectory generation which can be modified by a parametric interface to adapt to a specific task as well as utilizing the hip abduction to avoid obstacle collision. Moreover, the compensation strategies are also presented for reducing the discrepancies to implement the dynamic stepping motion on a real robot. The effectiveness is validated by COMAN's capability of dynamically stepping over a large obstacle of 10cm height by 5cm width which is almost 20% of its leg length in both simulation and experiment.
