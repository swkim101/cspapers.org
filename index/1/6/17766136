This work studies the potentials and challenges of designing ultra low-power analog circuits exploiting unique characteristics of Tunnel-FET (TFET). TFET can achieve ultra-low quiescent current (~pA). In the subthreshold operation, TFET exhibit subthreshold swing lower than 60mV/decade, and hence higher transconductance per bias current than the MOSFET. TFET also exhibit very weak temperature dependence, and higher output resistance. Among several challenges, TFET demonstrate higher Shot noise at low biasing current. Through design of TFET based Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) these challenges and opportunities are discussed. For implantable bio-medical applications, TFET OTA based neural amplifier design is studied.
