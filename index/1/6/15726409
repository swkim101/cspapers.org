We present a deterministic algorithm for solving two-dimensional convex programs with a linear objective function. The algorithm requiresO(klogk) primitive operations forkconstraints; if a feasible point is given, the bound reduces toO(klogk/loglogk). As a consequence, we can decide whetherkconvexn-gons in the plane have a common intersection inO(klognmin{logk, loglogn}) worst-case time. Furthermore, we can solve the three-dimensional online programming problem ino(log3n) worst-case time per operation.
