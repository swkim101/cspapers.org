With the continuous rise of multimedia, the question of how to access large-scale multimedia databases efficiently has become of crucial importance. Given a multimedia database comprising millions of multimedia objects, how to approximate the content-based properties of the corresponding feature representations in order to carry out similarity search efficiently and with high accuracy? In this paper, we propose the concept of gradient-based signatures in order to aggregate content-based features of multimedia objects by means of generative models. We provide theoretical insights into our approach including closed-form expressions for the computation of gradient-based signatures with respect to Gaussian mixture models and additionally investigate different binarization methods for gradient-based signatures in order to query databases comprising millions of multimedia objects with high accuracy in less than one second.
