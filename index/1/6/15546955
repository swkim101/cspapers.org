In this work, we investigate the application of geometric representation of hash vectors of the information packets in multicast authentication protocols. To this end, a new authentication approach based on geometric properties of hash vectors in an $n-$dimensional vector space is proposed. The proposed approach enables the receiver to authenticate the source packets and removes malicious packets that may have been injected by an adversary into the channel. A salient feature of the proposed scheme is that its bandwidth overhead is independent from the number of injected packets. Moreover, the performance analysis verifies that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the bandwidth overhead as compared to the well known multicast authentication protocols in the literature (e.g., PRABS).
