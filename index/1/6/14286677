Controlling the motion of microrobots based on feedback provided using an imaging modality is essential to make them clinically viable. In this study, we demonstrate the wireless magnetic-based motion control of paramagnetic microparticles using ultrasound feedback. This control is accomplished by pulling the microparticles using the magnetic field gradients towards the reference position through feedback provided by an ultrasound system. First, position of the microparticles is determined using the ultrasound images. Second, calibration of the ultrasound-based tracking of microparticles is achieved and verified using a calibrated microscopic system. Third, the feedback provided by the ultrasound system is used in the implementation of a proportional-derivative magnetic-based control system. This control system allows us to achieve point-to-point control of microparticles with an average position tracking error of 48±59 μm, whereas a control system based on a microscopic system achieves an average position tracking error of 21±26 μm. The positioning accuracy accomplished using our ultrasound magnetic-based control system demonstrates the ability to control microrobotic systems in situations where visual feedback cannot be provided via microscopic systems.
