This paper presents a six-legged, sprawl-tuned autonomous robot (STAR). This novel robot has a variable leg sprawl angle in the transverse plane to adapt its stiffness, height, and leg-to-surface contact angle. The sprawl angle can be varied from nearly positive 60 degrees to negative 90 degrees, enabling the robot to run in a planar configuration, upright, or inverted (see movie). STAR is fitted with spoke wheel-like legs which provide high electromechanical conversion efficiency and enable the robot to achieve legged performance over rough surfaces and obstacles, using a high sprawl angle, and nearly wheel-like performance over smooth surfaces for small sprawl angles. Our model and experiments show that the contact angle and normal contact forces are substantially reduced when the sprawl angle is low, and the velocity increases over smooth surfaces, with stable running at all velocities up to 5.2m/s and a Froude number of 9.8.
