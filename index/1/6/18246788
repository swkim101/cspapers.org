We present a statistical framework to extract information-rich citation sentences that summarise the main contributions of a scientific paper. In a first stage, we automatically discover salient keywords from a paper’s citation summary, keywords that characterise its main contributions. In asecond stage, exploitingthe results of the first stage, we identify citation sentences that best capture the paper’s main contributions. Experimental results show that our approach using methods rooted in quantitative statistics and information theory outperforms the current state-of-the-art systems in scientific paper summarisation.
