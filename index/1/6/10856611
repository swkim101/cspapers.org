This work presents a method to find analytic and feasible trajectories for underactuated, balancing robots. The target application is fast computation of achievable trajectories for the ballbot, a dynamically stable mobile robot which balances on a single spherical wheel. To this end, assumptions are made to form the system as differentially flat, and a method of deriving feasible trajectories is shown. These trajectories are tracked on the real robot, demonstrating both point to point motions and recovery from nonzero initial conditions.
