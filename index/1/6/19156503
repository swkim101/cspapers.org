This paper presents an effective fully convolutional network (FCN) to extract stroke skeletons for handwritten Chinese characters. We combine the holistically-nested architecture with regressive dense upsampling convolution (rDUC) and recently proposed hybrid dilated convolution (HDC) to generate pixel-level prediction for skeleton extraction. We evaluate our method on character images synthesized from the online handwritten dataset CASIA-OLHWDB and achieve higher accuracy of skeleton pixel detection than traditional thinning algorithms. We also conduct skeleton based character recognition experiments using convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers on offline/online handwritten datasets, and obtained comparable accuracies with recognition on original character images. This implies the skeletonization loses little shape information.
