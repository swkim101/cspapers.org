Conventional surveillance systems present video to a user from more than one camera on a single display. Such a display allows the user to observe different part of the scene, or the same part of the scene from different viewpoints. With the growing number of surveillance cameras set up and the expanse of surveillance area, the conventional split-screen display approach cannot provide intuitive correspondence between the images acquired and the areas under surveillance. In view of this, the “Immersive Surveillance for Total Situational Awareness” is proposed. The System uses computer graphic technique to construct 3D model of buildings on the 2D satellite-images, the users can construct the floor platform by defining the information of each floor or building and the position of each camera. This information is combined to construct 3D surveillance scene, and the images acquired by surveillance cameras are pasted into the constructed 3D model to provide intuitively visual presentation. All image sequences acquired by each camera are analyzed to extract the foreground salient objects and use it to draw out the trajectory of each person in every camera's field of view on the 3D surveillance scene. Users can also walk through the scene by a fixed-frequency, self-defined business model to perform a virtual surveillance. The System also enhances the dark area of nighttime images, and maintains the saturation information of each moving object.
