An analysis of the Cray-1S architecture based on dataflow graphs is presented. The approach consists of representing the components of a Cray-1S system as the nodes of a dataflow graph and the interconnections between the components as the arcs of the dataflow graph. The elapsed time and the resources used in a component are represented by the attributes of the node corresponding to the component. The resulting dataflow graph model is simulated to obtain timing statistics using as input a control stream that represents the instruction and data stream of the real computer system.
 The Cray-1S architecture is analyzed by conducting several experiments with the model. It is observed that the architecture is a well balanced one and performance improvements are hard to achieve without major changes. Significant improvement in performance is shown when parallel instruction issue is allowed with multiple CIP/LIPs in the architecture.
