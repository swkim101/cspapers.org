In this paper, the issue of computing a good estimate of the value set of a characteristic polynomial f(s, q) is addressed, where q denotes a vector of uncertain parameters belonging to a box and f is a multi-linear function of q. If f(s, p) is a totally decomposed expression, then a good estimate of the value set can be computed very fast by using non-convex polygon interval arithmetic. In this paper, an efficient method to compute good estimate of the value set is proposed when f is not a totally decomposed expression
