In the last twenty years, the development of application software has moved beyond the capabilities of the individual programmer and is now widely viewed as an engineering activity. This view is reinforced by the advent of “software factories, ” the recent interest by government and industry in software process improvement, and the strategic importance of good engineering practice in the development of large complex computer systems. Employers of computer science majors, however, express serious concerns about recent graduates: a lack of relevant and practical competencies; the inability to work as part of a team; and little perspective about the human, economic, and managerial issues involved in software development needs. Peter Denning [1] summarizes the problems associated with current engineering education:
