This paper presents a new methodology for formal logic verification for combinational circuits. Specifically, a structural approach is used, based on indirect implications derived by using Recursive Learning. This is extended to formulate a hybrid approach where this structural method is used to reduce the complexity of a subsequent functional method based on OBDDs. It is demonstrated how OBDD-based verification can take great advantage of structural preprocessing in a synthesis environment. The experimental results show the effective compromise achieved between memory-efficient structural methods and functional methods. One more advantage of these methods lies in the fact that resources that go into logic synthesis can effectively be reused for verification purposes.
