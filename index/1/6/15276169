We consider the following problem in proving observational congruences in functional languages: given a call-by-name language based on the simply-typed λ-calculus with algebraic operations axiomatized by algebraic equations E, is the set of observational congruences between terms exactly those provable from (β), (&eegr;), and E? We find conditions for determining whether β&eegr;E-equational reasoning is complete for proving the observational congruences between such terms. We demonstrate the power and generality of the theorems by presenting a number of easy corollaries for particular algebras.
