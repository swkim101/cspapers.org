The problem of concept learning, or forming a general description of a class of objects given a set of examples and non-examples, is viewed here as a search problem. Existing programs that generalize from examples are characterized in terms of the classes of search strategies that they employ. Several classes of search strategies are then analyzed and compared in terms of their relative capabilities and computational complexities.
