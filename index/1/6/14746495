Most existing work suffers from curse of dimensionality and encounters with the difficulty of generalization. In this paper, we develop an approximate dynamic programing method of synergistically combining the Lowner-John ellipsoid approximation with conventional value function iteration to quantify the associated optimal trading policy. Through constructing Lowner-John ellipsoids to parameterize the optimal policy and taking Euclidean projections onto the constructed ellipsoids to implement the trading policy, the proposed algorithm has cut computational costs up to a factor of five hundred and meanwhile achieved near-optimal risk-adjusted returns across both synthetic and real-world market datasets.
