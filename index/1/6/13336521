PLEASE workshop series focuses on exploring the present and the future of Software Product Line Engineering techniques. The main goal of PLEASE 2011 is to bring together industrial practitioner and software product line researchers in order to couple real-life industrial problems with concrete solutions developed by the community. We plan for an interactive workshop, where participants can apply their expertise to current industrial problems, while those who face challenges in the area of product line engineering can benefit from the suggested solutions. We also intend to establish ongoing, long-lasting relationships between industrial and research participants to the mutual benefits of both. The second edition of PLEASE is held in conjunction with the 33rd International Conference in Software Engineering (May 21-28, 2011, Honolulu, Hawaii).
