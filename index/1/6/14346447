This paper presents a nonlinear control approach for quadrotor Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), which combines a backstepping-like regulator based on the solution of a certain class of global output regulation problems for the rigid body equations on SO(3), a robust controller for the system with bounded disturbances, as well as a trajectory generator using a model predictive control method. The proposed algorithm is endowed with strong convergence properties so that it allows the quadrotor MAVs to reach almost all the desired attitudes. The control approach is implemented on a high-payload-capable quadcopter with unstructured dynamics and unknown disturbances. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated through a series of experimental evaluations and comparisons with another control method on normal and aggressive trajectory tracking tasks.
