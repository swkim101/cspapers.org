The effective use of knowledge based systems technology to solve complex and real-time problems in embedded system environments requires that the performance of these systems be maximized for conventional processor architectures. This paper presents a technique for the complete compilation of knowledge bases directly into procedural code. The technique is based on determining what actions an interpretive inference engine would take with the specific knowledge base and generating only the code needed to perform those actions. This eliminates the overhead of interpreting a representation of the knowledge base and significantly improves performance. The performance gains produced by this approach will be examined using examples from the High Performance [imbedded Reasoning (HiPER) System, a prototype tool which utilizes this technology.
