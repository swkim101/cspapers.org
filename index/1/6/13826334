The web of data has seen tremendous growth recently. New forms of structured data have emerged in the form of web markup, such as schema.org and web tables. Exploiting these rich, heterogeneous and evolving data sources has become increasingly important for many different types of applications, including (federated) search, question answering and fact verification. The objective of the PROFILES & DATA:SEARCH Workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the development of data search techniques, data profiling, and dataset retrieval on the web. This includes looking at the specifics of data-centric information seeking behaviours, understanding interaction challenges in data search on the web, and analysing the cognitive processes involved in the consumption of structured data by users. At the same time, we aim to discuss technologies addressing data search including semantics, information retrieval for web data (ranking algorithms and indexing), in particular in the context of decentralised and distributed systems, such as the web. We are interested in approaches to analyse, characterise and discover data sources. We want to facilitate a discussion around data search across formats and domain-specific applications. The PROFILES & DATA:SEARCH Workshop includes papers on a variety of topics such as profiling and data search, including querying and searching for structured data, profiling applications for cultural heritage, as well as data quality improvements through schema inference, content analysis and communities.
