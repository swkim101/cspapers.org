In this paper, we present a novel integrated bio cell processor to handle individual embryo cells. Its functions are composed of transporting, isolation, orientation, and immobilization of cells. These functions are essential for biomanipulation of single cells, and have been typically carried out by a proficient operator. The purpose of this study is the automation of these functions for effective cell manipulation using a MEMS based bio cell processor. This device is realized with relatively simple design and fabrication process. To transport cells, microfluidic channel is employed. The isolation of a cell is performed by actuation of polypyrrole (PPy) valves. The orientation control of cells is accomplished by dielectrophoresis (DEP). By the suction from the micro-hole, the target embryo cell is immobilized. Experimental results show that this device can substitute the essential but very tiresome and repeatable embryo cell manipulation and contribute significantly to the improvement of speed and success rate of operation by facilitating the cell manipulation. The cell viability test for the device is studied through the distribution of mitochondria in mouse (B6CBA) embryo cells and cultivation of cells for 86 h after cell was manipulated by DEP.
