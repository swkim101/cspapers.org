Nowadays, the number of flexible and fast human to application system interactions is dramatically increasing. For instance, citizens interact with the help of the internet to organize surveys or meetings (in real-time) spontaneously. These interactions are supported by technologies and application systems such as free wireless networks, web -or mobile apps. Smart Cities aim at enabling their citizens to use these digital services, e.g., by providing enhanced networks and application infrastructures maintained by the public administration. However, looking beyond technology, there is still a significant lack of interaction and support between "normal" citizens and the public administration. For instance, democratic decision processes (e.g. how to allocate public disposable budgets) are often discussed by the public administration without citizen involvement. This paper introduces an approach, which describes the design of enhanced interactional web applications for Smart Cities based on dialogical logic process patterns. We demonstrate the approach with the help of a budgeting scenario as well as a summary and outlook on further research.
