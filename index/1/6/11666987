Sniff is a pragmatic C++ programming environment which has beenimplemented during the last fifteen months. Sniff is implemented inC++ with the ET++ application framework. It runs on a large numberof UNIX workstations under several window management systems suchas OSF-Motif, OpenWindows, and Sunview. Sniff is an openenvironment providing browsing, cross-referencing, designvisualization, documentation, and editing support. It delegatescompilation and debugging to any C++ compiler and debugger ofchoice. Sniff has been in internal use at UBS (Union Bank ofSwitzerland) since August 1991. Since then several developers haveapplied Sniff in developing non- trivial software systems as wellas in evolving Sniff. Public domain distribution off Sniff willcommenced in May 1992.
The main goal in developing Sniff was to create an efficientportable C++ programming environment which makes it possible toedit and browse large software systems textually and graphicallywith a high degree of comfort, without wasting huge amounts of RAMor slowing down in an annoying way. A further goal was to achieveapplicable results within one person year.
