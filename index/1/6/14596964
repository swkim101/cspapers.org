Management of a modern enterprise is based on the assumption that executive reports of lower-layer management are faithful to what is actually happening in the field. As some well-publicised major recent disasters (such as Barings, AllFirst-Allied Irish Bank, ENRON, Societ√© Generale) have shown, this assumption is not well-founded. Intermediate managers can misrepresent the actual state of their systems in order to hide negative events or to "doctor" reports which have been already produced. Existing security approaches which guarantee integrity of logs and related reports do not protect the system against these threats, if they are directly applied to a multi-layered corporate structure. In this paper, we extend existing approaches by constructing a logging scheme which ensures that, at each level, logs are both correct and consistent.
