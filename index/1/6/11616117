This paper presents the control architecture and preliminary experimental results of a high performance parallel robot used for ankle rehabilitation. The goal of this work was to design suitable control algorithms for diagnostic, training and rehabilitation of the ankle in presence of musculoskeletal injuries. A position control scheme is used for patient-passive exercises while an admittance control technique is used to perform patient-active exercises with and without motion assistance. The design of the control algorithms is based on the analysis of the rehabilitation protocol taking into account the dynamics of the system and the dynamics of the interaction between the human and the robot. Electromyographic (EMG) signals are used to evaluate patient's effort during training/exercising. The results indicate the great potential of the rehabilitation device as a tool to fasten and improve the ankle therapies outcome.
