This paper examines the notion of symmetry in Markov decision processes (MDPs). We define symmetry for an MDP and show how it can be exploited for more effective learning in single agent systems as well as multiagent systems and multirobot systems. We prove that if an MDP possesses a symmetry, then the optimal value function andQ function are similarly symmetric and there exists a symmetric optimal policy. If an MDP is known to possess a symmetry, this knowledge can be applied to decrease the number of training examples needed for algorithms like Q learning and value iteration. It can also be used to directly restrict the hypothesis space.
