A one dimensional model of primate smooth pursuit mechanism has been implemented in 2 μm CMOS VLSI. The scheme consolidates Robinson’s negative feedback model with Wyatt and Pola’s positive feedback scheme, to produce a smooth pursuit system which zeroes the velocity of a target on the retina. Furthermore, the system uses the current eye motion as a predictor for future target motion. Analysis, stability and biological correspondence of the system are discussed. For implementation at the focal plane, a local correlation based visual motion detection technique is used. Velocity measurements, ranging over 4 orders of magnitude with < 15% variation, provides the input to the smooth pursuit system. The system performed successful velocity tracking for high contrast scenes. Circuit design and performance of the complete smooth pursuit system are presented.
