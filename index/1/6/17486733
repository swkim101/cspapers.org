We explain how Executable Use Cases (EUCs) constitute links between application domain requirements and machine specifications. As example, we use an EUC describing the hospital work process medicine administration and its proposed support by a new pervasive health care system. The EUC is based on a generalised state machine in the form of a Coloured Petri Nets model. We demonstrate how the EUC supports investigation of whether a specification of a machine satisfies the usersâ€™ requirements.
