The Luminescent Tentacles system is a scalable kinetic surface system for kinetic art, ambient display, and animatronics. The 256 shape-memory alloy actuators react to hand movement by fluid dynamics and Kinect. These actuators behave like waving tentacles of sea anemones under the sea, and the top of the actuator softly glows like a bioluminescent organism. To precisely control a large number of actuators simultaneously, the system utilizes one microcontroller per actuator for distributed processing. In addition, it provides a scalable platform, which can be easily built into various forms.
