Algorithm Visualizations (AVs) have been used for years as an interactive method to convey data structures and algorithms concepts. However, AVs have traditionally focused on illustrating the mechanics of how an algorithm works. We have developed visualizations that we name Algorithm Analysis Visualizations (AAVs), that focus on conveying algorithm analysis concepts. We present our findings from an initial evaluation study of the effectiveness of AAVs when applied to a semester long Data Structures course. AAVs were evaluated in terms of student engagement, student satisfaction, and student performance. Results indicate that the intervention group students spent significantly more time with the AAVs than did the control group students who used primarily textual content. Students gave positive feedback regarding the usefulness of the AAVs in illustrating algorithm analysis concepts. Students from the intervention group had better performance on the algorithm analysis part of the final exam than did control group students.
