In this paper, formal semantics of program constructs are defined by predicate transformer introduced by Dijkstra [3,4]. A predicate transformer is a mapping which transforms a set of states after the execution of a program to the set of all possible states before the execution of the same program. Thus, the concept of determinism no longer has its significance in this semantic context. Rather, the focus is on the nature of the computation, and hence the concept of iteration, and not how the program iterates, becomes a dominant concern here.
