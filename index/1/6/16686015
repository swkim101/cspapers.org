A study was conducted to evaluate user performance andsatisfaction in completion of a set of text creation tasks usingthree commercially available continuous speech recognition systems.The study also compared user performance on similar tasks usingkeyboard input. One part of the study (Initial Use) involved 24users who enrolled, received training and carried out practicetasks, and then completed a set of transcription and compositiontasks in a single session. In a parallel effort (Extended Use),four researchers used speech recognition to carry out real worktasks over 10 sessions with each of the three speech recognitionsoftware products. This paper presents results from the Initial Usephase of the study along with some preliminary results from theExtended Use phase. We present details of the kinds of usabilityand system design problems likely in current systems and severalcommon patterns of error correction that we found.
