Presumption is not a characteristic calculated to “win friends and influence people.” And it would be presumptuous - and slightly ridiculous - of anyone to present a “cost evaluation of design automation” as if the comparative costs versus achievable benefits of this broad subject could be classified in some static relationship. The costs may be real as a check on a solvent bank account, and the benefits may be just as realistic - but their relationship is far from static.
 A close analogy might be the cost/value assessment of a piece of business property. At any given moment the cost is fixed (by negotiation, to be sure), but the related value is entirely dependent upon what the buyer plans to do with it. A parking lot for automobiles places one value on it; a multi-story office building, a department store, a one-man neighborhood drug store relate different values to the same cost.
