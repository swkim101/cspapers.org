Over the past ten years, the difficulties encountered with electronic design and drafting problems have forced the engineer to rely more and more on the computer as a design aid. As are result, a new system concept, the low cost turnkey interactive graphics system has become commercially available to make the computer a more useful design tool. Systems, Science and Software of La Jolla, California has designed the MASK system for this purpose. The philosophy behind the development of the system is presented in this paper, along with a discussion of the applications of the MASK system as a design and drafting tool.
