In this paper we present a novel framework for computing the steady turning motion of a robotic fish undergoing periodic body and/or tail deformation. Taking the turning radius and the angular velocity as unknowns, we obtain the absolute motion trajectories of points on the “spinal column” of robotic fish by superimposing relative body/tail motions on the rigid body circular motion. The hydrodynamic reactive force and the resulting moment are then computed from the motion trajectories, using Lighthill's large-amplitude elongated-body theory, in terms of the two turning parameters. By integrating the dynamics of rigid body motion and averaging out oscillations, implicit equations involving the turning parameters can be established and solved. We also discuss the plan of applying the proposed framework to the modeling of steady turning maneuvers of biomimetic robotic propelled by an ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) caudal fin.
