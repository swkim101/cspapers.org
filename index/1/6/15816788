In targeted therapy, clusters of drug carriers (nanoparticles and microparticles) could be in contact with a surface such as the lumen of blood vessels and the interior of the gastrointestinal tract. We study the motion characteristics of clusters of microparticles when they slide on a surface under the influence of weak oscillating magnetic fields (less than 11 mT). The oscillating magnetic fields exert a magnetic torque on the microparticles and allow them to oscillate, and hence overcome the static friction and slide on a surface. We characterize the frequency response of clusters of microparticles by applying oscillating magnetic fields with a frequency range of 0 Hz to 55 Hz, in the presence of a constant magnetic field gradient (0.9 T/m). Clusters of 3 to 4 and 5 to 9 microparticles achieve maximum sliding speeds of 1100 μm/s and 1150 μm/s, at oscillating magnetic fields of 30 Hz. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate closed-loop motion control of the clusters with maximum position error of 20 μm. Furthermore, we show that the magnetic field gradient required to drive a cluster of microparticles (with 3 to 4 microparticles) decreases by 75% in the presence of oscillating magnetic fields from 5 Hz to 50 Hz.
