We consider the stochastic Steiner forest problem: suppose we were given a collection of Steiner forest instances, and were guaranteed that a random one of these instances would appear tomorrow; moreover, the cost of edges tomorrow will be Î» times the cost of edges today. Which edges should we buy today so that we can extend it to a solution for the instance arriving tomorrow, to minimize the expected total cost? While very general results have been developed for many problems in stochastic discrete optimization over the past years, the approximation status of the stochastic Steiner Forest problem has remained open, with previous works yielding constant-factor approximations only for special cases. We resolve the status of this problem by giving a constant-factor primal-dual based approximation algorithm.
