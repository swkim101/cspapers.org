The availability of user check-in data in large volume from the rapid growing location-based social networks (LBSNs) enables a number of important location-aware services. Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of such services, which is to recommend POIs that users have not visited before. It has been observed that: (i) users tend to visit nearby places, and (ii) users tend to visit different places in different time slots, and in the same time slot, users tend to periodically visit the same places. For example, users usually visit a restaurant during lunch hours, and visit a pub at night. In this paper, we focus on the problem of time-aware POI recommendation, which aims at recommending a list of POIs for a user to visit at a given time. To exploit both geographical and temporal influences in time aware POI recommendation, we propose the Geographical-Temporal influences Aware Graph (GTAG) to model check-in records, geographical influence and temporal influence. For effective and efficient recommendation based on GTAG, we develop a preference propagation algorithm named Breadth first Preference Propagation (BPP). The algorithm follows a relaxed breath-first search strategy, and returns recommendation results within at most 6 propagation steps. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the proposed graph-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art POI recommendation methods substantially.
