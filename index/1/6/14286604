The Interactive Computer Graphics System for Machined Part Design and NC Tape Generation, CGS-1, was developed as an educational tool. Its primary objective is to introduce computer graphics to students in the Penn State two year Associate Degree program in Drafting and Design Technology. Both computers and computer graphics are being extensively utilized in the engineering profession and promise to take on even greater importance in the future. Since the students will be highly involved with graphics, the College Administration felt they should gain an appreciation of the capabilities inherent in computer graphics. This introduction will demonstrate computer assisted design techniques and provide a limited amount of hands-on-experience. The educational benefit will be the knowledge that graphics systems are currently available and will include a limited understanding of computer graphics.
 A second major objective is to provide feedback information to the people involved in educational systems design. The areas of computer assisted instruction and interactive computer graphics are both relatively new and this experience is necessary for the development of effective educational tools.
