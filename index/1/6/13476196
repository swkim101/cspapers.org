To demonstrate more advanced topics we have changed the focus of our graphics assignments in our upper division C.S. majors course from strictly programming basic algorithms to working in existing software packages. In addition to three standard programming assignments in Pascal or C the students perform experiments and develop designs with L-grammar, fractal generator, morph, ray-tracing, and animation packages. Excellent and inexpensive versions of all these systems are available through shareware or freeware. The student response has been overwhelmingly positive.
