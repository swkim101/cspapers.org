A high performance information filtering system has three mainrequirements: it must be effective in supplying users with usefulinformation, it must do so in a timely fashion, and it must be ableto handle a large throughput of information and a large number ofuser profiles efficiently. These three requirements pose adifficult problem, and to our knowledge no existing system iscapable of meeting all three. In this paper we describe a systemwhich combines a number of techniques from other informationretrieval and filtering systems, and is capable of providing highperformance on a typical workstation platform. We provide estimatesof computing resource usage, and show that our system is alsoscalable.
