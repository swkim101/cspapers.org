A new approach to artificial muscle actuators assimilating the morphological and kinesiological structure of biological muscles is presented and is implemented using shape memory alloys. Like a biological muscle consisting of short muscle fibers arranged in an overlapping series, an array of SMA actuators are segmented into many independently controlled, spatially discrete volumes, each contributing a small displacement to create a large motion. Furthermore, the segmented architecture of SMA wires is extended to a multi-axis actuator array by arranging them in a two-dimensional array. The multi-axis control is streamlined and coordinated using a two-dimensional segmentation method in order to activate multiple bones (links) of a skeletal robot structure in a coordinated manner. Moreover, the 2-D segmentation is so designed that coordinated gross motion as well as independent fine movements may be generated with minimum complexity and minimum control loops.
