Congestion control is an important mechanism in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we discuss congestion control and the traffic-aware problem for sensor nodes in WSNs. Congestion may cause serious problems such as packet loss, the consumption of power, and low network throughput for sensor nodes. Hence, we propose a distributed congestion control protocol called traffic-aware congestion control protocol (TACCP). Through the buffer management mechanism, the TACCP can avoid packet loss because of traffic congestion, reduce the power consumption of nodes, and improve the network throughput. Experimental results show that the proposed TACCP can effectively improve network performance.
