Conventional high-performance processors utilize register renaming and complex broadcast-based scheduling logic to steer instructions into a small number of heavily-pipelined execution lanes. This requires multiple complex structures and repeated dependency resolution, imposing a significant dynamic power overhead. This paper advocates in-place execution of instructions, a power-saving, pipeline-free approach that consolidates rename, issue, and bypass logic into one structure - the CRIB - while simultaneously eliminating the need for a multiported register file, instead storing architected state in a simple rank of latches. CRIB achieves the high IPC of an out-of-order machine while keeping the execution core clean, simple, and low power. The datapath within a CRIB structure is purely combinational, eliminating most of the clocked elements in the core while keeping a fully synchronous yet high-frequency design. Experimental results match the IPC and cycle time of a baseline outof- order design while reducing dynamic energy consumption by more than 60% in affected structures.
