In this paper, we report on our experience on the development of La Hilandera, an e-commerce site selling haberdashery products and craft supplies in Europe. The store has a huge input space where customers can place almost three millions of different orders which made testing an extremely difficult task. To address the challenge, we explored the applicability of some of the practices for variability management in software product lines. First, we used a feature model to represent the store input space which provided us with a variability view easy to understand, share and discuss with all the stakeholders. Second, we used techniques for the automated analysis of feature models for the detection and repair of inconsistent and missing configuration settings. Finally, we used test selection and prioritization techniques for the generation of a manageable and effective set of test cases. Our findings, summarized in a set of lessons learnt, suggest that variability techniques could successfully address many of the challenges found when developing e-commerce sites.
