This paper presents a technique for tracking road edges in a panoramic image sequence. The major contribution is that instead of unwarping the image to find parallel lines representing the road edges, we choose to warp the parallel groundplane lines into the image plane of the equiangular panospheric camera. Updating the parameters of the line thus involves searching a very small number of pixels in the panoramic image, requiring considerably less computation than unwarping. Results using real-world images, including shadows, intersections and curves, are presented.
