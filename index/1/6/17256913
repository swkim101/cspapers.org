Interoperability is key to widespread adoption of sensor network technology, but interoperable systems have traditionally been difficult to develop and test. We demonstrate an interoperable system development and performance diagnosis environment in which different systems, different software, and different hardware can be simulated in a single network configuration. This allows both development, verification, and performance diagnosis of interoperable systems. Estimating the performance is important since even when systems interoperate, the performance can be sub-optimal, as shown in our companion paper that has been conditionally accepted for SenSys 2011.
