Numerical databases arise in many scientific applications to keep track of large sparse and dense matrices. Unlike the many matrix data storage techniques available for incore manipulation, very large matrices are currently limited to a few compact storage schemes on secondary devices, due to the complex underlying data management facilities. This paper presents a model of an approach to numerical database management system that provides generalized facility for promoting physical data independence by relieving users from the need for knowledge of the physical data organization on the secondary devices.Each of the storage techniques for dense and sparse matrices is described by a physical schema and the tools for any numerical database description, mapping to storage and data access are provided by data language facilities. The feasibility of the model with regard to our prototype implementation of a generalized numerical database translator is also discussed.
