Our goals are to review the evolution of curriculum developmen~ examine alternative curricular approaches, and explore new trends in the design of introductory computer science courses. We review the historical evolution of introductory computer science curricula, including Curriculum 68 and 78, the Liberrd Arts Model Curriculum of 1986, the Deming committeeâ€™s comprehensive (broad) approach in 1989, and the implementation of this approach in the recent report Computing Curricula 1991. Alternative approaches to introductory curriculum development are presented in terms of dichotomies such as depth versus breadth, single vemus multiple paradigm, conceptual versus pmctical, and active versus passive learning. The role of programming, mathematics, laboratories, and visualization in the curriculum is examined, We then focus more specifically on the goals and scope of specitlc approaches to the introductory courses, examining the role of introductory computer science within the technical and social context of the discipline as a whole.
