This paper presents the characterization in terms of force and displacement of a new interpenetrated network conductive polymer (IPN-CP) to be used as an actuator that works in air conditions. This last property opens many potential applications in robotics, bionics, haptics interface technology (namely tactile feedback devices), etc. Different experimental investigations show that the proposed actuator exhibits acceptable force behavior and capabilities (relatively to its size and mass) when classical solvents are used. However, IPN-CP with ionic liquid solvents show poor capabilities. Since ionic solvents guarantee long life usability, we found it somehow disappointing namely for robotic applications. We give some explanations for that, but we believe that this drawback could mid solutions in the near future.
