We are pursuing the detection of runways in aerial images as part of a project to automatically map complex cultural areas such as a major commercial airport complex. This task is much more difficult that appears at first. _ We use a hypothesize and test paradigm. Hypotheses are formed by looking for instances of long rectangular shapes, possibly interrupted by other long rectangles. We use runway markings, mandated by standards for runway construction, to verify our hypotheses.
