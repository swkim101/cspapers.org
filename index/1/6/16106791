This paper describes an asynchronous circuit switching network for multiple-processor systems. Several circuit switching networks for various applications have been proposed and constructed. However, there are problems associated with these networks. The asynchronous circuit switching network possesses several features that can solve these problems. A three-stage fully connected topology is utilized to construct the network. Each switching element is functionally and physically identical and this facilitates a cost-effective LSI implementation and software development. The control structure of the switching element and the routing algorithm are re-organized to fit the asynchronous operation. The network takes advantage of low-cost microcomputers to do the distributed routing control and to implement the communication protocols. The graceful degradation characteristic in the network is provided by independent multiple paths existing between any pair of the source and the destination. A network monitor is incorporated to facilitate an adaptive routing strategy and to have the fault diagnostic capability. Three alternatives for the switching element implementation are described to demonstrate the hardware and software tradeoffs.
