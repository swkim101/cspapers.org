The increasing emphasis on software engineering in the computer science curricula directly correlates with the expansion of the area of software engineering. The increased occurrence of software engineering courses has produced significant discrepancies in the content of the courses at the undergraduate level. These discrepancies have percipitated the need for recommendations for the inclusion of software engineering in the curriculum. The recommendations presented in this paper include both the integration of software engineering principles throughout the undergraduate curriculum and the content of a separate software engineering course. The recommendations for course content are based on a survey of the contents of recently published software engineering textbooks.
