A force-feedback actuation loop for a steer-by-wire vehicle is developed. It is shown that the performance of this loop can be essentially improved by the introduction of a torque sensor. Model reference based control algorithms based on disturbance observer (DOB) and active observers (AOB) are applied to enhance the robustness vs. non-modelled dynamics and uncertain driver impedance.
