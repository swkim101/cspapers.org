The smartphone has become an important part of our daily lives. However, the user experience is still far from being optimal. In particular, despite the rapid hardware upgrades, current smartphones often suffer various unpredictable delays during operation, e.g., when launching an application, leading to poor user experience. This video features our study of storage impact on smartphone application delay. We conduct the first large-scale measurement study on the I/O delay of Android using the data collected from our application running on 1009 devices within 130 days. We observe that Android devices spend up to 58% of their CPU active time waiting for storage I/Os to complete. This negatively affects the smartphone's overall application performance, and results in slow response time. Further investigation, among others, reveals that reads experience up to a 626% slowdown in the presence of concurrent writes. The obtained knowledge is used to design and implement a system called SmartIO that reduces the application delay by prioritizing reads over writes, and grouping them based on assigned priorities. SmartIO is implemented on the Android platform and evaluated extensively on several groups of popular applications. The results from the 20 researched applications demonstrate that SmartIO reduces launch delays by up to 37.8%, and run-time delays by up to 29.6%.
