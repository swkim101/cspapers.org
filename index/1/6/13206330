Every year, the SIGMOD Conference includes an exciting symposium addressing various aspects of a career in the data management community. These symposia are geared towards graduate students and junior researchers, but they attract a very broad audience because they are both informative and entertaining. This year, the symposium consists of two panels: “Dos and Don’ts for a Successful Job Search”, and “Good Papers and Good Research”. Each panel has four panelists and each panelist gives a 10-minute presentation based on their personal experiences and perspectives gained over the years. After the presentations, an informal discussion ensues, where questions are welcomed from the audience.
