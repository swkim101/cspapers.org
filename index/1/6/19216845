Nowadays it is common the construction of English understanding systems (interfaces) that sooner or later one has to re-use, adapting and converting them to other natural languages. This is not an easy task and in many cases the arisen problems are quite complex. In this paper an experiment that was accomplished for Portuguese language is reported and some conclusions are explicitely stated. A know ledge information processing system, known as SSIPA, with natural language comprehension capabilities that interacts with users in Protuguese through a Portuguese interface, LUSO, was built. Logic was used as a mental aid and as a practical tool.
