This paper describes a system for electronic voting in the classroom based on mobile devices. There is no need for special hardware. Cellular telephones or iPods with access to the Internet can be used for electronic polling. The system is so flexible, that the questions can be handwritten on the blackboard, on the spot, then generating automatically a web address which can be accessed with the voting device. Electronic voting can be started spontaneously without tedious preparations. This approach can be seamlessly integrated in E-Chalk, our electronic classroom software.
