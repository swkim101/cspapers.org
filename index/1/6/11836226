Uncertainty about a product can act as a barrier to purchase. The more confident a customer is about a product, the more likely she is to purchase it. Online shopping websites provide an array of tools and information to support decision-making (e.g., product comparison, ratings, reviews, etc.). In contrast, few tools are available in physical stores to help customers navigate the decision process. We have developed a mobile application prototype to support the purchase decision process in the store. At the core of the experience is the use of social profile data as a form of context to provide a tailored experience aimed at reducing customer uncertainty.
