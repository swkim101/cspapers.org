The paper introduces a dependency-based grammar and the associated parser and focusses on the problem of determinism in parsing and recovery from errors. First, it is shown how dependency-based parsing can be afforded, by taking into account the suggestions coming from other approaches, and the preference criteria for parsing are breifly addressed. Second, the issues of the interconnection between the syntactic analysis and the semantic interpretation in incremental processing are discussed and the adoption of a TMS for the recovery of the processing errors is suggested.
