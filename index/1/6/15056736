Personal Orchestra is the first system to let users conduct an actual audio and video recording of an orchestra, using an infrared baton to control tempo, volume, and instrument sections. A gesture recognition algorithm interprets user input, and a novel high-fidelity playback algorithm renders audio and video data at variable speed without time-stretching artifacts. The system is installed as a public exhibit in the HOUSE OF MUSIC VIENNA.
