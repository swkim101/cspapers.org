It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the BIG Web Track of the Web Conference 2018. Many of today's most successful enterprises in business and in science are built on the collection and analysis of data. The sheer volume and richness of these data sets has stimulated a massive wave of innovation. In addition, this revolution has also sparked important debate on data privacy policies, ethics, and governance. This track started as a co-located event called BigData Innovators Gathering (BIG) with a vision to bring together academic and industry leaders in the Big Data space to share the state of the art and its successful applications in business. This event will be co-located with the Web conference for the fifth time, but now as a fully fledged alternate track named The BIG Web in The Web Conference 2018 in Lyon. This year's track consists of two keynotes, a panel on machine learning in the field of medicine, and 11 invited talks. In addition, we have accepted 6 papers from 35 submissions (with an acceptance ratio of 17%).
