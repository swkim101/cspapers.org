This video highlights our system that enables a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) to autonomously explore and map unstructured and unknown GPS-denied environments. While mapping and exploration solutions are now well-established for ground vehicles, air vehicles face unique challenges which have hindered the development of similar capabilities. Although there has been recent progress toward sensing, control, and navigation techniques for GPS-denied flight, there have been few demonstrations of stable, goal-directed flight in real-world environments. Our system leverages a multi-level sensing and control hierarchy that matches the computational complexity of the component algorithms with the real-time needs of a MAV to achieve autonomy in unconstrained environments.
