The drive to move sensor network research from theory to de-ployment has dramatically increased interest in sensor network test-bed design. Such testbeds have the goal of supporting rapid de-ployment of protocols on real hardware without requiring the useof specialized sensor networks each time. The key challenges tomeeting this goal include providing realistic environments for test-ing the protocols (i.e., indoor testbeds may not approximate out-door deployments accurately) and having a simple programmingand experimentation interface. If the testbeds do not provide re-alistic environments for the testing of protocols, they may fail tobridge the gap between simulation and deployment and if they arenot easy to use and maintain, they could end up stiﬂing resear chrather than augmenting it.The SignetLab demonstration shows two fundamental contribu-tions. First, we present our deployable testbed. A critical featureof the SignetLab testbed is the ability to rapidly deploy it in a num-ber of scenarios (e.g., inside a lab or outdoors). This allows pro-tocols to be tested in environments that are very similar to actualdeployment scenarios. To facilitate this deployability, we have im-plemented a novel in-network programming module to accuratelyand efﬁciently program nodes while they are deployed. A key d if-ference between our in-network programming module and previouswork [7, 9] is the built-in reliability mechanism that accurately pro-grams all nodes in the network, via multihop wireless links. Sec-ond, we present our testbed management and visualization tool.This tool provides the programming interface tothe network aswellas the data visualization module. Through the tool, nodes can bemanaged at a ﬁne-grained level, giving researchers the necessarycontrol to perform a large variety of experiments.
