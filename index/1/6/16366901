Nowadays, huge volumes of data are organized or exported in a tree-structured form. Querying capabilities are provided through queries that are based on branching path expression. Even for a single knowledge domain structural differences raise difficulties for querying data sources in a uniform way. In this paper, we present a method for semantically querying tree-structured data sources using partially specified tree patterns. Based on dimensions which are sets of semantically related nodes in tree structures, we define dimension graphs. Dimension graphs can be automatically extracted from trees and abstract their structural information. They are semantically rich constructs that support the formulation of queries and their efficient evaluation. We design a tree-pattern query language to query multiple tree-structured data sources. A central feature of this language is that the structure can be specified fully, partially, or not at all in the queries. Therefore, it can be used to query multiple trees with structural differences. %and We study the derivation of structural expressions in queries by introducing a set of inference rules for structural expressions. We define two types of query unsatisfiability and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for checking each of them. Our approach is validated through experimental evaluation.
