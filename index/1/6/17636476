The High Dependability Computing Program (HDCP) project is a NASA initiative for increasing dependability of software-based systems. It researches achieving high dependability by introducing new technologies. We focus on the evaluation of the effectiveness of technologies with respect to dependability. We employ empirical evaluation methods along with evaluation testbeds. In this paper, our technology evaluation approach is described. A testbed representative of air traffic control applications is used. An experiment to evaluate a technology to for identification of architectural violations is presented.
