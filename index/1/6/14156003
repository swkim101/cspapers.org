Automated unit test generation bears the promise of significantly reducing test cost and hence improving software quality. However, the maintenance cost of the automatically generated tests presents a significant barrier to adoption of this technology. To address this challenge, we propose a novel technique for automated and fine-grained incremental generation of unit tests through minimal augmentation of an existing test suite. The technique uses iterative, incremental refinement of test-drivers and symbolic execution, guided by a diagnostics engine. The diagnostics engine works off a novel precise and efficient byte-level dynamic dependence analysis built using Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs). We present a tool FSX implementing this technique and evaluate it under two practical use-cases of incremental unit test generation, on five revisions of the open-source software iPerf, as well as on 3 large subjects, comprising more than 60 thousand lines of code, from in-house commercial network products. The evaluation shows that FSX can generate high-quality unit tests on large industrial software while minimizing the maintenance cost of the overall test-suite.
