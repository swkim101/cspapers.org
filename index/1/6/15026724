A problem associated with motion planning for the assembly of individual modules in a new self-reconfigurable modular robotic system is presented. Modules of the system are independently mobile and can be driven on flat surfaces in a similar fashion to the classic kinematic cart. This problem differs from most nonholonomic steering problems because of an added constraint on one of the internal states. The constraint properly aligns the docking mechanism, allowing modules to connect with one another along wheel surfaces. This paper presents an initial method for generating trajectories and control inputs that allow module assembly. It also provides an iterative method for locally optimizing a nominal control function using weighted perturbation functions, while preserving the final pose and internal states.
