Delivery of web content is increasingly using dynamic and personalized content. Caching has been extensively studied for reducing the client latency and bandwidth requirements for static content. There has been recent interest in schemes to exploit locality in dynamic web content [1, 2]. We propose a novel scheme that integrates the distribution and caching of personalized content which rely heavily on dynamic generation of content. In the proposed architecture, resource intensive processes involved in content generation are pushed to the network edges. We have performed a preliminary evaluation of the architecture under real world network conditions and have noticed significant improvements in bandwidth consumption, user response time and server scalability showing the feasibility of such a scheme.
