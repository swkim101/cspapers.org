In this paper, we examine the performance tradeoffs that are raised by caching data in the client workstations of a client-server DBMS. We begin by presenting a range of lock-based cache consistency algorithms that arise by viewing cache consistency as a v~iant of the well-understood problem of replicated data management. We then use a detailed simulation model to study the performance of these algorithm over a wide range of workloads end system resource configurations. The results illustrate the key performance tradeoffs related to clientserver cache consistency, and should be of use to designers of next-generation DBMS prototypes and products.
