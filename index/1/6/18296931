With the help of the computer, we have shown that in any coloring with two colors of the triangles on a set of 13 points there must exist a monochromatic tetrahedron. This proves the new upper bound R (4,4; 3)s13. The previous best upper bound of 15 was derived independently by Giraud (1969 [21), Schwenk (1978 [51) and Sidorenko (1980 [61). The first construction of a R (4,4; 3)-good hypergraph on 12 points was presented by Isbell (1969 [3]), and the same one again more elegantly by Sidorenko (1980 [6]). We have constructed more than 200,000 R (4,4;3)-good hypergraphs on 12 points, but probably not the full set. R (4,4; 3)=13 is the first known exact value of a classical Ramsey number for hypergraphs.
