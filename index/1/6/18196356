Accuracy in program error prediction is a major problem in quality control of a large-scale software system. This paper presents a model to estimate the number of errors remaining in a program at the beginning of the testing phase of development. Ten hypothesized environmental factors are statistically analyzed and the model is then derived by using the factors significantly identified in the analysis. This empirical study was done with data collected during the development of large-scale software systems. Results of the study indicate that factors such as frequency of program specification change, programmer's skill, and volume of program design document are significant and that the model based on these factors is more reliable than conventional error prediction methods based on program size alone.
