In this paper a novel type of tracking controller for flexible joint robots is proposed. Joint elasticity is considered unknown and may be time varying. Robot and motor dynamics are also considered unknown. The controller guarantees link position performance specifications that have been a-priori set utilizing full state feedback. Simulation on a two link flexible joint robot validate the efficiency of the proposed control approach.
