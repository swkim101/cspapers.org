This paper addresses the problem of cooperative aerial transportation of an object using a team of quadrotors. The approach presented to solve this problem accounts for the full dynamics of the system and it is inspired by the literature on reconfigurable cable-driven parallel robots (RCDPR). Using the modelling convention of RCDPR it is derived a direct relation between the motion of the quadrotors and the motion of the payload. This relation makes explicit the available internal motion of the system, which can be used to automatically achieve additional tasks. The proposed method does not require to specify a priory the forces in the cables and uses a tension distribution algorithm to optimally distribute them among the robots. The presented framework is also suitable for online teleoperation. Physical simulations with a human-in-the-loop validate the proposed approach.
