In this paper a novel decentralized approach for task sequencing within a multiple missions control framework is presented. The main contribution of this work concerns the decentralization of a control framework for multiple mission execution in order to enhance the robustness of the system, and the application of the latter to a heterogeneous robotic network. The proposed approach is based on the Matrix-based Discrete Event Framework (MDEF). This formalism is adapted to networks of heterogeneous robots, i.e., robots with different capabilities, and to the decentralized control of mission execution using a consensus-based approach which guarantees the agreement among robots on executed actions and their consequences.
