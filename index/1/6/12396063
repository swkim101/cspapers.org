This paper presents SMILe (Self-Motivated Incremental Learning), an intrinsically motivated learning framework in which an agent autonomously identifies interesting subgoals independently from any task prescription, and, driven by self-motivation, incrementally learns a hierarchy of more and more complex skills. Preliminary experimental activities show that learned skills can be profitably reused when the agent faces different tasks.
