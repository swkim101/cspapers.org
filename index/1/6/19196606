Because of the wide use of randomized scheduling in concurrency testing research, it is important to understand randomized scheduling and its limitations. This work analyzes how randomized scheduling discovers concurrency bugs by focusing on the probabilities of the two possible orders of a pair of events. Analysis shows that the disparity between probabilities can be large for programs that encounter a large number of events during execution. Because sets of ordered event pairs define conditions for discovering concurrency bugs, this disparity can make some concurrency bugs highly unlikely. The complementary nature of the two possible orders also indicates a potential trade-off between the probability of discovering frequently-occurring and infrequently-occurring concurrency bugs. To help address this trade-off in a more balanced way, randomized-stride scheduling is proposed, where scheduling granularity for each thread is adjusted using a randomized stride calculated based on thread length. With some assumptions, strides can be calculated to allow covering the least likely event pair orders. Experiments confirm the analysis results and also suggest that randomized-stride scheduling is more effective for discovering concurrency bugs compared to the original randomized scheduling implementation, and compared to other algorithms in recent literature.
