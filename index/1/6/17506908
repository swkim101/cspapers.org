In this paper, we present a method to qualitatively compute the global characteristics of causal graphs by the analysis of the underlying dynamical systems, rather than traditional qualitative simulations which su er from intractability and di culty in understanding their simulation results. The key idea is to translate a given causal graph into an autonomous dynamical system and to analyze equilibrium points in the system. The method requires no numerical information and it has the advantage of computing the conditions under which a certain equilibrium type holds and when equilibrium type-transitions occur. The method is rmly based on mathematical grounds, and the result is guaranteed to be valid for linear systems under the speci ed conditions.
