In this paper we present successful navigation of a mechanically linked insect moth-pair, using light-weight and low-power actuators, demonstrating insect powered micro air vehicles (MAVs). These MAVs can fly for long periods of time, consuming only a small fraction(1%) of power compared to purely mechanical MAVs. We demonstrate strategies for harnessing the high energy-density biofuel and high efficiency muscle actuators of insects using tissue-embedded and externally attached miniature insect generated momentum redirectors. Commercial off-the-shelf tail motor, a rudder that exploits flow behind the insect wings, and a steering mechanism that misaligns the thrust directions of two insects were all separately used to control yaw of the hawkmoth, Manduca Sexta, in tethered flight. Untethered flight control of two hawkmoths over 60 m was achieved using a 6 gm backpack, including a 3 gram helium balloon to keep the backpack airborne, for over 5 to 30 minutes of flight time.
