Product reviews posted at online shopping sites vary greatly in quality. This paper addresses the problem of detecting lowquality product reviews. Three types of biases in the existing evaluation standard of product reviews are discovered. To assess the quality of product reviews, a set of specifications for judging the quality of reviews is first defined. A classificationbased approach is proposed to detect the low-quality reviews. We apply the proposed approach to enhance opinion summarization in a two-stage framework. Experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively (1) discriminates lowquality reviews from high-quality ones and (2) enhances the task of opinion summarization by detecting and filtering lowquality reviews.
