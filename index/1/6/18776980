Unlike traditional text summarization and timeline generation systems, the proposed framework combines text and image analysis and delivers a storyline containing textual, pictorial, and structural information to provide a sketch of the topic evolution. A key idea in the framework is the use of an approximate solution for the dominating set problem. Given a collection of topic-related objects consisting of images and their text descriptions, a weighted multi-view graph is first constructed to capture the contextual and temporal relationships among these objects. Then the objects are selected by solving the minimum-weighted connected dominating set problem defined on this graph. Comprehensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
