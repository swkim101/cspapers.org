A simple continuous output feedback proportional-derivative (PD) plus desired gravity compensation controller is proposed to solve the global finite-time regulation of robot manipulators with position measurements only. The global finite-time convergence is proved by using Lyapunov theory and finite-time stability theory. Simulations preformed on a two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator demonstrate the expected properties of the proposed approach.
