This paper presents a basic motion-planning/feedback-control algorithm for a robot working with a human in the same workspace. With the proposed control scheme, robots can be safe and easy to use when unexpected events occur. The algorithm is based on: (1) inertia reduction, (2) passivity, and (3) parametric path planning. A preliminary simulation study is performed to show its effectiveness with a two-link manipulator.
