In this paper, a new hand exoskeleton device using a three-layered sliding spring mechanism is presented. In contrast to state of the art hand exoskeleton mechanisms (typically link, wire or pneumatically driven), the proposed mechanism is driven through large deformations of the compliant mechanism body. The mechanism can be made compact and lightweight by adequately positioning the compliant elements. In addition, the mechanism is designed to distribute 1-DOF actuated linear motion into three rotational motions of the finger joints, which translate into natural finger flexion/extension. The primary application of the proposed mechanism is to provide robotic support during physical therapy at the hospital (e.g. Continuous Passive Motion). However, thanks to its light and wearable structure, the proposed device could also be used at home as an assistive/therapeutic device to support activities of daily living. We introduce the mechanical structure of the three-layered sliding spring mechanism, present a prototype implementation as a hand exoskeleton device, and provide a preliminary evaluation.
