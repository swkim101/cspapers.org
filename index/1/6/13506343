In this paper, an original method about heavy vehicles rollover risk prediction is presented and validated experimentally. It is based on the calculation of the LTR (Load Transfer Ratio) which depends on the estimated vertical forces using high order sliding mode observers. The validation tests were carried out on an instrumented truck rolling on the road at various speeds and lane-change manoeuvres. Many scenarios have been experienced: driving on straight line, curve line and zigzag to emphasize the rollover phenomenon and its prediction to set off an alarm to the driver.
