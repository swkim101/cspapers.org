This work develops a computational model for representing and reasoning about dialogue in terms of the mutuality of belief of the conversants. We simulated cooperative dialogues at the speech act level and compared the simulations with actual dialogues between pilots and air traffic controllers engaged in real tasks. In the simulations, addressees and overhearers formed beliefs and took actions appropriate to their individual roles and contexts. The result is a computational model capable of representing the evolving context of complete real-world multiparty task-oriented conversations in the air traffic control domain.
