In active perception systems for scene recognition the utility of an observation is determined by the information gain in the probability distribution over the state space. The goal is to find a sequence of actions which maximizes the system knowledge at low resource costs. Most current approaches focus either on optimizing the determination of the payoff neglecting the costs or develop sophisticated planning strategies for simple reward models.
