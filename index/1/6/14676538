In this paper, we first characterize distributed real-time systems by the following two properties that have to be supported: best eflorl and leas2 suffering. Then, we propose a distributed real-time object model DRO which complies these properties. Based on the DRO model, we design an object oriented programming language DROL: an extension of C++ with the capa.bility of describing distributed real-time systems. The most eminent feature of DROL is that users can describe on meta level the semantics of message communications as a communication protocol with sending and receiving primitives. With this feature, we can construct a flexible distributed real-time system satisfying specifications which include timing constraints. We implement a runtime system of DROL on the ARTS kernel, and evaluate the efficiency of the prototype implementation as well as confirm the high expressive power of the language.
