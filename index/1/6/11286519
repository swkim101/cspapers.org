In this paper, we focus on some of the scientific data management problems faced by the Human Genome Project. In particular, we describe the design of an information model for the physical contig map assembly task. First, we present an object-oriented data schema that captures genomic data and their relationships required for this task, including the raw experimental data and the derived data gotten through analysis. Our genome object representation efficiently supports the maintenance of unordered, partially ordered, and completely ordered sets of data based on an overlap refinement hierarchy of interval relationships. We describe operators we have developed to automate analysis steps currently performed manually by the scientists. Examples are operators for inverting local orientation frames, for combining information in different frames into another more informative one, and for inferring additional overlap information using transitivity rules. In conclusion, we provide a walk-through example that demonstrates how our approach can be used to effectively support some of the experiments currently performed by the scientists at the Michigan Human Genome Center. “The authors are mateful to aclmowled~e Dartizd financial sum port from the NIH ;der grant NIH #PM”H&0208-03.
