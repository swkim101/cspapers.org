We observe two trends, growing wireless capability at the physical layer powered by MIMO-OFDM, and growing video traffic as the dominant application traffic. Both the source and MIMO-OFDM channel components exhibit non-uniform energy distribution. This motivates us to leverage the source data redundancy at the channel to achieve high video recovery performance. We propose ParCast that first separates the source and channel into independent components, matches the more important source components with higher-gain channel components, allocates power weights with joint consideration to the source and the channel, and uses analog modulation for transmission. Such a scheme achieves fine-grained unequal error protection across source components. We implemented ParCast in Matlab and on Sora. Extensive evaluation shows that our scheme outperforms competitive schemes by notable margins, sometimes up to 5~dB in PSNR for challenging scenarios.
