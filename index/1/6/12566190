A crucial problem for the efficient design and management of integrated services networks is how to best allocate network resources for heterogeneous and bursty traffic streams in multiplexers that support prioritized service disciplines. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for determining per-connection performance parameters such as delay-bound violation probability and loss probability in multi-service networks. The approach utilizes a traffic characterization consisting of the variances of a stream's rate distribution over multiple interval lengths, which captures its burstiness properties and autocorrelation structure. From this traffic characterization, we provide a simple and efficient resource allocation algorithm by deriving stochastic delay-bounds for static priority schedulers and employing a Gaussian approximation over intervals. To evaluate the scheme, we perform trace-driven simulation experiments with long traces of MPEG-compressed video and show that our approach is accurate enough to capture most of the inherent statistical multiplexing gain, achieving average network utilizations of up to 90% for these traces and substantially outperforming previous "effective bandwidth" techniques.
