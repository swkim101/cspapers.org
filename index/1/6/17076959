A methodology is developed for determining how much parallelism is optimal if a given job stream is to be executed without multiprogramming. Qualitative design tradeoffs are inferred from the cost-performance effect of parallelism on different hardware subsystems. Measures of software parallelism are analytically related to measures of hardware performance. It is shown that an increase in hardware parallelism may be desirable even though it causes an increase in job processing cost and/or a decrease in hardware efficiency.
