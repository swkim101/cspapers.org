This paper proposes a generic formulation that significantly expedites the training and deployment of image classification models, particularly under the scenarios of many image categories and high feature dimensions. As the core idea, our method represents both the images and learned classifiers using binary hash codes, which are simultaneously learned from the training data. Classifying an image thereby reduces to retrieving its nearest class codes in the Hamming space. Specifically, we formulate multiclass image classification as an optimization problem over binary variables. The optimization alternatingly proceeds over the binary classifiers and image hash codes. Profiting from the special property of binary codes, we show that the sub-problems can be efficiently solved through either a binary quadratic program (BQP) or a linear program. In particular, for attacking the BQP problem, we propose a novel bit-flipping procedure which enjoys high efficacy and a local optimality guarantee. Our formulation supports a large family of empirical loss functions and is, in specific, instantiated by exponential and linear losses. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on several representative image benchmarks. The experiments consistently exhibit reduced computational and memory complexities of model training and deployment, without sacrificing classification accuracy.
