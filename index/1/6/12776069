This paper presents the design, fabrication, modeling, and performance characterization of a new 3D-printed ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) soft crawling robot. First, a precursor to an ionomeric polymer material (Nafion) is used to 3D print modular leg and body sections to create a caterpillar-like robot. Then, the printed components are activated, plated with electrodes, assembled together to create the robot from smart electroactive polymer material. The 3D-printed robot exploits the unique capabilities of IPMC materials; specifically, the actuation of the hydrated 3D-printed leg and body sections can be controlled by applying a voltage signal. In particular, the IPMC legs can grip and the body sections can expand and contract, allowing the robot to propel itself forward and backward. The newly-developed 3D-printing process and the robot design and modeling process are described. Experimental results are presented that show the prototype robot moving along a tube like a caterpillar or inchworm.
