Programming or upgrading the software in sensor networks is one of the important problems since the sensors are often deployed in large numbers and in hostile environments. In this paper, we present <i>infuse</i>, a reliable over the air reprogramming service for sensor networks using time division multiple access (TDMA) protocol. In case of unexpected channel errors, a back pressure mechanism is used to ensure reliable propagation. Moreover, we show that infuse propagates code in a pipeline and in an energy-efficient manner.
