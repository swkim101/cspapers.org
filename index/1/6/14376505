This paper presents our approach to extending the niche of behavior-based robotics to manipulation. We use results from neuroscience to define the basic behaviors of the manipulator. Furthermore, we derive some qualitative design rules for the mechanics of the manipulator. With these principles, we have designed a first demo application: writing on a board with a mobile manipulator.
