We present FEMine, an automatic system for image-based gene expression analysis. We perform experiments on the largest publicly available collection of Drosophila ISH (in situ hybridization) images, showing that our FEMine system achieves excellent performance in classification, clustering, and content-based image retrieval. The major innovation of FEMine is the use of automatically discovered latent spatial "themes" of gene expressions, LGEs, in the whole-embryo context, as opposed to patterns in nearly disjoint portions of an embryo proposed in previous methods.
