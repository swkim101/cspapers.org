We investigate the factors which determine constituent order in German clauses and propose an algorithm which performs the task in two steps: First, the best candidate for the initial sentence position is chosen. Then, the order for the remaining constituents is determined. The rst task is more difcult than the second one because of properties of the German sentence-initial position. Experiments show a signicant improvement over competing approaches. Our algorithm is also more efcient than these.
