Opponents are characterized by a Bayesian network intended to guide Monte-Carlo Tree Search through the game tree of No-Limit Texas Hold'em Poker. By using a probabilistic model of opponents, the network is able to integrate all available sources of information, including the infrequent revelations of hidden beliefs. These revelations are biased, and as such are difficult to incorporate into action prediction. The proposed network mitigates this bias via the expectation maximization algorithm and a probabilistic characterization of the hidden variables that generate observations.
