This paper presents a general inductive graph representation learning framework called DeepGL for learning deep node and edge features that generalize across-networks. In particular, DeepGL begins by deriving a set of base features from the graph (e.g., graphlet features) and automatically learns a multi-layered hierarchical graph representation where each successive layer leverages the output from the previous layer to learn features of a higher-order. Contrary to previous work, DeepGL learns relational functions (each representing a feature) that naturally generalize across-networks and are therefore useful for graph-based transfer learning tasks. Moreover, DeepGL naturally supports attributed graphs, learns interpretable inductive graph representations, and is space-efficient (by learning sparse feature vectors). In addition, DeepGL is expressive, flexible with many interchangeable components, efficient with a time complexity of O(|E|), and scalable for large networks via an efficient parallel implementation. Compared with recent methods, DeepGL is (1) effective for across-network transfer learning tasks and large (attributed) graphs, (2) space-efficient requiring up to 6x less memory, (3) fast with up to 182x speedup in runtime performance, and (4) accurate with an average improvement in AUC of 20% or more on many learning tasks and across a wide variety of networks.
