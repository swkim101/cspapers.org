Today more than ever, it is critical to the Navy Acquisition Enterprise to move effectively and deliver capabilities to our Navy and our Nation. Software increasingly provides the lions share of our war fighting and business system functionality. The efficient and effective development and acquisition of this software is key to providing the capability our war fighters need in the field today. To be successful, we also need a business environment in which we accurately predict cost, schedule and performance, followed by disciplined execution of those plans.A partnership between government, academia and industry based on a high level of excellence on all sides will lead us in the right direction. Currently there are five teams of my senior staff working on improving how we contract for, develop and acquire software. Most importantly, we are examining how we train our teams to deliver a high quality product, on time and on cost.
