Industrial robots are important when the degree of automation in industry is increased. To enable the use of robots also when the products change rapidly, the programming must be quick and easy to perform. One way to accomplish this is to use lead-through programming, i.e., the user manually guides the robot. This paper presents a sensorless approach, and thus avoids the need for a typically expensive sensor. The method is based on disabling low-level joint controllers combined with gravity compensation. It is reported how the performance can be improved by compensating for friction. Further, a method for detecting small external torques is described, based on the use of the low-level joint controllers with increased integral gain. The lead-through programming is experimentally evaluated using two different industrial robots.
