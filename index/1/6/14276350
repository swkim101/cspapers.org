Multi-view semi-supervised learning methods try to exploit the combination of multiple views along with large amounts of unlabeled data in order to learn better predictive functions when limited labeled data is available. However, lack of complete view data limits the applicability of multi-view semi-supervised learning to real world data. Commonly, one data view is readily and cheaply available, but additionally views may be costly or only available in some cases. This work aims to make multi-view semi-supervised learning approaches more applicable to real world data specifically by addressing the issue of missing views. We introduce CoNet, a feature generation method that learns a mapping from one view to another that is specifically designed to produce features that are useful for multi-view semi-supervised learning algorithms. The mapping is then used to fill in views as pre-processing. Our comprehensive experimental study demonstrates the utility of our method as compared to the state-of-the-art multi-view semi-supervised learning methods for this scenario of partially observed views.
