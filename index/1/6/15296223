Packet routing algorithms are often analysed under the assumption that packets arrive (are generated) at a certain rate. Do the same bounds on the performance of the algorithm continue to hold if the arrival rate is reduo& This is the question studied in this paper. We observe that the published analysis of many routing algorithms deteriorates, or even breaks down completely, when z.xne of the psickets are removed from the network. la thii just an artifact of the analysis? Possibly not, es we give explicit examples of scenarios where reducing the load provably causea routing algorithms to experience longer queues. The scenarios are of a simple enough nature to imply that such nonmonotonic behavior may manifest itself in existing routing alga rithms (such as one bend FIFO routing on the mesh). On the positive side, we present a new bufferlea algorithm for routing on the two dimensional mesh, analyse its performance in the dynamic case, and show that the algorithm does not suffer from nonmonotonic phenomena. When packets have random destinations, the algorithm maintains significantly higher throughput than previously published hot potato algorithms for the mesh.
