This paper proposes a mechanism to share and utilize various sensors among multiple Android terminals for a functional enhancement and a battery life extension. The most important contribution is how to emulate the value from remote sensor as a value from a local sensor. By this emulation, all the other applications existed on Google Play Market can utilize remote sensors without any modification.
 For realizing our proposal, we modified Android OS itself, and developed two applications that run on Android OS. In the former, we uniquely modified SensorManager of Android OS for supporting an external sensors. In the latter, we made a virtualizing application for each embedded sensors that sends a value to other terminals via Bluetooth. Also, we developed a control application of our function itself.
 Through our demo using "Penguin Skiing 3D", we show that an acceleration sensor is successfully virtualized and is behaving as a local sensor of another terminal. In addition, we evaluate the affect of a sampling interval and a cache update interval at a remote terminal against the accuracy at a local terminal.
