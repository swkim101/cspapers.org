We present a novel real-time algorithm to predict the path of pedestrians in cluttered environments. Our approach makes no assumption about pedestrian motion or crowd density, and is useful for short-term as well as long-term prediction. We interactively learn the characteristics of pedestrian motion and movement patterns from 2D trajectories using Bayesian inference. These include local movement patterns corresponding to the current and preferred velocities and global characteristics such as entry points and movement features. Our approach involves no precomputation and we demonstrate the real-time performance of our prediction algorithm on sparse and noisy trajectory data extracted from dense indoor and outdoor crowd videos. The combination of local and global movement patterns can improve the accuracy of long-term prediction by 12-18% over prior methods in high-density videos.
