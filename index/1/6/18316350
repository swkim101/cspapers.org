Users often engage in tasks that span multiple personal devices. Although many current solutions exist to provide ubiquitous access to one's data, users continue to struggle with cross-device tasks. These solutions often require them to plan ahead for their information needs. In this paper, we present Myngle, a device-agnostic system that lets users quickly find the information they are looking for from previously visited web pages without having to plan ahead. Myngle provides a unified web history from multiple personal devices, and allows users to filter their history based on high-level categories influenced by common mobile information need categories (e.g., address, phone number). We evaluated Myngle with 32 users and found that our category-based method of filtering eases the burden of continuing cross-device tasks.
