Discovering coherent gene expression patterns in time-series gene expression data is an important task in bioinformatics research and biomedical applications. In this paper, we propose an interactive exploration framework for mining coherent expression patterns in time-series gene expression data. We develop a novel tool, coherent pattern index graph, to give users highly confident indications of the existences of coherent patterns. To derive a coherent pattern index graph, we devise an attraction tree structure to record the genes in the data set and summarize the information needed for the interactive exploration. We present fast and scalable algorithms to construct attraction trees and coherent pattern index graphs from gene expression data sets. We conduct an extensive performance study on some real data sets to verify our design. The experimental results strongly show that our approach is more effective than the state-of-the-art methods in mining real gene expression data, and is scalable in mining large data sets.
