A Program Design Language, or PDL, is a structured and program-like format for prose descriptions of computer algorithms. Syntax rules of the PDL, while few in number and informal in comparison with those of a compiled language, do impose a needed structure on the description, making the flow of control within the algorithm and its division into logically separate parts apparent to the reader.
 This paper introduces a Program Design Language to be called Tab. The name is suggested by the primary principle of its design: that the grouping of statements into structures be governed by indentations to equally spaced tab positions.
