The PowerPC logic verification methodology is a general purpose approach suitable for a large class of chip designs that can exceed five million transistors in size. Several validation techniques are integrated into an automated logic verification strategy. The success of this methodology has been demonstrated by realizing three PowerPC microprocessor chips that were functional the first time.
