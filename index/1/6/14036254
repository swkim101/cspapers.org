A method, called Boundary Integral-based Domain Decomposition was recently proposed for the solution of Laplace's equation. The method is characterized by the complete decoupling of the problem domain into subdomains which is possible after integral equation based techniques are used for the calculation of the solution on the subdomain boundaries. We describe some theoretical and practical issues involved in the use of such methods on shared memory multiprocessors.
