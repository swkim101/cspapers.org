In this paper we describe the design, implementation, and performance of an incremental join facility that has been added as an extension to the Starburst extensible DBMS. This facility provides an efficient access path for joins that materialize many-to-one relationships, and it works by maintaining hidden pointer fields embedded in related tuples. The facility was constructed for two reasons: as an experiment in using pointers in the internals of a relational DBMS, and as a stress-test of the Starburst extension architecture. In addition to describing the join facility and its performance, we also summarize what it taught us about extensibility both in Starburst and in general.
