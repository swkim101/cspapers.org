This paper describes the evaluation methods applied to assess the performance of the user models developed in the framework of a three-year plan recognition project. The user models were learned from observations of the behaviour of large numbers of users, and were used to predict usersâ€™ immediate activities and eventual goals in two related domains: a Multi-User adventure game and the World Wide Web. The evaluation methods were influenced by the features of the domain and the applied modeling techniques.
