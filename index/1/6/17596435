The predicate elimination strategy is a complete resolution proof strategy for multi-predicate formulas. Essentially, the procedure focuses on one of the predicate symbols P, and attempts to deduce clauses independent of P by means of resolution in which only predicates in P are “resolved away” from parent clauses. The completeness theorem states that one can in this way, deduce an unsatisfiable P-independent set of clauses, provided the given set is unsatisfiable. The strategy is then extended to a suitable form of semantic resolution. This leads to the following strategy: in the attempt to deduce an unsatisfiable P-independent set of clauses, apply elementary resolution to “resolve away” predicates in P only from parent clauses, one of which has all of its predicates in P positive (negative).
