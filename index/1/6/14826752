This is a tutorial paper which highlights the influence of the computer not only on the modus operandi of circuit design but also on network theory itself. It reviews the topological properties of linear graphs and describes a matrix-topological formulation of the network problem. In addition to the classical mesh, node, and outset methods, a mixed method of analysis is described which is applicable to d-c, a-c, and transient problems. Numerical methods of solving linear and non-linear d-c network problems are discussed and a new approach to a-c analysis, using the mixed method and a numerical solution of the matrix eigenvalue problem, is described. The extension of this method to the transient analysis of linear networks is also explained. Finally, the problem of instability in the numerical integration of differential equations is discussed and several means of solving the problem are outlined.
