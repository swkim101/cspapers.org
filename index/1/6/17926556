This poster discusses the performance of the TCP/IP stack and some common file transfer protocols when used in a scalable IP-based environment for digital media production. First, models were created to predict what to expect of these protocols. Afterwards, all protocols were extensively tested on a scalable setup, including clients, file servers (IBM xSeries), storage controllers and disks. Tuning the protocols, OS parameters and the use of specialized hardware (TCP Offload Engines) improved throughput and diminished processing power. Out of the models and current test results, a comparison was made between the different file transfer protocols, and the added value of an IP-based access network between user terminals and a central file server cluster is demonstrated. Up to 615 MB/s (5.16 Gbps) of traffic was reached from 1 quad Xeon IBM x366 (with attached storage) to a set of clients.
