Temporal graphs are a class of graphs whose nodes and edges, together with the associated properties, continuously change over time. Recently, systems have been developed to support snapshot queries over temporal graphs. However, these systems barely support aggregate time range queries. Moreover, these systems cannot guarantee ACID transactions, an important feature for data management systems as long as concurrent processing is involved. To solve these issues, we design and develop TGraph, a temporal graph data management system, that assures the ACID transaction feature, and supports fast temporal graph queries.
