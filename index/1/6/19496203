We propose in this paper a novel high gain coplanar waveguide-fed antenna, in which a wide bandwidth is achieved by adjusting taper numbers and slot shape. The proposed compact antenna utilizes the advantages of the CPW line to simplify the antenna structure into a single metallic level, which makes easier the integration with the microwave integrated circuits. To enhance antenna operation in term of gain and bandwidth as well as to control far-field radiation patterns, the initial CPW-fed antenna is with an array of EBG structures in three different ways. Based on this design procedure, proposed antennas are designed, optimized, compared as well as fabricated on low cost material substrate (FR-4, Îµ=4.4, h=1.6mm). The experimental result of these antennas at 915 MHz and 5.8 GHz band has a measured impedance bandwidth of 5% and 14.6%, a simulated gain of 5.56 dBi and 5.9 dBi, respectively. These properties make the antennas suitable for UHF RFID applications and Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) in Intelligent Transport System.
