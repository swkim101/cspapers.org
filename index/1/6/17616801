In this paper we argue the need for orchestration support for participatory campaigns to achieve campaign quality, and automatisation of said support to achieve scalability, both issues contributing to stakeholder usability. This goes further than providing support for defining campaigns, an issue tackled in prior work. We provide a formal definition for a campaign by extracting commonalities from the state of the art and expertise in organising noise mapping campaigns. Next, we formalise how to ensure campaigns end successfully, and translate this formal notion into an operational recipe for dynamic orchestration. We then present a framework for automatising campaign definition, monitoring and orchestration which relies on workflow technology. The framework is validated by re-enacting several campaigns previously run through manual orchestration and quantifying the increased efficiency.
