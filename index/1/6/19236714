Particularly, a sentiment and negation neural network (SNNN) is proposed, including a sentiment neural network (SNN) and a negation neural network (NNN). First, we modify the word level by embedding the word sentiment and negation information as the extra layers for the input. Second, we adopt a hierarchical LSTM model to generate the word-level, sentence-level and document-level representations respectively. After that, we enhance word sentiment and negation as attentions over the semantic level. Finally, the experiments conducting on the IMDB and Yelp data sets show that our approach is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we draw the interesting conclusions that (1) LSTM performs better than CNN and RNN for neural sentiment classification; (2) word sentiment and negation are a strong alliance with attention, while overfitting occurs when they are simultaneously applied at the embedding layer; and (3) word sentiment/negation can be singly implemented for better performance as both embedding layer and attention at the same time.
