Due to increased competition in a world economy, steel companies are currently interested in developing techniques that will allow for the improvement of the steelmaking process, either by increasing output efficiency or by improving the quality of their product, or both. Slag foaming is one practice that has been shown to contribute to both these goals. This paper describes an effort in progress to both model and control the slag foaming process using neural networks in tandem with genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic.
