In this paper, we utilize Rent's rule as an empirical measure for efficient clustering and placement of circuits on hierarchical FPGAs. We show that careful matching of design complexity and architecture resources of hierarchical FPGAs can have a positive impact on the overall device area. We propose a circuit placement algorithm based on Rent's parameter and show that our clustering and placement techniques can improve the overall device routing area by as much as 21% for the same array size, when compared to a state-of-art FPGA placement and routing tool.
