In general, the traffic characteristics of the individual applications that constitute the aggregate traffic on a network can be important for capacity engineering. In this paper, we demonstrate based on mathematical analysis the value of application specific measurements even when there is no service differentiation. In other words, under certain assumptions, we obtain the result that errors in engineering can occur, and in particular, under-engineering can occur when traffic characteristics of individual applications are ignored. The assumptions are that the individual applications can be modeled adequately as Fractional Brownian Motions and that measurements are available only at relatively coarse time scales. The results in this paper emphasize the value of collecting fine-grained traffic measurements.
