We have transformed five years of curriculum data of our academic staff from relational databases to a semantic model. Thanks to semantic queries, capabilities of NoSQL models, inference reasoners and data mining techniques we obtain knowledge that it improves the personal management of curriculum data, the quality and efficiency of exploitation tasks, and the transparency, dissemination and collaboration with citizens. The huge catalogue of CV data remains an underutilized resource. Private companies such as editorials have robust services based only on publications but academic institutions have the option of integrating other databases related with their staff to obtain more indicators. We analyse the transformation of data, highlighting the mapping process of authors, and we present two ways of exploitation using semantic queries and complex networks. Thus, institutions, researchers and citizens will have a quality data catalogue for diverse studies.
