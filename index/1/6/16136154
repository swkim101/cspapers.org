Seminal methods extract manual discrete features from automatic syntactic parse trees in order to capture semantic information of the enclosing sentence with respect to a target entity mention. Recently, it has been shown that competitive accuracies can be achieved without using syntactic parsers, which can be highly inaccurate on noisy text such as tweets. This is achieved by applying distributed word representations and rich neural pooling functions over a simple and intuitive segmentation of tweets according to target entity mentions. In this paper, we extend this idea by proposing a sentence-level neural model to address the limitation of pooling functions, which do not explicitly model tweet-level semantics. First, a bi-directional gated neural network is used to connect the words in a tweet so that pooling functions can be applied over the hidden layer instead of words for better representing the target and its contexts. Second, a three-way gated neural network structure is used to model the interaction between the target mention and its surrounding contexts. Experiments show that our proposed model gives significantly higher accuracies compared to the current best method for targeted sentiment analysis.
