Graphs and graph algorithms play an important role in undergraduate data structures and algorithms courses. However, they often also represent the first case where both the correctness and the underlying concepts of the algorithms are not evident. Both students and educators can therefore benefit from a simple yet expressive tool for coding graph algorithms and then conveniently visualizing them. We present such a tool, derived from a set of instructional requirements, and give an example application.
