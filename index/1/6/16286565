This paper describes the System Architects' Workbench, a personal computer-based teaching environment for courses in computer organization and systems programming. This tool set provides an integrated learning and teaching environment for computer systems concepts defined in ACM IS Curriculum '81 IS1. The central tool is a computer simulator based on a pedagogical model of computer system resources which allows students to study principles without becoming too involved in the implementation idiosyncrasies usually associated with machine level programming. Programs may be written directly in machine language or in a Pascal-like language, TP, which includes features that allow complete access to and control of host level resources. The TP compiler supports separate compilation, IPL load module generation, and detailed translation output used for machine language modification and debugging. The simulator supports interactive execution, tracing, modification, and debugging.
