No two robots are exactly the same-even for a given model of robot, different units will require slightly different controllers. Furthermore, because robots change and degrade over time, a controller will need to change over time to remain optimal. This paper leverages lifelong learning in order to learn controllers for different robots. In particular, we show that by learning a set of control policies over robots with different (unknown) motion models, we can quickly adapt to changes in the robot, or learn a controller for a new robot with a unique set of disturbances. Furthermore, the approach is completely model-free, allowing us to apply this method to robots that have not, or cannot, be fully modeled.
