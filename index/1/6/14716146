Researchers have focused on finding experts in individual domains, such as emails, forums, question answering, blogs, and microblogs. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for finding experts across these different domains. To do this, we propose an expertise framework that aims at extracting key expertise features and building an unified scoring model based on SVM ranking algorithm. We evaluate our model on a real World dataset and show that it is significantly better than the prior state-of-art.
