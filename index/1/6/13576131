There exist several industrial applications for large crane systems. Most of them experience serious problems with load swing. This paper presents a fuzzy based control scheme to minimize load swing for crane systems while maintaining continuous payload transportation. The control system of the crane is built using behavior-based approaches. In the control system developed, each module generates behaviors, and improvement in the performance of the system proceeds by adding new modules to the system. In order to develop the anti-swing module, fuzzy logic controller is applied using information extracted from potentiometers. The fuzzy controller provides a mechanism for dealing with imprecise sensor data. The anti-swing behaviors are successfully implemented by formulating a set of fuzzy rules. The performance of the developed system is illustrated by both simulations and experiments. The simulation and experimental results of the system show that the system remains stable under several operating situations.
