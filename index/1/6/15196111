SAMM is a top-down dominated activity modeling technique which has a representation scheme which has been automated. The automation, called SAMDF, validates the input, verifies the model, and produces a document illustrating the functional relationships of the system being modeled. SAMMDF significantly enhances the perception of system requirements, and it is this perception that benefits the design produced from the requirements.
