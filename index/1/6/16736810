Three laboratory modules were developed to teach C pointers to novice programming students, using two different versions of software. The first version was an intelligent tutoring system; the second was a multimedia tutorial. Six classes of students participated in an empirical study involving both versions of software. What was discovered as a result of this experiment was more than just the answer to whether or not a particular piece of software helped the students to learn the subject matter. We discovered who used the software, given the freedom of choice. We learned about the characteristics of software users, which software was more helpful, and what the students think about using software to learn. The more significant results of this study are presented in this paper.
