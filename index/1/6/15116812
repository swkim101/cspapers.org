A magnetic-tip steerable needle is presented with application to aiding deep brain stimulation electrode placement. The magnetic needle is 1.3mm in diameter at the tip with a 0.7mm diameter shaft, which is selected to match the size of a deep brain stimulation electrode. The tip orientation is controlled by applying torques to the embedded neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnets with a clinically-sized magnetic-manipulation system. The prototype design is capable of following trajectories under human-in-the-loop control with minimum bend radii of 100mm without inducing tissue damage and down to 30mm if some tissue damage is tolerable. The device can be retracted and redirected to reach multiple targets with a single insertion point.
