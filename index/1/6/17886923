Mobile devices, sensors and social networks have dramatically increased the collection and sharing of personal and contextual information of individuals. Hence, users constantly make disclosure decisions on the basis of a difficult trade-off between using services and data protection. Understanding the factors linked to the disclosure behavior of personal information is a step forward to assist users in their decisions. In this paper, we model the disclosure of personal information and investigate their relationships not only with demographic and self-reported individual characteristics, but also with real behavior inferred from mobile phone usage. Preliminary results show that real behavior captured from mobile data relates with actual sharing behavior, providing the basis for future predictive models.
