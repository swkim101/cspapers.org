We discuss a basis for creating self-reconfiguring robots and instantiate it for crystal modules. Crystalline robots consist of modules that can aggregate together to form distributed robot systems. Crystalline modules are actuated by expanding and contracting each unit. This actuation mechanism permits automated shape metamorphosis. We describe the crystalline module concept and its physical implementation. We prove that crystalline robots are general self-reconfiguring robots.
