We compare the relative change in word ordering entropies of English and Chinese translations of the Bible by treating the texts as composed of sequence of multi-grams. Using a randomized text with exactly the same segmentation structures and words statistics as the references, we find that the changes in the multi-grams entropies for the Chinese version are always larger than those for the English version. This suggests that the word ordering in the Chinese version is more ambiguous than that in the English version.
