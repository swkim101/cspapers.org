In this work a novel synergy-based bilateral tele-manipulation strategy is introduced. The proposed algorithm has been primarily developed to remotely control the Pisa/IIT SoftHand (SH) using a 3-finger hand exoskeleton as master device. With a single actuator and a sensory system limited to a position encoder and a current sensor, the SH minimalist design promotes robustness but challenges traditional teleoperation strategies. To tackle this challenge, the concept of Cartesian-based hand synergies is introduced as a projection tool which maps the fingertip Cartesian space to the directions oriented along the grasp principal components. The unconstrained motion of the operator's hand is projected on this space to extract the SH's motor position reference. Conversely, the interaction force estimated at the robotic hand as a 1-dimensional force along the first synergy is projected to the 9D fingertip Cartesian space through an inverse projection. The resultant finger-individualized forces form a synergy based weighted representation of the grasping effort applied by the SH and are displayed to the operators fingertips using the force feedback hand exoskeleton. The system's ability to reflect the environment's impedance has been experimentally validated during a ball squeezing experiment. To assess the overall effectiveness of the proposed system as a manipulation interface, the SoftHand was mounted on the humanoid robot COMAN and the setup was subsequently enriched with a vision-based tracking system monitoring the operators wrist trajectory. Experimental results indicate that the proposed body-machine bilateral interface allows for the intuitive performance of stable grasps and transport of a large range of diversely shaped objects.
