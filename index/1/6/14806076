The immune system offers to be a rich source of metaphors to guide the exploration of the notion of an adaptive system. We might define a class of systems which are inspired by, but diverge from, descriptions of the immune system, and refer to them as immune-based systems. The research reported here is motivated by a desire to explore the possibilities of such systems. Specifically, we attempt to construct an associative memory using immune system modelling as a starting point.
