The theme of this panel echoes the theme of this conference; at least the portion devoted to “looking back” on 20 years of software engineering history. The paneIists were specifically asked to reflect on their thoughts about software engineering, the NATO conferences, and the immmediate results within the context of the time. In other words, to try and recapture what was happening to their ideas as affected by the meetings.
