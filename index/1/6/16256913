The Educational Computer User's Network at Battelle represents a unique application of the joint-computer-center concept. The program is unique in two respects. First, it is a cooperative effort between a group of Ohio colleges, secondary schools, and a large research-oriented organization. Second, the entire program has proceeded without any federal or other outside financial support. Both Battelle and the schools have participated by utilizing funds available within their own operating budgets.
 The purpose of this paper is to describe the program and some of its results from the viewpoint of Battelle's Computer Center.
