This poster describes a potential problem with a relatively well used measure in Information Retrieval research: Kendall's Tau rank correlation coefficient. The coefficient is best known for its use in determining the similarity of test collections when ranking sets of retrieval runs. Threshold values for the coefficient have been defined and used in a number of published studies in information retrieval. However, this poster presents results showing that basing decisions on such thresholds is not as reliableas has been assumed.
