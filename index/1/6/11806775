In this paper, we present a novel solution to multi-view clustering through a structured low-rank representation. When assuming similar samples can be linearly reconstructed by each other, the resulting representational matrix reflects the cluster structure and should ideally be block diagonal. We first impose low-rank constraint on the representational matrix to encourage better grouping effect. Then representational matrices under different views are allowed to communicate with each other and share their mutual cluster structure information. We develop an effective algorithm inspired by iterative re-weighted least squares for solving our formulation. During the optimization process, the intermediate representational matrix from one view serves as a cluster structure constraint for that from another view. Such mutual structural constraint fine-tunes the cluster structures from both views and makes them more and more agreeable. Extensive empirical study manifests the superiority and efficacy of the proposed method.
