This paper presents a framework for evaluating information retrieval of medical records. We use the BLULab corpus, a large collection of real-world de-identified medical records. The collection has been hand coded by clinical terminologists using the ICD-9 medical classification system. The ICD codes are used to devise queries and relevance judgements for this collection. Results of initial test runs using a baseline IR system show that there is room for improvement in medical information retrieval. Queries and relevance judgements are made available at http://aehrc.com/med_eval
