A data stream management system (DSMS) should support an efficient evaluation scheme for long-running continuous queries over infinite data streams. This demonstration presents a scalable query processing engine, M-COPE (Multiple Continuous Query Processing Engine) developed to evaluate multiple continuous queries efficiently. A multiple query optimization scheme implemented in the system generates a single network of operations as an execution plan for registered queries in order to maximize the reuse of the intermediate results of common sub-expressions in the queries adaptively. In this paper, we describe the overall architecture of M-COPE along with its special features. Network traffic flow streams are used to demonstrate the main features of M-COPE.
