This paper addresses the problem of robot interaction with objects attached to the environment through joints such as doors or drawers. We propose a methodology that requires no prior knowledge of the objects' kinematics, including the type of joint - either prismatic or revolute. The method consists of a velocity controller which relies on force/torque measurements and estimation of the motion direction, rotational axis and the distance from the center of rotation. The method is suitable for any velocity controlled manipulator with a force/torque sensor at the end-effector. The force/torque control regulates the applied forces and torques within given constraints, while the velocity controller ensures that the end-effector moves with a task-related desired tangential velocity. The paper also provides a proof that the estimates converge to the actual values. The method is evaluated in different scenarios typically met in a household environment.
