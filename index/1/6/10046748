Teaching a computer networks course can be a challenge both in terms of deciding on the focus of the course and providing appropriate practical experiences to complement the theoretical issues. However, because the course overlaps other areas of the computer science curriculum, it is an opportunity to apply some of the concepts from other areas and to expose students to the research in the field. This paper describes a computer networks course to accomplish this along with a collection of resources.
