Those who have used patterns are aware that this literary form, and its corresponding process and community support, is providing a way to capture best practices and communicate them throughout organizations and the entire software industry. However, many who have tried to introduce patterns (or any new idea) into their organizations have found it to be a difficult task. Therefore, a pattern language, currently titled Evolving a Patterns Culture, is being written to capture solutions to the challenges in introducing patterns (or any new idea) into an organization.
