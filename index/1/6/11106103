Certification establishes a standard of competency in specific areas and job roles. This helps industry to determine that employees meet the required credentials for different job roles thus requiring less training during the initial employment period. Hence, some job criteria require individuals to be certified in order to be considered for employment. To the certified individual, certification provides a greater sense of confidence in their abilities and a measure of professional expertise and understanding of the job role and products used in that role. It is for these reasons that certification is becoming increasingly popular and in high demand. Many training companies are providing certification-training classes at high costs all across the globe. Unlike traditional academic degrees, certificates are specific to narrow fields or even to individual products. The aim is to provide targeted skills that have immediate applicability in the workplace.
