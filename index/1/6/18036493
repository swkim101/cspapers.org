Up to now, most of the retrieving systems are founded on a Boolean selection mechanism. It appears that this way of doing is not powerful enough to deal with some applications, especially when the size (number) of the results must be controlled. In that case, some kind of flexibility is needed in query expression. In this paper, we suggest the use of a fuzzy sets based approach. The basic principles of this approach are presented and compared to more conventional solutions providing only limited extensions. Moreover, the implementation aspects related to our approach are discussed to show that reasonable performances can be expected.
