In this paper, a method for displaying feeling of cutting by a micro-scissors type haptic device is described. Micro-scissors are a type of surgical instrument, which is frequently used in brain surgery under a microscope. A prototype of a micro-scissors type haptic device consists of three components: an interface, a drive member, and force sensors. The interface is designed to equip features of a pair of micro-scissors and has a blade spring on its end. The drive member is composed of two DC-motors and two crank-lever mechanisms as decelerators. The force sensors are composed of strain gauges with H-slits, and implemented into each handle of the interface. For the aid of applying the force sensors to feedback control of cutting resistance forces, compensation for influence of a blade spring on the force sensors is added. Evaluation experiment for basic performance of the device is carried out, and the device is proved to be able to generate the computed cutting resistance forces. Virtual cutting experiment by six subjects is carried out, and it is proved that the device is able to display feeling of cutting.
