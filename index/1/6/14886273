Mobile crowdsourcing is a powerful tool for collecting data of various types. The primary bottleneck in such systems is the high burden placed on the user who must manually collect sensor data or respond in-situ to simple queries (e.g., experience sampling studies). In this work, we present Compressive CrowdSensing (CCS) -- a framework that enables compressive sensing techniques to be applied to mobile crowdsourcing scenarios. CCS enables each user to provide significantly reduced amounts of manually collected data, while still maintaining acceptable levels of overall accuracy for the target crowd-based system. Na√Øve applications of compressive sensing do not work well for common types of crowdsourcing data (e.g., user survey responses) because the necessary correlations that are exploited by a sparsifying base are hidden and non-trivial to identify. CCS comprises a series of novel techniques that enable such challenges to be overcome. We evaluate CCS with four representative large-scale datasets and find that it is able to outperform standard uses of compressive sensing, as well as conventional approaches to lowering the quantity of user data needed by crowd systems.
