In this paper, we present the Flash flooding protocol that exploits the capture effect to produce low-latency network floods. The capture effect is the ability of some radios to correctly receive one of several concurrently transmitted messages, even if the received strengths of the two messages are almost the same. We exploit this phenomenon in a network flooding scenario by allowing nodes to propagate the flooding message concurrently, thus reducing delays due to neighborhood contention. Our experimental results indicate that Flash can reduce latency by 75-80 percent without sacrificing flooding reliability or coverage.
