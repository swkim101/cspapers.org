We define a language G for querying data represented as a labeled graph G. By considering G as a relation, this graphical query language can be viewed as a relational query language, and its expressive power can be compared to that of other relational query languages. We do not propose G as an alternative to general purpose relational query languages, but rather as a complementary language in which recursive queries are simple to formulate. The user is aided in this formulation by means of a graphical interface. The provision of regular expressions in G allows recursive queries more general than transitive closure to be posed, although the language is not as powerful as those based on function-free Horn clauses. However, we hope to be able to exploit well-known graph algorithms in evaluating recursive queries efficiently, a topic which has received widespread attention recently.
