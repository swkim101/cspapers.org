Many existing approaches for image-to-geometry registration assume that either a textured 3D model or a good initial guess of the 3D pose is available to bootstrap the registration process. In this paper we consider the registration of photographs to 3D models even when no texture information is available. This is very challenging as we cannot rely on texture gradients, and even shading gradients are hard to estimate since the lighting conditions are unknown. To that end, we propose average shading gradients, a rendering technique that estimates the average gradient magnitude over all lighting directions under Lambertian shading. We use this gradient representation as the building block of a registration pipeline based on matching sparse features. To cope with inevitable false matches due to the missing texture information and to increase robustness, the pose of the 3D model is estimated in two stages. Coarse pose hypotheses are first obtained from a single correct match each, subsequently refined using SIFT flow, and finally verified. We apply our algorithm to registering images of real-world objects to untextured 3D meshes of limited accuracy.
