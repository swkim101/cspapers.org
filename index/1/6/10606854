We analyze multi-relational social interaction networks in a large-scale commercial Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game(MMORPG). Our work is based on data from AION, currently the world's second most-played MMORPG with 3.4 million subscribers as of mid 2010, created and serviced by NCSoft, Inc. We construct and characterize six distinct interactivity networks (Friend, Private Messaging, Party invitation, Trade, Mail, and Shop), each representing diverse player interaction types.
