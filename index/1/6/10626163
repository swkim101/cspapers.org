In this paper, we proposal an Interest Set mechanism which aggregate similar Interest packets from same flow to one packet to improve the efficient of transport of NDN. The trick here is to reset lifetime of corresponding PIT entry in the immediate routers every time when valid Data packet is passed by. This mechanism covers the time and space uncertainty of data generating, reduce the cost of maintaining the pipeline and improve the transport of NDN.
