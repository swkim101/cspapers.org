Mobile advertisement (ad for short) is a major financial pillar for developers to provide free mobile apps. However, it is frequently thwarted by ad fraud, where rogue code tricks ad providers by forging ad display or user clicks, or both. With the mobile ad market growing drastically (e.g., from $8.76 billion in 2012 to $17.96 billion in 2013), it is vitally important to provide a verifiable mobile ad framework to detect and prevent ad frauds. Unfortunately, this is notoriously hard as mobile ads usually run in an execution environment with a huge TCB. This paper proposes a verifiable mobile ad framework called AdAttester, based on ARM?s TrustZone technology. AdAttester provides two novel security primitives, namely unforgeable clicks and verifiable display. The two primitives attest that ad-related operations (e.g., user clicks) are initiated by the end user (instead of a bot) and that the ad is displayed intact and timely. AdAttester leverages the secure world of TrustZone to implement these two primitives to collect proofs, which are piggybacked on ad requests to ad providers for attestation. AdAttester is non-intrusive to mobile users and can be incrementally deployed in existing ad ecosystem. A prototype of AdAttester is implemented for Android running on a Samsung Exynos 4412 board. Evaluation using 182 typical mobile apps with ad frauds shows that AdAttester can accurately distinguish ad fraud from legitimate ad operations, yet incurs small performance overhead and little impact on user experience.
