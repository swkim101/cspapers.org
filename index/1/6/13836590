We present an asymptotic fully polynomial time approximation scheme for two-dimensional strip packing with rotations. In this problem, a set of rectangles need to be packed into a rectangle (strip) of fixed width and minimum height, and these rectangles can be rotated by 90Â°. Additionally, we present a simple asymptotic polynomial time approximation scheme, and give an improved algorithm for two-dimensional bin packing with rotations.
