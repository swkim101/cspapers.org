Robots that can be given instructions in spoken language need to be able to parse a natural language utterance quickly, determine its meaning, generate a goal representation from it, check whether the new goal conflicts with existing goals, and if acceptable, produce an action sequence to achieve the new goal (ideally being sensitive to the existing goals). In this paper, we describe an integrated robotic architecture that can achieve the above steps by translating natural language instructions incrementally and simultaneously into formal logical goal description and action languages, which can be used both to reason about the achievability of a goal as well as to generate new action scripts to pursue the goal. We demonstrate the implementation of our approach on a robot taking spoken natural language instructions in an office environment.
