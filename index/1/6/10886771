Distributed hash tables (DHTs) provide scalable, key-based lookup of objects in dynamic network environments. Although DHTs have been studied extensively from an analytical perspective, only recently have wide deployments enabled empirical examination. This paper reports measurements of the Azureus BitTorrent client's DHT, which is in active use by more than 1 million nodes on a daily basis. The Azureus DHT operates on untrusted, unreliable end-hosts, offering a glimpse into the implementation challenges associated with making structured overlays work in practice. Our measurements provide characterizations of churn, overhead, and performance in this environment. We leverage these measurements to drive the design of a modified DHT lookup algorithm that reduces median DHT lookup time by an order of magnitude for a nominal increase in overhead.
