To accelerate the developmental process of robots interacting with humans in the real world, we propose the simultaneous introduction of two competing robots into the test field. One robot moves autonomously using a preprogrammed behavior set, while the other is remotely controlled by a human operator. The operator attempts to improve the robot by exploring new behavioral elements. Concurrently, the preprogrammed behavior set is tested by the first robot. The main concept is that by allowing the two robots compete against each other, we aim to accelerate the development process. By applying this methodology, we developed an educational robot for children. Herein we report the functioning of this methodology and how behavioral elements were explored and improved through field development.
