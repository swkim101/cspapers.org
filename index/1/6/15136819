Inspired by a visual motion detection model for the rabbit retina and by a computational architecture used for early audition in the barn owl, we have designed a chip that employs a correlation model to report the one-dimensional field motion of a scene in real time. Using subthreshold analog VLSI techniques, we have fabricated and successfully tested a 8000 transistor chip using a standard MOSIS process.
