We address the problem of long cycle time associated with the basic method of optimizing VLSI circuits. We are developing a system which makes it possible to carry out arbitrary changes to Register Transfer Level (RTL) source description of the circuit after a gate-level implementation has been synthesized. The system incrementally updates the gate-level implementation. For typical changes this updation produces comparable results but requires only a small fraction of the time for a complete resynthesis. The system makes use of two object representations. We describe these representations, the maintenance of consistency between them and the incremental synthesis and reoptimization process. Status of the ongoing research on this system is presented.
