A theory is presented for the computation of three dimensional motion and structure from dynamic imagery, using only line correspondences. The traditional approach of corresponding microfeatures (interesting points--highlights, corners, high curvature points, etc.) is reviewed and its shortcomings are discussed. Then, a theory is presented that describes a closed form solution to the motion and structure determination problem from line correspondences in three views. The theory is compared with previous ones that are based on nonlinear equations and iterative methods.
