Several papers have been written about the shortage of knowledgeable computer science teachers at the secondary and junior college level. Additional reports have been written describing workshops, courses, and various other methods to help reduce this shortage. See for example papers by Moursund, Dennis, Piorot and others in various publications by ACM and the proceedings of recent National Educational Computing Conferences.(l,2)
 Very few papers have reported on the existence of degree programs for teachers who are interested in developing the necessary background to teach computer science. Even fewer master's degree programs exist to help train teachers in computer science education. Moursund has described the master's degree at Oregon(3), Lykos has established a degree at Illinois Institute of Technology, and the University of Illinois has a degree for teachers.(2)
 This paper describes a unique master's degree program at Northwest Missouri State University. Details are given on the development and present status of the program. Also, several suggestions are indicated for possible future directions for such a program.
