Much of the problem solving done by both novices and experts uses "case-based" reasoning, or reasoning by analogy to previous similar cases. We explore the ways in which case-based reasoning can help in problem solving. According to our model, transfer of knowledge between cases is guided largely by the problem solving process itself. Our model shows the interactions between problem solving processes and memory for experience. Our computer program, called the MEDIATOR, illustrates case-based reasoning in interpreting and resolving common sense disputes.
