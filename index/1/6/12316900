Abstract—According to the requirement of providing personalized service to users in e-Learning systems and the problem of presenting the semantic relationships of users' interests in traditional user models, this paper discusses the representation and the construction of a personalized user model which represents individual user’s interests by semantic mining from user’s resource searching process. To testify the effectiveness of the model in providing personalized service and conveying the latent semantic requirement of the user, we exploit the user model to provide semantic query expansion service in our e-Learning system. And the results of the experiment indicate that the user model is helpful.
