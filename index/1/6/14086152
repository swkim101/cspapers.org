That intelligent systems need an explanatory capability if they are to aid or support human users has long been understood. A system which can justify its decisions generally obtains improved user trust, greater accuracy in use and offers embedded training potential. Extensive work has been done to provide rule-based systems with explanatory interfaces, but little has been done to provide the same benefits for model-based systems. We develop an approach to organizing the presentation of large amounts of model-based data in an interactive format patterned after a model of human-human explanatory and argumentative discourse. Portions of this interface were implemented for Honeywell's model-based Flight Control Maintenance and Diagnostic System (FCMDS). We conclude that sufficient information exists in a model-based system to provide a wide range of explanation types, and that, the discourse approach is a convenient, powerful and broadly applicable method of organizing and controlling information exchange involving this data.
