Concurrent p rocessor supercomputers are yet ano ther emerg ing real i ty to be reckoned with in prepar ing appropr iate curr icula for the remainder of the 1980s and beyond. Old prob lems need to be revisi ted and re fo rmu la ted fo r so lut ion on concur ren t comput ing systems. Such systems will soon be marketed. For tunate ly fo r us, learning to exp lo i t and teach the use of concurrent computer systems is exci t ing and reward ing work. At least one new book present ing concur rent a lgor i thms fo r wel l known problems, aimed at graduate students and faculty, wil l be appear ing short ly; it and s imi lar books are l ikely t o t r igger a new wave of text and course deve lopment ta i lored fo r undergraduates. The conclusion is inescapable that concurrent compute r sys tems and the i r use are another essential and at t ract ive facet of the compute r phenomenon, and ano ther intel lectual chal lenge set before us all. Fortunately, " th inking concur ren t l y " is fun! key words: concurrent a lgor i thms, concurrent processing, concur ren t p rogramming, hypercube architecture
