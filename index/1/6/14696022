This paper describes an algebraic data type specification language, called ADTS, and its associated rapid prototyping environment. ADTS is a specification and design language that supports constructivity and includes software engineering principles as modularity, parameterization and error and exception handling. Rapid prototyping provides a means for the early execution of specifications. In particular a translator that compiles constructive specifications into a high level language program and its associated environment is discussed.
