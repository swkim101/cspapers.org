A safe and deadlock free lock policy is introduced, called pre-analysis locking. Pre-analysis locking is based on an efficient geometric algorithm which inserts lock and unlock operations into the transactions. Pre-analysis locking is the first safe and deadlock free general locking policy which is not a variant of two-phase locking. It is an approach con- ceptually different from policies following the two-phase locking principle. In general, none of pre-analysis lock- ing and two-phase locking dominates the other: there exist cases in which pre-analysis locking allows for more concur- rency than any two-phase locking policy, but there are also cases in which a two-phase locking policy allows for more concurrency than pre-analysis locking.
