The main aim of the MIMA (Mining Information for Management and Acquisition) Search System is to achieve 'structuring knowledge' to accelerate knowledge exploitation in the domains of science and technology. This system integrates natural language processing including ontology development, information retrieval, visualization, and database technology. The 'structuring knowledge' that we define indicates 1) knowledge storage, 2) (hierarchical) classification of knowledge, 3) analysis of knowledge, 4) visualization of knowledge. We aim at integrating different types of databases (papers and patents, technologies and innovations) and knowledge domains, and simultaneously retrieving different types of knowledge. Applications for the several targets such as syllabus structuring will also be mentioned.
