Performance is an essential aspect of many software systems, and it is important for programmers to understand performance issues. However, most undergraduate curricula do not explicitly cover performance issues---performance monitoring and profiling tools, performance improvement techniques, and case studies---in their curricula. This paper describes how we address this topic as part of a third-year programming course. We focus on tools and techniques for monitoring and improving performance, as well as the interaction between clean program design and performance tuning.
