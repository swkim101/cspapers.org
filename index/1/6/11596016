Transfer learning can improve the reinforcement learning of a new task by allowing the agent to reuse knowledge acquired from other source tasks. Despite their success, transfer learning methods rely on having relevant source tasks; transfer from inappropriate tasks can inhibit performance on the new task. For fully autonomous transfer, it is critical to have a method for automatically choosing relevant source tasks, which requires a similarity measure between Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). This issue has received little attention, and is therefore still a largely open problem. This paper presents a data-driven automated similarity measure for MDPs. This novel measure is a significant step toward autonomous reinforcement learning transfer, allowing agents to: (1) characterize when transfer will be useful and, (2) automatically select tasks to use for transfer. The proposed measure is based on the reconstruction error of a restricted Boltzmann machine that attempts to model the behavioral dynamics of the two MDPs being compared. Empirical results illustrate that this measure is correlated with the performance of transfer and therefore can be used to identify similar source tasks for transfer learning.
