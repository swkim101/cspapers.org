This paper suggests a modified variable-gain PID controller. The proposed control method is verified through stability criteria, robustness analysis, and system sensitivity. The parameter multiplier is used for the robustness of the PID controller. This method is possible to increase system robustness without the change of a controller already constructed and used. Furthermore, the bounds of robustness can be determined by adjusting the parameter multiplier. The experimental controller uses a parameter multiplier to control the teleoperation system with the arm-harness mechanism for the wrist motion. A performance of the control method is verified through stability criteria and experiment.
