A page transition operation on touch interfaces is a common and frequent subtask when one conducts a drag-like operation such as selecting text and dragging an icon. Traditional page transition gestures such as scrolling and flicking gestures, however, cannot be conducted while conducting the drag-like operation since they have a confliction. We proposed Push-Push that is a new drag-like operation not in conflict with page transition operations. Thus, page transition operations could be conducted while performing Push-Push. To design Push-Push, we utilized the hover and pressed states as additional input states of touch interfaces. The results from two experiments showed that Push-Push has an advantage on increasing performance and qualitative opinions of users while reducing the subjective overload.
