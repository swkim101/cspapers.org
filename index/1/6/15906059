Multimedia transmission is an important component of the Web-based robotic applications which often serve multiple users concurrently. However, the multimedia transmission in large networks such as Internet is suffered from the hugeness and heterogeneity of the users. In this paper, an adaptive transmission strategy based on MLDA is designed to accommodate with the multicast environment. Improvement to MLDA is proposed for applications of the Web-based robotic system, as in the behaviors of the multimedia sender and receiver, synchronization mechanism and estimation of TCP-friendly transmission rate. Finally, a preliminary simulation for the estimation of TCP-friendly transmission rate is demonstrated.
