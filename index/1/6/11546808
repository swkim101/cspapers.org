We introduce a new segmentation evaluation measure, WinPR, which resolves some of the limitations of WindowDiff. WinPR distinguishes between false positive and false negative errors; produces more intuitive measures, such as precision, recall, and F-measure; is insensitive to window size, which allows us to customize near miss sensitivity; and is based on counting errors not windows, but still provides partial reward for near misses.
