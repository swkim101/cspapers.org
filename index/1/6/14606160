We explore the relation between word sense subjectivity and cross-lingual lexical substitution, following the intuition that good substitutions will transfer a word's (contextual) sentiment from the source language into the target language. Experiments on English-Chinese lexical substitution show that taking a word's subjectivity into account can indeed improve performance. We also show that just using word sense subjectivity can perform as well as integrating fully-fledged fine-grained word sense disambiguation for words which have both subjective and objective senses.
