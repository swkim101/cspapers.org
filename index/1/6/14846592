Classification trees are one of the most popular types of classifiers, with ease of implementation and interpretation being among their attractive features. Despite the widespread use of classification trees, theoretical analysis of their performance is scarce. In this paper, we show that a new family of classification trees, called dyadic classification trees (DCTs), are near optimal (in a minimax sense) for a very broad range of classification problems. This demonstrates that other schemes (e.g., neural networks, support vector machines) cannot perform significantly better than DCTs in many cases. We also show that this near optimal performance is attained with linear (in the number of training data) complexity growing and pruning algorithms. Moreover, the performance of DCTs on benchmark datasets compares favorably to that of standard CART, which is generally more computationally intensive and which does not possess similar near optimality properties. Our analysis stems from theoretical results on structural risk minimization, on which the pruning rule for DCTs is based.
