SUSPENSE is a high-level specification language for partial differential equations (PDEs) and related areas in numerical analysis. The language offers facilities to describe and manipulate numerical objects such as vectors, matrices, domains, grids etc. at a high level of abstraction. Sequential algorithms can be formulated by means of general iterators which describe (in contrast to procedural programming languages) only partial orders on objects. Parallelism is obtained in a domain-specific way by splitting numerical objects such as grids, vectors etc. into segments which will be processed in parallel. The specification language is supported by a system which checks specifications and transforms them into parallel programs. Algorithms specified and transformed in SUSPENSE are tailored to the parallel SUPRENUM machine [BGM 86].
