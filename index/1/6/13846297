Being an architectural style rather than a specification or a standard, the proper design of REpresentational State Transfer (REST) APIs is not trivial, since developers have to deal with a flood of recommendations and best practices, especially the proper application of the hypermedia constraint requires some decent experience. Furthermore, testing RESTful APIs is a missing topic within literature and especially, hypermedia testing is not mentioned at all. To deal with this state of affairs, we have elaborated a Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD) approach for creating RESTful APIs. As this project matured, we also explored the possibility of Model-Driven Testing (MDT). This work addresses the challenges of hypermedia testing and proposes approaches to overcome them with MDT techniques. We present the results of hypermedia testing for RESTful APIs using a model verification approach that were discovered within our research. MDT enables the verification of the underlying model of a RESTful API and ensuring its correctness before initiating any code generation. Therefore, we can prevent a poorly designed model from being transformed into a poorly designed RESTful API.
