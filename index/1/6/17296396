Presents a general framework for the dynamic simulation and haptic exploration of complex virtual environments. This work builds on previous developments in simulation, haptics and operational space control. The relations between the dynamic models used in simulation and the models originally developed for robotic control are also presented. This framework has been used to develop a simulator that can model complex interactions between generalized articulated mechanical systems and permits direct "hands-on" interaction with the virtual environment through a haptic interface.
