Strongtalk TM is a typechecker for a downwardcompatible Smalltalk dialect. It is designed for large-scale production software development, and incorporates a strong, modern structural type system. It not only separates the notions of type and class, but also deals with the more dicult issue of separating inheritance and subtyping using the notion of inherited types [CHC90, Bru93a] to preserve encapsulation. Strongtalk integrates inherited types, metaclasses, blocks and polymorphic methods into a highly usable, full-scale language.
