The results discussed in this paper are relevant to a large database consisting of consumer profile information together with behavioral (transaction) patterns. The focus of this paper is on the problem of online mining of profile association rules in this large database. The profile association rule problem is closely related to the quantitative association rule problem. We show how to use multidimensional indexing structures in order to perform the mining. The use of multidimensional indexing structures to perform profile mining provides considerable advantages in terms of the ability to perform very generic range based online queries.
