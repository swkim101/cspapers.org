In this peper, we explore an approach of interle&ing a bushy execution tree with hash filters to improve the execution of multi-join queries. The effect of hash filters is evaluated first. Then, an efficient scheme to determine nn effective sequence of hnsh filters for a bushy execution tree is developed, where hash filters are built and applied based on the join sequence specified in the bushy tree so that not only is the reduction effect optimised but also the cost associated is minimised. Various schemes using hash filters are implemented and evaluated via simulation. It is experimentally shown that the application of hash filters is in general a very powerful means to improve the execution of multi-join queries, and the improvement becomes more prominent M the number of relations in a query increases.
