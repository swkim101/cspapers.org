This paper describes a control architecture design and a system integration strategy for the autonomous service robot PSR (Public Service Robot). The PSR is under development at the KIST (Korea Institute of Science and Technology) for service tasks in public spaces such as office buildings and hospitals. The proposed control architecture is designed by tripodal frameworks, which are layered functionality diagram, class diagram, and configuration diagram. The tripodal schematic design clearly points out the way of integrating various hardware and software components. The developed strategy is implemented on the PSR and successfully tested.
