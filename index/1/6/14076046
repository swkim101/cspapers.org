This paper explains the design automation strategy developed at the Ferranti Electronics C.A.D. Centre for the Uncommitted Logic Array (U.L.A.). This strategy was to develop a modular automated design system for the single layer metallisation U.L.A.'s which automatically referred a central design document - the logic diagram. The system handles the function of auto layout and checking. It also links into the logic analysis and test schedule verification system.
