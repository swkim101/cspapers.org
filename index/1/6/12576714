These tasks are designed to measure various skills of an agent, such as: fact based question-answering, simple induction, the ability to find paths, co-reference resolution and many more. Their goal is to aid in the development of systems that can learn to solve such tasks and to allow a proper evaluation of such systems. They show existing systems cannot fully solve many of those toy tasks. In this work, we present a system that excels at all the tasks except one. The proposed model of the agent uses the Answer Set Programming (ASP) language as the primary knowledge representation and reasoning language along with the standard statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Given a training dataset containing a set of narrations, questions and their answers, the agent jointly uses a translation system, an Inductive Logic Programming algorithm and Statistical NLP methods to learn the knowledge needed to answer similar questions. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of a reasoning module significantly improves the performance of an intelligent agent.
