The design of proportional plus derivative (P-D) feedback eigenstructure assignment with minimum control effort is considered in a class of second-order dynamic systems. By utilizing the result of parametric eigenstructure assignment via P-D feedback proposed in, the design problem is formulated as a constrained minimization problem and a corresponding algorithm for this minimization problem is then proposed. This minimization involves the closed-loop eigenvalues as well as a group of parameter vectors when the closed-loop eigenvalues are not prescribed. Due to the simplicity, explicity and completeness of eigenstructure assignment, the proposed algorithm is simple and efficient. A three lumped mass-spring dashpot system and the simulation results show the effect of this proposed algorithm
