We demonstrate that it is possible to automatically identify and often fix inaccuracies and resolve ambiguities in a large pool of inaccurately and ambiguously labelled face images. Rich and complex datasets tend to be inaccurately labelled. Cleaning up the labelling automatically makes it possible to perform recognition experiments on interesting real-world datasets. We show quite good face clustering is possible for such a dataset. Our dataset is 45,000 face images, obtained by applying a face finder to approximately half a million captioned news images. This dataset is more realistic than usual face recognition datasets, because it contains faces captured “in the wild” in a variety of configurations with respect to the camera, taking a variety of expressions, and under illumination of widely varying color. Each face image is associated with a set of names, automatically extracted from the associated caption. Many, but not all such sets contain the correct name. We cluster face images in appropriate discriminant coordinates. We use a clustering procedure to break ambiguities in labelling and identify incorrectly labelled faces. A merging procedure then identifies variants of names that refer to the same individual. The resulting representation can be used to label faces in news images or to organize news pictures by individuals present. An alternative view of our procedure is as a process that cleans up noisy supervised data. We demonstrate how to use entropy measures to evaluate such procedures, and compare a variety of methods for cleaning up our face data set.
