In this paper, we will present a device specially designed on the basis of the theory of empty categories. This device cooperates with a bottom-up parser and is used as an elegant and efficient approach to treat the troublesome problems of the transformations of passivization, relativization; topicalization, ba-transformation and the use of zero pronouns in Chinese natural language. With the aid of the device, the grammar rules for Chinese will be much more simplified and easier to design, and the processing capability can be significantly improved.
