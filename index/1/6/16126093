The evidence reasoning is one method to reason uncertainty of artificial intelligence and has better performance of decision ability under the uncertainty situation. In this paper, the evidence reasoning is introduced to distributed decision system. The method is presented to distributed intelligent decision based on the transferable belief model. The agent model and distributed decision system architecture are built from the point of view of information fusion. The algorithms of informationâ€™s extracting and combination and of decision-making are provided. This method is applied to the situation assessment of SimuroSot.
