The ring is a useful means of structuring concurrent processes. Processes communicate by passing a token in a fixed direction; the process that possesses the token is allowed to make certain moves. Usually, correctness properties are expected to hold irrespective of the size of the ring. We show that the problem of checking many useful correctness properties for rings of all sizes can be reduced to checking them on a ring of small size. The results do not depend on the processes being finite state. We illustrate our results on examples.
