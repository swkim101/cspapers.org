With the recent growth of Linked Data on the Web, there is an increased need for knowledge engineers to find ontologies to describe their data. Only limited work exists that addresses the problem of searching and ranking ontologies based on keyword queries. In this proposal we introduce the main challenges to find appropriate ontologies, and preliminary solutions to address these challenges. Our evaluation shows that the proposed solution performs significantly better than existing solutions on a benchmark ontology collection for the majority of the sample queries defined in the benchmark.
