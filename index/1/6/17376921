Variability in software product lines is often expressed through feature models (FMs). To handle the complexity of increasingly larger FMs, we propose semantically meaningful decomposition support through a slicing operator. We describe how the slicing operator is integrated into the FAMILIAR environment and how it can be combined with other operators to support complex tasks over FMs in different case studies.
