Answering natural language questions over a knowledge base is an important and challenging task. Most of existing systems typically rely on hand-crafted features and rules to conduct question understanding and/or answer ranking. In this paper, we introduce multi-column convolutional neural networks (MCCNNs) to understand questions from three different aspects (namely, answer path, answer context, and answer type) and learn their distributed representations. Meanwhile, we jointly learn low-dimensional embeddings of entities and relations in the knowledge base. Question-answer pairs are used to train the model to rank candidate answers. We also leverage question paraphrases to train the column networks in a multi-task learning manner. We use FREEBASE as the knowledge base and conduct extensive experiments on the WEBQUESTIONS dataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves better or comparable performance compared with baseline systems. In addition, we develop a method to compute the salience scores of question words in different column networks. The results help us intuitively understand what MCCNNs learn.
