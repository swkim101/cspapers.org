Satisfiability (SAT) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) have been used in solving a wide variety of important and challenging problems, including automatic test generation, model checking, and program synthesis. For these applications to scale to larger problem instances, developers cannot rely solely on the sophistication of SAT and SMT solvers to efficiently solve their queries; they must also optimize their own orchestration and construction of queries. We present Smten, a high-level language for orchestrating and constructing satisfiability-based search queries. We show that applications developed using Smten require significantly fewer lines of code and less developer effort to achieve results comparable to standard SMT-based tools.
