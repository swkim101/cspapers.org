While currently difficult to measure or explicitly design for, evidence suggests that providing people 
with opportunities to reflect on experience must be recognized and valued during safety-critical 
work. We provide an insight into reflection as a mechanism that can help to maintain both individual 
and team goals. In the control room, reflection can be task-based, critical for the 'smooth' day-to-day 
operational performance of a socio-technical system, or can foster learning and organisational change 
by enabling new understandings gained from experience. In this position paper we argue that 
technology should be designed to support the reflective capacity of people. There are many 
interaction designs and artefacts that aim to support problem-solving, but very few that support 
self-reflection and group reflection. Traditional paradigms for safety-critical systems have focussed 
on ensuring the functional correctness of designs, minimising the time to complete tasks, etc. Work 
in the area of user experience design may be of increasing relevance when generating artefacts that 
aim to encourage reflection.
