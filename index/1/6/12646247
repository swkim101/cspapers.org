A realtime visual intonation-display system for the teaching of intonation is presented. This system can be used for the teaching of intonation of foreign languages to second-language learners and of intonation of native language to deaf persons. In contrast to other visual-display systems, the visual feedback on intonation is given as a continuous representation of the pitch contour. The pitch contour contains only the perceptually relevant variations in pitch. That is, the course of the pitch contour is approximated with the help of a small number of straight lines resulting in the so-called stylized pitch contour.
