The video presents high power, high precision and high speed drive of on-chip robot and its biomedical applications. The magnetically driven microtool (MMT) actuated by permanent magnets was employed as a microrobot because of its strong output force in the order of millinewtons and the ultrasonic vibration was applied to the microfluidic chip in order to reduce the friction on the MMT. We have achieved 1.1 Âµm positioning accuracy of the MMT and applied this drive method to the enucleation of oocyte process. The dual-arm MMT removed the nucleus part in a few seconds.
