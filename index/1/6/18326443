In this paper, we drew new security threats on IoT (Internet of Thing) based modern battlefield (Network centric battlefield). DoD is focusing its attention on the development of unmanned combat systems to prepare for future war. The IoT technology provides networking service to connect each other unmanned combat system. IoT has the security vulnerabilities of each element of the technology itself because the technology integrates several components to configure a specific service. And new security vulnerabilities will be caused when they are interconnecting. In military information communication technology, we should concern in four perspectives; illegal remote control, information leakage, false information insert, and signal disturbance.
