In this paper the functional uncertainty machinery in LFG is compared with the treatment of long distance dependencies in TAG. It is shown that the functional uncertainty machinery is redundant in TAG, i.e., what functional uncertainty accomplishes for LFG follows from the TAG formalism itself and some aspects of the linguistic theory instantiated in TAG. It is also shown that the analyses provided by the functional uncertainty machinery can be obtained without requiring power beyond mildly context-sensitive grammars. Some linguistic and computational aspects of these results have been briefly discussed also.
