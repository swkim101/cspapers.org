Introductory courses in information systems are typically taught as computer “literacy” courses; in computer science they are oriented to “algorithm development”. The course described in this paper is concerned with providing the student with facility in the top-down development of hierarchically related systems of programs to be used in a business context. It is considered critical to orient students to this conceptual approach early on in their professional education. The course has been offered for four terms and has been well received by students and valuable for continued educational development in later courses in the curriculum.
