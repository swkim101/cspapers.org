Business process model and data model play important roles in information system construction. They represent two different perspectives of business knowledge, and are closely related. A trouble to the model quality is the inconsistency between business process model and data model, which can often conduce to interaction errors. While finding such inconsistency is a meaningful problem, it receives little attention in available verification methods. We concentrate on this problem and identify some consistency anomalies between process model and data model. In our paper, a verification method PDGV is proposed to verify the consistency between process model and data model. Implemented prototype reveals that our scheme can detect consistency anomalies effectively.
