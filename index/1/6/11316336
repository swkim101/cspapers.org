In this paper, we conjecture that LfD can be used to develop robot behavior capable of interacting socially with humans, in scenarios such as a sharing the use of a playful and educational app. These demonstrations, we argue, should be provided within a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm. Thus, we refer to LfD for social human-robot interaction as learning from the wizard (LfW). We describe the corresponding algorithmic and experimental framework and explore challenges in designing LfW systems. Finally, we describe two ongoing projects involving LfD for human-robot interaction, along with a robotic platform and cognitive architecture that are common between the two projects.
