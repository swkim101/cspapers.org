This work tries to answer the question of what makes a query difficult. It addresses a novel model that captures the main components of a topic and the relationship between those components and topic difficulty. The three components of a topic are the textual expression describing the information need (the query or queries), the set of documents relevant to the topic (the Qrels), and the entire collection of documents. We show experimentally that topic difficulty strongly depends on the distances between these components. In the absence of knowledge about one of the model components, the model is still useful by approximating the missing component based on the other components. We demonstrate the applicability of the difficulty model for several uses such as predicting query difficulty, predicting the number of topic aspects expected to be covered by the search results, and analyzing the findability of a specific domain.
