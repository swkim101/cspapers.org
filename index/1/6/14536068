This research combines three distinct areas: domain-specific modeling, object-oriented application frameworks and round-trip engineering. We introduce framework-specific modeling languages (FSMLs) which are used for the modeling of framework-based software and enable automated round-trip engineering. We describe a prototype implementation of an example FSML. We also present research outline and future work
