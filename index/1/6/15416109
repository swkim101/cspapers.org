The increasing use of mobile devices and the dissemination of wireless networks have stimulated mobile and ubiquitous computing research. In this context, education is being considered one of the main application areas. New pedagogical opportunities are created through the use of location systems to track learners, and through context awareness support. This paper proposes a model to explore these opportunities using location information and context management as learning support tools. This model, called LOCAL, was conceived for small scale learning environments, but can be applied in large-scale as well. The model was implemented and the initial results show its utility to assist the teaching and learning processes.
