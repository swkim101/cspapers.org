Quadrupedal locomotion on sloped terrains poses different challenges than walking in a mostly flat environment. The robot's configuration needs to be explicitly controlled in order to avoid slipping and kinematic limits. To this end, information about the terrain's inclination is required for carefully planning footholds, the pose of the main body, and modulation of the ground reaction forces. This is even more important for dynamic trotting, as only two support legs are available to compensate for gravity and drive a desired motion. We propose a reliable method for estimating the parameters of the terrain quadrupedal robots move on, in the face of limited perception capabilities and drifting robot pose estimates. By fusing inertial measurements, kinematic data from joint encoders and contact information from force sensors, the local inclination can be robustly estimated and used to optimize the contact forces to reduce slippage. The estimated terrain information, namely the pitch and roll angles of the ground plane, is exploited in an extended version of our previous model-based control approach. Our improved control framework enabled StarlETH, a medium-sized, fully autonomous, torque-controllable quadrupedal robot, to trot on slopes of up to 21Â°.
