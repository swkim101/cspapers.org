Medication dispensers treated in this paper are designed to help improve compliance by users who live at homes and take medications over long periods of time. The paper first presents an overview of medication specifications that define constraints for dispensers and dispenser components that administer medications as specified. When given a specification and constraints defined by it, the dispenser scheduler checks for consistency and feasibility of constraints and schedules medications to meet the constraints. Several basic algorithms needed for these purposes are described and evaluated
