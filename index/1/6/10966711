Indexing and retrieval of structured documents have been drawing attention increasingly since they enable to retrieve and access a certain part of a document easily. So far, several methods have been proposed in the setting that documents are rarely changed. These can be applied for the books or journals possessed in libraries, but hardly work for the documents that are subject to change frequently in the business domain. This paper aims at enabling incremental update of indices whenever parts of documents are changed. For this, it employs the index-organized table that has been developed for the full-text retrieval in Oracle. It creates several index-organized tables that are essential in implementing the Bottom Up Scheme strategy, which has been developed for manipulating structured documents efficiently.
Along with an experiment, the technique presented here does not add much index overhead to the original one taken to the index organized table. In addition, the updates of indices are performed quickly as soon as parts of documents are changed.
