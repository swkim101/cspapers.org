We investigate different ways of learning structured perceptron models for coreference resolution when using non-local features and beam search. Our experimental results indicate that standard techniques such as early updates or Learning as Search Optimization (LaSO) perform worse than a greedy baseline that only uses local features. By modifying LaSO to delay updates until the end of each instance we obtain significant improvements over the baseline. Our model obtains the best results to date on recent shared task data for Arabic, Chinese, and English.
