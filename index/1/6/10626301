This paper presents and evaluates a class of buffered interconnection networks which provide performance and cost levels intermediate to a bus and a delta network. These networks, referred to as hybrid networks, are formed by beginning with a delta network and substituting buses for the final stages of the network. The choice of the number of stages replaced determines the bandwidth of the network. The reduction of network bandwidth is accompanied by a corresponding reduction in network cost. Hybrid networks provide the system architect with a cost-effective solution to design problems in which the required interconnection bandwidth is greater than that of a bus but less than that of a full delta network.
The performance of hybrid networks is investigated by developing a numerical model and by using simulation. Two features of the model, buffers of arbitrary length at network switches and resource service times greater than interstage transfer delays, have not been included in previous analytical models of delta networks. Results show that in some cases, the expense of a multistage network is not required in order to maintain the maximum level of system performance.
