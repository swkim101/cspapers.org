The role of discrete mathematics in secondary mathematics courses has become an extremely important issue in recent years and has been addressed extensively by several national organizations. This paper discusses a summer Institute in discrete matltematics for high school teachers. A detailed outline is presented. Our survey indicated the participants of the Institute had “none” to “vague” prior exposure to 7190 of the discrete mathematics topics presented in the course. The significant difference between this Institute and possibly others is the use of Mathematical as an integral part of the Institute. Mathematical provides an additional reinforcement of the material presented, especially in the area of graph theory and combinatorics. Mathematical can be a powerful motivating force and problem solving tool for high school students in their development of mathematical skills. We are encouraged by the success of this Institute in providing a needed service in our community. We hope the work reported in this paper will encourage others to develop similar Institutes in their communities.
