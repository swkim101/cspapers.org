In order to improve performance of analog signal transmission, we recently proposed a novel analog single-carrier transmission with frequency-domain equalization (analog SC-FDE). Analog SC-FDE adopts double sideband (DSB) technique (referred to as analog SC-DSB-FDE) to transmit signal. In this paper, in order to double the spectrum efficiency of analog SC-DSB-FDE, single sideband (SSB) technique is introduced. Analog SC-SSB-FDE applies discrete Fourier transform (DFT), frequency-domain spectrum shaping filter and mapping, inverse DFT (IDFT), and cyclic prefix (CP) insertion before transmission. At the receiver, one-tap FDE is applied to take advantage of frequency diversity and a spectrum copy for restoring spectrum is applied. By computer simulation, we show that analog SC-SSB-FDE achieves better normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance than conventional analog SSB transmission and keeps the performance quality similar to analog SC-DSB-FDE.
