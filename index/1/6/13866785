In this work, we present an algorithm that simultaneously searches for a high quality fingertip grasp and a collision-free path for a robot hand-arm system to achieve it. The algorithm combines a bidirectional sampling-based motion planning approach with a hierarchical contact optimization process. Rather than tackling these problems in a decoupled manner, the grasp optimization is guided by the proximity to collision-free configurations explored by the motion planner. We implemented the algorithm for a 13-DoF manipulator and show that it is capable of efficiently planning reachable high quality grasps in cluttered environments. Further, we show that our algorithm outperforms a decoupled integration in terms of planning runtime.
