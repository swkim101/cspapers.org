We present a cache oblivious algorithm for stencil computations, which arise for example in finite-difference methods. Our algorithm applies to arbitrary stencils in <i>n</i>-dimensional spaces. On an "ideal cache" of size <i>Z</i>, our algorithm saves a factor of Î˜(<i>Z</i><sup>1/<i>n</i></sup>) cache misses compared to a naive algorithm, and it exploits temporal locality optimally throughout the entire memory hierarchy.
