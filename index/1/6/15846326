A systematic design method of a communication system is given, by which the design, validation, implementation and maintenance of the system can be developed under the consistent philosophy. Next, the DAI-expression method for describing communication protocols is proposed to support the above design method. Here, the DAI-expression consists of three types of expressions, namely, the D-expression, A-expression and I-expression depending upon the purposes such as design, validation and implementation. And the new design language COPDEL is given as the D-expression which is a logical design-oriented expression. Finally, the validation algorithm EXPA is given, which is a generalization of the perturbation analysis given by C.H.West. Furthermore, the EXPA can validate communication protocols described by the COPDEL.
