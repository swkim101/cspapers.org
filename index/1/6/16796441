The proliferation of electronically available data within large organizations as well as publicly available data (e.g. over the World Wide Web) poses challenges for users who wish to efficiently interact with and integrate multiple heterogeneous sources. This paper presents CI3, a corporate information integrator, which applies XML as a tool to facilitate data mediation and integration amongst heterogeneous sources in the context of financial analysts creating corporate profiles. Sources include Lotus Notes, relational databases, and the World Wide Web. CI3 applies a unified XML data model to automate integration. By preserving metadata about the source of each datum in the integrated result set, CI3 supports source attribution. Users may trace the attribution metadata from the result back to the underlying sources and leverage their expertise in interpreting the data and, if necessary, use their judgment in assessing the authenticity and veracity of results. We present a functional overview of CI3, its system architecture including the XML data model, and the integration procedures. We conclude by reflecting on lessons learned.
