Abstract In this paper the frequency distribution of quantization error in coherent sampling of digitizers will be investigated. As the distribution of the quantization error affects the values of THD and SNR, it is relevant for a correct interpretation of THD and SNR of sine waves in coherent sampling. The distribution of the quantization error will be analyzed as a function of N, total number of samples and M, number of cycles in the sample set and it will be proved that for certain cases, the quantization error falls on odd harmonics only of the frequency of the sampled sine wave.
