Software errors in distributed systems are difficult to detect, locate and correct. The relational database approach in software diagnostics is an integrated approach encompassing most features in static analysis, dynamic testing, symbolic execution and performance evaluation techniques. Modified syntax analysis of source program and testing run of the instrumented code generate the basis relations (symbol tables, graph models, program fragments, execution histories) from which diagnostic information is retrieved interactively. The basis relations contain necessary information to diagnose the software since data structures, algorithms and execution behavior of the software are included. Implementations of some typical dynamic testing features extended to distributed software are discussed and illustrated.
