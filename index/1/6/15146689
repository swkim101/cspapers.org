We consider the problem of finding the row maxima of a totally monotone n x n matrix. Many geometric and combinatorial problems can be solved efficiently by reductions to this problem. It is known that the row maxima of a totally monotone n x n matrix can be computed sequentially in O(n) time. We give randomized parallel algorithms for this problem which run in O(log n) time and O(loglog n) time with high probability on the EREW and CRCW PRAMS respectively, and have a time-processor product of O(n). The run-times are the best possible, even for randomized parallel algorithms. Previous polylogarithmic time parallel solutions to this problem had a time-processor product of O(n log n/ log log n) or worse. Our result directly improves the parallel complexity of several problems.
