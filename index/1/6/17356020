With advances in technology, mobile handheld devices-such as PDAs-have become very popular. In many real-life situations, users want to find structuring information using these mobile devices, which are convenient to use but have relatively limited resources. In this paper, we present a top-k structured mobile Web search engine. It uses a top-k adaptable search-tree method that utilizes hierarchical structure of hypermedia objects to effectively look for structuring information from the mobile Web model. The engine, which is implemented in the mobile environment, provides users with top-k adaptive Web search recommendations for mobile handheld devices.
