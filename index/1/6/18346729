We show how to transform the B-spline curve and surface fitting problems into suffix computations of continued fractions. Then a parallel substitution scheme is introduced to compute the suffix values on a newly proposed mesh-of-unshuffle network. The derived parallel algorithm allows the curve interpolation through <italic>n</italic> points to be solved in &Ogr;(log <italic>n</italic>) time using &THgr;<italic>n</italic>/log <italic>n</italic>) processors and allows the surface interpolation through <italic>m</italic> x <italic>n</italic> points to be solved in &Ogr;(log <italic>m</italic> log <italic>n</italic>) time using &THgr; (<italic>mn</italic>/(log <italic>m</italic> log <italic>n</italic>)) processors. Both interpolation algorithms are cost-optimal for their respective problems. Besides, the surface fitting problem can be even faster solved in &Ogr;(log <italic>m</italic> + log <italic>n</italic>) time if &THgr;(<italic>mn</italic>) processors are used in the network.
