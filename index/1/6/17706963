We present CloakingNote, a novel desktop interface for subtle writing. The main idea of CloakingNote is to misdirect observers' attention away from a real text by using a prominent decoy text. To assess the subtlety of CloakingNote, we conducted a subtlety test while varying the contrast ratio between the real text and its background. Our results demonstrated that the real text as well as the interface itself were subtle even when participants were aware that a writer might be engaged in suspicious activities. We also evaluated the feasibility of CloakingNote through a performance test and categorized the users' layout strategies.
