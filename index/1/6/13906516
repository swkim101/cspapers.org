This paper presents an approach to partial parse selection for robust deep processing. The work is based on a bottom-up chart parser for HPSG parsing. Following the definition of partial parses in (Kasper et al., 1999), different partial parse selection methods are presented and evaluated on the basis of multiple metrics, from both the syntactic and semantic viewpoints. The application of the partial parsing in spontaneous speech texts processing shows promising competence of the method.
