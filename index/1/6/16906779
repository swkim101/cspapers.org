We propose a multi-document generic summarization model based on the budgeted median problem. Our model selects sentences to generate a summary so that every sentence in the document cluster can be assigned to and be represented by a sentence in the summary as much as possible. The advantage of this model is that it covers the entire relevant part of the document cluster through sentence assignment and can incorporate asymmetric relations between sentences such as textual entailment.
