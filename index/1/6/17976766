Adaptive learning systems aim to precisely tailor education and training to the individual needs of learners. Such systems use an internal model of a user's current knowledge to adjust the navigational affordances and presentation order of material. The user model is incrementally built and updated as the user demonstrates mastery by completing exercises and tests. Designing courses that are delivered adaptively involves addressing many complexities. This paper describes experiences designing the first adaptive module in a series intended to teach software testing skills. Experiences in using the first module and a preliminary evaluation of its effectiveness are presented.
