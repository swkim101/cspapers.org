The ITT/NET is an internal corporate network built to satisfy the distributed programming requirements of ITT technology and engineering communities. This paper describes the network: its goals, its architecture, its operational environment and prototype development activities.
 The various issues involved in the construction of a Corporate Network based upon diverse, existing systems and communication methods are described in detail. The architectural and implementation decisions are discussed and justified. The programming process and the methodologies adopted are presented and some conclusions are drawn as to the practicality and usefulness of formal development methods in the context of this particular project.
