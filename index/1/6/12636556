In an asteroid exploration and sample return mission, accurate estimation of the shape and motion of the target asteroid is essential for selecting a touchdown site and navigating a spacecraft during touchdown operation. In this work, we present an automatic estimation method for the shape and motion of an asteroid, which is planned to be tested in future exploration missions including Japanese Hayabusa-2 [1]. Our task is to estimate the shape and rotation axis of the asteroid, as well as positions of the spacecraft from optical images. The proposed method is based on the expectation conditional-maximization (ECM) framework that consists of an auxiliary particle filter and nonlinear optimization techniques. One of our technical contributions is the estimation of the direction of rotation axis of the asteroid from monocular camera images, which are taken by the moving spacecraft. We conducted two experiments with synthetic data and an asteroid mock-up to show the validity of the proposed method and to present the numerical accuracy.
