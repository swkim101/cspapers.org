Autonomous robot navigation through unknown, cluttered environments at high-speeds is still an open problem. Quadrotor platforms with this capability have only begun to emerge with the advancements in light-weight, small form factor sensing and computing. Many of the existing platforms, however, require excessive computation time to perform collision avoidance, which ultimately limits the vehicle's top speed. This work presents an efficient perception and planning approach that significantly reduces the computation time by using instantaneous perception data for collision avoidance. Minimum-time, state and input constrained motion primitives are generated by sampling terminal states until a collision-free path is found. The worst case performance of the Triple Integrator Planner (TIP) is nearly an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to plan and execute aggressive collision avoidance maneuvers in highly cluttered environments.
