This paper discusses the Top SE program established to bridge the industry-academia gap. The program features extensive use of software engineering tools, not only to introduce students to the tools, but also as a conduit for learning the techniques and guidelines needed to apply the tools to practical software development situations. The curriculum is organized around practical problems mainly from the area of digital home appliances and focuses on upper stream software development processes. The Top SE program is developed and operated by a close collaboration between industry and academia. We illustrate our discussion with examples from one of the courses, verification of design models, which takes up model checking technologies, including three specific tools: SPIN, SMV, and LTSA.
