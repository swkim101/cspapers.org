A dual probability model is constructed for the La tent Semantic Indexing (LSI) using the cosine simi larity measure. Both the document-document sim ilarity matrix and the term-term similarity matrix naturally arise from the maximum likelihood esti mation of the model parameters, and the optimal solutions are the latent semantic vectors of of LSI. Dimensionality reduction is justified by the statis tical significance of latent semantic vectors as mea sured by the likelihood of the model. This leads to a statistical criterion for the optimal semantic di mensions, answering a critical open question in LSI with practical importance. Thus the model estab lishes a statistical framework for LSI. Ambiguities related to statistical modeling of LSI are clarified.
