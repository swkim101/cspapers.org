Dynamic web development still borrows heavily from its origins in CGI scripts: modern web applications are largely designed and developed as programs that happen to output HTML. This thesis proposes to investigate the idea taking a mockup-centric approach instead, in which self-contained, full page web mockups are the central artifact driving the application development process. In some cases, these mockups are sufficient to infer the dynamic application structure completely. This approach to mockup driven development is made possible by the development of a language the thesis develops, called Cascading Tree Sheets (CTS), that enables a mockup to be annotated with enough information so that many common web development tasks and workflows can be eliminated or vastly simplified. CTS describes and encapsulates a web page's design structure the same way CSS describes its styles. This enables mockups to serve as the input of a web application rather than simply a design artifact. Using this capability, I will study the feasibility and usability of mockup driven development for a range of novice and expert authorship tasks. The thesis aims to finish by demonstrating that the functionality of a domain-specific content management system can be inferred automatically from site mockups.
