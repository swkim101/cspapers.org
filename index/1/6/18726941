Specifying and enforcing constraints and invariants such as architectural constraints and data typing, strongly enhances the safety and reliability of the software system. Next to design and development constraints, the composition of software systems in component-based software also introduces composition time constraints and dependencies. In data-centered software systems, for example, the software composer implicitly creates dataflow dependencies between software components. Describing composition time constraints and enforcing these constraints at deploy time or at run-time strongly improves the safety and reliability of the software. In this paper, we present an approach for expressing and enforcing dataflow dependencies in data-centered software systems, and conclude with a validation of the approach in a servlet-based case study.
