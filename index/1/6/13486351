Recently, portable devices with wireless network interfaces are becoming more popular than desktop PCs. While multipath coupled congestion control with ”linked increases” algorithm (MPTCP-LIA) and its advanced ”opportunistic linked increases” algorithm (MPTCP-OLIA) were designed for wired networks. As a result, their performance is degraded significantly in wireless environments, where packet losses often are caused by random error rather than by network congestion as in wired networks. In this work, we analyze and evaluate several existing multipath congestion control algorithms, and then propose a design of multipath TCP Veno (MPVeno) for wireless networks. Our simulation results show that MPVeno can achieve better goodput than MPTCP-OLIA over wireless links while preserving fair competition with MPTCP-OLIA in wired networks.
