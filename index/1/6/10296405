SPICED (System of Programs for Integrated Circuit Equipment Design) is a set of machine aids to the design of ceramic substrates containing integrated circuit chips. The major functions are to build and maintain a descriptive data file, place all chips, interconnect the chips with thin film using air-insulated beam type crossovers1 where necessary, document the design, prepare the artmaster, and produce test data to verify that crossovers are not shorted or opened.
