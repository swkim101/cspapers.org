In this paper, we present a framework for building versatile web applications through form-based interaction. Our framework, entitled “Architectural XML Editing Framework,” or “AXEFramework,” is implemented using exclusively existing standards, making it easy to adopt. Furthermore, the framework strives to avoid undue complexity, and thus feature a quick learning curve. These characteristics make it a desirable choice for building large-scale digital archives, and complex enterprise applications.
