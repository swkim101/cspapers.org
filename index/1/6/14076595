Considers the problem of applying ATM technology in designing distributed industrial plant control applications with integrated real-time communication requirements. In particular, we first examine (1) the design space using current ATM service categories and their corresponding traffic models, and (2) the mathematical and practical implications of the traffic models. We then present a taxonomy of the algorithms available to implement the service categories that can provide performance guarantees. Through the examination, we shed light on the gap between what is usually assumed in research and what the actual ATM network will provide. We then show how real-time communication can be mapped onto ATM service categories and demonstrate the limitations of ATM services. Finally, we describe the concept of user-level multiplexing as a means to overcome the limitations.
