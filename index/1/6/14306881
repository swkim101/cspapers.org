In this paper, we present a novel approach for tracking a deformable anatomical target within 3D ultrasound volumes. Our method is able to estimate deformations caused by the physiological motions of the patient. The displacements of moving structures are estimated from an intensity-based approach combined with a physically-based model and has therefore the advantage to be less sensitive to the image noise. Furthermore, our method does not use any fiducial marker and has real-time capabilities. The accuracy of our method is evaluated on real data acquired from an organic phantom. The validation is performed on different types of motions comprising rigid and non-rigid motions. Thus, our approach opens novel possibilities for computer-assisted interventions where deformable organs are involved.
