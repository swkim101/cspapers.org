In this paper a force scaling function for an haptic system is the output of the psychophysics experiments that have been carried out with the aim of better understanding the human perception capabilities. The experimental work consists in measuring the differential thresholds of force perception applied to the hand-arm system. These findings support our claim that the human perception of forces and torques depends on force intensity and works differently along different directions, thus suggesting that perception can be enhanced by suitable scaling. We have identified a scaling function for each direction and we have shown that this variable scalings can be safely embedded in a passivity based teleoperation system in order to improve the feeling perceived by the user during the interaction with remote environments.
