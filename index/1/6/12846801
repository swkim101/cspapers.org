Numerical simulation analysis of the motion of wheeled mobile robots is significant for both their R&D and control phases, especially due to the recent increase in the number of planetary exploration missions. Using the position/orientation of the rover body and all the joint angles as generalized coordinates, the Jacobian matrices and recursive dynamic models are derived. Terramechanics models for calculating the forces and moments that act on the wheel—as a result of the deformable soil—are introduced in consideration of the effect of normal force. A rough terrain modeling method is developed for estimating the wheel-soil interaction area, wheel sinkage, and the terminal coordinate. A simulation program that includes the above techniques is developed using Matlab and SpaceDyn Toolbox. Experimental results from a 4-wheeled mobile robot moving on Toyoura soft sand are used to verify the fidelity of the simulation. A simulation example of a robot moving on a random rough terrain is also presented.
