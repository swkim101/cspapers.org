This poster will present the work of Oopsla 2000 workshop 13, on “Active Learning For Object-Oriented Design”. Many people are introduced to OO concepts, hut only learn the words. This workshop will explore “active learning” techniques for OO design, where innovative teaching strategies are used to allow learners to be actively engaged in design work right from an early point. Our focus is on design mentoring and innovative active strategies. The workshop invites submissions on new techniques, new applications or extensions of well-known techniques, and case studies. The workshop will consist of presentations on these topics, and immediate active experimentation using the techniques.
