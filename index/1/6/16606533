We investigate the problem of self-stabilizing round-robin token management scheme on an anonymous bidirectional ring of identical processors, where each processor is an asynchronous probabilistic (coin-flipping) finite state machine which sends and receives messages. We show that the solution to this problem is equivalent to symmetry breaking (i.e., leader election). Requiring only constant-size messages and message-passing model has practical implications: our solution can be implemented in high-speed networks using a universal fast hardware switches (i.e., finite state machines) of size independent of the size of the network.
