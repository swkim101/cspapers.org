Knowledge-based search tactics are discussed in terms of their role in the functioning of a semantically-based search system for bibliographic information retrieval. This prototype system, EP-X, actively assists users in defining or refining their topics of interest. It does so by applying search tactics to a knowledge-base describing topics in a particular domain and a database describing the contents of individual documents.
This paper reviews the empirical studies that lead to the two central concepts implemented in EP-X:Semantically-based search;Knowledge-based search tactics.
