In this paper we discuss strengths and weaknesses of logic synthesis systems and present a system for microarchitecture and logic optimization. Our system uses a set of algorithms for synthesizing SSI/MSI cells from parameterized microarchitecture components. In addition, it uses rules for optimizing both at the microarchitecture and logic level. The system increases designer productivity and requires less design knowledge and experience from circuit engineers.
