This paper presents a new mobile robotic platform (R-Mo) which can reduce unexpected variations in height as well as pitch angle of its main body while traversing rough terrains. As a measure for the smooth movement of mobile platform, the variations in height and pitch angle are chosen in this study. Then, the kinematic analysis on the Rocker-Bogie mechanism is carried out to investigate its variations in height and pitch angle on rough terrains. Based on this result, a new mobile platform is systematically designed by combining the Rocker-Bogie with the inverse four bar linkage. The extensive experiments are carried out by using the Rocker-Bogie mechanism and the proposed R-Mo against rough terrain, which validate that in comparison with the Rocker-Bogie mechanism, the average and maximum variations in height of proposed R-Mo are reduced by 12.72% and 5.96%, respectively, and the average and maximum variations in pitch angle of proposed R-Mo are considerably reduced by 65.87 % and 60.53 %, respectively.
