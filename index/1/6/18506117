An explicit study of min-wise independent permutation families, together with their variants --- k-restricted, approximate, etc. --- was initiated by Broder, et al[4]. In this paper, we give a lower bound for the size of k-restricted min-wise independent permutation family. A family F of permutations on [0,n-1]=(0,1,...,n-1) is said to be <i>k-restricted min-wise independent</i> if for any subset X ⊆ [0,n-1] with |X| ≤ k and any x ∈ X, Pr[min(π(X))=π(x)] = 1/|X|, when π is randomly chosen from F according to a probability distribution D on the family F. For the minimum size of a family of k-restricted min-wise independent permutations, upper bounds of O(n<sup>k</sup>) for any fixed k have been shown for uniform and biased probability distributions on F. We show that if a family F of permutations on [0,n-1] is k-restricted min-wise independent, then |F| ≥ m(n-1,k-1), where m(n,d) = ∑<inf>i=0</inf><sup>d/2</sup>(<sup>n</sup><inf>i</inf>) if d is even; m(n,d)= ∑<inf>i=0</inf><sup>(d-1)/2</sup>(<sup>n</sup><inf>i</inf>) + (<sup>n-1</sup><inf>(d-1)/2</inf>) otherwise. The lower bound for the size of F still holds when we allow an arbitrary probability distribution on F. Our proof technique is based on linear algebra methods, and can be regarded as a generalization of the result by Alon, Babai, and Itai[1], i.e., if random variables X<inf>1</inf>,X<inf>2</inf>,...,X<inf>n</inf>: Ω → (0,1) are k-wise independent and Pr[X<inf>i</inf>=1] = p<inf>i</inf> is neither 0 nor 1, then |Ω| ≥ m(n,k). By applying our proof technique, we also derive lower bounds for the sample size of the related notions, e.g., k-wise symmetrically independent distributions, k-rankwise independent permutation families, etc.
