This paper describes a program called ASSIST-V which is designed to provide students and other researchers with an environment in which they may write and analyze operating systems for the IBM 360/370 series of machines. ASSIST-V is an extended version of a student-oriented assembler/interpreter called ASSIST. A user of ASSIST-V is presented with a machine which simulates the full set of S/360 machine instructions (including privileged instructions): the standard 360/370 interrupt structure, I/0 channels, and I/0 devices. Since the machine environment is simulated, ASSIST-V can provide debugging and statistics-gathering features not available on an actual “bare” machine.
