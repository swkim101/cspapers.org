This paper describes the evaluation of an NSF-sponsored educational research project. The primary focus of this project was to develop and evaluate a course curriculum designed to improve retention and performance for "at risk" introductory computer science majors. The results of this research suggest that the newly developed course and curriculum materials did improve students' performance and retention in computer science and their attitudes towards computer science.
