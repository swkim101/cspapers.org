We present in this paper a pseudo functional language and a specification language both of which are designed to describe systems of synchronized processes with shared resources. The semantics of the pseudo functional language is defined by translating its statements to the set of formulas of intensional logic. The specification language contains formulas of the logic, hence its semantics can be treated by the model theory as usual. A proof method for the program written in the language is proposed. Time dependent aspects of processes are described in terms of intensional logic. Specification of parallel systems can be described in a well structured manner in our specification language, more precisely, they are described hierarchically according to the function decomposition of the system, and at each level of the hierarchy the configuration of processes and resources and time dependent properties are separately described. Resources are defined as an abstract data type with synchronization specification. We give an example of specification and a proof of a program written in the parallel pseudo functional programming language.
