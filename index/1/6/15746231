The betweenness centrality is a measure for the relative participation of the vertex in the shortest paths in the graph. In many cases, we are interested in the k-highest betweenness centrality vertices only rather than all the vertices in a graph. In this paper, we study an efficient algorithm for finding the exact k-highest betweenness centrality vertices.
