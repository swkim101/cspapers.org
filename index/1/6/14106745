This paper presents empirical results on the performance of CD, a compiler directed memory management policy, and the Working Set policy in a multiprogramming system. A description of the multiprogramming model used in the experiments is also presented. The results show that CD outperforms WS in terms of fault rate, space time cost, and throughput characteristics. Moreover, WS is shown to lack controllability. Two anomaly types are reported in this paper, both of which are exhibited by WS but not by CD.
