The rise in popularity of Twitter in recent years has in parallel led to an increase in online controversies. To monitor and control such conflicts early on, we design and evaluate a language-agnostic classifier to tell pairs of ideological friends from foes. We build the classifier using features from four different aspects: user-based, interaction-based, relationship-based and conflict-based. By experimenting with three large data sets containing diverse conflicts, we demonstrate the effectiveness of language-agnostic classification of ideological relation, achieving satisfactory results across all three data sets. Such a classifier potentially enables studies of diverse conflicts on Twitter on a large scale.
