This paper discusses two aspects of the objectoriented view management system, Multi View, which we designed to simplify view specification. First, we iniroduce a query language for view customization that operates on a complete schema, rather than deriving only individual virtual classes. This graph algebra promises to reduce the effort involved in view specification by lowering the number of queries necessary to dejine a view. Second, we introduce a tool that guarantees the composition of view classes into arbitrarily complex, yet consistent, view schemata. Unlike for relational views, generalization relationships in 00 views must be validated so that they are consistent with the global schema. In our system, we solve this problem by reformulating view schema construction as a classical graph theory problem, called minimal covering. This allows us to develop eficient algorithms that automatically generate a complete, minimal and consistent view schema. Proofs of correctness of these algorithms can be shown.
