Two variants of the concept "non-blocking" have been defined in the literature: "strictly" non-blocking and "wide-sense" non-blocking. Hitherto, only toy examples were known of connectors that are wide-sense non-blocking but not strictly non-blocking, and these examples are more expensive than comparable strictly non-blocking connectors. In this paper we show for the first time how wide-sense non-blocking con-nectors can be less expensive than comparable strictly non-blocking connectors. In the simplest case we show that strictly non-blocking n-connectors with depth 2 must have ~2(n 2) edges, but wide-sense non-blocking n-connectors with depth 2 can have O(n 3/2 (log n) I/2) edges. Armed with this knowledge of how to exploit the concept of wide-sense non-blocking, we show that wide-sense non-blocking generalized n-connectors can have O(n log n) edges. Informally, this means that there exists an "ideal conference-call telephone exchange" for n subscribers with O(n log n) switches. In such an exchange conferences can be extended and restricted as well as being created and destroyed dynamically , with each request being satisfied without disturbing other previously established conferences.
