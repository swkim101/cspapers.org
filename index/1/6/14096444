X-NODE is a single-chip VLSI processor to be realized in the mid 1980's and to be used as a building block for a tree-structured multiprocessor system (X-TREE). Three major trends influence the design of this processor: the continuing evolution of VLSI technology, the requirements for parallelism and communication in a multiprocessor system, and the need for better support of software and high level language constructs. The influence of these trends on the processor architecture are discussed and the current state of the design of X-NODE is outlined. X-NODE will introduce several new features exploiting the full potential of VLSI technology. The processor and hierarchical memory of multiple device types will be combined on a single chip to provide a powerful processor. With basically a memory-to-memory architecture, an on-chip caching scheme provides the performance of a register based architecture. This on-chip memory hierarchy contains program and data, as well as microcode. The instruction set of any processor can thus be dynamically changed and tailored to the specific problem being executed. It is planned to support high level language constructs directly in hardware through mechanisms such as bounds checking.
