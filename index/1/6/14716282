We study the time-scaling characteristics of low-power wireless communication at the physical and link layers. We observe that links are bursty at many time scales: the packet reception rate (PRR) varies regardless of the length of the time scale considered. Using wavelet analysis, we find that RSSI variations in many wireless sensor network (WSN) links are consistent with statistical self-similarity but not with long range dependence, which can explain burstiness at many scales. We relate RSSI variance to the probability that the physical layer is consistent with self-similarity. Current simulation models and protocols do not take these characteristics into account, leading to inaccurate simulation and sub-optimal protocol performance.
