Tense, temporal adverbs, and temporal connectives provide information about when events described in English sentences occur. To extract this temporal information from a sentence, it must be parsed into a semantic representation which captures the meaning of tense, temporal adverbs, and temporal connectives. Representations were developed for the basic tenses, some temporal adverbs, as well as some of the temporal connectives. Five criteria were suggested for judging these representations, and based on these criteria the representations were judged.
