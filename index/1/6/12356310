This is work-in-progress on an entry-level course on computational problem-solving and programming for engineering students. It has been run since 2006 at our institution at a scale of 800 students/term, as a hybrid in-person lab and out-of-class on-line autograded exercises using Maple TA. The course is in the process of changing languages (from Maple to Matlab), with upgraded resources: a lecture period, some manually graded assignments, projects, and automatic code testing. To date the assessment of the impact of the course has been through conventional means: assigning grades and indications as to whether student grades are consistent with those obtained in other courses taken. During the transition from Maple to Matlab more detailed and individualized performance assessment plans are being developed which are intended to enable the staff and students to better judge weaknesses in program knowledge and who would benefit from additional personal contact.
