A transaction is an atomic update which takes a data base from a consistent state to another consistent state. The Transaction Monitoring Facility (TMF), is a component of the ENCOMPASS distributed data management system, which runs on the Tandem [TM] computer system. TMF provides continuous, fault-tolerant transaction processing in a decentralized, distributed environment. Recovery from failures is transparent to user programs and does not require system halt or restart. Recovery from a failure which directly affects active transactions, such as the failure of a participating processor or the loss of communications between participating network nodes, is accomplished by means of the backout and restart of affected transactions. The implementation utilizes distributed audit trails of data base activity and a decentralized transaction concurrency control mechanism.
