We describe an adaptation and application of a search-based structured prediction algorithm "Searn" to unsupervised learning problems. We show that it is possible to reduce unsupervised learning to supervised learning and demonstrate a high-quality un-supervised shift-reduce parsing model. We additionally show a close connection between unsupervised Searn and expectation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of a semi-supervised extension. The key idea that enables this is an application of the predict-self idea for unsupervised learning.
