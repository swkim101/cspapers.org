Flow tables specifying large asynchronous sequential circuits often contain more internal states than are required to specify desired circuit behavior. Known minimization techniques appear unsuited for reduction of such large (rows × columns > 250) flow tables, because of excessive computation and intermediate data requirements for problems of this size. The algorithm described here is intended to rapidly produce a simplified—but in general non-minimal—flow table. It is most economical when applied to extremely large tables and was devised primarily for automated design applications.
 The procedure has been programmed in PL/1 and has been incorporated into an asynchronous sequential circuit design automation systeml developed at the University of Missouri—Rolla. Typical flow table simplification times obtained using the program are cited. In one test reduction of a 217 row × 8 column table to 39×8 required about 2.6 minutes (the minimum table in this case was known to be 23×8).
