Training a cascade-based face detector using boosting and Haar features is computationally expensive, often requiring weeks on single CPU machines. The bottleneck is at training and selecting Haar features for a single weak classifier, currently in minutes. Traditional techniques for training a weak classifier usually run in 0(NT log N), with N examples (approximately 10,000), and T features (approximately 40,000). We present a method to train a weak classifier in time 0(Nd2 + T), where d is the number of pixels of the probed image sub-window (usually from 350 to 500), by using only the statistics of the weighted input data. Experimental results revealed a significantly reduced training time of a weak classifier to the order of seconds. In particular, this method suffers very minimal immerse in training time with very large increases in members of Haar features, enjoying a significant gain in accuracy, even with reduced training time.
