AUC (area under ROC curve) is an important evaluation criterion, which has been popularly used in many learning tasks such as class-imbalance learning, cost-sensitive learning, learning to rank, etc. Many learning approaches try to optimize AUC, while owing to the non-convexity and discontinuousness of AUC, almost all approaches work with surrogate loss functions. Thus, the consistency of AUC is crucial; however, it has been almost untouched before. In this paper, we provide a sufficient condition for the asymptotic consistency of learning approaches based on surrogate loss functions. Based on this result, we prove that exponential loss and logistic loss are consistent with AUC, but hinge loss is inconsistent. Then, we derive the $q$-norm hinge loss and general hinge loss that are consistent with AUC. We also derive the consistent bounds for exponential loss and logistic loss, and obtain the consistent bounds for many surrogate loss functions under the non-noise setting. Further, we disclose an equivalence between the exponential surrogate loss of AUC and exponential surrogate loss of accuracy, and one straightforward consequence of such finding is that AdaBoost and RankBoost are equivalent.
