The author believes that everybody should be introduced to programming but that standard general purpose languages are not suitable for this purpose, mainly because they do not provide an environment offering natural problems. Another characteristic which makes them unsuitable for the purpose is that they are all more or less burdened by restrictions imposed by legitimate concerns of professional programmers with security and economical aspects of programming. This paper briefly considers the general features that a programming language intended for the introduction of an average non-programmer should have and describes some aspects of one such language developed by the author.
