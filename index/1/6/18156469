At Georgia Tech, we investigated aspects of student performance in the Introduction to Computing course offered by the College of Computing. Our goal was to investigate the effects of customizing assignments based on individual student needs. This was motivated by the fact that our technology can enable us to create and distribute individualized assignments. Thus, we sought to answer the question, "In the span of a single academic quarter, can we (a) identify weaknesses in each student's performance, then (b) give them assignments targeted to their individual weaknesses such that (c) we achieve a positive impact on their subsequent performance. Significant results were found with respect to certain aspects of individualization. They suggest individualized assignments can be effective for students who evidence neither very strong nor very weak topical performance.
