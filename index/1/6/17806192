A simulation model is developed and used to study the effect of buffering of memory requests on the performance of multiprocessor systems.
 A multiprocessor system is generalized as a parallel-pipelined processor of order (s,p), which consists of p parallel processors each of which is a pipelined processor with s degrees of multiprogramming, there can be up to s*p memory requests in each instruction cycle. The memory, which consists of N(&equil;2n) identical memory modules, is organized such that there are l(&equil;2i) lines and m(&equil;2nâˆ’i) identical memory modules, where each module is characterized by the address cycle (address hold time) and memory cycle of a and c time units respectively.
 Too large an l is undesirable in a multiprocessor system because of the cost of the processor-memory interconnection network. Hence, we will show how effective buffering can be used to reduce the system cost while effectively maintaining a high level of performance.
