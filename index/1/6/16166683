Intelligent assistants on mobile devices, such as Siri, have recently gained considerable attention as novel applications of dialogue technologies. A tremendous amount of real users of intelligent assistants provide us with an opportunity to explore a novel task of predicting whether users will continually use their intelligent assistants in the future. We developed prediction models of prospective user engagement by using large-scale user logs obtained from a commercial intelligent assistant. Experiments demonstrated that our models can predict prospective user engagement reasonably well, and outperforms a strong baseline that makes prediction based past utterance frequency.
