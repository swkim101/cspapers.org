MultiMATLAB is an extension of the popular MATLAB environment to distributed memory multiprocessors. We present a MultiMATLAB architecture that provides performance on multiprocessors while maintaining the functionality and usability of MATLAB. This system will enable users to access high performance parallel routines from within MATLAB, to extend MATLAB with new parallel routines, and to use these routines to develop parallel applications with the MATLAB language. We discuss a general MultiMATLAB architecture and present two implementations built upon MPI. Preliminary results indicate that the MultiMATLAB system can offer the full performance of the underlying multiprocessor to the MATLAB environment.
