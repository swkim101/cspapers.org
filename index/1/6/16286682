Effective computer performance evaluation requires: theories and models which effectively represent computer systems and computer processes, evaluation techniques which generate accurate assessments of system or program behavior from models and theories, technology for data gathering on executing systems or processes and technology for data analysis. This paper assesses the extent to which these requirements are currently met. A greater emphasis on combining empirical and theoretical work is needed. The significance and value of current applications of performance measurement and analysis are assessed. Network and data base systems offer high leverage for application of performance modeling and evaluation.
