In desktop grids the use of off-the-shelf shared components makes the use of dedicated resources economically nonviable and increases the complexity of design of efficient storage systems that are required to address the exponentially growing storage demands of modern applications that run on these platforms. To address this challenge, we present PeerStripe, a storage system that transparently distributes files to storage space contributed by participants that have joined a peer-to-peer (p2p) network. PeerStripe uses structured p2p routing to yield a scalable, robust, reliable, and self-organizing storage system. The novelty of PeerStripe lies in its ingenious use of striping and error coding techniques in a heterogeneous distributed environment to stor every large data files. Our evaluation of PeerStripe shows that it can achieve acceptable performance for applications in desktop grids.
