A 0, fl matrix is balanced if, in every square submatrix with two nonzero entries per row and column, the sum of the entries is a multiple of four. This paper extends the decomposition of balanced 0,l matrices obtained by Conforti, Cornukjols and Rao to the class of balanced 0, fl matrices. As a consequence, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm for recognizing balanced 0, fl matrices.
