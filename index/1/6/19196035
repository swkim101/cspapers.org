The archery sight-system is developed for visually impaired persons. The system is based on the magnetic directional sensors for earth magnetism. Both azimuth and elevation angles to the target are measured by the sensor equipped on the archery bow. The sensed information is transmitted to the receiver, which is located near the archer. The sound interface in the receiver transforms the sensed information to the hearing information, and the archer gets this hearing information by the wireless headphones. The sensor system is light-weight of 34g, and operates for about 2 hours by two SR44 button batteries. Shooting experiments by archers with eye-mask show that the system is useful for the visually impaired persons to play archery.
