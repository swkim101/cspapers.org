Informal Mathematical Discourse (IMD) is characterized by the mixture of natural language and symbolic expressions in the context of textbooks, publications in mathematics and mathematical proof. We focused the IMD processing at the low level of discourse. In this paper, we proposed the preprocessing phase before the IMD structure analysis within the context of Controlled Natural Language (CNL). Our contribution is defined in context of the IMD processing and the use of machine learning; first, we present a CNL, a pure corpus and Matemathical Treebank for processing IMD; second, we present a preprocessing phase for IMD analysis with connectives disambiguation and verbs treatment, finally, we found a satisfactory result on input text parsing using a statistical parsing model. We will propagate these results for classification of argumentative informal practices via the low level discourse in IMD processing.
