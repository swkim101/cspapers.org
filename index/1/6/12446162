The real-time simulation of a high rise structure during an earthquake represents a marked step forward in the structural design field. It affords a graphic display of the dynamic behaviour and characteristics of such a structure. The simulation can be presented on a CRT or by means of a 16 or 35 mm. movie and tailored for client or technical viewing.
 This paper discusses the application of the computer techniques involved in dynamically analyzing and simulating the seismic response of an actual 52 story steel-framed tower located in the Los Angeles area.
