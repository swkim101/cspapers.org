Clustering in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is an important technique to prolong lifetime of a WSN. This paper proposes energy efficient multi-level clustering scheme called Power Aware Multi-level Clustering (PAMC) for homogeneous wireless sensor networks. Further, we also apply the proposed multi-level clustering scheme for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. Due to large area of deployment, the network needs to have a multi-level clustering protocol that will enable far-off nodes to communicate with the base station. Simulation is used to analyze the proposed protocols and compare the performance with existing protocol EEMC. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed protocols are effective in prolonging the network lifetime.
