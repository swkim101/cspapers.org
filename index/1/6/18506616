Humanoid robots working in a household environment need 3D geometric shape models of objects for recognizing and managing them properly. In this paper, we make humanoid robots creating models by themselves with dual-arm re-grasping (Fig.1). When robots create models by themselves, they should know how and where they can grasp objects, how their hands occlude object surfaces, and when they have seen every surface on an object. In addition, to execute efficient observation with less failure, it is important to reduce the number of re-grasping. Of course when the shape of objects is unknown, it is difficult to get a sequence of grasp positions which fulfills these conditions. This determination problem of a sequence of grasp positions can be expressed through a graph search problem. To solve this graph, we propose a heuristic method for selecting the next grasp position. This proposed method can be used for creating object models when 3D shape information is updated on-line. To evaluate it, we compare the result of the re-grasping sequence from this method with the optimal sequence coming out of breadth first search which use 3D shape information. Also, we propose an observation system with dual-arm re-grasping considering the points when humanoid robots execute observation in the real world. Finally, we show the experiment results of construction of 3D shape models in the real world using the heuristic method and the observation system.
