In this paper an efficient parallel implementation of the Lanczos method for matrix tridlagonalization is described. This work is restricted to sparse matrices where the work load unbalance problem must be solved in order to optimize the efficiency of the parallel implementation. A new strategy for data dktribution (called Pivoting Block) is purposed in this work. Efficiency of the parallel Lanczos method for sparse matrices using Pivoting Block is slightly improved compared to others data dktribution strategies.
