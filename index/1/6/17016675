This work presents an assessment of different control techniques based on Limit Cycle Walking. The study is performed on a two-dimensional kneed bipedal simulator developed with Open Dynamics Engine, which includes realistic configuration of weight allocation, link length, inertia distribution and impacts. The controllers are model-based driven from an analytic 2D kneed biped. Several controllers from the Computed Torque (CT) family together with a Passivity Based controller (PBC) are compared based on their energy efficiency and robustness. The previous controllers are used in their original form, with minor adjustment to handle hybrid systems such as the kneed biped case. PBC proved not suitable for real implementation however a combined strategy between PBC and a soft PD control has shown promising results. PD Computed Torque control also offered high tolerance to disturbances with reasonable energy consumption. Furthermore, the performance of all the controllers showed high dependency on the parameters of the robot.
