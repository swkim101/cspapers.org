A vast majority of L1 vocabulary acquisition occurs through incidental learning during reading (Nation, 2001; Schmitt et al., 2001). We propose a probabilistic approach to generating code-mixed text as an L2 technique for increasing retention in adult lexical learning through reading. Our model that takes as input a bilingual dictionary and an English text, and generates a code-switched text that optimizes a defined “learnability” metric by constructing a factor graph over lexical mentions. Using an artificial language vocabulary, we evaluate a set of algorithms for generating code-switched text automatically by presenting it to Mechanical Turk subjects and measuring recall in a sentence completion task.
