Dynacargo is an ongoing research project that introduces a breakthrough approach for cargo management systems, as it places the hauled cargos in the center of a haulage information management system, instead of the vehicle. Dynacargo attempts to manage both distribution and collection processes, providing an integrated approach. This paper presents the Dynacargo architectural modules and interrelations between them, as well as the research issues and development progress of some selected modules. In the context of Dynacargo project, a set of durable, low cost RFID tags are placed on waste bins in order to produce crucial data that is fed via diverse communication channels into the cargo management system. Besides feeding the management system with raw data from waste bins, data mining techniques are used on archival data, in order to predict current waste bins fill status. Moreover easy-to-use mobile and web applications will be developed to encourage citizens to participate and become active information producers and consumers. Dynacargo project overall aim is to develop a near real-time monitoring system that monitors and transmits waste bins' fill level, in order to dynamically manage the waste collection more efficiently by minimizing distances covered by refuse vehicles, relying on efficient routing algorithms.
