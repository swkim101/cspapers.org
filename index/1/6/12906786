With the advent of the computer, simulation has received serious attention from both the academic community and industry. The pathbreaking work of Forrester (industrial dynamics) [12], Cohen (management gaming) [6], Clarkson (portfolio selection [5], Bonini (information flow within the firm) [2], and so on, and the many industrial applications reported in the literature leave no doubt that simulation is a versatile technique well suited for the study of some complex problems confronting the firm. According to Morgenthaler It has not been possible thus far...to reduce the operation of a large business activity to a few simple equations. Analytical techniques may not exist for solving the mathematical formulation once it has been achieved...Even when analysts have the confidence and ability to arrive at a theoretical prediction of the behavior of a large system, it may not be possible to perform validating experiments...When any of these difficulties occur, as they do daily in the attempts...to tackle previously untouched, unmanageable problems, some form of simulation is the obvious tool to be tried.
