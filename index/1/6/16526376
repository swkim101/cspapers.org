This paper examines seller strategies for dynamic pricing in an auction-driven marketplace. Specifically, this paper focuses on the airline industry, a field experienced in demand forecasting and dynamic pricing capabilities. Our goal is to discover the relevant factors when a seller dynamically evaluates incoming bids on a finite number of goods. We present two adaptive pricing strategies and evaluate them using a market simulator.
