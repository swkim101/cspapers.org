A Cable-Driven Locomotion Interface employs two independent cable-driven haptic foot platforms constrained in six degrees of freedom (6-DOF). Its control system and its geometry are designed for performing a wide range of trajectories that could generate cable interferences. This paper presents and analyzes computational methods for determining which cable can be released from an active actuation state while allowing control in a minimal tension state, thereby ensuring that both platforms stay in a controllable workspace. One challaging task is to develop light and fast computational algorithms for hard real time processes included in haptic display applications. Seeing that releasing a cable from an active actuation state might generate discontinuities in tension values in the other cables, this paper proposes collision prediction schemes named Interference Estimated Time of Arrival in order to reduce or completely eliminate such discontinuities.
