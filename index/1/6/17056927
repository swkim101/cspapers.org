The problem of minimizing capacity violation is a variation of the transshipment problem. It is equivalent to the problem of computing maximum mean surplus cuts which arises in the dual approach to the minimum cost network circulation problem. McCormick and Ervolina [15] proposed an algorithm which computes a sequence of cuts with increasing mean surpluses, and stops when an optimal one is found. The mean surplus of this cut is equal to the minimum possible maximum capacity violation. McCormick and Ervolina proved that the number of iterations in this algorithm is <italic>O</italic>(<italic>m</italic>). One iteration, i.e., finding the subsequent cut, amounts to computing maximum flow in an appropriate network. We prove that the number of iterations in this algorithm is  &thgr;(<italic>n</italic>). This gives the best known upper bound <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>2</supscrpt><italic>m</italic>) for the problem. We also show a tight analysis of this algorithm for the case with integral capacities and demands, and present some improvements.
