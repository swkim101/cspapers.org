Using 802.11 concurrently for communications and positioning is problematic, especially if location-based services (e.g., indoor navigation) are concurrently executed with real-time applications (e.g., VoIP, video conferencing). Periodical scanning for measuring the signal strength interrupts the data flow. Reducing the scan frequency is no option because it hurts the position accuracy. For this reason, we need an adaptive technique to mitigate this problem.
 This work proposes ComPoScan which, based on movement detection, adaptively switches between light-weight monitor sniffing and invasive active scanning to allow positioning and to minimize the impact on the data flow. The system is configurable to realize different trade-offs between position accuracy and the level of communication interruption.
 We provide extensive experimental results by emulation on data collected at several sites and by validation in several real-world deployments. Results from the emulation show that the system can realize different trade-offs by changing parameters. Furthermore, the emulation shows that the system works independently of the environment, the network card, the signal strength measurement technology, and number and placement of access points. We also show that ComPoScan does not harm the positioning accuracy of a positioning system. By validation in several real-world deployments, we provided evidence for that the real system works as predicted by the emulation. In addition, we provide results for ComPoScan's impact on communication where it increases throughput by a factor of 122, decreases the delay by a factor of ten, and the percentage of dropped packages by 73 percent.
