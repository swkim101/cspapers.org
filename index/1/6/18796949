We present our work in generating Karmina, an old Malay poetic form for Indonesian language. Karmina is a poem with two lines that consists of a hook ( sampiran ) on the first line and a message on the second line. One of the unique aspects of Karmina is in the absence of discourse relation between its hook and message. We approached the problem by generating the hooks and the messages in separate processes using predefined schemas and a manually built knowledge base. The Karminas were produced by randomly pairing the messages with the hooks, subject to the constraints imposed on the rhymes and on the structure similarity. Syllabifications were performed on the cue words of the hooks and messages to ensure the generated pairs have matching rhymes. We were able to generate a number of positive examples while still leaving room for improvement, particularly in the generation of the messages, which currently are still limited, and in filtering the negative results.
