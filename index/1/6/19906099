To improve the obstacle surmounting performance of the quad-rotor vehicle, this paper focuses on designing, kinematically and dynamically characterizing a novel deformable quad-rotor that is based on the scissor-like foldable structures. The foldable structure allows that the volume of the quad-rotor can be tuned to dynamically adapt variously sized obstacles and small spaces. To generate the controllable deformation, the actuated angulated elements that are the essential components of the scissor-like foldable structure play an important role. The element design, its actuation mechanism and the corresponding configuration patterns for the new quad-rotor are presented in the paper in detail. The simulations on deformation properties and obstacle surmounting ability are then performed to verify the deformation capability of the structure. In addition, experiments were extensively conducted to test the controlled deformation of the structure as well to investigate the deformation induced effects to the activated quad-rotor airframe and its aerodynamics. All implementation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed deformable quad-rotor design, that is, it enables the new quad-rotor having excellent obstacle surmounting performance, adaptability, flight maneuverability, as well as minimal aerodynamics influences during deforming.
