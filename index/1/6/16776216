We give a new, strongly polynomial algorithm and improved analysis of the metric $s-t$ path TSP. The algorithm finds a tour of cost less than 1.53 times the optimum of the subtour elimination LP, while known examples show that 1.5 is a lower bound for the integrality gap. 
A key new idea is the deletion of some edges, where the arising connectivity problems can be solved for a minor extra cost. On the one hand our algorithm and analysis extend previous tools, at the same time simplifying the framework. On the other hand new tools are introduced, such as a linear program that allows us to efficiently choose the probabilities of edges used for analyzing the reconnection cost and a new way of applying the matroid partition theorem and algorithm to different matroids, in order to write the subtour elimination optimum as a particular convex combination of spanning trees. 
Furthermore, the 3/2 target-bound is easily reached in some relevant new cases.
