We propose a systematic modelling of the nonholonomic mobile manipulators built from a robotic arm mounted on a wheeled mobile platform. It extends the fundamental notions of nonholonomy, mobility and maneuverability to the case of these hybrid holonomic/nonholonomic systems. It offers unambiguous definitions and models to the designer of kinematic control laws.
