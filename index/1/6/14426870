There is a rich and expanding folklore concerning the consequences of inappropriate naming of computer commands. The problems are particularly acute for occasional users of interactive systems who may be unfamiliar with the jargon of computing. While “naming” has long been of interest to philosophers, linguists and psychologists [2], there is little systematic research on the psychological processes involved in the understanding and acquisition of the vocabularies of interactive computer systems.
 Since the names for interactive commands tend to be drawn from the wider vocabulary of natural language, occasional users are faced with the task of understanding, learning and remembering new meanings for the words.
