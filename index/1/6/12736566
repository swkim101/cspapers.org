The beam-opening angle problem of an ultrasonic range sensor is solved by using artificial neural networks to fuse multiple ultrasonic sensors. A mathematical model about the same problem is also derived. Both simulation and experimental results of scanning images are presented. The line extractor of the sensor image is developed by using the regression model with a little modification. The simulation results show this method is useful for environment recognition of robotic systems.
