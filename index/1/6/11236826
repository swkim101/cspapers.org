The idea that connected convex surfaces, separated by concave boundaries, play an important role for the perception of objects and their decomposition into parts has been discussed for a long time. Based on this idea, we present a new bottom-up approach for the segmentation of 3D point clouds into object parts. The algorithm approximates a scene using an adjacency-graph of spatially connected surface patches. Edges in the graph are then classified as either convex or concave using a novel, strictly local criterion. Region growing is employed to identify locally convex connected subgraphs, which represent the object parts. We show quantitatively that our algorithm, although conceptually easy to graph and fast to compute, produces results that are comparable to far more complex state-of-the-art methods which use classification, learning and model fitting. This suggests that convexity/concavity is a powerful feature for object partitioning using 3D data. Furthermore we demonstrate that for many objects a natural decomposition into “handle and body” emerges when employing our method. We exploit this property in a robotic application enabling a robot to automatically grasp objects by their handles.
