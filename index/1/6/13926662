Insider threats to databases in the financial sector have become a very serious and pervasive security problem. This paper proposes a framework to analyze access patterns to databases by clustering SQL queries issued to the database. Our system Ettu works by grouping queries with other similarly structured queries. The small number of intent groups that result can then be efficiently labeled by human operators. We show how our system is designed and how the components of the system work. Our preliminary results show that our system accurately models user intent.
