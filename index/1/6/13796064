In the actual scenario of ever-growing data consumption speed and quantity, factors like news source decentralization, citizen journalism and democratization of media, make the task of manually checking and correcting disinformation across the internet impractical or infeasible . Here, there is an imperative need for a fast and reliable way to account for the veracity of what is produced and spread as information: Automatic fact-checking. In this work we present the problem of fact-checking in the era of big data and post-truth. Some existing approaches for this task are presented and their main features discussed and compared. Concluding, a new approach inspired on the best components of the existing ones is presented.
