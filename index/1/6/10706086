Integrated design process for automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems is proposed in this paper. There are two problems to design AGV systems: transporter routings and flow-path networks. These two should be solved at the same time, because one problem depends on the other. This issue is solved with cooperative co-evolution in this paper. Both problems are represented as different species and genetic algorithm is applied to them. AGV systems designed with this method are evaluated through simulations with real data.
