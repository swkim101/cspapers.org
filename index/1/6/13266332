An <i>outerplanar graph</i> is a planar graph that can be embedded in the plane without crossing edges, in such a way that all the vertices are on the outer boundary. In this paper, we prove a conjecture of Chartrand, Geller, and Hedetniemi that any planar graph <i>G</i>=(<i>V,E</i>) has a bipartition of its edge set <i>E</i> = <i>A</i> âˆª <i>B</i> such that the graphs induced by these subsets, <i>G</i>[<i>A</i>] and <i>G</i>[<i>B</i>], are outerplanar.
