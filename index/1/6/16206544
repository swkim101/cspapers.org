Despite the attractiveness of the concept, attempts to date to use proof of correctness techniques on production software have been generally unsuccessful. The obstacles encountered are not fundamental. We have implemented a proof of correctness system to be used for improving the realiability of certain small, real-time programs. It appears that many of the problems of past systems can be avoided.This work is supported by the Long Range Research Program of the Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan.
