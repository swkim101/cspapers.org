Total Variation (TV) is an effective and popular prior model in the field of regularization-based image processing. This paper focuses on TV for image restoration in the presence of impulse noise. This type of noise frequently arises in data acquisition and transmission due to many reasons, e.g. a faulty sensor or analog-to-digital converter errors. Removing this noise is an important task in image restoration. State-of-the-art methods such as Adaptive Outlier Pursuit(AOP) [42], which is based on TV with ℓ02-norm data fidelity, only give sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a new method, called ℓ0TV -PADMM, which solves the TV-based restoration problem with ℓ0-norm data fidelity. To effectively deal with the resulting non-convex non-smooth optimization problem, we first reformulate it as an equivalent MPEC (Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints), and then solve it using a proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (PADMM). Our ℓ0TV -PADMM method finds a desirable solution to the original ℓ0-norm optimization problem and is proven to be convergent under mild conditions. We apply ℓ0TV -PADMM to the problems of image denoising and deblurring in the presence of impulse noise. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ℓ0TV -PADMM outperforms state-of-the-art image restoration methods.
