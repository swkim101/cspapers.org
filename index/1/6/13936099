 1 Layout drafting
 2 Detail drafting
 3 Checking
 4 Shop layout (transferring the dimensions onto a blank metal sheet) (Fig. 1)
 5 Positioning the sheet on the punch press, mounting a tool, and punching (hopefully at the correct location)
 6 Flame cutting of large openings, and
 7 Bending, rolling, and assembly (welding or bolting)
