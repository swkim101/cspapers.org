This work investigates how attribute interactions affect consumer preference for product form attributes in choice based conjoint analysis. Interaction effects are present when preference for the level of one attribute is dependent on the level of another attribute. When some or all interaction effects are negligible, a factional factorial experimental design can be used to reduce the number of variants shown to the respondent and keep the survey size manageable. This is particularly important when the presence of many parameters or levels makes full factorial designs intractable. However, if there is uncertainty about the independence of attributes or if interaction effects are relevant, a fractional factorial design may create biased estimates and misleading conclusions. This work examines the role of interaction effects in visual conjoint analysis, an extension to traditional conjoint analysis that allows for product form attributes that vary continuously. Many visual conjoint analysis studies assume interaction effects are negligible. We conduct preliminary tests on this assumption in three visual conjoint analysis studies. The results suggest that interactions can be significant or negligible in visual conjoint, depending on both consumer preferences and shape parameterization. We suggest that randomized designs are generally better than fractional factorial designs at avoiding errors due to the presence of interactions and/or the organization of profiles into choice sets.
