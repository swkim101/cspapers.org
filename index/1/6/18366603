1. ABSTRACT This paper deals with queries involving the retrieval of images that contain certain object configurations. Consider, for instance, that a user wants to “find all images where there exists a building adjacent to the west side of a park which is southwest and near a commercial center”. This query can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) where the query variables are nodes of the corresponding constraint network and the image objects constitute the domain of each variable. The arcs of the network correspond to spatial constraints (e.g., adjacent ∧ west (X1,X2), southwest ∧ near (X2,X3)). Problems of the above nature are, in general, intractable. In addition, spatial constraints (e.g., southwest, near) lack universally accepted semantics and cannot always be modeled by crisp relations; a fact that further complicates query processing. This paper focuses on the development of effective methods that take advantage of the special structure of the spatial domain to achieve good average performance even for large images and queries. 1.1
