Log-linear description logics are a family of probabilistic logics integrating various concepts and methods from the areas of knowledge representation and reasoning and statistical relational AI. We define the syntax and semantics of log-linear description logics, describe a convenient representation as sets of first-order formulas, and discuss computational and algorithmic aspects of probabilistic queries in the language. The paper concludes with an experimental evaluation of an implementation of a log-linear DL reasoner.
