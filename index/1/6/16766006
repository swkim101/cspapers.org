This paper presents the first study using neural machine translation (NMT) for grammatical error correction (GEC). We propose a twostep approach to handle the rare word problem in NMT, which has been proved to be useful and effective for the GEC task. Our best NMTbased system trained on the CLC outperforms our SMT-based system when testing on the publicly available FCE test set. The same system achieves an F0.5 score of 39.90% on the CoNLL-2014 shared task test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art and demonstrating that the NMT-based GEC system generalises effectively.
