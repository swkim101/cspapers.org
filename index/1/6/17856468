Software engineering is often associated with the software technology of yesterday. To manage anything, predictability is a key issue, and it takes some time to gather the necessary experience of a new technology. Object technology has not yet reached this stage of maturity but is rapidly becoming established in industry. This paper describes how the object-oriented paradigm is used throughout an academic software engineering education program. The relative immaturity of existing methods and practices is handled by an experiential learning approach that emphasizes questions rather than answers. The paper discusses various pedagogical aspects as well as some of the practical trade-offs and experiences gained in the implementation of the program.
