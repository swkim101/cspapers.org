Improving verbose (or long) queries poses a new challenge for search systems. Previous techniques mainly focused on two aspects, weighting the important words or phrases and selecting the best subset query. The former does not consider how words and phrases are used in actual subset queries, while the latter ignores alternative subset queries. Recently, a novel reformulation framework has been proposed to transform the original query as a distribution of reformulated queries, which overcomes the disadvantages of previous techniques. In this paper, we apply this framework to verbose queries, where a reformulated query is specified as a subset query. Experiments on TREC collections show that the query distribution based framework outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.
