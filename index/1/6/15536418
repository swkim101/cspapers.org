In this paper we present the procrastination approach to the treatment of ambiguity, particularly in the context of natural language interfaces. In this approach, we try not to notice ambiguity unless we have the knowledge to resolve it available. In order to support this approach, we have developed a collection of structures that describe sets of possible interpretations efficiently. We have implemented this approach using these structures in Lucy" an English interface program for knowledge-based systems.
