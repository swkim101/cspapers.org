The massage coverage and the massage path have significant influence on the massage effect of massage robot. Analyzing the traditional Chinese massage operation and the demand for path planning, an efficient full covered improved path planning algorithm which based on a portable back massage robot was put forward. The model of an improved back and forth path algorithm and an efficient full covered path algorithm were established and the simulation were implemented in Matlab. The simulation results show that the improved algorithm is suitable for back massage, and it ensures that the massage robot traverses the entire back area with improved massage coverage. Meanwhile, the experimental environment was built to test the effect of the proposed algorithm. A series of problems appeared during experiments were solved with repeated tests; the massage robot eventually achieved the desired massage effect and planned path.
