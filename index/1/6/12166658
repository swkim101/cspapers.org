Database support for multidimensional arrays is an area of growing importance; a variety of highvolume applications such as spatio-temporal data management and statistics/OLAP become focus of academic and market interest. RasDaMan is a domain-independent array database management system with server-based query optimization and evaluation. The system is fully operational and being used in international projects. We will demonstrate spatio-temporal retrieval using the rView visual query client. Examples will encompass 1-D time series, 2-D images, 3-D and 4-D voxel data. The real-life data sets used stem from life sciences, geo sciences, numerical simulation, and climate research.
