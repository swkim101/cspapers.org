In this paper we present an approach to incorporate design schedule management services into a flow management system. The basis of our approach is to derive a design schedule from the simulation of a flow execution. Actual flow execution can then be tracked against the proposed schedule via design metadata. We verify our approach by implementing design scheduling into the Hercules Workflow Manager.
