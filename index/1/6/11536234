As a part of a cine-film understanding system, this paper presents a dynamic scene analyzer which separates moving objects from the background and analyzes their motion patterns in dynamic line images such as cartoon films. Finding correspondence of regions and their segments in a sequence of input frames by a new flexible template matching method, the analyzer tracks moving regions and their segments in the dynamic images. Next, a similarity test of segment movements detects the background movement, and classifies the regions into stationary and non-stationary ones. Each in the latter group is further labeled as partly occluded, false, or moving, by examining motion patterns of its segments. Finally, the analyzer merges segments of each moving object into groups having similar motion patterns in order to obtain a meaningful partition corresponding to its components such as hands or legs.
