In spite of extensive and continuing research, for various geometric search problems (such as nearest neighbor search), the best algorithms known have performance that degrades exponentially in the dimension. This phenomenon is sometimes called the curse of dimensionality. Recent results [37, 38, 40] show that in some sense it is possible to avoid the curse of dimensionality for the approximate nearest neighbor search problem. But must the exact nearest neighbor search problem suffer this curse? We provide some evidence in support of the curse. Specifically we investigate the exact nearest neighbor search problem and the related problem of exact partial match within the asymmetric communication model first used by Miltersen [43] to study data structure problems. We derive non-trivial asymptotic lower bounds for the exact problem that stand in contrast to known algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search.
