A model for the formation of situation concepts is described. A characteristic of this form of concept formation is that it does not require instructive feedback. This renders it suitable for concept formation by autonomous agents. It is experimentally demonstrated that situation concepts constructed independently by several agents can convey useful information between agents through a learned system of communication. A relation was found between the development of the learned system of communication and the duration of the situations.
