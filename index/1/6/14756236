General Game Playing (GGP) is the art of designing programs that are capable of playing previously unknown games of a wide variety by being told nothing but the rules of the game. This is in contrast to traditional computer game players like Deep Blue, which are designed for a particular game and can't adapt automatically to modifications of the rules, let alone play completely different games. General Game Playing is intended to foster the development of integrated cognitive information processing technology. In this article we present an approach to General Game Playing using a novel way of automatically constructing a position evaluation function from a formal game description. Our system is being tested with a wide range of different games. Most notably, it is the winner of the AAAI GGP Competition 2006.
