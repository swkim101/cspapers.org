Game bots are a critical threat to Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) because they can seriously damage the reputation and in-game economy equilibrium of MMORPGs. Existing game bot detection techniques are not only generally sensitive to changes in game contents but also limited in detecting emerging bot patterns that were hitherto unknown. To overcome the limitation of learning bot patterns over time, we propose a framework that detects game bots through machine learning technique. The proposed framework utilizes self-similarity to effectively measure the frequency of repeated activities per player over time, which is an important clue to identifying bots. Consequently, we use realworld MMORPG (“Lineage”, “Aion” and “Blade & Soul”) datasets to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed framework. Our experimental results demonstrate that 1) self-similarity can be used as a general feature in various MMORPGs, 2) a detection model maintenance process with newly updated bot behaviors can be implemented, and 3) our bot detection framework is practicable.
