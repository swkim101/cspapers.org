This paper is an update on the investigation of Distributed Inward Gripping (DIG) as a rapid and robust attachment mechanism for vertical and inverted climbing. DIG is implemented on an 18-DOF hexapod, DIGbot, with onboard power and control system. Passive compliance in the foot, which is inspired by the flexible tarsus of the cockroach, increases the robustness of the adhesion strategy and enables DIGbot to execute large steps and stationary turns while walking vertically on mesh screen. Results of vertical climbing are shown.
