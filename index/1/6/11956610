The ISLE project is a continuation of the long standing EAGLES initiative, carried out under the Human Language Technology (HLT) programme in collaboration between American and European groups in the framework of the EU-US International Research Co-operation, supported by NSF and EC. We concentrate in this paper on the current position of the ISLE Computational Lexicon Working Group. We provide a short description of the EU SIMPLE lexicons built on the basis of previous EAGLES recommendations. We then point at a few basic methodological principles applied in previous EAGLES phases, and describe a few principles to be followed in the definition of a Multilingual ISLE Lexical Entry (MILE).
