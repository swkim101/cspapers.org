Many-to-Many Invocation (M2MI) is a new paradigm for building collaborative systems that run in wireless proximal ad hoc networks M2MI provides an object oriented method call abstraction based on broadcasting. An M2MI invocation means "Every object out there that implements this interface, call this method." An M2MI-based application is built by defining one or more interfaces, creating objects that implement those interfaces in all the participating devices, and broadcasting method invocations to all the objects on all the devices.
