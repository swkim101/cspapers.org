In this paper, we propose a simple framework for learning and synthesis of fast and complex motor tasks. Where a passivity-based task-space controller acts not only as a full-body force control module, but also as an important module to generate phasic joint patterns. The generated joint patterns are encoded into the parameters of phase oscillators and form the synergy of the task. Then, similar and/or faster motions are synthesized by superposing the task space controller output and the oscillator output with the modified oscillator amplitudes and/or frequencies. We present some examples of whole-body motion synthesis on a human-sized biped humanoid robot including squatting, dancing and stepping while bipedal balancing. The simulation and experimental videos are supplemented.
