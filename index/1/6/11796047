One of the key challenges in mobile robot teleoperation is master-slave kinematic dissimilarity: master device (e.g., joystick) has a bounded workspace, while slave mobile robot can/should cover an unbounded workspace. A direct master-position/slave-velocity coupling has been frequently used for this, which, yet, in general, violates passivity of the closed-loop system, since the master system with position output cannot be passive. In this paper, we propose a new notion of feedback r-passivity of general multi-dimensional Lagrangian systems, which allows us to achieve such master-position/slave-velocity coupling while enforcing passivity. Its applications to tele-driving of dynamic and kinematic WMRs with constant communication delay are also presented.
