A service robot that operates in a previously-unseen home environment should be able to recognize the functionality of the rooms it visits, such as a living room, a bathroom, etc. We present a novel part-based model and an approach for room categorization using data obtained from a visual sensor. Images are represented with sets of unordered parts that are obtained by object-agnostic region proposals, and encoded using state-of-the-art image descriptor extractor - a convolutional neural network (CNN). An approach is proposed that learns category-specific discriminative parts for the part-based model. The proposed approach was compared to the state-of-the-art CNN trained specifically for place recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the holistic CNN by being robust to image degradation, such as occlusions, modifications of image scaling, and aspect changes. In addition, we report non-negligible annotation errors and image duplicates in a popular dataset for place categorization and discuss annotation ambiguities.
