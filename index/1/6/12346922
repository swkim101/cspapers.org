Software-defined networking enables applications act as blackboxes independently to control the network flexibly. However, these independent applications may generate conflicting control decisions. To reconcile applications automatically and dynamically, we implement control applications with Prolog, which enables applications to execute jointly to make consistent control decisions. When conflicts occur, we design a compromise algorithm by sacrificing a subset of applications to maximize the desired control objectives.
