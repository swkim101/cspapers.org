Requirements elicitation is one of the first processes of software development and it is intended to be hand-made by means of analyst-stakeholder interviews. As a natural-language-based activity, requirements elicitation can take advantages of Computational Linguistics techniques, in order to achieve better results looking for automation in this field. In this paper we survey some of the work related to software development automation, guided by Computational Linguistics techniques, and performed by the Computational Language Research Group from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. We aim the definition of future transnational effort to be made in this research line.
