Sensor technologies for musical instruments enable musicians to capture playing parameters while playing and augment their instruments for enhanced musical expression. A further step into this direction is the following optical, contact free bowing sensing technique for string instruments. In string instrument playing, the combination of bowing speed, position, bow pressure and bow to string contact point and angle are the basic factors of the right hand sound production. To measure these parameters, we developed an optical, contactless sensor system to complete existing pressure measurement systems. It consists of emitters, infrared (IR) or colored light emitting diodes (LEDs) on the bow and IR or color receivers on the violin. The precision of the measurement data obtained with this setup is sufficient to investigate the main parameters of bowing and sound production.
