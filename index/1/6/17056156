Abstract : In the near future, pervasive robotics will require small, light, and cheap robots that exhibit complex behaviors. These demands led to the development of the M2-M4 Macaco project -- a robotic active vision head. Macaco is a portable system, capable of emulating the head of different creatures both aesthetically and functionally. It integrates mechanisms for social interactions, autonomous navigation, and object analysis.
