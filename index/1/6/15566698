In this paper, we describe the in-lane communication framework that enables the communication between vehicles on the same lane. The system creates a unique signature for each lane using smartphone inertial sensors. The calculated lane signature will be attached with each broadcasted message, where other vehicles on the street compare it with their own lane signature to decide if the received message came from a vehicle on the same lane or not. The paper concentrates on finding the right features that can be used to identify a lane in a road. To identify a lane with a unique signature, the paper proposes a combination of driving features and road features. The paper uses the inertial sensors because the current GPS systems are not accurate enough to locate vehicles with a lane level accuracy. The ability to establish a communication channel between vehicles on the same lane can enhance the road safety and enable several interesting navigation applications.
