The goals of UMBC's CE21-Maryland project are to build community and to increase the accessibility, diversity, and quality of high school CS education in Maryland. The ultimate objective is for all Maryland students to have access to high-quality, college preparatory CS courses. We present findings from a survey of high school computing teachers regarding the status of CS education in Maryland. Some findings of interest are that urban and rural students have less access to computing courses than suburban students; female teachers are more likely to attract female students and to have larger AP CS classes; and neither teacher race nor gender is correlated with the number of minority students enrolled in CS classes. We describe community building successes through two Google CS4HS workshops, a Maryland CSTA chapter, and statewide summit meetings for educators and administrators. We also discuss how our methodology can be used as a model for other states who are working towards CS education reform at the high school level.
