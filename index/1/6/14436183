Recent physiological research has shown that synchronization of oscillatory responses in striate cortex may code for relationships between visual features of objects. A VLSI circuit has been designed to provide rapid phase-locking synchronization of multiple oscillators to allow for further exploration of this neural mechanism. By exploiting the intrinsic random transistor mismatch of devices operated in subthreshold, large groups of phase-locked oscillators can be readily partitioned into smaller phase-locked groups. A multiple target tracker for binary images is described utilizing this phase-locking architecture. A VLSI chip has been fabricated and tested to verify the architecture. The chip employs Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) to encode the output at the periphery of the system.
