In this paper, we present a functional description of a VLSI chip aimed at reducing the cost of data transmission and data access within information processing machines and distributed information systems. The chip maps standard character codes (e.g., ASCII) into more efficient codes (e.g., Huffman's codes) using a tree module of basic cells. In bit-serial communication controllers, for example, the parallel-to-serial transformation unit can be simply replaced by the proposed chip. The VLSI design can provide speeds that far exceed current and projected peak transfer rates of high-speed disks and communication controllers.
