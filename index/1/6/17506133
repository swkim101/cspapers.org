Searching for objects in occluded spaces is one of the problems robots need to solve when tackling mobile manipulation tasks. Most approaches focus only on searching for a specific object. In this paper, we use the concept of relational affordances to improve occluded object search performance. Affordances define action possibilities on an object in the environment and play a role in basic cognitive capabilities. Relational affordances extend this concept by modelling relations between multiple objects. By learning and using a relational affordance model we can search for any of the multiple objects that afford a given action, each object type having a probability distribution over possible sizes and shapes, and where spatial relations between objects such as co-occurrence and stacking are modelled. The experimental results show the viability of the relational affordance models for occluded object search.
