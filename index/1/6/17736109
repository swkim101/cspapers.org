The PERCRO laboratory of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna has recently completed the development and functional assessment of the Body Extender (BE) system, an advanced wearable robot expressly conceived for augmenting the human strength for handling of heavy materials in unstructured environment. The system is composed by four robotic limbs with anthropomorphic kinematics and has a total of 22 independently actuated degrees of freedom. The leg locomotion and the force servo-amplification allow operations in environments that are hardly accessible by the conventional handling systems preserving the force sensibility during the manipulative tasks. Possible applications are handling of military materials in narrow spaces, rescuing of victims in natural and human provoked disasters and handling of heavy parts in the manufacturing of large products. The paper reports the system specifications taken as a reference for the design, the criteria and verification methods, the architectural solutions used for the implementation of mechanics, electronic and control components and the results of the preliminary experimental assessment.
