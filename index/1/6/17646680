Khuller and Raghavachari [12] present an approximation algorithm (the <i>KR algorithm</i>) for finding the smallest <i>k</i>-edge connected spanning subgraph (<i>k-ECSS</i>) of an undirected multigraph. They prove the KR algorithm has approximation ratio < 1.85. We prove the KR algorithm has approximation ratio ≤ 1 + √1/<i>e</i> < 1.61; for odd <i>k</i> this requires a minor modification of the algorithm. This is the bestknown performance bound for the smallest <i>k</i>-ECSS problem for arbitrary <i>k</i>. Our analysis also gives the best-known performance bound for any fixed value of <i>k</i> ≤ 3, e.g., for even <i>k</i> the approximation ratio is ≤ 1 + (1 -- 1/<i>k</i>)<sup><i>k</i>/2</sup>. Our analysis is based on a laminar family of sets (similar to families used in related contexts) which gives a better accounting of edges added in previous iterations of the algorithm. We also present a polynomial time implementation of the KR algorithm on multigraphs, running in the time for <i>O</i>(<i>nm</i>) maximum flow computations, where <i>n</i> (<i>m</i>) is the number of vertices (edges, not counting parallel copies). This complements the implementation of [12] which uses time <i>O</i>((<i>kn</i>)<sup>2</sup>) and is efficient for small <i>k</i>.
