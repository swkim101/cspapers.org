Test models are needed to evaluate and benchmark algorithms and tools in model driven development. Most model generators randomly apply graph operations on graph representations of models. This approach leads to test models of poor quality. Some approaches do not guarantee the basic syntactic correctness of the created models. Even if so, it is almost impossible to guarantee, or even control, the creation of complex structures, e.g. a subgraph which implements an association between two classes. Such a subgraph consists of an association node, two association end nodes, and several edges, and is normally created by one user command. This paper presents the SiDiff Model Generator, which can generate models, or sets of models, which are syntactically correct, contain complex structures, and exhibit defined statistical characteristics.
