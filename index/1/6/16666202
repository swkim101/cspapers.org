Consider the pricing problem faced by FedEx. Each customer has a package to ship, a deadline $d$ by which he needs his package to arrive, and a value $v$ for a guarantee that the package will arrive by his deadline. FedEx can (and does) offer a number of different shipping options in order to extract more revenue from their customers. In this paper, we solve the optimal (revenue-maximizing) auction problem for the single-agent version of this problem. Our paper adds to the relatively short list of multi-parameter settings for which a closed-form solution is known.
