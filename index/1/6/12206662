We give two algorithms computing representative families of linear and uniform matroids and demonstrate how to use representative families for designing single-exponential parameterized and exact exponential time algorithms. The applications of our approach include 
- LONGEST DIRECTED CYCLE 
- MINIMUM EQUIVALENT GRAPH (MEG) 
- Algorithms on graphs of bounded treewidth 
-k-PATH, k-TREE, and more generally, k-SUBGRAPH ISOMORPHISM, where the k-vertex pattern graph is of constant treewidth.
