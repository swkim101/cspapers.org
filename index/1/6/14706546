This paper presents a prototype of a force/torque sensor that uses fiber optic guided light and linear polarizer materials to obtain intensity modulated light to detect applied force and torque to the sensing structure. The sensor is also capable of measuring the contact direction between the sensor and the object. The sensor's design and operating principles are explained and experimental data is given to verify the proposed operating principle. The experimental data shows that linear polarizers can be used to measure the torque applied to a force/torque sensor.
