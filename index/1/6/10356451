We introduce a latent activity model for workplace emails, positing that communication at work is purposeful and organized by activities. We pose the problem as probabilistic inference in graphical models that jointly capture the interplay between latent activities and the email contexts they govern, such as the recipients, subject and body. The model parameters are learned using maximum likelihood estimation with an expectation maximization algorithm. We present three variants of the model that incorporate the recipients, co-occurrence of the recipients, and email body and subject. We demonstrate the modelâ€™s effectiveness in an email recipient recommendation task and show that it outperforms a state-of-the-art generative model. Additionally, we show that the activity model can be used to identify email senders who engage in similar activities, resulting in further improvements in recipient recommendation.
