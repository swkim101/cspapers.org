We present a novel method for accurate marker-less capture of articulated skeleton motion of several subjects in general scenes, indoors and outdoors, even from input filmed with as few as two cameras. Our approach unites a discriminative image-based joint detection method with a model-based generative motion tracking algorithm through a combined pose optimization energy. The discriminative part-based pose detection method, implemented using Convolutional Networks (ConvNet), estimates unary potentials for each joint of a kinematic skeleton model. These unary potentials are used to probabilistically extract pose constraints for tracking by using weighted sampling from a pose posterior guided by the model. In the final energy, these constraints are combined with an appearance-based model-to-image similarity term. Poses can be computed very efficiently using iterative local optimization, as ConvNet detection is fast, and our formulation yields a combined pose estimation energy with analytic derivatives. In combination, this enables to track full articulated joint angles at state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal stability with a very low number of cameras.
