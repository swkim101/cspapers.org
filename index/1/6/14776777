A new algorithm for solving the three dimensional container packing problem is proposed in this paper. This new algorithm deviates from the traditional approach of wall building and layering. It uses the concept of "building growing" from multiple sides of the container. We tested our method using all 760 test cases from the OR-Library. Experimental results indicate that the new algorithm is able to achieve an average packing utilization of more than 87%. This is better than the results reported in the literature.
