During testing, the execution of valid cases is only one part of the task. Checking the behavior in boundary situations and in the presence of errors is an equally important subject. This is especially true in embedded systems where parts of a system's function are realized by sensors and actuators, which are subject to wear and defects. As testing with the real hardware is costly and hardware defects are hard to stimulate, such tests are often performed using behavior models of the system which allow to execute the controller software against simulated hardware and environment. However, these models seldom contain possible hardware errors, as this makes the models more complex and, thus, harder to create and maintain. This paper presents a modeling technique for the description of system errors without modifying the original model. Error specifications for individual system components are modeled separately and can be used to augment the system model.
