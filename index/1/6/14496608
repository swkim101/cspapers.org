COREL is an experimental retrieval system that employs techniques of artificial intelligence. Articles of the Civil Code of Louisiana have been conceptually indexed using frame-based knowledge structures in hope of improving accessibility over traditional key-word retrieval systems. A set of macro packages has been developed to allow a domain expert to implement a retrieval system based on this methodology.
