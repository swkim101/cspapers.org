Vehicular Networks are more and more considerable recently. With the rapid advance of information technology, it becomes easy to support low cost inter-vehicle communication. In particular, the demand for delay sensitive applications, such as streaming media distribution, is increasing. However, due to the high mobility, links between roadside units and wireless nodes are intermittent, unreliable and inefficient. We propose cross-layer cooperative routing (CLCR) for vehicular networks to overcome the unreliability of the wireless channel and maximize the system throughput. Owing to different relay nodes may lead to different results. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to choose appropriate relay nodes in vehicular networks. Furthermore, we extend the lifetime of routing path to reduce the frequency of route rediscovering. Simulation results based on network simulator 2 (ns2) and mobility model generator for vehicular networks (MOVE) show the proposed CLCR has good performance.
