Cognitive informatics is an interdisciplinary research area that paves way for finding solutions to problems in the related field such as problem understanding, artificial intelligence, cognitive sciences etc. It studies the information processing mechanism and its relation to the behavior thereupon, may it be system or an individual. Cognition defines the ease of understanding or the property of comprehension. Comprehension is the key feature that distinguishes any entity as being complex or simple. Comprehensibility of a problem helps in efficient design solution and improvement of software product quality. Thus property of comprehensibility can be used in all the different phases of software engineering. Hence, from a practitioner's point of view, we need a object-oriented metric based on cognition that will act as a yardstick in designing efficient software systems.
