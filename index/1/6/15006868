By nature, we are circadian creatures whose bodies' biological clocks drive numerous physiological, mental, and behavioral rhythms. Simultaneously, we are social beings. Accordingly, our internal circadian timings experience interference from externally determined factors such as work schedules and social engagements, and digital connectivity imports additional social constraints that can further misalign our individual body clocks. Misalignment between biological and social time causes social jet lag [50], which has serious physical and mental health consequences. It particularly impacts our sleep processes and neurobehavioral functioning. Examining the interplay between biological rhythms and technology-mediated social interactions, we find that technology may both modulate and reflect circadian rhythms. We also leverage such social-sensor data to infer sleep-related behaviors and disruptions and to analyze variations in attention, cognitive performance, and mood following (in)adequate sleep. We conclude with recommendations for designing technologies attuned to our innate biological traits.
