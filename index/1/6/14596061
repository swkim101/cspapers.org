This paper traces the history of computer architecture courses in U. S. electrical engineering departments. Data from the Fall 1972 survey of U. S. and Canadian electrical engineering departments by the COSINE Committee of the Commission on Education of the National Academy of Engineering are given to show current computer architecture course offerings and texts. Computer architecture courses offered in 1972-73 are analyzed, compared with ACM and COSINE recommendations, and classified into five categories: introductory computer engineering courses with a computer architecture flavor, software -oriented computer organization courses, hardware-oriented computer organization courses, case study courses, and topical seminars Future trends in computer architecture education are predicted.
