The engineering design process, such asairplane or building design, involves the participation of many independent specialists who need to share information stored in several autonomous design databases. To insure consistency of the final design, high-level constraints need to be defined and enforced on the design objects stored in these pre-existing databases. The constraints need to be verified when the participating databases are updated. In this paper, we present an architecture of a distributed constraint management system that checks design constraints on pre-existing autonomous databases. The architecture emphasizes independence of constraint management from the underlying databases systems to avoid compromising site autonomy. To provide this independence, we present a declarative constraint language for specifying constraints, which facilitates compile time optimizations such as constraint fragmentation and local validation strategies. We also support set-oriented updates that model transactions in engineering applications, and notifications that model interaction between designers. Early detection of constraint violation and appropriate notifications to the participants can avoid expensive project delays and cost overruns. A prototype of the proposed architecture is being implemented using the Starburst database system at Permieeion to copy without fee ell or part of thie materiel ie granted provided that the copiee era not med. or distributed for direct oornrrmrciel advantege, the ACM copyright notice and the tide of the publication end ite dote eppaer, and notice ie given thet copying ie by permieeion of the Aeeocintion for Computing Machinery.
