Studies on retention and success in introductory programming course have suggested that previous programming experience contributes to students' course outcomes. If such background information could be automatically distilled from students' working process, additional guidance and support mechanisms could be provided even to those, who do not wish to disclose such information. In this study, we explore methods for automatically distinguishing novice programmers from more experienced programmers using fine-grained source code snapshot data. We approach the issue by partially replicating a previous study that used students' keystroke latencies as a proxy to introductory programming course outcomes, and follow this by an exploration of machine learning methods to separate those students with little to no previous programming experience from those with more experience. Our results confirm that students' keystroke latencies can be used as a metric for measuring course outcomes. At the same time, our results show that students programming experience can be identified to some extent from keystroke latency data, which means that such data has potential as a source of information for customizing the students' learning experience.
