Ultrasound tomography offers the potential for detecting of very small tumors whose sizes are smaller than the wavelength of the incident pressure wave without ionizing radiation. Based on inverse scattering technique, this imaging modality uses some material properties such as sound contrast and attenuation in order to detect small objects. One of the most commonly used methods in ultrasound tomography is the Distorted Born Iterative Method (DBIM). The compressed sensing technique was applied in the DBIM as a promising approach for the image reconstruction quality improvement. Nevertheless, the random measurement configuration of transducers in this method is very difficult to set up in practice. Therefore, in this paper, we take advantages of simpler sparse uniform measurement configuration set-up of transducers and high-quality image reconstruction of l1 non-linear regularization in sparse scattering domain. The simulation results demonstrate the high performance of the proposed approach in terms of tremendously reduced total runtime and normalized error.
