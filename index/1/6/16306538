We present a novel system which incorporates photometric stereo with the Time-of-Flight depth sensor. Adding to the classic ToF, the system utilizes multiple point light sources that enable the capturing of a normal field whilst taking depth images. Two calibration methods are proposed to determine the light sources' positions given the ToF sensor's relatively low resolution. An iterative refinement algorithm is formulated to account for the extra phase delays caused by the positions of the light sources. We find in experiments that the system is comparable to the classic ToF in depth accuracy, and it is able to recover finer details that are lost due to the noise level of the ToF sensor.
