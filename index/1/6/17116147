A new structure for implementing data cache prefetching is proposed and analyzed via simulation. The structure is based on a Global History Buffer that holds the most recent miss addresses in FIFO order. Linked lists within this global history buffer connect addresses that have some common property, e.g. they were all generated by the same load instruction. The Global History Buffer can be used for implementing a number of previously proposed prefetch methods, as well as new ones. Prefetching with the Global History Buffer has two significant advantages over conventional table prefetching methods. First, the use of a FIFO history buffer can improve the accuracy of correlation prefetching by eliminating stale data from the table. Second, the Global History Buffer contains a more complete (and intact) picture of cache miss history, creating opportunities to design more effective prefetching methods. Global History Buffer prefetching can increase correlation prefetching performance by 20% and cut its memory traffic by 90%. Furthermore, the Global History Buffer can make correlations within a loadâ€™s address stream, which can increase stride prefetching performance by 6%. Collectively, the Global History Buffer prefetching methods perform as well or better than the conventional prefetching methods studied on 14 of 15 benchmarks.
