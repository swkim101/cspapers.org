Recent robotic research recognized the advantages that Variable Impedance Actuators would yield to a new generation of robots, rendering them adapt to many different tasks of everyday life. In this work we present the development of a Variable Damping mechanism, designed to integrate within a modular Variable Stiffness Actuator platform to realize a complete Variable Impedance Actuation unit. After a short discussion on the possible implementation strategies, the different operation principles and realization methods of damping systems are initially introduced, and a detailed description of the mechatronics and functionalities of a novel variable damping unit follows. In particular, the proposed implementation adopts an innovative aperture mechanism, similar to the light shutter of a camera, to engage a rotating chamber of high-viscosity silicon oil. Finally, some experiments are shown, to validate and characterize the system.
