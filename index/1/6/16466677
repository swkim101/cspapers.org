It is well known that a great number of query--document features which significantly improve the quality of ranking for popular queries, however, do not provide any benefit for new or rare queries since there is typically not enough data associated with those queries that is required to reliably compute the values of those features. It is a common practice to propagate the values of such features from popular to tail queries, if the queries are similar according to some predefined query similarity functions. In this paper, we propose new algorithms that facilitate and increase the effectiveness of this propagation. Given a query similarity function and a query--document relevance feature, we introduce two different approaches (linear weighting approach and tree-based approach) to learn a function of values of the similarity function and values of the feature for the similar queries w.r.t. the given document. The propagated value of the feature equals the value of the obtained function for the given query--document pair.
