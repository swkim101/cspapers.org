The goal of this paper is to generate and stabilize a periodic walking motion for a five degrees of freedom planar robot. First of all we will consider a biped version of the spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP), which shows openloop stable behavior. Then we will control the robot behavior as close as possible to the simple model. In this way we take advantage of the open-loop stability of the walking pattern related to the SLIP, and additional control actions are used to increase the robustness of the system and reject external disturbances. To this end an upper level controller will deal with the stabilization of the SLIP model, while a lower level controller will map the simple virtual model onto the real robot dynamics. Two different approaches are implemented for the lower level: in the first one, we aim at exactly reproducing the same acceleration that a SLIP would have when put in the same condition, while in the second one, we aim at a simpler control law without exactly reproducing the aforementioned acceleration. The latter case is equivalent to considering a SLIP with additional external disturbances, which have to be handled by the upper level controller. Both approaches can successfully reproduce a periodic walking pattern for the robot.
