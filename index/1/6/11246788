A compositional semantics for focusing subjuncts---words such as only, even, and also---is developed from Rooth's theory of association with focus. By adapting the theory so that it can be expressed in terms of a frame-based semantic formalism, a semantics that is more computationally practical is arrived at. This semantics captures pragmatic subtleties by incorporating a two-part representation, and recognizes the contribution of intonation to meaning.
