Intelligent keyboards aid fast text entry by correcting user's erroneous input, but there is a big problem that a user always has to watch and judge of their suggestion results. Contelli, a user-controllable intelligent keyboard, monitors the duration of each key-tapping, and analyzes the possibility of mis-typing only for short-tapped letters. A long-tapped letter is regarded as a precise input and excluded in the process of candidate generation from a lexicon. Using Contelli, a user may actively "control" the intelligent keyboards. S/he may type ordinary words quickly on watch-sized small touchscreens. Also, s/he may input a word as typed without switching off the automatic replacement or performing additional actions for the replaced result. In addition, long-tapping a part of a string reduces the number of replacement candidates, which contributes the more precise word replacement for highly erroneous input typed on small touchscreens.
