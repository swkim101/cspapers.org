This paper considers DoS attacks on DNS wherein attackers flood the nameservers of a zone to disrupt resolution of resource records belonging to the zone and consequently, any of its sub-zones. We propose a minor change in the caching behavior of DNS resolvers that can significantly alleviate the impact of such attacks. In our proposal, DNS resolvers do not completely evict cached resource records whose TTL has expired; rather, such resource records are stored in a separate "stale cache". If, during the resolution of a query, a resolver does not receive any response from the nameservers that are responsible for authoritatively answering the query, it can use the information stored in the stale cache to answer the query. In effect, the stale cache is the part of the global DNS database that has been accessed by the resolver and represents an insurance policy that the resolver uses only when the relevant DNS servers are unavailable. We analyze a 65-day DNS trace to quantify the benefits of a stale cache under different attack scenarios. Further, while the proposed change to DNS resolvers also changes DNS semantics, we argue that it does not adversely impact any of the fundamental DNS characteristics such as the autonomy of zone operators and hence, is a very simple and practical candidate for mitigating the impact of DoS attacks on DNS.
