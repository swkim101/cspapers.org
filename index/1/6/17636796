The oldest known game tree search algorithm Alpha-Beta is still the most popular one. All other algorithms in this area fall short of Alpha-Beta in one or more of the following three desired characteristics high pruning power, low storage requirement and low execution time. This paper discusses how revisit of nodes can be used effectively in game tree search. A few strategies of introducing revisits in game tree search are presented. It is demonstrated that for any shape and ordering of the game tree to be searched, there always exists one strategy that, on an average, consistently evaluates less number of terminals than Alpha-Beta in comparable memory and time.
