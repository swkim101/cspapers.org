The Internet of things consists of a high amount of heterogeneous objects that are widely distributed and evolve frequently according to their context changes. Management of such a complex environment is costly in terms of time and money. Designing a context aware autonomic framework with capability of self-management is a challenge. This paper proposes FRAMESELF, a generic and extensible autonomic framework to self-manage ubiquitous environments based on ontologies, graph models, and reasoning rules. A smart metering use case is experimented to illustrate the proposed solution.
