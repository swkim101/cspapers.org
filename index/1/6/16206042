We introduce a simple opinion mining system for analyzing Japanese Weblog reviews called OMS-J. OMS-J is designed to provide an intuitive visual GUI of opinion mining graphs for a comparison of different products of the same type to help a user make a quick purchase decision. We first use an opinion mining method using a combination of supervised (a Naive Bayes Classifier) and unsupervised (an improved SO-PMI: Semantic Orientation Using Pointwise Mutual Information) learning.
