This paper considers the active control problem of reconfigurable mobile robots on irregular terrain. A kinematic control strategy to improve robot mobility (stability and traction) is proposed. The proposed control is validated through numerical simulations and experimental tests using an amphibious wheel-legged robot, named Environmental Hybrid Robot, recently developed by Petrobras S.A. (Brazilian Petroleum Company) for environmental monitoring in the Amazon rain forest.
