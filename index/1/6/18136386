Logic programming and AI based courses have been taught during the last few years to Israeli high school students as part of a computer science curriculum. A special curriculum aimed at teaching concepts of logic programming and AI principles, using Abstract Data Types (ADTs) in Prolog environment was developed in the Weizmann Institute of Science. This curriculum is based on a flexible instructional model according to which the processes of problem solving and knowledge representation are carried out through several main phases while using ADTs. The flexibility of the model is achieved by encapsulating the ADTs' implementation in distinct computer programs. The curriculum was successfully implemented in Israeli high schools and was found to be suitable for a wide range of students.
