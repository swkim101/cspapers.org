This is a report on a work in progress. The project emerged from our participation with Oberon (a descendant of Pascal and Modula-2) in Project 7 that was launched by Microsoft Research in 1999 with the goal of implementing an exemplary set of nonstandard programming languages for the .NET interoperability platform. Our motivation for continuing was double-faced; a) explore the potential of .NET in combination with the new compiler integration technology CCI as an experimental field for language design and b) implement Zonnon for .NET, an evolution of Oberon for .NET.
