However, most existing community-finding methods have focused on finding communities using network topologies, and the problem of extracting module semantics has not been well studied and node contents, which often contain semantic information of nodes and networks, have not been fully utilized. We considered the problem of identifying network communities and module semantics at the same time. We introduced a novel generative model with two closely correlated parts, one for communities and the other for semantics. We developed a co-learning strategy to jointly train the two parts of the model by combining a nested EM algorithm and belief propagation. By extracting the latent correlation between the two parts, our new method is not only robust for finding communities and semantics, but also able to provide more than one semantic explanation to a community. We evaluated the new method on artificial benchmarks and analyzed the semantic interpretability by a case study. We compared the new method with eight state-of-the-art methods on ten real-world networks, showing its superior performance over the existing methods.
