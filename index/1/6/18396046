From mobile devices to interactive objects, various input methods are provided using built-in motion and capacitive touch sensors. These inputs are offered in effective and efficient manner where users can operate interface quickly and easily. However, they do not fully explore the input space supported by human's natural motion behavior. As a solution, my work focuses on promoting natural interaction through hand-driven embedded input powered by multimodal and magnetic sensing techniques. In my previous works, embedded inputs were implemented in the form of smart textile, stylus, and ring supporting from mobile devices to everyday objects. Throughout the paper, I will briefly go over implemented systems along with evaluated results and potential applications. Future research direction is highlighted at the end of the paper.
