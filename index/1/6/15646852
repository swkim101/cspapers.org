The study described in this article continues research on gender-related issues in Computer Science education by focusing on the differences between two sectors in the Israeli high school system -- the Jewish sector (majority) and the Arab sector (minority). As it turns out, the under-representation of female high school students in CS studies is significantly more salient in the majority sector. This study explores this situation and attempts to explain it. We also explain how the findings of this research can be applied to other countries and societies.
