Morphologically rich languages such as Turkish may benefit from morphological analysis in natural language tasks. In this study, we examine the effects of morphological analysis on text categorization task in Turkish. We use stems and word categories that are extracted with morphological analysis as main features and compare them with fixed length stemmers in a bag of words approach with several learning algorithms. We aim to show the effects of using varying degrees of morphological information.
