We evaluated a Prolog machine PSI (Personal Sequential Inference machine) for the purpose of improving and redesigning it. In this evaluation, we measured the execution speed and the dynamic characteristics of cache memory, register file, and branching hardware introduced for high-speed execution of Prolog programs.Execution speed of the PSI firmware interpreter was found to be comparable to that of the DEC-10 Prolog compiled code on the DEC-2060. It was also found that PSI was faster than DEC for executing programs containing much unification and backtracking that require runtime processing.With the cache memory, the hit ratio for application programs was found higher than 96%; this demonstrates that the Prolog execution has much memory access locality. The memory access frequency and the appearance ratio between Read and Write command were also investigated.Concerning the register file, use rate of each dedicated access mode was measured and effect of each mode was discussed. In the branching function we confirmed a high appearance rate of conditional branches and multi-way branches based on tag values.
