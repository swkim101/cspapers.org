Successful navigation from a relevant web page to other relevant pages depends on the page linking to other relevant pages. We measured the distance to travel from relevant page to relevant page and found a bimodal distribution of distances peaking at 4 and 15 hops. In an attempt to make it easier to navigate among relevant pages, we added content similarity links to pages. With these additional links, significantly more relevant documents were close to each other. A browser plug-in or other tool that provides links to pages similar to a given page should increase the ability of web users to find relevant pages via navigation.
