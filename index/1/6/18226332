In this paper, we demonstrate the FusionDB system; an extended relational database engine for managing conflicts in small-science databases. In small sciences, groups---each consists of few scientists---may share and exchange parts of their own databases among each other to foster collaboration. The goal of such sharing, especially when done at early stages of the discovery process, is not to build a warehouse or a unified schema, instead the goal is to compare and verify results, detect and assess conflicts, and possibly modify or re-design the discovery process. FusionDB is designed to meet the requirements and address the challenges of such sharing model. We will demonstrate the key functionalities of FusionDB including: (1) Detecting conflicts using a rule-based model over heterogeneous schemas, (2) Assessing conflicts and providing probabilistic estimates for values' correctness, (3) Extended querying capabilities in the presence of conflicts, and (4) Providing curation operations to help scientists resolve and investigate conflicts according to different priorities. FusionDB is realized on top of PostgreSQL DBMS.
