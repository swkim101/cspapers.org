The Open Source Component Artefact Repository (OS- CAR) was developed under the auspices of the GENESIS project to store data produced during the software development process. Significant problems were encountered during the course of the project in both the development itself and management of the project. The reasons for and potential solutions to these problems are examined with the intention of developing a set of guidelines to enable participants in other collaborative projects to avoid these pitfalls. We wish to make it clear that we attach no opprobrium to any of the participants in the GENESIS project as many of the issues we outline below have solutions only visible with hindsight. Instead, we seek to provide a fair-minded critique of our role and the mistakes we made in a fairly typical two-year EU research project, and to provide a set of recommendations for other similar projects, in order that they can (attempt to) avoid suffering similarly.
