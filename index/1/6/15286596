New mothers can experience social exclusion, particularly during the early weeks when infants are solely dependent on their mothers. We used ethnographic methods to investigate whether technology plays a role in supporting new mothers. Our research identified two core themes: (1) the need to improve confidence as a mother; and (2) the need to be more than \'18just' a mother. We reflect on these findings both in terms of those interested in designing applications and services for motherhood and also the wider CHI community.
