Sports exercises are beneficial for general health and fitness. Some exercises such as weight lifting are particularly error-prone and using incorrect techniques can result in serious injuries. The current work aims to develop a weight lifting assistant that relies on motion sensors mounted on the body and integrated into gym equipment that provides qualitative feedback on the user's performance. We believe that by comparing motion data recorded from different parts of the body with a mathematical model of the correct technique, we will be able to qualitatively assess the user's performance, and provide a score and suggestions for improvement.
