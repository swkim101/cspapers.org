Between-task similarity often provides useful cues, such as feature sharing, for learning visual classifiers. By contrast, the competition relationship between visual recognition tasks (e.g., content independent writer identification and handwriting recognition) remains largely under-explored. A key challenge in visual recognition is to select the most discriminating features and remove irrelevant features related to intra-class variations. With the help of auxiliary competing tasks, we can identify such features within a joint learning model exploiting the competition relationship.Motivated by this intuition, we propose a novel way to exploit competition relationship for solving visual recognition problems. Specifically, given a target task and its competing tasks, we jointly model them by a generalized additive regression model with a competition constraint. This constraint effectively discourages choosing of irrelevant features (weak learners) that support the auxiliary competing tasks. We name the proposed algorithm CompBoost. In our study, CompBoost is applied to two visual recognition applications: (1) content-independent writer identification from handwriting scripts by exploiting competing tasks of handwriting recognition, and (2) actor-independent facial expression recognition by exploiting competing tasks of face recognition. In both experiments our approach demonstrates promising performance gains by exploiting the between-task competition.
