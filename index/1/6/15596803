Smartwatches are operating under tight energy constraints. In this paper, we describe our on-going work on measuring and optimizing Android smartwatch energy consumption. We derived power models for commodity smartwatches, and then applied the power model to an IRB-approved user study involving 30 smartwatch users. We then propose research ideas on improving energy efficiencies for Android smartwatches.
