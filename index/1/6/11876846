Automatic image annotation is an important function for online photo sharing service. The concurrence of labels is pretty common in multi-label annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called latent-community and multi-kernel learning (LCMKL). The established graph of labels is regarded as a semantic network. Community detection method is introduced that treats the label set as communities. Multi-kernel learning SVM is adopted for specifying communities and settling difficulty of extracting semantically meaningful entities with some simple features. Experiments on NUS-WIDE database demonstrate that LCMKL outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.
