A number of educational institutions of the world offer academic programs in Computer Science for undergraduate and graduate students. Many of these programs have used a medium sized to large computer system as a facility for the students. There is a need for a system in which the students have full access to the machine in terms of hardware and software details. Most commercial systems do not normally provide this information. In this paper we describe an experimental system designed and built at I.I.T., Madras, which is used for illustrating several concepts in Machine Organization, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems Distributed Computing etc.. present use of the system for Computer Science instruction is identified and proposed applications are indicated.
