As people visit various places in their daily lives, connections are formed between people via places (co-presence), and between places via people (overlapping). This paper introduces a method for modeling social and geographical context based on colocation networks in human mobility datasets. Applying the method to a metropolitan-scale mobility dataset reveals a variety of place groups that can be considered in the design of urban ubicomp applications.
