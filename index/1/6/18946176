Learning about design is a central component in education for human-computer interaction. We have foimd Design Space Analysis to be a useful technique for students learning user interface design skills. In the FLUID tool described here, we have combined explicit instruction on design, worked case studies, and problem exercises for learners, yielding an interactive multimedia system to be incorporated into an HCI design course. FLUID is intended as a "training wheels" for learning user interface design. In this paper, we address the question of how this form of teaching might mediate and extend the learning process and we present our observations on Design Space Aniysis as a training wheels aid for learning user interface design.
