We give a technical description of the fission module of the COMIC multimodal dialogue system, which both plans the multimodal content of the system turns and controls the execution of those plans. We emphasise the parts of the implementation that allow the system to begin producing output as soon as possible by preparing and outputting the content in parallel. We also demonstrate how the module was designed to ensure robustness and configurability, and describe how the module has performed successfully as part of the overall system. Finally, we discuss how the techniques used in this module can be applied to other similar dialogue systems.
