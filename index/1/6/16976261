Estimating Cartesian contact forces and torques enables external force supervision for robotic manipulators and even force-controlled applications while avoiding the need for additional external sensing. Redundant manipulators facilitate the problem of Cartesian contact force and torque estimation (CCFE) at the TCP, since an increased amount of joint level information is available for estimating the six components of external wrench. In this paper, we point out that the errors in CCFE estimates arising from inevitable uncertainties in available joint level information (either measurements or estimates) depend on the manipulator configuration. Based on this, an algorithm is proposed that resolves redundancy in an optimal way with respect of the achievable CCFE quality. For a given TCP pose, the joint configuration resulting in minimized CCFE errors is calculated. The proposed method is verified by means of experimental data gathered from a 7DOF manipulator.
