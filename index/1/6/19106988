Although reward shaping has previously been introduced to accelerate learning by bootstrapping an agent with additional information, this can lead to problems with convergence. We present a novel Bayesian reward shaping framework that augments the reward distribution with prior beliefs that decay with experience. Formally, we prove that under suitable conditions a Markov decision process augmented with our framework is consistent with the optimal policy of the original MDP when using the Q-learning algorithm. However, in general our method integrates seamlessly with any reinforcement learning algorithm that learns a value or action-value function through experience. Experiments are run on a gridworld and a more complex backgammon domain that show that we can learn tasks significantly faster when we specify intuitive priors on the reward distribution.
