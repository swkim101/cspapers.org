This paper describes the development of a laser-based ranging device, as part of a sensor work package that is to be integrated into an autonomous underwater vehicle. The objective of the laser ranging component includes robust operation in turbid ocean environments from 1 to 10 meters with a balance of accuracy and speed. A calibration technique that utilizes a spline interpolation is employed as an accurate, yet simple alternative to conventional triangulation methods. The resulting configuration is capable of range detection within 2% absolute error, at a 10 Hz refresh rate, out to 4 meters in turbid ocean conditions, and to greater than 10 meters in air. The maximum underwater range of the system is currently limited by the existing hardware, whereas the software is ready for any future system upgrades.
