This paper deals with the s-dim parameter of bipartite graphs (minimum number of complete bipartite subgraphs that cover the edges of the bipartite graph). Computing sdim is an NP-hard problem [ll] which arises in many areas and has many applications. We propose a polynomial class for this problem, namely the bipartite domino-free graphs, that strictly generalizes most of known polynomial clauses. This class is the first non trivial one allowing chordless cycles. We propose a O(n x m) algorithm to compute the s-dim parameter of such graphs where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges. This algorithm improves the O(m2) algorithm proposed in [9] to compute the jump number of distance-hereditary bipartite graphs. Our result follows from properties of the Galois lattice associated to domino-free bipartite graph.
