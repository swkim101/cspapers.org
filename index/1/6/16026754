Model-based design is an important approach for embedded software. The method starts from a mathematical representation of the design problem and derives the software implementation from this representation. The model that has had most success especially for control dominated application is synchronous reactive. While this model simplifies the way of dealing with concurrency by decoupling functional and timing aspects, when implemented, it may be inefficient since the synchronous assumption implies constraints that are stronger than needed. We present in this paper a method for improving the efficiency of the software design process, by relaxing computation constraints, while preserving the synchronous computation semantics, with the introduction of a particular inter-task communication mechanism. We show how this mechanism can be implemented on single processor, multi processor and distributed implementation platforms.
