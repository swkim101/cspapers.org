This paper deals with localization of a mobile robot using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in low power IEEE 802.15.4 conform wireless communication in an outdoor environment. Hardware modifications are derived to reduce the radio irregularity and to increase the uniqueness of the measured RSSI to distance. A novel algorithm is elaborated allowing for sub meter accuracy. It accounts for the noise and implicitly models the uncertainty. Additionally it is robust to node failures. To further improve the accuracy a particle filter is employed to perform probabilistic sensor fusion of odometry, ultrasonic and RSSI sensors and a map. The suitability of this approach is shown with real measurements achieving a mean positioning error of 0.32 m.
