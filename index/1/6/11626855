In this poster, we develop an evolutionary document summarization system for discovering the changes and differences in each phase of a disaster evolution. Given a collection of document streams describing an event, our system generates a short summary delivering the main development theme of the event by extracting the most representative and discriminative sentences at each phase. Experimental results on the collection of press releases for Hurricane Wilma in 2005 demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal.
