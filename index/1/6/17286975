The state-of-the-art in intelligent assist devices (IADs) is reviewed. IADs are computer-controlled tools that enable production workers to lift, move and position payloads quickly, accurately, and safely. Several examples of industrial applications are given, illustrating typical configurations and functionality, including strength amplification and virtual surfaces. The concept of human intent sensing is introduced and discussed, as are IAD safety and control considerations.
