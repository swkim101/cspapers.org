We investigate constructions of pseudorandom generators that fool polynomial tests of degree <i>d</i> in <i>m</i> variables over finite fields F. Our main construction gives a generator with seed length <i>O</i>(<i>d</i><sup>4</sup> log <i>m</i> (1 + log(<i>d</i> ⁄ ε) ⁄ log log <i>m</i>) + log |F|) bits that achieves arbitrarily small bias ε and works whenever |F| is at least polynomial in <i>d</i>, log <i>m</i>, and 1⁄ε. We also present an alternate construction that uses a seed that can be described by <i>O</i>(<i>c</i><sup>2</sup><i>d</i><sup>8</sup><i>m</i><sup>6⁄(<i>c</i>-2)</sup> log(<i>d</i>⁄ε) + log |F|) bits (more precisely, <i>O</i>(<i>c</i><sup>2</sup><i>d</i><sup>8</sup><i>m</i><sup>6⁄(<i>c</i>-2)</sup>) field elements, each chosen from a set of size poly(<i>cd</i>⁄ε), plus two field elements ranging over all of F), works whenever |F| is at least polynomial in <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, and 1⁄ε, and has the property that every element of the output is a function of at most <i>c</i> field elements in the input. Both generators are computable by small arithmetic circuits. The main tool used in the construction is a reduction that allows us to transform any "dense" hitting set generator for polynomials into a pseudorandom generator.
