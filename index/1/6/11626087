Semantic deﬁcit is a symptom of language impairment in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We present a generalizable method for automatic generation of information content units (ICUs) for a picture used in a standard clinical task, achieving high recall, 96.8%, of human-supplied ICUs. We use the automatically generated topic model to extract semantic features, and train a random forest classiﬁer to achieve an F-score of 0.74 in binary classiﬁcation of controls versus people with AD using a set of only 12 features. This is comparable to re-sults (0.72 F-score) with a set of 85 manual features. Adding semantic information to a set of standard lexicosyntactic and acoustic features improves F-score to 0.80. While control and dementia subjects discuss the same topics in the same contexts, controls are more informative per second of speech.
