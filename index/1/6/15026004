A bottom-up visual saliency detector is proposed, following a decision-theoretic formulation of saliency, previously developed for top-down processing (object recognition) [5]. The saliency of a given location of the visual field is defined as the power of a Gabor-like feature set to discriminate between the visual appearance of 1) a neighborhood centered at that location (the center) and 2) a neighborhood that surrounds it (the surround). Discrimination is defined in an information-theoretic sense and the optimal saliency detector derived for a class of stimuli that complies with known statistical properties of natural images, so as to achieve a computationally efficient solution. The resulting saliency detector is shown to replicate the fundamental properties of the psychophysics of pre-attentive vision, including stimulus pop-out, inability to detect feature conjunctions, asymmetries with respect to feature presence vs. absence, and compliance with Weber's law. It is also shown that the detector produces better predictions of human eye fixations than two previously proposed bottom-up saliency detectors.
