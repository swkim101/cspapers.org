Some courses in computer organization and assembly language programming have evolved away from ones emphasizing proficiency with a particular machine. Instead, these courses attempt to build understanding for the way in which abstract concepts are ultimately realized through machine level programming. The advent of small computers offers an opportunity to further personalize this form of instruction and to improve its delivery and availability. This paper discusses a package of software for use on personal computers which supports the teaching of courses in computer organization and assembly language programming. The software permits visualization of various abstractions, concepts, and phenomena. Examples of its use in teaching are examined, and related directions in teaching courses of this type are examined.
