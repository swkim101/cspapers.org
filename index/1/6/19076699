Incorporating information security into the undergraduate curriculum continues to be a topic of interest to SIGCSE attendees. The purpose of this BOF is to help sustain the existing community of educators and researchers interested in bringing ethical hacking skills and an understanding of security into the classroom and relating these topics to the foundations of Computer Science. We would like to bring our colleagues together to share pedagogical practices, stories of hacking and how to use them to inspire our students and communicate complex concepts in computer science and security. We also plan to discuss our own experiences, practices and ongoing efforts (e.g., our infosec teaching experiences, the SISMAT program, EDURange and the dissemination of infosec interactive exercises). SISMAT is one of many alternatives for teaching cybersecurity to undergraduates. It is based on the "Hacker Curriculum" and includes a two-week summer intensive program, a research component and an internship. A description can be viewed at http://www.ists.dartmouth.edu/events/sismat/. An education in computer science can be an important resource in nurturing future leaders in cybersecurity, but only if we enable a community of educators willing to share approaches. This was highlighted by Sally Finch's keynote speech in 2010. At our BOF last year, several people had stories to share, and we plan to focus on that.
