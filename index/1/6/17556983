WAPS (WArranty Planning System) is a Data Mining support environment which is developed within a cooperation between DaimlerChrysler Research & Technology, Ulm and the Sales and Services Direction, Stuttgart. Data Mining modelling is performed in WAPS by using an innovative approach based on regression analysis taking into account the structural change of warranty and goodwill costs data. In this paper, we describe the different development phases of WAPS.
