Creating a piece of music requires deep knowledge of composition, and is time-consuming even for experts. Algorithmic composition systems can generate pieces in an existing style. However, these systems are not interactive. Therefore, it is difficult for them to express the user's intention. We propose a system that recommends a continuation melody in accordance with a melody expressed by the user. Recommendation uses the style of the piece of the composer, thus users give the system a piece of the style in which they want to compose. With this system, users can compose pieces tailored to their needs, and composers can get assistance with composition.
