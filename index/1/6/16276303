A minimum k-way cut of an n-vertex, m-edge, weighted, undirected graph is a partition of the vertices into k sets that minimizes the total weight of edges with endpoints in different sets. We give new randomized algorithms to find minimum 3-way and 4-way cuts, which lead to time bounds of O(mn k-2 log s n) time for k < 6. This improves on the best previous time bounds by a factor of ~(n2). 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n A minimum k-way cut of an n-vertex, m-edge, weighted, undirected graph is a partition of the vertices into k sets that minimizes the total weight of edges with endpoints in different sets. Asking for a minimum k-way cut is equivalent to asking for the edge set of minimum total weight whose removal would break the graph into at least k connected components. Our main motivations for studying minimum k-way cuts are that they are a natural property of graphs, and that they have received considerable attention in the past. Nagamochi and Ibaraki [111 also point to a number of applications, including finding cutting planes for the traveling salesman problem, VLSI design, task allocation in distributed computing, and network reliability. Goldschmidt and Hochbaum [2] showed that the minimum k-way cut problem is NP-hard if k is part of the input, but that it can be solved in polynomial time if k is fixed. In particular, they gave a deterministic algorithm with a running time of O(nk2/2-3k/2+4F(n, m)), where F(n, m) is the time to compute a minimum st cut (the minimum 2-way cut that separates specified vertices s and t), which can be solved in O(mn) time by a maximum flow computation. Karger and Stein [9] improved on this algorithm with a randomized one that Laboratory for Computer Science, Cambridge, MA 02138. This work partially supported by NSF contract CCR9624239, an Alfred P.

(At least, they are the best ones that are fully written up. Nagamochi and Ibaraki [12] say "a determihistic O(n2k-3m) time algorithm is claimed in [6] (where no full proof is given).") Better results are known for several special cases. The minimum 2-way cut problem, more commonly known as simply the minimum cut problem, or the problem of computing edge-connectivity, can be solved in O(mn) time by deterministic algorithms of Hao and Orlin [3] or Nagamochi and Ibaraki [101 and in d)(n ~) or d)(m) time by randomized algorithms of Karger and Stein [9] and Karger [8], respectively. Improvements were made for the minimum 3-way cut problem as well. Hochbaum and Shmoys [4] showed that on an unweighted planar graph it can be solved in O(n 2) time. Kapoor [7] and Kamidoi, Wakabayashi, and Yoshida [5] showed that the problem can be solved in O(n3F(n,m)) time. Burlet and Goldschmidt [1] improved this to O(mn ~) time. For the minimum 4-way cut problem, Kamidoi, Wakabayashi, and Yoshida [5] gave an O(n~F(n, m))time algorithm. Finally, in a recent paper Nagamochi and Ibaraki gave an 0(mn~)-time algorithm for k ~_ 4, and Nagamochi, Katayama, and Ibaraki [121 extended this result to work for k < 6. Our results, which improve on Nagamochi, Katayama, and Ibaraki's results by a factor of ~(n2), are very much grounded in the past results. In particular, the 3-way cut algorithm makes use of Burlet and Goldschmidt's structural result, Karger's minimum 2-way cut algorithm, and Nagamochi and Ibaraki's structural result and algorithm framework. The high level view is that Burlet and Goldschmidt gave a way to break the computation up into not too many subproblems, which could be identified quickly, but took some time to solve. Nagamochi and Ibaraki took a different approach that created far few subproblems, but which took some time to identify. Our algorithm is a hybrid that manages to keep only the fast part of each algorithm. Our 4-way cut algorithm is similar to the 3-way cut one, except that we needed to find an appropriate
