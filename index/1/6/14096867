Wearable computing represented an important paradigm shift in engineering and computer science. At the present time, wearable computing is undergoing a new paradigm shift: the wearable systems that used to be transportable devices are actually weaving itself into "the fabric of everyday life" (as predicted by Weiser). Indeed, the current trend of wearable computing is integrating the technology directly in the garments without introducing new body-worn systems. Clothes, shoes, eye-glasses, bracelets and watches are becoming smarter, seamlessly embedding more and more powerful computational resources and communication possibilities. The change has already begun and this workshop aims to bring together researchers from the academia and the industry in order to establish a multidisciplinary community interested in discovering and exploring the challenges and opportunities coming from this natural evolution of wearable computing.
