Recently, network traffic analysis has been increasingly used in various applications including security, targeted advertisements, and network management. However, data encryption performed on network traffic poses a challenge to these analysis techniques. In this paper, we present a novel method to extract characteristics from encrypted traffic by utilizing data dependencies that occur over sequential transmissions of network packets. Furthermore, we explore the temporal nature of encrypted traffic and introduce an adaptive model that considers changes in data content over time. We evaluate our analysis on two packet encrypted applications: website fingerprinting and mobile application (app) fingerprinting. Our evaluation shows how the proposed approach outperforms previous works especially in the open-world scenario and when defense mechanisms are considered.
