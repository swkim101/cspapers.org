This paper concerns the design of a flexible and efficient packet monitoring program for analyzing traffic patterns and gathering statistics on a packet network. This monitor operates in real time, using an analyzer which is an interpretive pseudo-machine driving object-oriented data collection programs. The pseudo-program for the interpreter is “compiled” from configuration commands written in a monitoring control language.
