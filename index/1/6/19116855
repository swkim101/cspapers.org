Existing prediction methods mainly exploit the historical exercising records of students, where each exercise is usually represented as the manually labeled knowledge concepts, and the richer information contained in the text description of exercises is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel Exercise-Enhanced Recurrent Neural Network (EERNN) framework for student performance prediction by taking full advantage of both student exercising records and the text of each exercise. Specifically, for modeling the student exercising process, we first design a bidirectional LSTM to learn each exercise representation from its text description without any expertise and information loss. Then, we propose a new LSTM architecture to trace student states (i.e., knowledge states) in their sequential exercising process with the combination of exercise representations. For making final predictions, we design two strategies under EERNN, i.e., EERNNM with Markov property and EERNNA with Attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of EERNN framework. Moreover, by incorporating the exercise correlations, EERNN can well deal with the cold start problems from both student and exercise perspectives.
