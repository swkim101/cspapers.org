Let <?Pub Fmt italic>G<?Pub Fmt /italic> be a group of matriceswith integer entries, given by a list of generators. It is known thatmembership in such a group is undecidable, even for 4 x 4 integralmatrices [Mi].
In this paper we show that one can decide whether or not<?Pub Fmt italic>G<?Pub Fmt /italic> is<?Pub Fmt italic>finite<?Pub Fmt /italic>, in Las Vegas polynomialtime.
The key estimate derived makes the entire “black boxgroup” theory ([BSz], [BCFLS], [Ba2], [BKL]) applicable to thefinite groups of integral matrices. In particular it follows that inthis case, structural properties such as<?Pub Fmt italic>solvability<?Pub Fmt /italic> and<?Pub Fmt italic>nilpotence<?Pub Fmt /italic> are decidable in MonteCarlo polynomial time; and <?Pub Fmt italic>membership, order,isomorphism,<?Pub Fmt /italic> and a host of other problems are in therelatively low complexity class AM<inline-equation><f>∩</f><?Pub Caret></inline-equation>coAM [Ba1].
We give two algorithms. The simpler one (Monte Carlo but not LasVegas) employs a refinement of the <?Pub Fmt italic>randomwalk<?Pub Fmt /italic> technique over groups, developed in [Ba3](applied here to infinite groups). The termination rule rests on a newestimate on the bit-size of the elements of finite groups<?Pub Fmt italic>G<?Pub Fmt /italic>, obtained via polynomial timesymbolic manipulation of <?Pub Fmt italic>representations over algebraicnumber fields<?Pub Fmt /italic> using results of [BR]. This symbolicmanipulation technique is the basis of the Las Vegas algorithm. (A LasVegas algorithm is a rnadomized algorithm which never errs; but withsmall probability, it may r eport failure.)
