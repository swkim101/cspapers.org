Bugs in complex distributed systems are often hard to find. Many bugs reflect discrepancies between a system's behavior and the programmer's assumptions about that behavior. Differences may be in correctness, in performance characteristics, or both. Our debugging framework, Pip, compares actual behavior with expected behavior and visualizes both. Pip consists of two tools to help reconcile assumptions and actual behavior: an automatic expectations checker and an interactive behavior-explorer GUI.
