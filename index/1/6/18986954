Analyzing groups of people having a conversation enable to provide context-aware services, such as life log, group-wares, and the virtualization of social networks. We propose a novel method for extract chatting groups by leveraging Bluetooth RSSI and voice data acquired from smart phones. Neighboring people are detected from Bluetooth RSSI, and conversation groups are extract by talking states. The purpose of this paper is to define algorithm that works on efficiently on smart phones that are general and widespread mobile devices.
