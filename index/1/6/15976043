This paper presents three methods that can be used to recognize paraphrases. They all employ string similarity measures applied to shallow abstractions of the input sentences, and a Maximum Entropy classifier to learn how to combine the resulting features. Two of the methods also exploit WordNet to detect synonyms and one of them also exploits a dependency parser. We experiment on two datasets, the MSR paraphrasing corpus and a dataset that we automatically created from the MTC corpus. Our system achieves state of the art or better results.
