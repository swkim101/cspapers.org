In this paper we propose a novel, passive approach for detecting and tracking malicious flux service networks. Our detection system is based on passive analysis of recursive DNS (RDNS) traffic traces collected from multiple large networks. Contrary to previous work, our approach is not limited to the analysis of suspicious domain names extracted from spam emails or precompiled domain blacklists. Instead, our approach is able to detect malicious flux service networks in-the-wild, i.e., as they are accessed by users who fall victims of malicious content advertised through blog spam, instant messaging spam, social website spam, etc., beside email spam. We experiment with the RDNS traffic passively collected at two large ISP networks. Overall, our sensors monitored more than 2.5 billion DNS queries per day from millions of distinct source IPs for a period of 45 days. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to accurately detect malicious flux service networks. Furthermore, we show how our passive detection and tracking of malicious flux service networks may benefit spam filtering applications.
