This demo presents a framework for running probabilistic graph queries on uncertain graphs and visualizing their results. The framework supports the most common uncertainty model for uncertain graphs, i.e. existential uncertainty for the edges of the graph. A large variety of meaningful graph queries are supported, such as shortest path, range, kN, reverse kN, reachability and various aggregation queries. Since the problem of exact probability computation according to possible world semantics is in #P-Time for many combinations of model and query, and since ignoring uncertainty (e.g. by using expectations only) will yield counterintuitive and hard to interpret results, our framework uses an optimized version of Monte-Carlo sampling to estimate the results which allows us not only to perform queries that conform to possible world semantics but also to sample only parts of a graph relevant for a given query. The main strength of this framework is the visualization combined with statistic hypothesis tests, which gives the user not only the estimated result of a query, but also an indication of how significant and reliable these results are. The aim of this demonstration is to give an intuition that a sampling based approach to probabilistic graphs is viable, and that the estimated results quickly converge even for very large graphs.
