Moore's Law and the wave of technologies it enabled have led to tremendous improvements in productivity and the quality of life in industrialized nations. Yet, technology has had almost no effect on the other five billion people on our planet. In this talk I argue that decreasing costs of computing and wireless networking make this the right time to spread the benefits of technology, and that the biggest missing piece is a lack of focus on the problems that matter. After covering some example applications that have shown very high impact, I present some our own preliminary results, including the use of novel low-cost telemedicine to improve the vision of real people, with over 20,000 patients examined so far. I conclude with some discussion on the role of database researchers in this new area.
