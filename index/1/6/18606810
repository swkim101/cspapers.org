Recently, high resolution visual methods based on direct-phase measurement of periodic patterns has been proposed with successful applications to microrobotics. This paper proposes a new implementation of direct-phase measurement methods to achieve 3-DoF (degrees of freedom) visual servoing. The proposed algorithm relies on a single frequency tracking rather than a complete 2D discrete Fourier transform that was required in previous works. The method does not require any calibration step and has many advantages such as high subpixelic resolution, high robustness and short computation time. Several experimental validations (in favorable and unfavorable conditions of use) were performed using a XYÎ¸ microrobotic platform. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the frequency-based controller, this in term of accuracy (micrometric error), convergence rate (30 iterations in nominal conditions) and robustness.
