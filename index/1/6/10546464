The increasing amount of data that needs to be collected and analyzed requires large-scale datacenter architectures that are naturally more susceptible to faults of single components. One way to offer consistent services on such unreliable systems are replicated state machines (RSMs). Yet, traditional RSM protocols cannot deliver the needed latency and request rates for future large-scale systems. In this paper, we propose a new set of protocols based on Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) primitives. To asses these mechanisms, we use a strongly consistent key-value store; the evaluation shows that our simple protocols improve RSM performance by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we show that RDMA introduces various new options, such as log access management. Our protocols enable operators to fully utilize the new capabilities of the quickly growing number of RDMA-capable datacenter networks.
