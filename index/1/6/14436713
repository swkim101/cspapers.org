In this paper we present a completemethodology for the design and validation of asynchronous circuits starting from a formal specificationmodel that roughly correspondsto a timing diagram. The methodology is presented in such a way that it is easy to embed in the current methodology for synchronous circuits. The different steps of the synthesis process will just be briefly touched upon. The main part of the paper concentrates on the simulation and validation of asynchronous circuits. It discusses where the designer needs validation and how it can be done. It also explains how this process can be automated and embedded in the complete methodology.
