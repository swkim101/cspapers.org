During an exploratory study in the design of a stored program processor for an electronic switching system, the need for logic simulation for design verification was evident [1]. The advantages of using logic simulation concurrent with hardware design are many.
 This paper will discuss logic simulation and fault analysis work undertaken while designing a self-checking switching processor. The logic simulation and fault analysis were implemented on an IBM/360 model 67 executing a simulator called LAMP (Logic Analyzer for Maintenance Planning) [3]. Section 2 briefly describes the simulator system and the logic simulated. Circuit preparation for simulation and a hierarchical method for simulating large circuits are discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, characteristics and design objectives of self-checking circuits are discussed. Concurrent fault detection methods and self-checkability figures of merit are then considered.
