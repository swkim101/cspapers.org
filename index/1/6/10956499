In this paper, the regulation problem of rigid-link electrically-driven (RLED) robotic manipulators with uncertain kinematics and dynamics is addressed. A task-space Saturated-Proportional Integral and Differential (SP-ID) based control approach is proposed using backstepping technique to deal with the uncertainties in actuator dynamics, robot dynamics and kinematics. The proposed method is structurally simple and easy for implementation. Sufficient conditions for choosing the feedback gains, approximate Jacobian matrix and motor torque constant matrix are provided to guarantee system stability. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
