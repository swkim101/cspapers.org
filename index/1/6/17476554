Studies on supporting user task with a wearable projector are attracting attention in recent years. However, previous work did not consider the utilization in moving state because an image swing is caused by a body sway. Such instability of projected images does not only affect the viewability, but also makes it difficult to present spatial information. In this paper, we propose a projection stabilization method for wearable projector applications.
