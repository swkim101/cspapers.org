We sugg=t a practical and economical way to generate random bits using a computer disk drive * a source of randomn-. It requirw no additiond hardware (given a system with a disk), and no user involvement. As a concrete example of performance, on a Sun Wtra-1 with a Seagate Cheetah disk, it generatw bits at a rate of either 5 bits per minute or 577 bits per minute depending on the physical phenomena that we use = a source of randomness. The generated bits are random by a theoretical argument, and *O pass a severe battery of statiaticrd twts.
