This paper presents EMACs, a medium access protocol especially designed for wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks differ greatly from traditional ad hoc wireless networks and therefore require the usage of new types of network protocols, which are energy-efÔ¨Åcient to ensure a node lifetime of several years on a single battery and which can operate without assistance of central managers in a dynamic network topology.
