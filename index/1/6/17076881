We present a batch reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that provides probabilistic guarantees about the quality of each policy that it proposes, and which has no hyper-parameters that require expert tuning. The user may select any performance lower-bound, ρ-, and confidence level, δ, and our algorithm will ensure that the probability that it returns a policy with performance below ρ- is at most δ. We then propose an incremental algorithm that executes our policy improvement algorithm repeatedly to generate multiple policy improvements. We show the viability of our approach with a simple gridworld and the standard mountain car problem, as well as with a digital marketing application that uses real world data.
