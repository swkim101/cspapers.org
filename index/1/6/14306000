To address the high data bus bandwidth requirements, the principle of locality of reference is exploited in the vast majority of video processing algorithms. Especially, for application’s kernels based on motion estimation, it is inevitable to fetch the pixel data from a local storage. However, the video application kernel requirements can vary significantly. The technique of data re-organization and folding (extensively used in software to map operations of same type to a single resource in a time-multiplexed fashion) are presented in the context of the design of customized streaming video scratchpad memories. These techniques transform one scratchpad organization into the another in order to best satisfy the kernel’s requirements and physical design constraints. Three instances of streaming scratchpads suiting different kernel types are designed. Based on the RTL and netlist level simulations, their differences in performance, power dissipation and silicon area are stated.
