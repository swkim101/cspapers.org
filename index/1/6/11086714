Our demo tracks physical browsing by users in indoor spaces. Analogous to online browsing, where users choose to go to certain webpages, dwell on a subset of pages of interest to them, and click on links of interest while ignoring others, we can draw parallels in the physical setting, where a user might walk purposefully to a section of interest, dwell there for a while, and gaze at specific items that they wish to know more about.
