This paper introduces conceptual framework of an ontology for describing linguistic services on network-based language infrastructures. The ontology defines a taxonomy of processing resources and the associated static language resources. It also develops a sub-ontology for abstract linguistic objects such as expression, meaning, and description; these help define functionalities of a linguistic service. The proposed ontology is expected to serve as a solid basis for the interoperability of technical elements in language infrastructures.
