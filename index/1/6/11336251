The rapid development of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the increasing complexity of the deployed applications force researchers to turn to testbeds to test their communication and application related algorithms and protocols. On the other side, industries' demand for young professionals with WSN expertise is growing too. These two factors motivated us to develop a highly modular and extensible testbed, called Atelier, as part of our bachelor level course on WSNs. In this paper we share our testbed design and describe its main requirements and challenges.
