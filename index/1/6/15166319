We investigate the use of received RF-signals for activity recognition in scenarios with multiple receive nodes and multiple simultaneously active individuals. Our system features a short 0.5 second window over which features are calculated and we report on experiences in the choice of the neighbourhood size of the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) classifier utilised. In a case study with software defined radio nodes utilised in an active, device-free activity recognition (DFAR) system, we observe a good recognition accuracy for the recognition of multiple simultaneously conducted activities with two and more receive devices. This is the first study to distinguish this particular set of activities from users conducting them simultaneously. For a single individual, we repeat the experiment and report the recognition accuracy in scenarios where the recognition area per receive node is larger than 8sqm
