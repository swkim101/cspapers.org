This paper proposes FBRL, a language for representing function and behavior with the primitives we identified and discusses its application to explanation generation. FBRL explicitly represents model of each component in a system in terms of two elements. One is a necessary and sufficient information for simulation of the component which we call behavior. The other is the interpretation of the behavior under a desirable state which the component is expected to achieve, which we call function. By identifying primitives necessary for the interpretation of the behavior in various domains, we can capture what function is and represent it by selection and combination of them. We also investigate the relation between function and behavior based on the primitives of FBRL. As FBRL can represent concepts at various levels of abstraction, it contributes to explanation generation by providing information for mapping behavior of a component to a term which represents its function.
