This paper presents the use of Java applets acting as a web-based interface to existing, platform dependent software tools. We present an example application called GAWebTutor which was constructed from a comprehensive genetic algorithm package and web-based Java components. In effect, we packaged an interactive genetic algorithms tutorial and made it available to anyone on the WWW. Furthermore, by building a GUI front end to an existing application in Java, we leveraged browser technology to overcome platform compatibility problems. A blending of Java and platform dependent code can successfully create user friendly, portable, more versatile applications that take full advantage of all available software components. Using our approach, educators can make their educational programs or other software tools available to anyone through the WWW.
