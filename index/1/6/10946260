In this paper, a novel decentralized swarm aggregation algorithm for multi-robot systems with an integrated obstacle avoidance is proposed. In this framework, the interaction among robots is limited to their visibility neighborhood, i.e., robots that are within the visibility range of each other. Furthermore, to better comply with the hardware/software limitations of mobile robotic platforms, robots actuators are assumed to be saturated. A theoretical characterization of the main properties of the proposed swarm aggregation algorithm is provided. Simulations have been carried out to validate the theoretical results and experiments have been performed with a team of low-cost mobile robots to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real scenario.
