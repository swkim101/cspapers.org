This paper presents a new rule-based hybrid-system approach to contact monitoring. The rules are formulated in terms of temporal sequences of the contact force and they recognize temporal patterns of force associated with contact states and transitions. The rule-base is built using inductive learning techniques on force data obtained by human demonstration. This approach is suitable for monitoring robotic as well as human tasks. An advantage of this approach is that it allows process monitors for diierent tasks to be built quickly and easily by learning new sets of rules from a demonstration of the tasks. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the eeectiveness of this approach.
