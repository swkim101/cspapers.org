This paper describes SOLO, a program for mapping arbitrary MOS circuit schematics into efficient corresponding layouts. SOLO employs a layout strategy which allows it to be applied to circuits with sized transistors as well as to circuits which include unequal numbers of n-MOS and p-MOS transistors. The program can effectively be applied to module-size circuits including up to roughly 200 transistors.
