Wireless sensor networks are revolutionizing the instrumentation of the physical world, across scientific, industrial and military applications. In this paper, we describe our efforts developing and classroom-testing hands-on materials for use in undergraduate-accessible courses on sensor networks. In Winter 2008 at Portland State University, we introduced an in-class laboratory component to a sensor networks course that had previously been entirely lecture-based. For the laboratory exercises, we utilized Sun's Java-programmable Sun SPOT [7] sensor network technology. We found the Sun SPOT based laboratory activities to be quite powerful as a teaching and excitement-fostering tool.
