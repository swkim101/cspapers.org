The number of papers on database system education has been close to zero at recent conferences. As database systems are a fundamental part of computer science curricula this comes as a surprise. The apparent draught in new ideas in database system education is even more surprising given the fact that this area of computer science has arguably undergone its most significant changes for more than 30 years within the last 5 years. Many new database system paradigms (most of them appearing under the NoSQL label) have been introduced for various reasons. Some of these massively distributed database systems facilitate unprecedented data processing capabilities often labeled as BigData. In order to offer a sustainable and practical CS education, at least some of those new paradigms and methodologies should probably be included into database education. This BoF can be a starting point for a discussion about which of those deserve inclusion into a typical CS curriculum and (even more interestingly) at what time in the curriculum and by replacing what other topics. Depending on interest of the audience a decision could be made as to what is the correct technology support for continuing the discussion beyond the conference. The BoF will also offer participants a forum to share their opinions, ideas and experiences on recent and future changes in database system education in general.
