The work presents the development and evaluation of a novel foot sole for humanoid robots. For humanoid locomotion the foot sole is important for absorbing impacts. In contrast to the simple planar rubber pad foot sole that is conventionally used in humanoid robots this paper introduces a new foot sole design in which the dissipation of energy during collision is done effectively using a viscous air damping sole mechanism that provides better reduction of the ground impact forces. The paper describes the principle of the foot sole and provides details of its design and implementation. Experimental trials were performed with the child size humanoid robot, COMAN, wearing the proposed feet to validate their performance during landing and walking. The results demonstrate that the proposed new passive damping mechanism can reduce effectively the ground reaction impact forces and oscillations while maintaining the foot/body posture.
