Making a step further,we prove that if both the agents’ preferences and thecollective ranking of the decisions satisfy Dubois andPrade’s axioms (1995), and particularly risk aversion,and Pareto Unanimity, then the egalitarian collectiveaggregation is compulsory. This result can be seen asan ordinal counterpart of Harsanyi’s theorem (1955).
