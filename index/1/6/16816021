Precise and reliable estimation of orientation plays crucial role for any mobile robot operating in unknown environment. The most common solution to determination of the three orientation angles: pitch, roll, and yaw, relies on the Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) that exploits inertial data fusion (accelerations and angular rates) with magnetic measurements. However, in real world applications strong vibration and disturbances in magnetic field usually cause this approach to provide poor results. Therefore, we have devised a new approach to orientation estimation using inertial sensors only. It is based on modified complementary filtering and was proved by precise laboratory testing using rotational tilt platform as well as by robot field-testing. In the final, the algorithm well outperformed the commercial AHRS solution based on magnetometer aiding.
