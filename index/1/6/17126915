A campus grid is a critical component of research cyberinfrastructure. A grid facilitates resource sharing, improving collaboration and increasing the capability to address large scale scientific and engineering problems. Resources comprising a grid include research clusters, centrally managed clusters, opportunistic use of desktop computers, campus clouds, and commercial clouds.
 Advances in virtual machine technology and hypervisor availability has made the use of virtual machines an attractive tool for building campus grids. Pools of Virtual Boxes (POVB) is an open-source, dedicated virtual machine environment for rapidly deploying a campus grid. POVB is targeted at institutions where financial and administrative constraints prevent large scale changes in computational infrastructure.
 The POVB distribution includes: services that manage the virtual machine hypervisor, services that communicate select host information with the Linux guest for debugging and resource utilization policies, a bootstrapping framework for building virtual images, and a third-party package deployment framework that integrates with Condor to advertise available software services. We report on the design and implementation of POVB and examine a deployment of several hundred POVB instances, which has been operational for over a year.
