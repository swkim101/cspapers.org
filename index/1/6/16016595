User Interface Management Systems have provided support for most user interface design personnel with the exception of dialogue evaluators. Potential support that a UIMS can provide to evaluators of user interfaces generated by the UIMS are discussed. Metrics for measuring interactive behavior have been implemented as part of a User Interface Management System. It is shown how the external control and separate dialogue description features of UIMSs make possible such measurements. These metrics are automatically mapped back to the responsible portions of the dialogue description. Reports are generated which aid interface evaluators in locating specific problems in a user interface design.
