Applications increasingly use personality traits to provide a personalized service to the user. To acquire personality, social media trails showed to be a reliable source. However, until now, analysis of social media trails have been focusing on \textit{what} has been disclosed: content of disclosed items. These methods fail to acquire personality when there is a lack of content (non-disclosure). In this study we do not look at the disclosed content, but whether disclosure occurred or not. We extracted 40 items of different Facebook profile sections that users can disclose or not disclose. We asked participants to indicate to which extent they disclose the items in an online survey, and additionally asked them to fill in a personality questionnaire. Among 100 participants we found that users' personality can be predicted by solely looking at whether they disclose particular sections of their profiles. This allows for personality acquisition when content is missing.
