We propose to demonstrate LiquidXML, a platform for managing large corpora of XML documents in large-scale P2P networks. All LiquidXML peers may publish XML documents to be shared with all the network peers. The challenge then is to efficiently (re-)distribute the published content in the network, possibly in overlapping, redundant fragments, to support efficient processing of queries at each peer. The novelty of LiquidXML relies in its adaptive method of choosing which data fragments are stored where, to improve performance. The "liquid" aspect of XML management is twofold: XML data flows from many sources towards many consumers, and its distribution in the network continuously adapts to improve query performance.
