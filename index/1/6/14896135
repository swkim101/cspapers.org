With e-business becoming mainstream, inferring intentions of users by observing their interactions over the web, becomes an important problem. Current methods of customer tracking using simple and heuristic data categorization methods, are insu√Ücient to model the complex time-varying behavior of users. In this paper, we continuously infer and track the browsing behavioral states of users through the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Speci(cid:12)cally, we model the behavioral states a user transitions while browsing, to be the hidden states of a Hidden Markov Model. We develop a systematic way to design and estimate the parameters of the behavioral HMMs using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning with data obtained from user studies. The design of behavioral HMMs is illustrated in the context of video browsing.
