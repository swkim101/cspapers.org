We propose a new Web page transformation method for browsing on mobile devices with small displays. In our approach, an original web page that does not fit into the screen is transformed into a set of pages, each of which fits into the screen. This transformation is done through slicing the original page. The resulting set of transformed pages form a multi-level tree structure, called a slicing*-tree, in which an internal node consists of a thumbnail image with hyperlinks and a leaf node is a block from the original web page. Our slicing*-tree based Web page transformation eases Web browsing on small displays by providing screen-fitting visual context and reducing page scrolling effort.
