An elaborately designed software architecture is put forward based on fuzzy sets theory (FST), which is specialized in multiple sensor fusion and mechanism failure diagnosis. Besides, when confronted with multiple fault signals, fusion parameters can be dynamically adapted based on principles of fuzzy soft clustering so as to promote immune ability in artificially mechanical systems. The key point in this new approach lies in its power on faults detection, which requires no prior information on the state vectors of the sensors and system behavior, and no supplemental machine learning operation is required. The proposed algorithm combines principles of artificial immune system and the classical technique in fuzzy theory, which will consist of two main portions. In the first part a traditional data fuse structure is constructed, the sensor signals will be fed into it to implement the fuzzy aggregating algorithm.
