Data mining is computationally expensive. Since the benefits of data mining results are unpredictable, organizations may not be willing to buy new hardware for that purpose. We will present a system that enables data mining applications to run in parallel on networks of workstations in a fault-tolerant manner. We will describe our parallelization of a combinatorial pattern discovery algorithm and a classification tree algorithm. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with two real applications: discovering active motifs in protein sequences and predicting foreign exchange rate movement.
