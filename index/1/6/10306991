Street names say a lot about a country's or region's identity. So far, they have mostly been analyzed manually and for very limited regions (e.g., a city), and hardly any large-scale studies have been performed automatically. A phenomenon not yet studied are street names with date references. These are of special interest as they can be used to commemorate important events in a region's history. In this paper, we present our approach to automatically extract such street names across the world. We analyze the dates' temporal and geographic distribution, and automatically gather potential explanations why specific dates occur in particular regions. We further describe date-Rome, a tool to interactively explore the streets, their distribution, and possible explanations.
