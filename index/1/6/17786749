How similar are two corpora? A measure of corpus similarity would be very useful for NLP for many purposes, such as estimating the work involved in porting a system from one domain to another. First, we discuss difculties in identifying what we mean by ‘corpus similarity’: human similarity judgements are not negrained enough, corpus similarity is inherently multidimensional, and similarity can only be interpreted in the light of corpus homogeneity. We then present an operational denition of corpus similarity which addresses or circumvents the problems, using purposebuilt sets of iknown-similarity corporai. These KSC sets can be used to evaluate the measures. We evaluate the measures described in the literature, including three variants of the information theoretic measure ‘perplexity’. A -based measure, using word frequencies, is shown to be the best of those tested.
