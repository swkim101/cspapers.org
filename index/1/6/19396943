Even many works have been proposed for automatic plant identification, there exists very few plant identification applications on the market. To the best of our knowledge, Leafsnap [1] is the first automatic plant identification application. However, this application is dedicated to iOS users and is working with tree species of the Northeastern United States. Today, a huge number of Android users make an interesting market for developing plant identification for Android. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we propose a leaf based plant identification method using SURF features in combination with Bag of Words and supervised learning. This method obtains better results in comparison with other existed methods in the same database. Secondly, we develop a leaf based plant identification system for Android.
