In his groundbreaking 2002 bestseller The Rise of the Creative Class, economist Richard Florida identified the 3 Ts of economic development: Technology, Talent, and Tolerance. Now, with The Flight of the Creative Class, Florida is back - and he's gone global. How does the movement of talented people across borders affect regional growth? What do tighter immigration, faltering education systems, and strong international competition mean for U.S. growth? Who are the up-and-comers in the global creative economy? Florida takes on these questions and more as he charts a course for creativity in the 21st century - and explains what the impact will be for countries, cities, and companies the world over.
