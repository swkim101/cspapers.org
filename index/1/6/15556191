Topology control can reduce power consumption and channel contention in wireless sensor networks by adjusting the transmission power. However, topology control for wireless sensor networks faces significant challenges, especially in indoor environments where wireless characteristics are extremely complex and dynamic. We first provide insights on the design of robust topology control schemes based on an empirical study in an office building. For example, our analysis shows that Received Signal Strength Indicator and Link Quality Indicator are not always robust indicators of Packet Reception Rate in indoor environments due to significant multi-path effects. We then present Adaptive and Robust Topology control (ART), a novel and practical topology control algorithm with several salient features: (1) ART is robust in indoor environments as it does not rely on simplifying assumptions about the wireless properties; (2) ART can adapt to variations in both link quality and contention; (3) ART introduces zero communication overhead for applications which already use acknowledgements. We have implemented ART as a topology layer in TinyOS 2.x. Our topology layer only adds 12 bytes of RAM per neighbor and 1.5 kilobytes of ROM, and requires minimal changes to upper-layer routing protocols. The advantages of ART have been demonstrated through empirical results on a 28-node indoor testbed.
