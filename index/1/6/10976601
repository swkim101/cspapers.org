The workspace and performance of a humanoid robot is decisively influenced by the design of its torso. The joints or spinal discs are usually the weak points due to the high stress they are exposed to, e. g. when lifting heavy objects. One way to circumvent the necessity of large motors is to use parallel mechanisms to optimize the distribution of loads. Here, we analyze the workspace of the humanoid robot Rollin' Justin of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) w. r. t. the constraints imposed by kinematic coupling of torso joints via tendons. The results of the analysis can be used for planning and reactive control to efficiently exploit the torso performance capabilities of the robotic system. As an application, we design a potential field based controller to avoid violating these constraints and implement it on the real robot.
