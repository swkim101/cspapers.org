This paper presents a model for safe driving at blind intersections and its integration to a local planner based on a Frenet frame. The model predicts potential moving obstacles from blind intersections to proactively slow down to avoid potential collisions. The derivation of the model is described and its parameters are detailed. The local planner computes smooth trajectories with smooth velocity profiles so that the vehicle can follow the paths without jerk and sudden accelerations resulting in safe and comfortable navigation. Experimental results in simulation and in the real field with an autonomous car, show that the proposed predictive driving framework can reproduce human expert driver's trajectories and velocities when facing blind intersections.
