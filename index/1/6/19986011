We give an integer programming formulation of the paging problem with varying sizes and fetching costs. We use this formulation to provide an alternative proof that a variant of the algorithm greedy-dual-size previously considered in [l, 63 is &-competitive against the optimal strategy with cache size h < k. Our proof provides further insights to greedy-dual-size. The linear programming relaxation is also applicable for obtaining an approximate solution to the NP-complete “of3ine” problem.
