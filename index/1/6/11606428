A simple concurrency control mechan- ism for B+-trees Databases is intro- duced. It is based on early split- ting and catenating of nodes during a process, which are candidates for such operations later on in that process. These early operations enable to lock only the current node in the process and its father node, and hence to increase the degree of concurrency relatively to other known mechanisms.
