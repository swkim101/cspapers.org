A randomized (Las Vegas) algorithm is given for finding the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition of a graph; this immediately yields the cardinality of a maximum matching. Let n denote the number of vertices, and let M(n) denote the number of arithmetic operations for multiplying two nxn matrices. The expected sequential running time (i.e., number of bit operations) is within a poly-logarithmic factor of M(n). The parallel complexity is O((logn)2) expected parallel time using a number of processors within a poly-logarithmic factor of M(n). The same complexity bounds suffice for finding the edges that do not occur in any maximum matching. The new complexity bounds are significantly better than the best previous ones, e.g., using the best value of M(n) currently known, the new expected sequential running time is O(n2.38) versus the previous best O(n2.5/(10gn)) or more.
