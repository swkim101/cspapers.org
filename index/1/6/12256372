Traditional natural language generation systems are based on a pipelined architecture. A conceptual component selects items from a knowledge base and orders them into a message to address some discourse goal. This message is passed to the stylistic component that makes lexical and syntactic choices to produce a natural language surface text. By contrast, humans producing formal text typically create drafts which they polish through revision [Hayes and Flower 1980]. One proposal for improving the quality of computer-generated multisentential text is to incorporate a draft-and-revision paradigm.
