We present a novel Joint Online Tracking and Segmentation (JOTS) algorithm which integrates the multi-part tracking and segmentation into a unified energy optimization framework to handle the video segmentation task. The multi-part segmentation is posed as a pixel-level label assignment task with regularization according to the estimated part models, and tracking is formulated as estimating the part models based on the pixel labels, which in turn is used to refine the model. The multi-part tracking and segmentation are carried out iteratively to minimize the proposed objective function by a RANSAC-style approach. Extensive experiments on the SegTrack and SegTrack v2 databases demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.
