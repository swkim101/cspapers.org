Collaborative filtering with implicit feedbacks has been steadily receiving more attention, since the abundant implicit feedbacks are more easily collected while explicit feedbacks are not necessarily always available. Several recent work address this problem well utilizing pairwise ranking method with a fundamental assumption that a user prefers items with positive feedbacks to the items without observed feedbacks, which also implies that the items without observed feedbacks are treated equally without distinction. However, users have their own preference on different items with different degrees which can be modeled into a ranking relationship. In this paper, we exploit this prior information of a user's preference from the nearest neighbor set by the neighbors' implicit feedbacks, which can split items into different item groups with specific ranking relations. We propose a novel PRIGP(Personalized Ranking with Item Group based Pairwise preference learning) algorithm to integrate item based pairwise preference and item group based pairwise preference into the same framework. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the competitive baselines on several ranking-oriented evaluation metrics.
