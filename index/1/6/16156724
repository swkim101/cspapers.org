Exception directed acyclic graphs (EDAGs) are knowledge structures that subsume trees and rules but can be substantially more compact. Manually constructed and induced EDAGs are compared by reconstructing Shapiro's "structured induction" of a chess end game. It is shown that the induced EDAG is very similar to that produced through consultation with experts, and that both are small, comprehensible solutions to a problem that is complex for people.
