KVM/370 (Kernelized Virtual Machine Sys-tem 370) is based on IBM's Virtual Machine operating system, VM/370. KVM/370 is a general purpose operating system that enforces. DoD military security policy using kernel technology. Funded as a small research project in 1976, the system has undergone continuous development since 1978 when implementation was begun by System Development Corporation. This paper describes KVM/370's architecture, security controls and performance. Based on insights gained during the retrofit, recommendations are made as to how a more efficient system might be designed.
