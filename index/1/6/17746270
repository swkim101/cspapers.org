The term cellular computer can be associated with a number of computational engines that range from chip-level architectures to massively parallel systems of the size of Connection Machine, and whose common characteristics include the relative large number of simple processing units with limited local memory, as well as, the simple (mostly synchronous/broadcasting) communication protocols. From a different point of view, these systems can be viewed as extensions of the simple cellular automaton model of computation. The extensions include properties, such as, non-homogeneity of the cells/processors, non-local addressed communications, etc. [Hillis85].
