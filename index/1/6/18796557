Automatically solving algebra word problems has raised considerable interest recently. Existing state-of-the-art approaches mainly rely on learning from human annotated equations. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to efﬁciently mine algebra problems and their numerical solutions with little to no manual effort. To leverage the mined dataset, we propose a novel structured-output learning al-gorithm that aims to learn from both explicit (e.g., equations) and implicit (e.g., solutions) supervision signals jointly . Enabled by this new algorithm, our model gains 4.6% absolute improvement in accuracy on the A LG - 514 benchmark compared to the one without using implicit supervision. The ﬁnal model also outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach by 3%.
