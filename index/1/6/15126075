Non-holonomic omnidirectional mobile robots have higher load carrying capacity than their holonomic counterparts. Once the steer joint configuration is initialized, they can perform arbitrarily complex three-dimensional trajectories in the plane of motion and, as such, are more suitable for industrial contexts. However, their kinematic model presents representational and structural singularities, solutions to which must respect actuator performance limits. Recent research efforts have provided either simple restricting of the velocity space (among which few considered hardware limits) or complex non-restricting (no hardware limits considered) solutions. Most of these efforts are providing solutions at the kinematic control level. Instead, here we propose both a representational singularity free kinematic model, and a simple numeric treatment for the kinematic singularity. We further provide a method to tune the latter, to respect the actuator acceleration limits. Thanks to its steer rate damping behavior, the method can be further extended, to respect joint limits. Another benefit is the treatment of the singularity at the level of the kinematic model, which enhances real time capabilities. The developed method has been tested successfully on the Neobotix-MPO700 mobile robot and shown superior results as compared to the embedded controller.
