There is a lack of method to communicate wirelessly without underlying networking infrastructure. We adopt the concept of camera-LCD communication and proposed this VisualComm system, a channel to communicate wirelessly through transmission and reception of a QR-code stream. VisualComm implements a series of techniques to overcome big challenges of frame missing, perspective distortion and viewing angle issue. In this demo, we show our VisualComm system can achieve real-time wireless file transfer with a reasonable bandwidth (of hundreds of Kbps) and good robustness.
