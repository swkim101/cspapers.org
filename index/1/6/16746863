Browsing a collection can start with a keyword search. A user visits a library, performs a keyword search to find a few books of interest; finding their location in the library. Then they go to these locations; the corresponding bookshelves, where they do not just retrieve the found books, but rather they start browsing the nearby books; the books which have a similar Dewey classification. This paper extends this approach to curated corpora that contain items or documents that have been classified in multiple dimensions (facets), where each dimension classification may be a hierarchy. In particular (i) a technique for determining near items based on OLAP datacube cells and (ii) user interfaces that support browsing of near items are presented.
