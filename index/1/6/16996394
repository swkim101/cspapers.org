Deep convolutional networks have achieved successful performance in data mining field. However, training large networks still remains a challenge, as the training data may be insufficient and the model can easily get overfitted. Hence the training process is usually combined with a model regularization. Typical regularizers include weight decay, Dropout, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel regularizer, named Structured Decorrelation Constraint (SDC), which is applied to the activations of the hidden layers to prevent overfitting and achieve better generalization. SDC impels the network to learn structured representations by grouping the hidden units and encouraging the units within the same group to have strong connections during the training procedure. Meanwhile, it forces the units in different groups to learn non-redundant representations by minimizing the cross-covariance between them. Compared with Dropout, SDC reduces the co-adaptions between the hidden units in an explicit way. Besides, we propose a novel approach called Reg-Conv that can help SDC to regularize the complex convolutional layers. Experiments on extensive datasets show that SDC significantly reduces overfitting and yields very meaningful improvements on classification performance (on CIFAR-10 6.22% accuracy promotion and on CIFAR-100 9.63% promotion).
