This paper proposes a method by which 5W1H (who, when, where, what, why, how, and predicate) information is used to classify and navigate Japanese-language texts. 5W1H information, extracted from text data, has an access platform with three functions: episodic retrieval, multi-dimensional classification, and overall classification. In a six-month trial, the platform was used by 50 people to access 6400 newspaper articles. The three functions proved to be effective for office documentation work and the precision of extraction was approximately 82%.
