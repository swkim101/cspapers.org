The number of high quality online videos is increasing rapidly. Online courses as well as universities do not fully leverage the content due to several open challenges in video search, indexing, summarization and customization requirements for specific courses, instructors or learners. We present a new web-based social learning platform called Videoken. Using novel video summarization algorithms, Videoken automatically creates Table of Contents for videos. This allows a textbook-like facility for non-linear search and navigation through the video, enables extraction of semantically coherent clips from within a video and improves video search through better semantic indexing. The platform also allows new ways of course creation and sharing of learning modules; and can be both integrated with existing Learning Management Systems and used independently.
