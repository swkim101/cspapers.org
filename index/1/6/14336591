The subject of multistage interconnection networks (MINs) has been extensively studied in the lazt ten years and has gained even more attention recently with increased interest in large-scale shared memory multiprocessors. Several multiprocessors are under construction using packet-switched multistage networks [4,5,11]. While some theoretical results have been obtained about the behavior of MINs [1,3,6,8,9,10], and their limitations along with possible corrections for practical systems have been discussed [12], many questions still remain unanswered. In particular, the performance of MINâ€™s supporting vector multiprocessors is an issue of growing importance as the number of such machines increases. In this paper we will present results showing the behavior of not only a MIN but of an entire shared memory system obtained through simulation. Our goal is to evaluate the performance and interaction between components of such a system, based on realistic hardware assumptions and driven by user programs. To achieve this we have developed a parallel register-transfer level simulator of interconnection networks and an interleaved shared memory. The simulator itself runs on a multiprocessor (Alliant FX/8). We study non-uniform, burst traffic as exhibjted by prefetch or vector units in each processor. Because the exact behavior of the hardware is simulated, we also obtain a time dependent descrip tion of system performance. In the first part of this paper we describe the sys-
