Rotary Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs) are largely adopted to safely and accurately modulate interaction torques when robots operate in close contact with humans. Torque control is often based on a cascade scheme including PI regulators for a velocity controller nested in a torque controller. This solution is simple, robust and can potentially guarantee coupled stability. A high-level impedance control loop is also commonly added to regulate the behavior of the interaction port as a desired virtual viscoelastic body. In the present work, passivity is analyzed when a cascade controlled SEA is employed to display a virtual parallel spring-damper system. The case of a null desired impedance and of a pure spring are also tackled. The range of renderable mechanical impedance and guidelines for the selection of the control gains are derived.
