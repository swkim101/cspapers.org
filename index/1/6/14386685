To accomplish a search task and satisfy a single information need, users usually submit a series of queries to web search engines. It is useful for web search engines to detect the task boundaries in a series of successive queries. Traditional task boundary detection methods are based on time gap and lexical comparisons, which often suffer from the vocabulary gap problem, that is, the topically related queries may not share any common words. In this paper we learn hidden topics from query log and leverage them to resolve the vocabulary gap problem. Unlike other external knowledge resources, such as WordNet and Wikipedia, the hidden topics discovered from query log cover long tail queries, which is useful to detect task boundaries. Experimental results on dataset from real world query log demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant quality enhancement.
