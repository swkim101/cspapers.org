Underactuated and synergy-driven hands are gaining attention in the grasping community mainly due to their simple kinematics, intrinsic compliance and versatility for grasping objects even in non structured scenarios. The evaluation of the grasping capabilities of such hands is a challenging task. This paper revisits some traditional quality measures developed for multi-fingered, fully actuated hands, and applies them to the case of underactuated hands. The extension of quality metrics for synergy-driven hands for the case of underactuated grasping is also presented. The performance of both types of measures is evaluated with simulated examples, concluding with a comparative discussion of their main features.
