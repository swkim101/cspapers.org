We present the design of the GFDL ocean circulation model as adapted for simulations of the Mediterranean basis for the Cedar multicluster architecture. The model simulates the basic aspects of large-scale, baroclinic ocean circulation, including treatment of irregular bottom topography. The data and computational mapping strategies and their effect on the design are discussed. The code was parametrized to offer several choices for data partitionings of the computational domain, for placement strategies for the data in the memory hierarchy, and for the number of clusters and processors used in the computational hierarchy of Cedar. The experiments and performance trends are discussed. Using four clusters and 32 processors the code demonstrates significant speedup compared to a single cluster and compared to a single processor.
