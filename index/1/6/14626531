In this paper, the use of structural behavior of communication protocols in designing new covert channels is investigated. In this way, a new covert transmitter is designed based on a modified CSMA protocol that enables the transmitter to embed a covert message in its overt traffic. The proposed scheme provides high covert rate without compromising the stealthiness of the channel.
