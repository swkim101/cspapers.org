Hunger is a major problem even in developed countries like Australia. We are working with a social startup, Foodbank Local, and local charities at distributing donated food more efficiently. This food must first be allocated to these charities and then delivered to the end customers. This fair division problem is interesting as it combines traditional features with a number of dimensions that are scarcely considered or combined in the literature. For example, the food arrives online as the day progresses. We must start allocating it almost immediately, possibly anticipating more donations later the same day. We assume the products are packaged and therefore indivisible. How do we then allocate them? Also, the problem the food banks face today is likely to repeat tomorrow. Can we then improve the allocation tomorrow by using the experience learned today? As a very first step, we focus on designing simple mechanisms allocating the food more efficiently (see Aleksandrov et al. [2015a]). In future, we also plan on investigating more closely the frontier between the allocation and the transportation frameworks within this mixed setting. For instance, shall we dispatch the items as soon as they arrive? Or, shall we first gather some more of them and then dispatch these together in order to guarantee the efficiency of the driverâ€™s shift?
