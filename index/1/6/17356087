Cyclic averaging techniques are applied to the CLL resonant power converter to provide steady-state converter characteristics for rapid stress analysis. This is shown to facilitate the determination of mode duties and initial conditions through knowledge of the operational modes of the rectifier at various operating frequencies. Comparisons are made with FMA-based cyclic analyses, and Spice simulations, that show, respectively, improved accuracy and vastly improved execution speeds.
