Remote backup systems provide database availability even in case Of &JaJterJ i!hUt cause Complete database failure. In a remote backup system a backup tracks the tranaactionprocessing at the primary and in the event of the primary failure takes ouer transaction processing without causing users to observe a breach in service. Remote backup algorithms have been developed for a variety of system architectures including the case in which primary and backup consist of multiple processors connected via multiple communication lines. A limitation of ezisting algorithms for such environments is that they ignore the issue of partial primary and backup failures in which one or more of the primary/backupprocessors fail but the ~ystern as a whole survives. This paper describes the design of a primary backup system which uses the backup to provide continued availability not only during disasters but also during partial failures. The key to the approach is a non-blocking two-phase commit protocol adapted for coordinating the propagation of the lags from the primary to the backup. Based on the developed commit protocol, recovery algorithms for handling partial and total failures of the primary and the backup are described.
