Pedestrians have difficulty noticing hybrid vehicles (HVs) and electrical vehicles (EVs) quietly approaching from behind. We propose a vehicle detection scheme using a smartphone carried by a pedestrian. A notification of a vehicle approaching can be delivered to wearable devices such as Google Glass. We exploit the high-frequency switching noise generated by the motor unit in HVs and EVs. Although people are less sensitive to these high-frequency ranges, these sounds are prominent even on a busy street, and it is possible for a smartphone to detect these signals. The ambient sound captured at 48 kHz is converted to a feature vector in the frequency domain. A J48 classifier implemented on a smartphone can determine whether an EV or HV is approaching. We have collected a large amount of vehicle data at various locations. The false-positive and false-negative rates of our detection scheme are 1.2% and 4.95%, respectively. The first alarm was detected as early as 11.6 s before the vehicle approached the observer. The scheme can also determine the vehicle speed and vehicle type.
