Most of the implementation experiences with CLOS(Common Lisp Object System)[CLOS] rotate around PCL [PCL], or Delphi[Delphi], on Lisp systems that do not support very efficient object oriented languages. Lisp Machines, on the other hand have been supporting Flavors[Moon 811, a very efficient implementation of a powerful ancestor of CLOS. Most of their operating system is based on Flavors programming. Implementing CLOS on these architectures represents both an opportunity and a challenge. The architecture is designed to implement object oriented languages like Flavors very efficiently, but on the other hand, CLOS must be as efficient as Flavors to be accepted as an alternative. This paper describes the TI implementation of CLOS, TICLOS for the Explorer architecture, and gives some results of performance benchmarks.
