A new type of wavelet based linearly parameterized network, dyadic network, is proposed in this paper, with application to an inverse dynamic based adaptive control. The function approximation capability of dyadic networks is supported by dyadic wavelet theory. Dyadic networks are easy to construct and the time cost is limited. Simulation results of a flight control system are presented to illustrate the performance of dyadic networks.
