CS faculty are responsible for educating future software developers and thus have a unique responsibility to combat the problem of sexism within the software development industry. Game development is an important subfield in which to address this problem because of its cultural impact, which extends beyond the developers involved, and its incorporation into pedagogy for the purposes of engagement and retention. The recent #GamerGate controversy has brought to public attention the issue of sexism within a white male-dominated gaming subculture as it enters the cultural mainstream, particularly due to anonymous threats of violence being made against women who have criticized the #GamerGate movement. This controversy is particularly important for CS because it centers on software developers. In addition to harming the targeted women, such threats create a chilling effect that threatens not only to silence important voices within gaming, but also to undermine progress toward gender equality in CS and the recruitment and retention of female CS students. It is important for CS faculty to evaluate their responsibility to students and to the field in light of these concerns. This lightning talk will assess the outcome of a round-table to be held with students at Capital University in which this controversy and its broader implications will be discussed. In particular, the talk will focus on outcomes related to CS education and outreach, with the goal that lessons learned through the round-table can inform the efforts of faculty planning to address such issues at their institutions.
