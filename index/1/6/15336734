Current forms of on-line help do not adequately reflect the graphical and dynamic nature of modern graphical user interfaces. Many of today's software applications provide text-based on-line help to assist users in performing a specific task. This report describes a study in which 176 undergraduates received on-line help instructions for completing seven computer-based tasks. Instructions were provided in either written or spoken form with or without still graphic or animated visuals. Results consistently revealed that visuals, either still graphic or animated, in the on-line help instructions enabled the users to significantly perform more tasks in less time and with fewer errors than did users who did not have visuals accompanying the on-line help instructions. Although users receiving spoken instructions were faster and more accurate for the initial set of tasks than were users receiving written instructions, the majority of subjects preferred written instructions over spoken instructions. The results of this study suggest additional empirically-based guidelines to designers for the development of effective on-line help.
