We study the role of pricing policies in multiple service class networks. We argue that some form of graduated prices are required in order for a ng multiclass service discipline to have the desired effect. Moreover, we demonstrate through simulation that it is possible to set the prices so that every user is more satisfied with the combined cost and performance of a network with graduated prices. For some users the performance penalty received for requesting a less-than-optimaJ service class is offset by the reduced price of the service. For the other users the monetary penalty incurred by using the more expensive, higher quality service classes is offset by the improved performance they receive. Thus, prices allow us to spread the benefits of multiple service classes around to all users, rather than just having these benefits remain exclusively with users who are performance sensitive.
