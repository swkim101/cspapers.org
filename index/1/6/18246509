The evolution of CAD (Computer-Aided Design) in response to the increased requirements of design engineers is discussed, and the effect of increased CAD capability on CAD philosophy is studied. It is noted that without the increases in hardware and software capabilities experienced in the last decade, these increases in capability would not have been possible.
