This paper addresses the problem of merging results obtained from different databases and search engines in a distributed information retrieval environment. The prior research on this problem either assumed the exchange of statistics necessary for normalizing scores (cooperative solutions) or is heuristic. Both approaches have disadvantages. We show that the problem in uncooperative environments is simpler when viewed as a component of a distributed IR system that uses query-based sampling to create resource descriptions. Documents sampled for creating resource descriptions can also be used to create a sample centralized index, and this index is a source of training data for adaptive results merging algorithms. A variety of experiments demonstrate that this new approach is more effective than a well-known alternative, and that it allows query-by-query tuning of the results merging function.
