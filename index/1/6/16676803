A loop (ring) system is proposed for distributed computer networks which: i) allows simultaneous transmission of variable-length message frames, 2) minimizes loop access and transmission times, and 3) provides a form of automatic traffic regulation. The ring interface transmitter which performs these three functions is described, and a conceptual model of its operation is developed. The model illustrates a technique by which the ring interface transmitter can delay incoming messages by hardware buffering just long enough for a variable-length output message to be placed on the loop. It is shown how advantage can be taken of gaps between incoming messages to clear out the delay buffer and to make room for future outgoing messages. It is further demonstrated that an interesting form of automatic message traffic regulation results from use of the proposed technique. Possible hardware implementations of the model are also considered, using a variable-length shift register for the incoming message delay buffer. The probable effects of the proposed technique on message transmission are discussed, and ongoing analytic and simulation studies are described.
