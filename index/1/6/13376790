The development of variable impedance actuators (VIAs) has highlighted the need for proper control of passive impedance to attain suitable interaction performance. Until recently the regulation of the intrinsic impedance in VIAs is achieved in an open-loop model-based manner, mainly due to the lack of physical sensors capable of measuring impedance components such as stiffness and damping. Hence, the estimation of variable stiffness and damping has been explored, with the target to provide monitoring and feedback for potential closed loop control schemes. However, the use of the output of these estimators in the feedback control of variable impedance actuators has never been implemented/demonstrated in practice. This work contributes to the field with the development and experimental evaluation of a novel damping feedback control for a class of variable impedance compliant actuators able to realize a variable physical damping principle. The scheme is based on non-model-based damping estimation feedback to compensate model uncertainties in the action of an inner controller that uses a model-based friction estimator. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed scheme to replicate with good fidelity constant and time-varying damping levels.
