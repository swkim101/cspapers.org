The Fujitsu-ANU Parallel Mathematical Subroutine Library Project is a joint research program involving staff at the Australian National University and Fujitsu Japan. The aim of the project is to produce a library of mathematical subroutines for the vector-parallel Fujitsu VPP300 which result in high performance and accuracy on large problems. In order to utilise the architecture of the VPPSOO it is necessary to develop new algorithms for many of the standard numerical problems.
