Android devices and applications become prevalent and ask for unanticipated capabilities thanks to the increased interests in smartphones and web applications. As a way to use the capabilities not directly available to ordinary users, applications have used Android Debug Bridge (ADB), a command line tool to communicate with Android devices for debugging purposes. While ADB provides powerful features that require permissions to use critical system resources, it opens a gate to adversaries. To understand the ADB capabilities and their possible risks, we present various types of attacks that are not easily identifiable using ADB capabilities and device-specific functions. We show that applications using ADB capabilities can modify installed applications, leak private user data, and track phone calls, among other things only with the INTERNET permission on the same device. To protect Android devices from such attacks, we present several mitigation mechanisms including a static analysis tool that analyzes Android applications to detect possible attacks using ADB capabilities. Such a tool can aid application markets such as Google Play to check third-party applications for possible attacks.
