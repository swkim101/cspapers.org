A variety of proposed architectures for data flow computers have been advanced. Evaluation of the practical potential of these proposals is being studied through analysis and simulation, but these techniques cannot be used to study a machine design in sufficient detail to make accurate predictions of performance. As a basis for extrapolating cost/performance of these architectures, and for developing a methodology for data flow program preparation, the construction of prototype machines is needed. In this paper we present our plan for realizing experimental data flow machines as packet communication systems using two types of hardware elements: a microprogrammed processing element with provision for packet transmission and reception; and a router unit used to build networks to support packet communication among processing elements.
