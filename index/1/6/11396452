The handwritten signature is perhaps the most accustomed way for the acknowledgement of the consent of an individual or the authentication of the identity of a person in numerous transactions. In addition, the authenticity of a questioned offline or static handwritten signature still poses a case of interest, especially in forensic related applications. A common approach in offline signature verification system is to apply several predetermined image analysis models. Consequently, any offline signature sample which originates from either authentic persons or forgers, utilizes a fixed feature extraction base. In this proposed study, the feature space and the corresponding projection values depend on the training samples only; thus the proposed method can be found useful in forensic cases. In order to do so, we reenter a groundbreaking unsupervised learning method named archetypal analysis, which is connected to effective data analysis approaches such as sparse coding. Due to the fact that until recently there was no efficient implementation publicly available, archetypal analysis had only few cases of use. However, a fast optimization scheme using an active set strategy is now available. The main goal of this work is to introduce archetypal analysis for offline signature verification. The output of the archetypal analysis of few reference samples is a set of archetypes which are used to form the base of the feature space. Then, given a set of archetypes and a signature sample under examination archetypal analysis and average pooling provides the corresponding features. The promising performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the use of an evaluation method which employs the popular CEDAR and MCYT75 signature datasets.
