Practical parallel scientific applications with domain decompositions, such as finite element methods, require irregular domain decompositions of complicated-shaped objects. However, existing PGAS frameworks, such as Global Arrays and XcalableMP, have supported the productive description of exchanging ghost points only for regular domain decompositions. With these backgrounds, we propose, implement and evaluate Distributed Memory Interface (DMI), a global address space framework for irregular applications. DMI provides highly productive APIs called read-write-set for irregular domain decompositions and complicated orderings in practical scientific applications.
