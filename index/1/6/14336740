In this paper we address several problems relating to functional dependencies and network schemas. We investigate properties of the functional dependencies that are implicitly defined in a network schema. A definition for the satisfaction of functional dependencies by a network database is proposed, and then we give a sufficient condition for the global consistency of a network schema. A network schema is globally consistent if all its databases satisfy the functional dependencies that are implicitly defined in the schema. Finally, we describe a design methodology for producing a network schema whose set of implicitly defined functional dependencies implies a set of functional dependencies specified by the user.
