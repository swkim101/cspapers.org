Detection of the Line-of-Sight (LOS) has a variety of applications, such as communication tools for elderly or disabled people and assisting drivers. To realize such promising applications, there is strong demand for a LOS detection system that does not restrict users' activities and inflicts no mental stress. In this paper, we propose a novel wearable LOS detection system, featuring minimum disturbance to users, both physically and mentally, via the use of dye-sensitized photovoltaic devices. These latter are transparent and generate voltage according to the incident light intensity. Arraying the devices on wearable eyeglasses, this system detects the difference in the reflection light from the pupil and the white of the eye and hence determines the position of the pupil. It is wearable as eyeglasses, meaning it does not disturb users' activities or eyesight. More importantly, it involves minimal physical and psychological stress. We fabricated the photovoltaic device and demonstrated their feasibility to determine the location of the pupil. We improved the accuracy of pupil location detection by arraying the micro-patterned devises using MEMS technology. The pupil location and the line-of-sight was successfully detected using the developed eyeglass type system.
