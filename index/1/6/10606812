This paper presents preliminary work done on developing a 3D full-wave indoor propagation model. The model is based on the volume electric field integral equation (VEFIE) which when discretised by a weak-form discretisation results in a dense linear system whose solution can be expedited through use of the Fast Fourier Transform and a reduced operator. A comparison between the current standard for indoor wave propagation, ray tracing, is made. Very good agreement between the two models is shown.
