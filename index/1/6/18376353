In this paper, a novel soft inflatable arm is proposed for telepresence robots. It is capable of imitating human arms to realize remote interaction. The new proposed arm using a very common and low cost inflatable material, and it is very light, which weight is only about 50 grams, but can well realize agile movement by driving three tiny cables installed in shoulder joint and elbow joint, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed cable driven mechanism also allows connecting numbers of joints easily. The soft inflatable can work just by pumping air with very low pressure (7.32 Â± 3.45 kPa), and allows human directly and safely contact without any external sensors. Moreover, to solve the challenge problems of soft joint deformation, the kinematic modeling of the joint with deformation compensation is also developed. Experimental results show that the soft inflatable arm can agilely move for remote interaction. The workspace and velocity are also close to an adult's arm movement space and normal motion speed.
