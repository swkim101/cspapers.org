Newly available EEG headsets allow us to sense mental states which could be useful in understanding how our brains are affected by the surrounding environments. In this paper, we present a novel recommendation approach that is based on mental states analysis. Mobile EEG headsets are used to detect mental states at different places to understand how they stimulate our brain signals. By analyzing EEG data, we could classify places according to the mental state signature, then we could build a map to guide and recommend therapeutical third places to people that lessen brain fatigue and mental rejuvenation.
