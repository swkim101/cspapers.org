The property management database system under development at the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) is a large relational database system. The application system has a high expected transaction processing rate approximately 37000 transactions per day (most of them accessing mutliple tables) from about 250 on-line users. Performance is of critical importance in its success. In this paper we consider the effect of the Ingres Search Accelerator on the transaction processing efficiency of the system. The performance enhancement brought about by SCAFS (XL’s current version of the well-known Content Addressable File Store, CAFS pABB79, BABB85,COUL72] - the heart of the Ingres Search Accelerator) for different fde organisations is assessed. Recommendations on how the performance of SCAFS can be improved by tuning certain parameters is provided. We also provide a rough guideline as to when the Ingres Query Optimizer “decides” to use SCAFS for different file organ&lions and point out deficiencies in this decision making
