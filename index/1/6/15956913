The advent of new database applications such as engineering design stresses the need for new functie nalities in database systems. It includes the management of multiple representations for database objects, long transactions as well as dynamic data structures. This paper presents the approach used in CADB, a prototype expert database system dedicated to CAD, for the management and control of the consistency of design objects. It concerns both the operations on the object property values and the interactive manipulation of their structure. They involve concepts of the object models as well as the application semantics. They rely therefore on concepts used for representing the design objects and on semantic notions related to expert knowledge in the application domain. Among these are the notions of consistency and of completeness of the objects. These two complementary aspects are detailed and their relationships described. The emphasis is on the heuristic rules that provide a unified knowledge-based approach for their management independent of the particular application being considered. Dynamic inheritance mechanisms are also presented that sup port the manipulations performed on the object structures. It is shown how they help providing expert database facilities.
