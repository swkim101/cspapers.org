A new age of industrial robotics is here which includes safety rated human friendly robots. These types of robots are more suitable in high volume and small scale industries. The operations in these areas can be fully automated. There are other industries which have specialty for low volume and high variability. High variety means there are less chances of fully automation as one product will be varying from other and in this complete automation is not viable option. The industrial robots which deal with high volume and can adopt variability through programming. There are plenty of manual operations which can be semi-automated. To address this human robot collaboration is a complete fit. The experiment has been undertaken to make one of these medium scale robot to collaborate with human to perform a task together. The contactless leap motion device has been used for controlling robot motions.
