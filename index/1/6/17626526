We have studied the application of an independent component analysis (ICA) approach to the identification and possible removal of artifacts from a magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recording. This statistical technique separates components according to the kurtosis of their amplitude distributions over time, thus distinguishing between strictly periodical signals, and regularly and irregularly occurring signals. Many artifacts belong to the last category. In order to assess the effectiveness of the method, controlled artifacts were produced, which included saccadic eye movements and blinks, increased muscular tension due to biting and the presence of a digital watch inside the magnetically shielded room. The results demonstrate the capability of the method to identify and clearly isolate the produced artifacts.
