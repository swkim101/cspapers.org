A thorough understanding of the network behaviour when exposed to challenges is of paramount importance to construct a resilient MANET (mobile ad hoc network). However, modelling mobile and wireless networks as well as challenges against them is non-trivial due to dynamic and intermittent connectivity caused by channel fading and mobility of the nodes. We treat MANETs as time-varying graphs (TVGs) represented as a weighted adjacency matrix, in which the weights denote the link availability. We present how centrality-based attacks could affect network performance for different routing protocols. Furthermore, we model propagation loss models that represent realistic area-based challenges in wireless networks.
