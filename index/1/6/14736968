Several organizations are setting up Public Key Infrastructures, examples are: • the Corporation for Research and Educational Networking (CREN), • the Federal Government plans to fund 7 Public Key Infrastructure Models pilot programs at different federal agencies. However, experts have quite different viewpoints on how to set up such Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Indeed, X500 and X509 are hierarchically organized (i.e. vertical), but PGP (see also Rivest-Lampson) is horizontally organized. Variants of PGP (see Reiter-Stubblebine (CCCS, ACM) and BurmesterDesmedt-Kabatianski (DIMACS)) require a minimum connectivity, i.e., a minimum number of disjoint paths in order to deal with hackers breaking into certifying entities (authorities). Moreover, Ellison-Schneier have questioned the need for a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Before one builds such an expensive infrastructure, experts should debate what method to use and whether a PKI is needed. While a hierarchical PKI may become the next target of computer hackers, a multiple-connected one seems much more expensive to build. 1. SURVEY BY THE MODERATOR 1.
