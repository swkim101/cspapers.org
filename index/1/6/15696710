In this paper, we consider an environment in which computational offoading is adopted amongst mobile devices. We call such an environment a mobile device cloud (MDC). In this work, we highlight via emulation, experimenation and real measurements, the potential gain in computation time and energy consumption that can be achieved by offoading tasks within an MDC. We also propose and develop an experimental platform to enable researchers create and experiment with novel offoading algorithms in MDCs.
