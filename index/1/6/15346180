Manually constructing a Wordnet is a difficult task, needing years of expertsâ€™ time. As a first step to automatically construct full Wordnets, we propose approaches to generate Wordnet synsets for languages both resource-rich and resource-poor, using publicly available Wordnets, a machine translator and/or a single bilingual dictionary. Our algorithms translate synsets of existing Wordnets to a target language T, then apply a ranking method on the translation candidates to find best translations in T. Our approaches are applicable to any language which has at least one existing bilingual dictionary translating from English to it.
