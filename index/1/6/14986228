We describe an autonomous robotic system capable of navigating through an office environment, opening doors along the way, and plugging itself into electrical outlets to recharge as needed. We demonstrate through extensive experimentation that our robot executes these tasks reliably, without requiring any modification to the environment. We present robust detection algorithms for doors, door handles, and electrical plugs and sockets, combining vision and laser sensors. We show how to overcome the unavoidable shortcoming of perception by integrating compliant control into manipulation motions. We present a visual-differencing approach to high-precision plug-insertion that avoids the need for high-precision hand-eye calibration.
