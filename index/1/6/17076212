This paper presents a novel method of combining topological and feature-based mapping strategies to create a hierarchical approach to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). More than simply running both processes in parallel, we use the topological mapping procedure to organize local feature-based methods. The result is an autonomous exploration and mapping strategy that scales well to large environments and higher dimensions while confronting the issue of obstacle avoidance. We have obtained successful results of our approach in an area spanning 5000 square meters.
