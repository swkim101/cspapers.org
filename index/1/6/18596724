Whole-body holding manipulation is effective for carrying the handleless large object. In order to keep the object stability, the dexterous transition motion is necessary. From geometric and physical conditions of object manipulation, we propose the general method of generating the transition graph, which represents the object pose and grasp contact. By searching the path on the graph, the transition motion is planned automatically with considering the object motion and contact switching simultaneously. By generating and modifying the whole-body holding motion, the planned object motion is achieved stably. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by the experiments, in which robot lifts up a large object with whole-body contact by the planned transition motion.
