This paper proposes a direct monocular SLAM algorithm that estimates a dense reconstruction of a scene in real-time on a CPU. Highly textured image areas are mapped using standard direct mapping techniques [1], that minimize the photometric error across different views. We make the assumption that homogeneous-color regions belong to approximately planar areas. Our contribution is a new algorithm for the estimation of such planar areas, based on the information of a superpixel segmentation and the semidense map from highly textured areas. We compare our approach against several alternatives using the public TUM dataset [2] and additional live experiments with a hand-held camera. We demonstrate that our proposal for piecewise planar monocular SLAM is faster, more accurate and more robust than the piecewise planar baseline [3]. In addition, our experimental results show how the depth regularization of monocular maps can damage its accuracy, being the piecewise planar assumption a reasonable option in indoor scenarios.
