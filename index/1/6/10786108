The research aim is to apply locomotive robots to rescue tasks, such as searching for sufferers and removing obstacles to save sufferers. The paper discusses the exploitation of arm and leg integrated robots and basic experiments of infrared probing sensor, in the application of rescue tasks. First, the limb mechanism is introduced and discussed in the aspect of locomotion capability and stability in rough terrain of disaster area. Then, the probing sensor is evaluated in the aspect of its detection range and capability. Assuming the sensor is mounted on the tip of robot arm for probing, the probing algorithm is proposed to find quickly and locate precisely a sufferer. The basic experiments have been carried out using a parallel arm to confirm the applicability and the usefulness of the proposed rescue system.
