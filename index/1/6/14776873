Accurate interference models are important for use in transmission scheduling algorithms in wireless networks. In this work, we perform extensive modeling and experimentation on two 20-node TelosB motes testbeds -- one indoor and the other outdoor -- to compare a suite of interference models for their modeling accuracies. We first empirically build and validate the physical interference model via a packet reception rate vs. SINR relationship using a measurement driven method. We then similarly instantiate other simpler models, such as hop-based, range-based, protocol model, etc. The modeling accuracies are then evaluated on the two testbeds using transmission scheduling experiments. We observe that while the physical interference model is the most accurate, it is still far from perfect, providing a 90-percentile error about 20-25% (and 80 percentile error 7-12%), depending on the scenario. The accuracy of the other models is worse and scenario-specific. The second best model trails the physical model by roughly 12-18 percentile points for similar accuracy targets. Somewhat similar throughput performance differential between models is also observed when used with greedy scheduling algorithms. Carrying on further, we look closely into the the two incarnations of the physical model -- 'thresholded' (conservative, but typically considered in literature) and 'graded' (more realistic). We show via solving the one shot scheduling problem, that the graded version can improve `expected throughput' over the thresholded version by scheduling imperfect links.
