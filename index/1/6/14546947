Visual object recognition involves the identification of images of 3-D objects seen from arbitrary viewpoints. We suggest an approach to object recognition in which a view is represented as a collection of points given by their location in the image. An object is modeled by a set of 2-D views together with the correspondence between the views. We show that any novel view of the object can be expressed as a linear combination of the stored views. Consequently, we build a linear operator that distinguishes between views of a specific object and views of other objects. This operator can be implemented using neural network architectures with relatively simple structures.
