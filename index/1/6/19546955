In recent years, social media has become one of the most popular tools for discovering and following breaking news and ongoing events. However tools and interfaces have lagged behind users' expectations, with current tools making it difficult to discover new events and failing to provide a solution to the problem of information overload. We have developed an interactive interface for visualizing events, backed by a state-of-the-art event detection approach, which is able to detect, track and summarize events in real-time. Our interface provides up-to-the-second information about ongoing events in an easy to understand manner, including category information, temporal distribution, and location information -- all of which was previously unobtainable in real-time.
