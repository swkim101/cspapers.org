A new method for the computation of the dynamics of structure-varying kinematic chains is proposed. This is based on the complete redefinition of the system connectivity deriving from a given structural change. The derived computational efficiency is then described with examples of typical motion planning tasks and structure changes for free-flying robots. These include open branched chains and closed loops, in free and grappled conditions. The method may then contribute to the efficiency of motion planning for robots which may require different kinematic structures for a given task.
