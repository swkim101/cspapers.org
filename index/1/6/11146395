A two par ty protocol in which par ty A uses one of several secret witnesses to an NP assertion is witness indistinguishable if par ty B cannot tell which witness A is actually using. The protocol is witness hiding if by the end of the protocol B cannot compute any new witness which he did not know before the protocol began. Witness hiding is a natural security requirement, and can replace zero knowledge in many cryptographic protocols. We prove two central results: 1. Unlike zero knowledge protocols, witness indistinguishablity is preserved under arbi t rary composition of protocols, including parallel execution. 2. If a s ta tement has at least two independent witnesses, then any witness indistinguishable protocol for this s ta tement is also
