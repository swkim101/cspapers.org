In this paper, we prove that there exists a fault-free cycle of length at least 2<sup>n</sup> - 2|F<sub>v</sub>| in Q<sub>n</sub> (n ges 3) with |Fe| les 2n - 5 and |F<sub>v</sub>| + |F<sub>e</sub>| les 2n - 4 in which each node is incident to at least two critical edges. Our result improves on the previously best known results reported in the literature, where only faulty nodes or faulty edges are considered.
