In this paper, we propose a prototype system for automatic generation of concept hierarchies to be used as an overview of search results. The system sends a user's query to five search engines and receives a returned list of relevant web pages. The system then extracts query-oriented concept terms from snippets that come with the returned hits. Concept terms are organized into a concept hierarchy using a co-occurrence-based classification technique. Finally, concepts in returned documents are dynamically highlighted according to terms in the selected concept branch that lead to the chosen document. The user study shows that concept hierarchies do provide easy navigation and browsing of web returned documents. The results also show that users can find a document of interest no matter how low it is ranked in the retrieved list.
