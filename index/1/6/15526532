In this paper, we introduce the method tagging substitute-complement attributes on miscellaneous recommending relations, and elaborate how this step contributes to electronic merchandising.
 There are already decades of works in building recommender systems. Steadily outperforming previous algorithms is difficult under the conventional framework. However, in real merchandising scenarios, we find describing the weight of recommendation simply as a scalar number is hardly expressive, which hinders the further progress of recommender systems.
 We study a large log of user browsing data, revealing the typical substitute complement relations among items that can further extend recommender systems in enriching the presentation and improving the practical quality. Finally, we provide an experimental analysis and sketch an online prototype to show that tagging attributes can grant more intelligence to recommender systems by differentiating recommended candidates to fit respective scenarios.
