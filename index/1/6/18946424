We introduce a new method for training deep Boltzmann machines jointly. Prior methods of training DBMs require an initial learning pass that trains the model greedily, one layer at a time, or do not perform well on classification tasks. In our approach, we train all layers of the DBM simultaneously, using a novel training procedure called multi-prediction training. The resulting model can either be interpreted as a single generative model trained to maximize a variational approximation to the generalized pseudolikelihood, or as a family of recurrent networks that share parameters and may be approximately averaged together using a novel technique we call the multi-inference trick. We show that our approach performs competitively for classification and outperforms previous methods in terms of accuracy of approximate inference and classification with missing inputs.
