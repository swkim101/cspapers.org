Researchers have often linked factors such as mathematics ability and overall academic achievement to success in computer science. In this study, a group of students with common mathematics backgrounds was examined to determine if some other new factors were also involved in success in computer science. In particular, the roles of prior computing experience, work, and sex are discussed. A composite picture of the typical successful student is drawn and the implications for computer science departments are identified.
