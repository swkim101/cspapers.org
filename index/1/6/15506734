Mobile manipulation control method for humanoid robots provides good manipulability and stability on manipulation tasks. This method leads whole body motion and locomotion, when the manipulator tip trajectory is decided. For the dexterous manipulation, the robot has to cope with the unexpected forces acting to the hands. By assuming the statistical balance, we define the projection of the CoM as "complement zero moment point (CZMP)", when the external forces act to the end-effectors. We propose to use the CZMP for the modification control of CoM with balancing control. The method is implemented to the mobile manipulation control method and the effectiveness is confirmed by the experimental results.
