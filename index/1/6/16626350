The synthesis of controllers with robust performance is addressed. Tracking specifications are defined by a family of reference models describing the desired frequency response. The synthesis problem is then formulated as a set inclusion problem in the frequency domain. It is shown that the problem can be cast as a constraint satisfaction problem and solved by branch-and-prune algorithms. Different branching and pruning methodologies are explored and compared
