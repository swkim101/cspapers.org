Nowadays, mobile devices are becoming more flexible and rich in functionalities. As already presented in [6] those devices are highly influenced by constraints, mainly regarding power management. In fact, mobile batteries are limited in time and there are no efficient methods able to manage power consumption. Even knowing the device Time To Live (TTL) is currently left to the user experience. In this paper, we presented MPower, a system able to predict the mobile device TTL, providing also the user with suggestions on the optimal device configuration w.r.t. the desired TTL. This allows the user to manage the available power resources, according to his/her needs, avoiding power wasting.
