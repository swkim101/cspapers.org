The use of the temporal logic formalism for program reasoning is reviewed. Several aspects of responsiveness and fairness are analyzed, leading to the need for an additional temporal operator: the 'until' operator -U. Some general questions involving the 'until' operator are then discussed. It is shown that with the addition of this operator the temporal language becomes expressively complete. Then, two deductive systems DX and DUX are proved to be complete for the languages without and with the new operator respectively.
