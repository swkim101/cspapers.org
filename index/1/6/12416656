This paper proposes a design strategy for deep language processing grammars to appropriately handle language variants. It allows a grammar to be restricted as to what language variant it is tuned to, but also to detect the variant a given input pertains to. This is evaluated and compared to results obtained with an alternative strategy by which the relevant variant is detected with current language identification methods in a preprocessing step.
