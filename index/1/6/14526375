In this research, our aim is to increase the efficiency of individual visitors and the whole system by reducing traffic congestion in large-scale crowd’s activities. To achieve the goal, a route guidance mechanism with centralized information control (CIC) is proposed by granting priority to visitors using CIC. Through multi-agent simulation, we confirmed that the CIC mechanism was effective in improving the traffic efficiency of visitors and could avoid the phenomena of social dilemma in large-scale crowd’s activities at the same time.
