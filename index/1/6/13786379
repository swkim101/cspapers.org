Public key server is a simple yet effective way of key management in secure end-to-end communication. To ensure the trustworthiness of a public key server, transparent log systems such as CONIKS employ a tamper-evident data structure on the server and a gossiping protocol among clients in order to detect compromised servers. However, due to lack of incentive and vulnerability to malicious clients, a gossiping protocol is hard to implement in practice. Meanwhile, alternative solutions such as EthIKS are not scalable. This paper presents Trusternity, an auditing scheme relying on Ethereum blockchain that is easy to implement, scalable and inexpensive to operate.
