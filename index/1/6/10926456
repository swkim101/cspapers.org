Traditional approaches to knowledge management are essentially limited to document management. However, much knowledge in organizations or communities resides in an informal social network and may be accessed only by asking the right people. This paper describes MARS, a multiagent referral system for knowledge management. MARS assigns a software agent to each user. The agents facilitate their users' interactions and help manage their personal social networks. Moreover, the agents cooperate with one another by giving and taking referrals to help their users find the right parties to contact for a specific knowledge need.
