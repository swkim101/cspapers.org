Formalization of familiarity contributes to formalization of trust through a value-centric trust model. However, familiarity was assumed to be the similarity of values (fixed for two agents), and stability of the trust model was relatively low. To increase the stability, we propose an improved familiarity measurement. Experiments are carried out to compare the stability of the trust model with the improved familiarity measurement and with the fixed familiarity value. It is observed that the stability is increased by 33.47% through the improved familiarity measurement.
