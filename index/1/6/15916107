This work deals with the application of confidence measures within an interactive-predictive machine translation system in order to reduce human effort. If a small loss in translation quality can be tolerated for the sake of efficiency, user effort can be saved by interactively translating only those initial translations which the confidence measure classifies as incorrect. We apply confidence estimation as a way to achieve a balance between user effort savings and final translation error. Empirical results show that our proposal allows to obtain almost perfect translations while significantly reducing user effort.
