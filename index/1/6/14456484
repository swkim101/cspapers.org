We present an implementation of a model of very early sensory-motor development, guided by results from developmental psychology. Behavioral acquisition and growth is demonstrated through constraint-lifting mechanisms initiated by global state variables. The results show how staged competence can be shaped by qualitative behavior changes produced by anatomical, computational and maturational constraints.
