This paper presents a mobile-instrumented Platform to interact with smart objects by using gestures. The system relies on a Dynamic Time Warping algorithm, which serve to train personalized gestures and also to recognize them real-time. The trained set of gestures is available for consumer applications to include this type of interaction in their functionalities. In particular, we describe a consumer application that enables to configure and orchestrate different controllable smart objects. Each object provides a list of configurable actions that it can perform, thus the user may match each action with his preferred gesture. In execution time, a user may control the desired object just by pressing the object name; additionally, the user can retrieve the existing configuration, reconfigure it and train new gestures. The result is an easy-to-scale system, in which developers may include new object modules.
