In recent years, many researchers have studied the characteristics of Twitter, which is a microblogging service used by a large number of people worldwide. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet been conducted to study the relationship between profile images and user behaviors on Twitter. We assume that the profile images and behaviors of users are influenced by their internal properties, because users consider their profile images as symbolic representations of themselves on Twitter. We empirically categorized profile images into 13 types, and investigated the relationships between each category of profile images and users' behaviors on Twitter.
