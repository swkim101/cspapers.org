This paper presents a quasi-static step climbing behaviour for a minimal sensing wheel-legged quadruped robot called PAW. In the quasi-static climbing maneuver, the robot benefits from wheel traction and uses its legs to reconfigure itself with respect to the step during the climb. The control methodology with the corresponding controller parameters is determined and the state machine for the maneuver is developed. With this controller, PAW is able to climb steps higher than its body clearance. Furthermore, any step height up to this maximum achievable height can be negotiated autonomously with a single set of controller parameters, without knowledge of the step height or distance to the step.
