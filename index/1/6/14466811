We consider the communication complexity of finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a string shared between two parties. We prove tight bounds for the space complexity of randomized one-pass streaming algorithms for this problem. Our bounds are parameterized in terms of the LIS of the inputs. This resolves an open question in [19]. We also give the first bounds for approximating the LIS and its length.
 Next, we consider the communication complexity of finding the longest common subsequece (LCS) of two strings held by different parties, as well as the problem of approximating its length. We improve the existing lower bounds for these problems, even in the most difficult case when both parties have a permutation of N symbols. Our results yield tight space bounds for multipass deterministic streaming algorithms. For randomized mutlipass algorithms, our bounds are tight up to a logarithmic factor.
