The introduction of dynamic oracles has considerably improved the accuracy of greedy transition-based dependency parsers, without sacrificing parsing efficiency. However, this enhancement is limited to projective parsing, and dynamic oracles have not yet been implemented for parsers supporting non-projectivity. In this paper we introduce the first such oracle, for a non-projective parser based on Attardiâ€™s parser. We show that training with this oracle improves parsing accuracy over a conventional (static) oracle on a wide range of datasets.
