The results and achievements of research in information retrieval have had little influence on the types of retrieval mechanism implemented in the large commercial on-line retrieval systems. Commercial systems still use simple Boolean techniques while experiments have shown that other techniques, such as those making use of relevance information, perform better. Reasons for this are suggested. A strategy is described for the implementation of high-powered techniques which overcomes this problem - an intelligent terminal is used in conjunction with an existing commercial I. R. system. The added processing capability permits the implementation of more sophisticated retrieval techniques very cheaply. Retrieval methods that can be implemented on such a terminal used in this way are described.Particular emphasis is placed upon the practical implementation of a term weighting scheme based on relevance feedback information which generates a ranked list of documents in answer to a query.
