Brand advertising on the Web is usually done by graphical ads (display ads) placed on the publishers’ Web pages.

In contrast, in online advertising there are billions of opportunities (page views), hundreds of millions of ads and it is possible to provide personalization with quantifiable results. This brings the advertising into the realm of the other ”computational” sciences. The aim of this tutorial is to present the state of the art in the emerging area of computational advertising, and to expose the participants to the main research challenges in
