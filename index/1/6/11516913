We show how model checking and symbolic execution can be used to generate test inputs to achieve structural coverage of code that manipulates complex data structures. We focus on obtaining branch-coverage during unit testing of some of the core methods of the red-black tree implementation in the Java TreeMap library, using the Java PathFinder model checker. Three different test generation techniques will be introduced and compared, namely, straight model checking of the code, model checking used in a black-box fashion to generate all inputs up to a fixed size, and lastly, model checking used during white-box test input generation. The main contribution of this work is to show how efficient white-box test input generation can be done for code manipulating complex data, taking into account complex method preconditions.
