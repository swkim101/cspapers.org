We investigate a few problems relevant to cooperative games, such as deciding whether a group of agents can form a coalition and act together in a way that satisfies all of them. In terms of solution concepts, we study the computational aspects of the core of a game. The main contributions are a formal link with the existing literature, and complexity results for several classes of models.
