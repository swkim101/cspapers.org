Along with technological developments and increasing competition there is a major incentive for companies to produce and market high quality products before their competitors. In order to conquer a bigger portion of the market share, companies have to ensure the quality of the product in a shorter time frame. To accomplish this task companies try to automate their test processes as much as possible. It is critical to investigate and understand the problems that occur during different stages of test automation processes. In this paper we report on a case study on automatic analysis of non-functional test results. We discuss challenges in the face of continuous integration and deployment and provide improvement suggestions based on interviews at a large company in Sweden. The key contributions of this work are filling the knowledge gap in research about performance regression test analysis automation and providing warning signs and a road map for the industry.
