In acyclic job shop scheduling problems there are n jobs and on machines. Each job is composed of a sequence of operations to be performed on different machines. A legal schedule is one in which within each job, operations are carried out in order, and each machine performs at most one operation in any unit of time. If D denotes the length of the longest job, and C denotes the number of time utits requested by all jobs on the most loaded machine, then clearly Zb = max[C, D] is a lower bound on the length of the shortest legal schedule. A celebrated result of Leighton, Maggs and Rao shows that if all operat,ions are of unit length, then there always is a legal schedule of lengt,h O(Ib), independent of n and m. For the case ghat operations may have different lengbhs, Shmoys, Stein and wein showed that there alwavs is a legal schedule of length O(Zb(log Z~J)~), where (6) notaiion is used to suppress log log(B) terms. We improve the upper bound to d(Blog la). We also shorn that our new upper bound is essentially best possible, by proving the existence of instances of acyclic job shop scheduling for which the shortest legal schedule is of length $blog Zb). This resolves (negatively) a known open problem of whether the linear upper bound of Leighton, Maggs and Rae applies to arbitrary job shop scheduling instances (without the restriction to acyclicity and unit length operations).
