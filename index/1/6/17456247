An algorithm for generating a page reference string which exhibits a given working set size behavior in the time domain is presented, and the possible applications of such a string are discussed. The correctness of the algorithm is proved, and its computational complexity found to be linear in the length of the string. A program implementing the algorithm, which is performed in one pass and requires very little space, is briefly described, and some experimental results are given.
