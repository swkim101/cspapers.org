We present a diagnostic model of software fault localization. A diagnoatic. approach to fault localization has proven effective In the domains of medicine and digital hardware. Applying this approach to the software domain requires two extensions: a heuristic abstraction mechanism which infers program function from structure using recognition and transformation tactics; and a search mechanism which integrates both prototypic and causal reasoning about faults.
