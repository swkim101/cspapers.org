This tool demonstration presents a framework for integrating and coordinating the activities of medical devices. The framework uses a publish-subscribe framework for communicating with and controlling devices and a model-driven component-based development environment for rapid implementation of device coordination tasks. A multi-faceted graphical user interface supports activities such as device/driver registering and installation, model-based development of device integrations, and monitoring system activities/performance. The framework also includes a control/display environment that clinicians would use to (a) display integrated information pulled from multiple devices and (b) launch and interact with device coordinations that automate clinical workflows. The distribution of the framework includes a collection of mock medical devices, and instructions for integrating real devices. The codebase is freely available under an open source license.
