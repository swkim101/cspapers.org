We demonstrate a localization system, called Spotlight [1], for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). The system, developed at the University of Virginia, has been tested in an outdoor, realistic, environment and has shown a very high accuracy (e.g., tens of centimeters). Our contribution to the area of localization in WSNs is two-fold: develop a novel scheme for localizing sensor nodes, and implement the system on real sensor nodes and common-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware.
