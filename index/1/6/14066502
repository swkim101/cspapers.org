This paper presents a statistical parser for a wide-coverage Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) derived from the Penn Treebank. The Treebank is translated to a corpus of canonical CCG derivations. We de ne a generative statistical model over CCG derivations and train it on the transformed Treebank. This model is evaluated using Parseval measures and the accuracy of recovery of word-word dependencies. The impact of lexical coverage on parsing accuracy is also investigated.
