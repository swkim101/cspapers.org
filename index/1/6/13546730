In recent years, natural language processing techniques have been used more and more in IR. Among other syntactic and semantic parsing are effective methods for the design of complex applications like for example question answering and sentiment analysis. Unfortunately, extracting feature representations suitable for machine learning algorithms from linguistic structures is typically difficult. In this paper, we describe one of the most advanced piece of technology for automatic engineering of syntactic and semantic patterns. This method merges together convolution dependency tree kernels with lexical similarities. It can efficiently and effectively measure the similarity between dependency structures, whose lexical nodes are in part or completely different. Its use in powerful algorithm such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) allows for fast design of accurate automatic systems.
 We report some experiments on question classification, which show an unprecedented result, e.g. 41% of error reduction of the former state-of-the-art, along with the analysis of the nice properties of the approach.
