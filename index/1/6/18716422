There are no mechanical harvesters for the fresh market apple industry commercially available. The absence of automated harvesting technology is a critical problem because of rising production costs and increasing uncertainty about future labor availability. This paper presents the preliminary design of a robotic apple harvester. The approach adopted was to develop a low-cost, `undersensed' system for modern orchard systems with fruiting wall architectures. A machine vision system fuses Circular Hough Transform and blob analysis to detect clustered and occluded fruit. The design includes a custom, six degree of freedom manipulator with an underactuated, passively compliant end-effector. After fruit localization, the system makes a linear approach to the apple and replicates the human picking process. Integrated testing of the robotic harvesting system has been completed in a laboratory environment with a replica apple tree for proof-of-concept demonstration. Experimental results show that the system picked 95 of the 100 fruit attempted with average localization and picking times of 1.2 and 6.8 seconds, respectively, per fruit. Additional work planned in preparation for field evaluation in a commercial orchard is also described.
