PLATINUM is an operating system kernel with a novel memory management system for Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) multiprocessor architectures. This memory management system implements a coherent memory abstraction. Coherent memory is uniformly accessible from all processors in the system. When used by applications coded with appropriate programming styles it appears to be nearly as fast as local physical memory and it reduces memory contention. Coherent memory makes programming NUMA multiprocessors easier for the user while attaining a level of performance comparable with hand-tuned programs.
This paper describes the design and implementation of the PLATINUM memory management system, emphasizing the coherent memory. We measure the cost of basic operations implementing the coherent memory. We also measure the performance of a set of application programs running on PLATINUM. Finally, we comment on the interaction between architecture and the coherent memory system.
PLATINUM currently runs on the BBN Butterfly Plus Multiprocessor.
