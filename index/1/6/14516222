This paper presents a second prototype of the flytrap robot which mimics the fast snap-through motion of the Venus flytrap, the previous version of the robot. This second prototype employs a new type of unsymmetrically laminated carbon fiber reinforced prepreg (CFRP) structure which has two different curvatures, and an SMA spring actuator. To estimate the force of snap-through the structure, a linear beam bending model is introduced and a force-displacement experiment is demonstrated. Based on the numerical and experimental results, the flytrap robot can be closed rapidly and opened for re-load. The closure time is about 100ms.
