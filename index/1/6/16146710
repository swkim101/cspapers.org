In this paper we present a new methodology for designing reliable communication protocols. This methodology enhances communicating processes with a synchronization mechanism so that they can detect and resolve the errors caused by collisions automatically. The major advantages of this new methodology include: (1) the “state explosion” problem involved in protocol validation is alleviated; and (2) the burden of handling errors due to collisions is removed from the protocol designer. There is a need to verify that this methodology is applicable to arbitrary protocols. In this paper we also discuss the application of a program verification technique to this methodology.
