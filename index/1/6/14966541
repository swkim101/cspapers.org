We describe a novel simple and highly scalable semi-supervised method called Word-Class Distribution Learning (WCDL), and apply it task of information extraction (IE) by utilizing unlabeled sentences to improve supervised classification methods. WCDL iteratively builds class label distributions for each word in the dictionary by averaging predicted labels over all cases in the unlabeled corpus, and re-training a base classifier adding these distributions as word features. In contrast, traditional self-training or co-training methods self-labeled examples (rather than features) which can degrade performance due to incestuous learning bias. WCDL exhibits robust behavior, and has no difficult parameters to tune. We applied our method on German and English name entity recognition (NER) tasks. WCDL shows improvements over self-training, multi-task semi-supervision or supervision alone, in particular yielding a state-of-the art 75.72 F1 score on the German NER task.
