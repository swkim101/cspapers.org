We study how functional dependencies affect the cyclicity of a database scheme; in particular, when does a set of functional dependencies make a cyclic database scheme behave like an acyclic one.A database scheme is fd-acyclic if every pairwise-consistent database state that satisfies the fd's is join-consistent. We give a simple characterization of fd-acyclicity over a restricted class of database schemes. We then give a tableau-based characterization for the general case that leads to an algorithm for testing fd-acyclicity. This algorithm actually solves the more general problem of query equivalence under functional dependencies and typed inclusion dependencies.
