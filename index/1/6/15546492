Large complex real-time systems are developed by design teams using object-oriented analysis and design methodologies. This workshop focused on the processes and the representations used to create and manipulate 00 designs. The context of the participants (AT&T, BNR, CAI, Digitalk, Espirito Santo Data Informatica, IBM, NRC, OTI, University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and Xerox) included both pure 00 systems and systems with a large legacy of non-00 designs and code. Each participant contributed a paper to detail their experience with 00 design techniques and to provide some background on their current system size; design tools; and design process. Presentations by the participants were limited to a brief five minute statement of position. This permitted the rest of the day (over seven hours!) to be spent brainstorming and organizing ideas related to team approaches to 00 design. Workshop activities included:
