We discuss a solution to the problem of separating waveforms produced by multiple cells in an extracellular neural recording. We take an explicitly probabilistic approach, using latent-variable models of varying sophistication to describe the distribution of waveforms produced by a single cell. The models range from a single Gaussian distribution of waveforms for each cell to a mixture of hidden Markov models. We stress the overall statistical structure of the approach, allowing the details of the generative model chosen to depend on the specific neural preparation.
