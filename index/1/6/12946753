We present Autoepistemic Description Logics (ADLs), in which the language of Description Logics is augmented with modal operators interpreted according to the nonmonotonic logic MKNF. We provide decision procedures for query answering in two very expressive ADLs. We show their representational features by addressing defaults, integrity constraints, role and concept closure. Hence, ADLs provide a formal characterization of a wide variety of nonmonotonic features commonly available in frame-based systems and needed in the development of practical applications.
