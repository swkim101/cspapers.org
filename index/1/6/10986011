In medical and biotechnology fields, soft devices are required because of their high safety from low mechanical impedance. FMA (Flexible Microactuator) is one of the typical soft actuators. It consists of fiber-reinforced rubber structure with multi air chambers and realizes bending motion pneumatically. It has been applied to robot hands, robot legs and so on. High potential of FMA has been confirmed by many experiments reported in several papers. However in fabrication process of the actuator, it is difficult to embed the reinforced fiber in the rubber structure. In this study, we aim at development of a fiber less FMA realizing quite large motion, which can be said curling motion, and a soft hand using the actuators. We design the actuator without fiber using nonlinear FEM (Finite Element Method) and derived efficient shape. The actuator is fabricated through micro rubber casting process including micro machining process for molds, micro vacuum rubber molding process and rubber bonding process with surface improvement by excimer light. Basic driving experiments of the actuator showed that it realized curling motion which agreed well with FEM results. And the actuator could grasp a fish egg without breaking. Additionally, we made a soft hand consisting of three curling actuators. This hand also could be manufactured by simple casting process. The developed hand works opening and closing motions well.
