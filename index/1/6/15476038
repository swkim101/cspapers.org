This presentation will discuss the basics of design for testability. A short review of testing is given along with some reasons why one should test. The different techniques of design for testability are discussed in detail. These include techniques which can be applied to today's technologies and techniques which have been recently introduced and will soon appear in new designs. These techniques include the three main areas of Design for Testability, 1) Ad Hoc approaches; 2) Structured approaches; and, 3) Self Test/Built-in Test approaches.
