Mobile application markets currently serve as the main line of defense against malicious applications. While marketplace revocations have successfully removed the few overtly malicious applications installed on mobile devices, the anticipated coming flood of mobile malware mandates the need for mechanisms that can respond faster than manual intervention. In this paper, we propose an infrastructure that automatically identifies and responds to malicious mobile applications based on their network behavior. We design and implement a prototype, Airmid, that uses cooperation between in-network sensors and smart devices to identify the provenance of malicious traffic. We then develop sample malicious mobile applications exceeding the capabilities of malware recently discovered in the wild, demonstrate the ease with which they can evade current detection techniques, and then use Airmid to show a range of automated recovery responses ranging from on-device firewalling to application removal.
