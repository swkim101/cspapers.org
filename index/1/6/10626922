We present SoEs (Sword of Elements), an attachable augmented haptic device for enhancing gaming controller in the immersive first-person game. Generally, Player can easily receive visual and auditory feedback through head-mounted displays (HMD) and headphones from first-person perspective in virtual world. However, the tactile feedback is less than those feedbacks in immersive environment. Although gaming controller, i.e. VIVE or Oculus controller, can provide tactile feedback by some vibration sensors, the haptic feedback is more complicated and various, it includes kinesthesia and cutaneous feedback. Our key idea is to provide a low-cost approach to simulate the haptic feedback of player manipulation in the immersive environment such as striking while the iron is hot which the player could feel the heat and reaction force. Eventually, the game makers could utilize the attachable device into their games for providing haptic feedback.
