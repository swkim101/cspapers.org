Optical tweezers has become a powerful tool in automated cell transportation control and has been used in a variety of biological applications. The use of optical tweezers for cell surgery has great potential for various biomedical applications such as microinjection, organelle extraction and modification, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). In these cell surgical manipulation tasks, the cell of interest must be oriented properly such that the desired component, e.g., the polar-body or organelles, can be visualized by optical microscopy; thus cell rotation becomes a necessary procedure. Currently, cell rotational control can be carried out by laser tools that are usually handled by skilled people. The open-loop manual operation cannot be readily used for applications requiring precise and high throughput cell rotational control. This highlights the need of developing an automated controlled robot manipulator to rotate biological cells more accurately and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a cell surgery system that utilizes two optical traps, generated by robotically controlled holographic optical tweezers (HOT), to manipulate the cell for rotation, where the optical tweezers functions as special robot manipulators. Through dynamic modeling using T-matrix approach, the relationship between the applied torques and the spherical coordinates of the optical tweezers is characterized. A rotational controller is further developed to rotate the cell to the pre-desired orientation accurately. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
