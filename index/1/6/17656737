The Butler system is a set of programs running on Andrew workstations at CMU that give users access to idle workstations. Current Andrew users use the system over 300 times per day. This paper describes the implementation of the Butler system and tells of our experience in using it. In addition, it describes an application of the system known as gypsy servers, which allow network server programs to be run on idle workstations instead of using dedicated server machines.
