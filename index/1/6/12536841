Our research group recently discovered that human analysts, when asked to validate candidate traceability matrices, produce predictably imperfect results, in some cases less accurate than the starting candidate matrices. This discovery radically changes our understanding of how to design a fast, accurate and certifiable tracing process that can be implemented as part of software assurance activities. We present our vision for the new approach to achieving this goal. Further, we posit that human fallibility may impact other software engineering activities involving decision support tools.
