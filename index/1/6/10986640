INTRODUCTION Advances in computer graphics hardware have enabled the practical realization of real-time interactive 3D animation systems, which can be used to develop virtual 3D workspaces. Such systems have the potential to revolutionize computer user interfaces because virtual 3D workspaces can tap human experiences and skills of working in the real world. However, new interaction techniques are required to realize this potential. In particular, techniques for rapid and controlled movement are required. Virtual 3D workspaces will often be large and full of interesting details, which will require rapid movement to cover distances without losing work time and controlled movement to approach target details without collision. This video describes a viewpoint movement technique and a related object movement technique that use a logarithmic motion function when approaching an object of interest. Like the arrow of Zeno’s Paradox, the user’s viewpoint continues to fly closer to the point of interest, but never actually reaches it. Instead, the user sees the target open at a uniform rate, revealing ever finer detail. These techniques work with 2D input devices (e.g., mouse), and higher dimensional input devices (e.g., dataglove). By exploiting human perception and making motion target-oriented, these techniques transform a complex multiple-dimensional control problem into a simpler problem. The resulting movement techniques are easy to use and support both rapid and controlled movements.
