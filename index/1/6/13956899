Knowledge management approaches for weakly-structured, adhoc knowledge work processes need to be lightweight, i.e., they cannot rely on high upfront modeling efforts. This paper presents TaskNavigator, a novel prototype to support weakly-structured processes by integrating a standard task list application with a state-of-the-art document classification system. The resulting system allows for a task-oriented view on office workers' personal knowledge spaces in order to realize a proactive and contextsensitive information support during daily, knowledge-intensive tasks. Moreover, TaskNavigator supports process know-how reuse by proactively suggesting similar tasks or relevant process models, based on textual similarities. Finally, we report on a feasibility test and a case study that have been conducted in order to evaluate the system in the context of daily research task management and software requirements analysis.
