In this paper, we study multi-click queries - queries for which more than one click is performed by the same user within the same query session. Such queries may reflect a more complex information need, which leads the user to examine a variety of results. We present a comprehensive analysis that reveals unique characteristics of multi-click queries, in terms of their syntax, lexical domains, contextual properties, and returned search results page. We also show that a basic classifier for predicting multi-click queries can reach an accuracy of 75% over a balanced dataset. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of Web search tools.
