This paper describes a formal definition of the EFK+-+ conceptual model. This model provides an integrated description of all relevant static and behavior aspects of database applications within ERC+ objects. The latter are extended ERC+ types to object, identity. Behavior of ERC+ objects are designed with a temporal logic language. Additionally, we provide ERC+ with a tool for monitoring constraints associated to El%(‚Äù;+ objects. This is based on transitional graphs. The monitoring process allows tp help the designer to understand the effects of temporal constraints on ERC+ object manipulations, and to identify all possible constraint violations.
