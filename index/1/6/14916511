Caring for individuals with dementia living in long-term care environments requires the management of responsive behaviours (e.g., screaming, hitting, wandering), which affect 60-80% of residents with dementia. Responsive behaviours are commonly treated with antipsychotic medications, and they compromise well-being of residents as well as staff. Our multi-disciplinary team seeks to develop technological solutions to minimize agitated and aggressive behaviours by creating familiar and appropriate activities that allow residents with dementia opportunities to self-initiate (trigger), engage and interact with Ambient Activity Technologies (AATs) and Centivizers (reward-based learning). Once engaged, these technologies should provide the resident with individualized and stimulating experiences that are meaningful to the resident, facilitating the development of a calm and engaged state, thereby managing responsive behaviours (e.g., agitation and aggression) and improving quality of life. In this paper, we review the etiology of dementia and responsive behaviours to elucidate the rationale behind the design and development of AATs and Centivizers for individuals with dementia living in long-term care, using a person-centered technological approach. Our goal is to utilize technology to minimize caregiver burden and help to improve well-being related outcomes in residents, staff and family members.
