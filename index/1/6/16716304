Stochastic games are a generalization of MDPs to multiple agents, and can be used as a framework for investigating multiagent learning. Hu and Wellman (1998) recently proposed a multiagent Q-learning method for general-sumstochastic games. In addition to describing the algorithm, they provide a proof that the method will converge to a Nash equilibrium for the game under specified conditions. The convergence depends on a lemma stating that the iteration used by this method is a contraction mapping. Unfortunately the proof is incomplete. In this paper we present a counterexample and flaw to the lemmaâ€™s proof. We also introduce strengthened assumptions under which the lemma holds, and examine how this affects the classes of games to which the theoretical result can be applied.
