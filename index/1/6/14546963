POPS is a processor for a simple nondeterministic programming language, PSL. POPS accepts a problem stated in PSL and attempts to solve it by finding a successful execution of the PSL program, POPS operates by identifying elements of the input program with elements of the heuristic search paradigm, analyzing the input program to obtain information about the problem operators, and applying methods borrowed from GPS to solve the problem. In addition to the goal-directed methods based on GPS, POPS contains the methods developed by Fikes in his program REF-ARF.
