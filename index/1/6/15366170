In poker, players tend to play sub-optimally due to the uncertainty in the game. Payoffs can be maximized by exploiting these sub-optimal tendencies. One way of re- alizing this is to acquire the opponent strategy by recog- nizing the key patterns in its style of play. Existing stud- ies on opponent modeling in poker aim at predicting op- ponent's future actions or estimating opponent's hand. In this study, we propose a machine learning method for acquiring the opponent's behavior for the purpose of predicting opponent's future actions. We derived a num- ber of features to be used in modeling opponent's strat- egy. Then, an ensemble learning method is proposed for generalizing the model. The proposed approach is tested on a set of test scenarios and shown to be effective.
