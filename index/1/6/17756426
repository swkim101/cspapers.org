We present a solution to the problem of assigning to each directed tree <italic>T</italic> of size <italic>n</italic> a unique isomorphism invariant name for <italic>T</italic>, using only work space <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>). Hence, tree isomorphism is computable in logspace. As another consequence, we obtain the corollary that the set of logspace computable queries (<italic>Lspace</italic>) on trees is recursively enumerable. Our results extend easily to undirected trees and even forests.
