We present an ownership-based multiprocessor cache consistency protocol, designed for implementation by a single chip VLSI cache controller. The protocol and its VLSI realization are described in some data, to emphasize the important implementation issues, in particular, the controller critical sections and the inter- and intra-cache interlocks needed to maintain cache consistency. The design has been carried through to layout in a P-Well CMOS technology.
