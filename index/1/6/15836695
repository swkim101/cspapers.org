This paper presents a definition of convexity useful for describing local optimality in configuration spaces, proves that finding convex regions is relatively easy, and presents an algorithm for approximating the free configuration space using a set of such convex regions. The paper examines simple but interesting systems: serial planar arms with revolute joints, and a Reeds-Shepp car. The paper experimentally explores an approach for finding good (although not necessarily optimal) trajectories using the derived data structure.
