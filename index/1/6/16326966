This paper describes the use of a particu1a.r object oriented technique, multiple inheritance, and its impact in the construction of generic user interface tools (in C++). Generic user interface tools are defined as user interface components with a high degree of independence from the particular implementation environment. The paper argues that the use of multiple inheritance in the design and implementation of these tools provides a.dditional flexibility. The paper goes further in discussing why the use of single inherita.nce in this particular context was rejected and wha,t were the major negative implications of that approa.ch.
