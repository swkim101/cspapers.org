Networking and data communication have become more prominent in the information technology arena over the past ten years. Graduates of Information Systems or Computer Science programs should possess some competence in this computing sub-discipline. However, many universities opt to exploit resources and find synergy between the Computer Science and Information Systems curricula where possible. We present an approach to teaching the subject that gives students a rich set of laboratory experiments and yet is appropriate for both the Information Systems and Computer Science curricula. Our approach gives students access to the implementation detail of data communication protocols in an NT/Visual Basic programming environment that is friendly to Information Systems.
