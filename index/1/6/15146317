This paper summarizes the results of an initial investigation of a language and underlying technology for the design of Data Processing System Performance Requirements. The initial research results indicate that a technology based on Petri nets, formal logic, and simulation can be used to describe and analyze some important aspects of data processing performance requirements. These initial language and technology concepts were successfully applied to fully describe a benchmark problem. Future research will focus on the implementation and evaluation of automated verification and analysis procedures based on the technology.
