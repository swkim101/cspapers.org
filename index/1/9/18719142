Group events are defined as regular events recognized by partial group automata. Canonical forms are introduced for the class of regular expressions denoting group events. Algorithms are presented to find a canonical form from a recognizing automaton, to find a recognizing automaton from a canonical form, and to find a canonical form from a regular expression denoting a simple group event. Furthermore an algorithm is presented that decides whether or not two canonical forms denote the same event.
