This paper describes a graphical interface for application programs. The interface is based on the notion of a control panel. A control panel contains a browsable list of an application's parameters and a set of functions to control the application's execution. A variety of graphical knobs and gauges may be associated with any or all of the parameters to permit fine-grain execution control, including animation of an application's output. The control panel interface is integrated into the framework of an interactive programming environment for graphics and image processing applications. This integration is an important feature of the overall interface design.
