Recently, several researchers have proposed schemes for low-cost, low-power error detection in the processor core. In this work, we demonstrate that one particular scheme, an enhanced implementation of the Argus framework called Argus-2, is a viable option for industry adoption. Using an FPGA prototype, we experimentally evaluate Argus-2's ability to detect errors due to (a) all possible single stuck-at faults in a given core and (b) a statistically significant number of double stuck-at faults, including pairs of faults that are randomly located and pairs that are spatially correlated on the chip.
