Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless communication technology using 13.56 MHz to support 2-way communications between two devices within ~10 cm. Such a short communication range may be considered as a shortcoming, but at the same time, this enables a secure data transfer within the connectivity region when compared to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Wi-Fi. Accordingly, NFC can be optionally utilized when secure data are transmitted in various services and applications focusing on ID validation. This demo presents a proof-of-concept for an alternative packet transmission method for achieving secure data exchange based on IP-over-NFC technology. For realizing this, there are a number of technical challenges. Utmost, the current NFC Linux kernel driver requires updates for supporting network-layer functionalities. Using such implementations, this demo demonstrates the procedures of transmitting secure data using NFC, while normal packet transmissions occur over WiFi simultaneously.
