Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied to camera relocalization, which is to infer the pose of the camera given a single monocular image. However, there are still many open problems for camera relocalization with CNNs. We delve into the CNNs for camera relocalization. First, a variant of Euler angles named Euler6 is proposed to represent orientation. Then a data augmentation method named pose synthesis is designed to reduce spsarsity of poses in the whole pose space to cope with overfitting in training. Third, a multi-task CNN named BranchNet is proposed to deal with the complex coupling of orientation and translation. The network consists of several shared convolutional layers and splits into two branches which predict orientation and translation, respectively. Experiments on the 7Scenes dataset show that incorporating these techniques one by one into an existing model PoseNet always leads to better results. Together these techniques reduce the orientation error by 15.9% and the translation error by 38.3% compared to the state-of-the-art model Bayesian PoseNet. We implement BranchNet on an Intel NUC mobile platform and reach a speed of 43 fps, which meets the real-time requirement of many robotic applications.
