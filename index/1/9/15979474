Cornell, like most other large schools, has been struggling with the problem of introductory programming instruction for years. The problem is not yet solved but in the last few years we have done some experimenting and seem to have made some progress. The situation seems worth reporting so that others can perhaps benefit from what has been successful and avoid what has not.
 The major problems seem to be volume and variety. Pedagogical techniques that are obviously effective with small classes are sometimes impractical when faced with more than a thousand students per year. This may be largely a question of economics, since one could presumably allocate enough resources to the task to have small classes, but this is just not realistic at Cornell and the real question becomes one of finding practical large-scale techniques. For example, the central computing facility at Cornell (a 360/65 under OS/HASP) cannot support a sufficient number of interactive terminals to make that mode of instruction practical.
 Hence our solution must operate within the constraint of a conventional non-inter-active computer service.
