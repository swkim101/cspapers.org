Formal methods and requirements analysis are techniques for developing complex systems. However, there is little research on reconciling the requirements phase with the formal specification phase. To bridge this gap, we propose a formal specification generator based on model transformation techniques. This tool transforms KAOS models (requirements specifications) into VDM++ formal specifications. Our generator enables consistent and effective software development activities.
