This artificial intelligence project introduces students to an alternative to the traditional “crisp” paradigm of computer science through the use of fuzzy sets and linguistic variables for modeling natural language expressions. A fuzzy/linguistic meta-language is built on Prolog. This helps them to explore some of the problems encountered in the human/computer interface of bridging the fuzzy, imprecise symbolic world of natural language and the computer's crisp, numeric world.
