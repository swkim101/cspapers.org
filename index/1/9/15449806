We examine the ability of radial basis functions (RBFs) to generalize. We compare the performance of several types of RBFs. We use the inverse dynamics of an idealized two-joint arm as a test case. We find that without a proper choice of a norm for the inputs, RBFs have poor generalization properties. A simple global scaling of the input variables greatly improves performance. We suggest some efficient methods to approximate this distance metric.
