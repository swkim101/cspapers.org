This paper presents a performance study of the state-of-the-art caching proxy called Squid. We instrumented Squid to measure per request network and disk activities and conducted a series of experiments on large Web caches. We have discovered many interesting and consistent patterns across a wide variety of environments. Our data and analysis are essential for understanding, modeling, benchmarking, and tuning performance of a proxy server.
