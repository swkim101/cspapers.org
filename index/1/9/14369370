We present Trio2Promela, a tool for model checking metric temporal logic specifications written in the TRIO language. Our approach is based on the translation of formulae into Promela programs for the model checker Spin, guided by equivalence between temporal logic and alternating Bilchi automata. Trio2Promela may be used also to check satisfiability of temporal logic specifications (a distinguishing difference with other model checking tools).
