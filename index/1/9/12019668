This paper discusses the performance, complexity and system-integration considerations that shaped the System/370 Vector Architecture [1, 9]. The architecture is intended for compatible systems providing a range of price and performance. The paper reviews the reasons for choosing a register-oriented architecture with compound instructions over storage-to-storage operations and vector-instruction chaining. Then it discusses the role of cache in stride-N storage accessing, and describes some new facilities introduced for control-program purposes.
