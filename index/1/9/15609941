We characterize the power of two-prover one-round (<italic>MIP</italic>(2,1)) proof systems, showing that <italic>MIP</italic>(2,1)=<italic>NEXPTIME</italic>. However, the following intriguing question remains open: Does parallel repetition decrease the error probability of <italic>MIP</italic>(2,1) proof systems?.
We use techniques based on quadratic programming to study this problem, and prove the parallel repetition conjecture in some special cases. Interestingly, our work leads to a general polynomial time heuristic for any <italic>NP</italic>-problem. We prove the effectiveness of this heuristic for several problems, such as computing the chromatic number of perfect graphs.
