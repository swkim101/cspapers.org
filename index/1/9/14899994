In this paper, we study the evaluation of skyline queries with partially-ordered attributes. Because such attributes lack a total ordering, traditional index-based evaluation algorithms (e.g., NN and BBS) that are designed for totally-ordered attributes can no longer prune the space as effectively. Our solution is to transform each partially-ordered attribute into a two-integer domain that allows us to exploit index-based algorithms to compute skyline queries on the transformed space. Based on this framework, we propose three novel algorithms: BBS+ is a straightforward adaptation of BBS using the framework, and SDC (Stratification by Dominance Classification) and SDC+ are optimized to handle false positives and support progressive evaluation. Both SDC and SDC+ exploit a dominance relationship to organize the data into strata. While SDC generates its strata at run time, SDC+ partitions the data into strata offline. We also design two dominance classification strategies (MinPC and MaxPC) to further optimize the performance of SDC and SDC+. We implemented the proposed schemes and evaluated their efficiency. Our results show that our proposed techniques outperform existing approaches by a wide margin, with SDC+-MinPC giving the best performance in terms of both response time as well as progressiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to address the problem of skyline query evaluation involving partially-ordered attribute domains.
