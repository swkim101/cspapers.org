Efficient realizations often exploit database technology and rewrite a given query to an equivalent SQL or Datalog query over a database associated with the ontology. This approach has been intensively studied for conjunctive query answering in the DL-Lite and EL families, but is much less explored for more expressive DLs and queries. We present a rewriting-based algorithm for conjunctive query answering over Horn-SHIQ ontologies, possibly extended with recursive rules under limited recursion as in DL+log. This setting not only subsumes both DL-Lite and EL, but also yields an algorithm for answering (limited) recursive queries over Horn-SHIQ ontologies (an undecidable problem for full recursive queries). A prototype implementation shows its potential for applications, as experiments exhibit efficient query answering over full Horn-SHIQ ontologies and benign downscaling to DL-Lite, where it is competitive with comparable state of the art systems.
