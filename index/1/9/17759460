In most database systems, a query embedded in a program written in a conventional programming language is optimized when the program is compiled. The query optimizer must make assumptions about the values of the program variables that appear as constants in the query, the resources that can be committed to query evaluation, and the data in the database. The optimality of the resulting query evaluation plan depends on the validity of these assumptions. If a query evaluation plan is used repeatedly over an extended period of time, it is important to determine when reoptimization is necessary. Our work aims at developing criteria when reoptimization is required, how these criteria can be implemented efficiently, and how reoptimization can be avoided by using a new technique called dynamic query evaluation plans. We experimentally demonstrate the need for dynamic plans and outline modifications to the EXODUS optimizer generator required for creating dynamic query evaluation plans.
