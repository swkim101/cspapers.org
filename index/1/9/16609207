Optical manipulation of biological cells has recently attracted increasing attention in bioscience and nanotechnology, where optical tweezers are used as end-effectors to manipulate the cells with high precision and flexibility. Analysis of the dynamics of the optically trapped cells plays a critical role in many cell manipulation tasks such as the automatic cell transportation and force transducer. This paper presents a novel approach to calibrating the cell dynamics with the adaptive control technology. According to different measurements, two adaptive tracking controllers are designed, based on which the estimated parameters of the cell trapping dynamics (i.e., the rate of viscous coefficient and trapping stiffness) can automatically converge to the true values. Stability of the adaptive controllers and convergence of the estimated parameters are analyzed by using Lyapunov approach. Simulations and experiments of manipulating yeast cells are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
