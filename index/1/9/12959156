This work proposes and evaluates a probabilistic cross-lingual retrieval system. The system uses a generative model to estimate the probability that a document in one language is relevant, given a query in another language. An important component of the model is translation probabilities from terms in documents to terms in a query. Our approach is evaluated when 1) the only resource is a manually generated bilingual word list, 2) the only resource is a parallel corpus, and 3) both resources are combined in a mixture model. The combined resources produce about 90% of monolingual performance in retrieving Chinese documents. For Spanish the system achieves 85% of monolingual performance using only a pseudo-parallel Spanish-English corpus. Retrieval results are comparable with those of the structural query translation technique (Pirkola, 1998) when bilingual lexicons are used for query translation. When parallel texts in addition to conventional lexicons are used, it achieves better retrieval results but requires more computation than the structural query translation technique. It also produces slightly better results than using a machine translation system for CLIR, but the improvement over the MT system is not significant.
