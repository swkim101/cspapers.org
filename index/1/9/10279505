We will demonstrate a robot for data center energy management, in action, on a simulated data center floor. We shall highlight the robot's navigation, tile and obstacle classification, event scheduling and preemption capabilities, along with its ability to discover charging docks, and successfully dock with extreme precision. We shall also show simulations on real data center layouts evincing navigational efficiency gains obtained by our latest heuristic enhancements.
