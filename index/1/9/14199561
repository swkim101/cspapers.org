Automatic Document Classification (ADC) is the basis of many important applications such as spam filtering and content organization. Naive Bayes (NB) approaches are a widely used classification paradigm, due to their simplicity, efficiency, absence of parameters and effectiveness. However, they do not present competitive effectiveness when compared to other modern statistical learning methods, such as SVMs. This is related to some characteristics of real document collections, such as class imbalance, feature sparseness and strong relationships among attributes. In this paper, we investigate whether the relaxation of the NB feature independence assumption (aka, Semi-NB approaches) can improve its effectiveness in large text collections. We propose four new Lazy Semi-NB strategies that exploit different ideas for alleviating the NB independence assumption. By being lazy, our solutions focus only on the most important features to classify a given test document, overcoming some Semi-NB issues when applied to ADC such as bias towards larger classes and overfitting and/or lack of generalization of the models. We demonstrate that our Lazy Semi-NB proposals can produce superior effectiveness when compared to state-of-the-art ADC classifiers such as SVM and KNN. Moreover, to overcome some efficiency issues of combining Semi-NB and lazy strategies, we take advantage of current manycore GPU architectures and present a massively parallelized version of the Semi-NB approaches. Our experimental results show that speedups of up to 63.36 times can be obtained when compared to serial solutions, making our proposals very practical in real-situations.
