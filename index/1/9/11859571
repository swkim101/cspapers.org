This paper reports on two successful curricular innovations made in the first-year PL/I programming course at Rutgers. Simple internal procedures are introduced at an early point, and used extensively thereafter; and fairly long, large programming projects are undertaken. The combined effect significantly reinforces the presentation of structured programming methodology, as well as enhancing the general educational effectiveness of the course.
