We study arithmetic proof systems P<sub>c</sub>(F) and P<sub>f</sub>(F) operating with arithmetic circuits and arithmetic formulas, respectively, that prove polynomial identities over a field F. We establish a series of structural theorems about these proof systems, the main one stating that P<sub>c</sub>(F) proofs can be balanced: if a polynomial identity of syntactic degree d and depth k has a P<sub>c</sub>(F) proof of size s, then it also has a P<sub>c</sub>(F) proof of size poly(s,d) and depth O(k+log<sup>2</sup> d + log d• log s). As a corollary, we obtain a quasipolynomial simulation of P<sub>c</sub>(F) by P<sub>f</sub>(F), for identities of a polynomial syntactic degree. Using these results we obtain the following: consider the identities: det(XY) = det(X)•det(Y) and det(Z)= z<sub>11</sub> ••• z<sub>nn</sub>, where X,Y and Z are n x n square matrices and Z is a triangular matrix with z<sub>11</sub>,..., z<sub>nn</sub> on the diagonal (and det is the determinant polynomial). Then we can construct a polynomial-size arithmetic circuit det such that the above identities have P<sub>c</sub>(F) proofs of polynomial-size and O(log<sup>2</sup>n) depth. Moreover, there exists an arithmetic formula det of size n<sup>O(log n)</sup> such that the above identities have P<sub>f</sub>(F) proofs of size n<sup>O(log n)</sup>.
 This yields a solution to a basic open problem in propositional proof complexity, namely, whether there are polynomial-size NC<sup>2</sup>-Frege proofs for the determinant identities and the <i>hard matrix identities</i>, as considered, e.g. in Soltys and Cook (2004) (cf., Beame and Pitassi (1998). We show that matrix identities like AB=I -> BA=I (for matrices over the two element field) as well as basic properties of the determinant have polynomial-size NC<sup>2</sup>-Frege proofs, and quasipolynomial-size Frege proofs.
