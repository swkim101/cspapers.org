CANLOGS is a logic gate simulator program originally written for use in computer organization courses. While maintaining its role as an exploration tool for behavior of combinational and sequential circuits, CANLOGS is also used to teach concepts in programming languages and software engineering. CANLOGS has a command-line interface and a circuit specification language that has features of block structured programming languages. By studying this interface and its implementation, students get a taste of language and compiler design.
