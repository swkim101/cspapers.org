We extend Zhao and Ng's (2007) Chinese anaphoric zero pronoun resolver by (1) using a richer set of features and (2) exploiting the coreference links between zero pronouns during resolution. Results on OntoNotes show that our approach significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art anaphoric zero pronoun resolvers. To our knowledge, this is the first work to report results obtained by an end-toend Chinese zero pronoun resolver.
