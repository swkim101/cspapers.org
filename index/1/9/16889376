Although planning for the tasks a household robot has to perform appears to be easy, there exists the problem that the robot is usually uncertain about the state of the household when starting to plan. For example, when getting the order of tidying up the kitchen, the robot does not know what objects it will have to put away and whether there are actually any objects that need to be put away. Furthermore, while sensing operations can provide moreinformation about the environment, things can go wrong when executingan action. In this paper, we try to identify conditions under which classical planning can be used in a replanning loop in order to solve the planning problem in nondeterministic partially observable open domains. In particular, we will define completeness and soundness of replanning with respect to nondeterministic planning and we will identify a PSPACE-checkable condition that guarantees soundness.
