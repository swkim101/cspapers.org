Multimedia service is a fundamental requirement in the Wireless Broadband Access (WBA) network. It is a challenge for service operators to provide the low-latency applications, such as voice service, due to the limited wireless bandwidth resource. Although it has been carried out in wireless mobile 3G/3.5G networks, the user experience of Internet surfing is not satisfied. The mobile WiMAX 4G technology, based on the IEEE 802.16eâ€“2005 specification with improved spectral efficiency and proposed QoS mechanism, is more suitable to provide better user-experiencing multimedia services. In order to provide the QoS assured services in the all IP and WiMAX network, the end-to-end QoS provisioning shall be carefully designed. In this paper, we propose the multiple service flows for VoIP and Internet access by specifying QoS classification rules and associating the QoS to the proper DSCP value in the IP network. We demonstrate that the bandwidth or the quality of VoIP service is not affected, while users are simultaneously surfing the Internet. The performance of the proposed service flows is measured in the radio interface of the client terminal and the serving base station in commercial WiMAX network. It shows that VoIP service is feasible in WiMAX network.
