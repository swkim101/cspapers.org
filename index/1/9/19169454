In this paper, we study extractive topic-oriented Twitter summarization as a solution to address this problem. Traditional summarization methods only consider text information, which is insufficient in social media situation. Existing Twitter summarization techniques rarely explore relations between tweets explicitly, ignoring that information can spread along the social network. Inspired by social theories that expression consistence and expression contagion are observed in social network, we propose a novel approach for Twitter summarization in short and noisy situation by integrating Social Network and Sparse Reconstruction (SNSR). We explore whether social relations can help Twitter summarization, modeling relations between tweets described as the social regularization and integrating it into the group sparse optimization framework. It conducts a sparse reconstruction process by selecting tweets that can best reconstruct the original tweets in a specific topic, with considering coverage and sparsity. We simultaneously design the diversity regularization to remove redundancy. In particular, we present a mathematical optimization formulation and develop an efficient algorithm to solve it. Due to the lack of public corpus, we construct the gold standard twitter summary datasets for 12 different topics. Experimental results on this datasets show the effectiveness of our framework for handling the large scale short and noisy messages in social media.
