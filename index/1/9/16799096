This paper presents a generalized model of tightly-coupled multiprocessor systems which is then simplified to form a stochastic model for the study of interference. Analysis is performed on the resource contention which is characteristic of such systems in order to find a measure of system performance. After reviewing the problem of memory interference, the analysis is extended to contention in other individual resources, then combined to form a model for the interacting effects of contention in systems where processors contend for several shared resources.
