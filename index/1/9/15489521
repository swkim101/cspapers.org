We describe a nonparametric topic model for labeled data. The model uses a mixture of random measures (MRM) as a base distribution of the Dirichlet process (DP) of the HDP framework, so we call it the DP-MRM. To model labeled data, we define a DP distributed random measure for each label, and the resulting model generates an unbounded number of topics for each label. We apply DP-MRM on single-labeled and multi-labeled corpora of documents and compare the performance on label prediction with MedLDA, LDA-SVM, and Labeled-LDA. We further enhance the model by incorporating ddCRP and modeling multi-labeled images for image segmentation and object labeling, comparing the performance with nCuts and rddCRP.
