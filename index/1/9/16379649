Pattern Based GUI Testing (PBGT) is a new methodology that aims at systematizing and automating the GUI testing process. It is supported by a Tool (PBGT Tool) which provides an integrated modeling and testing environment that supports the crafting of test models based on UI Test Patterns, using a GUI modeling DSL called PARADIGM. The tool is freely available as an Eclipse plugin, developed on top of the Eclipse Modeling Framework. This paper presents PBGT Tool, which has been successfully used in several projects, and more recently at industry level.
