Controlling mobile robots with complex articulated parts and hence many degrees of freedom generates high cognitive load on the operator, especially under demanding conditions such as in Urban Search & Rescue missions. We propose a solution based on reinforcement learning in order to accommodate the robot morphology automatically to the terrain and the obstacles it traverses. In this paper, we concentrate on the crucial issue of predicting rewards from incomplete or missing data. For this purpose we exploit the Gaussian processes as a predictor combined with decision trees. We demonstrate our achievements in a series of experiments on real data.
