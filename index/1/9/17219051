Human mobility is one of the key topics to be considered in the networks of the future, both by industrial and research communities that are already focused on multidisciplinary applications and user-centric systems. If the rapid proliferation of networks and high-tech miniature sensors makes this reality possible, the ever-growing complexity of the metrics and parameters governing such systems raises serious issues in terms of privacy, security and computing capability. In this demonstration, we show a new system, able to estimate a user's mobility profile based on anonymized and lightweight smartphone data. In particular, this system is composed of (1) a web analytics platform, able to analyze multimodal sensing traces and improve our understanding of complex mobility patterns, and (2) a smartphone application, able to show a user's profile generated locally in the form of a spider graph. In particular, this application uses anonymized and privacy-friendly data and methods, obtained thanks to the combination of Wi-Fi traces, activity detection and graph theory, made available independent of any personal information. A video showing the different interfaces to be presented is available online.
