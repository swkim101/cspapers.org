Heterogeneous types of gene expressions may provide a better insight into the biological role of gene interaction with the environment, disease development and drug effect at the molecular level. In this paper for both exploring and prediction purposes a Time Lagged Recurrent Neural Network with trajectory learning is proposed for identifying and classifying the gene functional patterns from the heterogeneous nonlinear time series microarray experiments. The proposed procedures identify gene functional patterns from the dynamics of a state-trajectory learned in the heterogeneous time series and the gradient information over time. Also, the trajectory learning with Back-propagation through time algorithm can recognize gene expression patterns vary over time. This may reveal much more information about the regulatory network underlying gene expressions. The analyzed data were extracted from spotted DNA microarrays in the budding yeast expression measurements, produced by Eisen et al. The gene matrix contained 79 experiments over a variety of heterogeneous experiment conditions. The number of recognized gene patterns in our study ranged from two to ten and were divided into three cases. Optimal network architectures with different memory structures were selected based on Akaike and Bayesian information statistical criteria using two-way factorial design. The optimal model performance was compared to other popular gene classification algorithms such as Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and Self-Organized Map. The reliability of the performance was verified with multiple iterated runs.
