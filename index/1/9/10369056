We study what happens when the same wireless sensor network (WSN) is "immersed" in different outdoor environments, namely, two types of forests and an open field. Qualitative answers can be derived from existing results. Here, we aim to quantify the extent of changes, both at the physical and application layer, based on the combined effect of environmental parameters over daily and seasonal time-scales.
