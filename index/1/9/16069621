In this supplement, we provide additional context for ABCD-L and place our contributions in perspective, relative to the existing body of literature on topics like AMS modelling/verification, Boolean and hybrid systems frameworks, etc. Further, we demonstrate that ABCD-L can be applied in conjunction with Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques, to Booleanize large LTI systems whose direct eigendecomposition may be computationally infeasible. For example, we combine ABCD-L with Arnoldi iteration based MOR to efficiently produce accurate Boolean models of a real-world power grid network (with 25849 nodes) obtained from a benchmark set made available by IBM. Due to space constraints, we were unable to include such material within our main manuscript.
