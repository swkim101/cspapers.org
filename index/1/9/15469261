With the increasing number of information retrieval systems and databases available and the increasing demand of end users to utilize the systems, a need exists for improved interfaces and improved training mechanisms. This paper reports on a project to develop an integrated online instruction and assistance system to be used as a “front end” to the U.S. Department of Energy's RECON retrieval system. The conceptual framework for the interface design is based on individual characteristics of its current and prospective users, predominantly scientists conducting energy research. We are building a prototype based on information gained from interviews with scientists using the system (either directly or through a search intermediary) and interviews with search intermediaries. The paper reports on research in progress, including the results of the interviews and the preliminary design of the interface. The conference presentation will include a fuller description of the interface than can be specified here.
