The Programmer's Workbench boasts a broad set of highly useful features aimed at the application program developer. It claims to be a “human-end” computer providing tools and services to ease the load on the application system designer, programmer, documenter, tester, and delivery personnel. This paper shows the benefits of using the PWB tools, individually and in combination. Through specific examples drawn from the history of a software project, evidence is given that the use of the Programmer's Workbench can be a major contributing factor in the successful development of a software project.
