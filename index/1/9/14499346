Displaying sponsored ads alongside the search results is a key monetization strategy for search engine companies. Since users are more likely to click ads that are relevant to their query, it is crucial for search engine to deliver the right ads for the query and the order in which they are displayed. There are several works investigating on how to learn a ranking function to maximize the number of ad clicks. In this paper, we address a new revenue optimization problem and aim to answer the question: how to construct a ranking model that can deliver high quality ads to the user as well as maximize search engine revenue? We introduce two novel methods from di fferent machine learning perspectives, and both of them take the revenue component into careful considerations. The algorithms are built upon the click-through log data with real ad clicks and impressions. The extensively experimental results verify the proposed algorithm that can produce more revenue than other methods as well as avoid losing relevance accuracy. To provide deep insight into the importance of each feature to search engine revenue, we extract twelve basic features from four categories. The experimental study provides a feature ranking list according to the revenue benefit of each feature.
