Integration of Near Field Communication (NFC) sensors into mobile devices has enabled their use for authentication. The ubiquitous nature of authentication using mobile devices comes though with increased security considerations. In addition to the risk of being stolen, mobile devices are increasingly susceptible to different types of software attacks. User-provided passwords such as Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) are often employed to ameliorate these limitations. The use of passwords though, has its own vulnerabilities that are mainly caused by the passwords' static nature and low entropy. To eliminate the security threats caused by untrusted devices and static passwords, we propose the development of new types of biometric authentication, based on macroscopic human behavior.
