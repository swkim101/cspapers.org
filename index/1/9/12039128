Covering problems occur at several steps during logic synthesis including two-level minimization and DAG covering. This paper presents a better lower bound computation algorithm and two new pruning techniques that significantly improve the efficiency of covering problem solvers. We show that these techniques reduce by up to three orders of magnitude the time required to solve covering problems exactly.
