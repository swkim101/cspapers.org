This paper describes the design and implementation of a constraint satisfaction system that uses delayed evaluation techniques to provide greater representational power and to avoid unnecessary computation. The architecture used is a uniform model of computation, where each constraint contributes its local information to provide a global solution. We demonstrate the utility of the system by formulating a real-world scheduling problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP).
