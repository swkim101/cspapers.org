The handling of exceptions in multiclass problems is a tricky issue in inductive logic programming (ILP). In this paper we propose a new formalization of the ILP problem which accounts for default reasoning, and is encoded with first-order possibilistic logic. We show that this formalization allows us to handle rules with exceptions, and to prevent an example to be classified in more than one class. The possibilistic logic view of ILP problem, can be easily handled at the algorithmic level as an optimization problem.
