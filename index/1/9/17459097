DP is a library of process management and communication tools for writing portable, reliable distributed applications. It provides support for a flexible set of message operations as well as process creation and management. It has been successfully used in developing distributed Monte Carlo, disjunctive programming and integer goal programming codes.It differs from PVM and similar libraries in its support for lightweight, unreliable messages, as well as asynchronous delivery of interrupt-generating messages. In addition, DP supports the development of long-running distributed applications tolerant to the failure or loss of a subset of its processors.
