The Space Shuttle Orbiter manned reusable craft is being developed by NASA for applications in the 1980' and beyond. Navigation, guidance flight control, systems management and control, and payload checkout are but a few of the functions of the Orbiter which are being mechanized in the avionics computer complex.The development of the system is traced through three distinct architectures to the current system. Factors affecting the architecture and system development are discussed. A system figure of merit for evaluating competing systems architecture is developed.
