In relevance feedback, first-round search results are used to boost second-round search results. Two forms have been traditionally considered: exhaustively labelled feedback, where all first-round results to depth k are annotated for relevance by the user; and blind feedback, where the top-k results are all assumed to be relevant. In this paper, we consider an intermediate, semi-supervised scheme, in which only a subset of results is selected for annotation, and then their labels are propagated to their nearest neighbours. Specifically, we use clustering to determine the nearest-neighbour groups, and seed selection to choose documents for annotation. We find that the effectiveness of this method is indistinguishable from the exhaustive relevance feedback, and is significantly higher than both blind feedback and the use of the annotated subset alone. We show that this approach works well in environments in which some but limited amounts of human feedback are available, such as early case assessment in e-discovery.
