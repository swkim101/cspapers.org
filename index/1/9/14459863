A new theory of information flow is presented. This theory is used to determine the information flows between the users of a system. Information flows when variety in the actions of a source user can be conveyed to a destination user. This theory is developed around Hoare'a calculus for communicating sequential processes. Information flows due to concurrency, non-determinism and input/output can be examined within the framework of this calculus.
