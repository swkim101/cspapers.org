In this paper, based on a novel shape-similarity-based retrieval method, we propose an interactive partial-distance-map (PDM)- based high-dimensional indexing scheme to speed up the retrieval performance of the large Chinese calligraphic character databases. Specifically, we use the approximate minimal bounding hyper- sphere of query character to search the PDM and utilize the users' relevance feedback to refine the search process. We conduct comprehensive experiments to testify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.
