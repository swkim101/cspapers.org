In this paper, a data structure is presented for incremental planarity testing. At any moment, the data structure can answer the following type of query: given two nodes in the graph, can an edge be inserted between these nodes such that planarity is preserved, while edges (preserving planarity) are inserted from time to time. Starting from an " empty " graph of n nodes, the data structure runs in O (n + rn. a(m, n)) time, where m is the total number of queries and edge insertions. The data structure allows for insertions of nodes also (in the same time bounds, taking n as the final number of nodes), As a co-result, the problem of finding a maximal planar subgraph of a given (static) graph can be solved in O(n + e.a(e, n)) time, where e is the number of edges in the graph.
