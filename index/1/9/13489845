Both Sriram and I started at the University of Wisconsin in the Fall of 1985; Sriram as a graduate student and I as an Assistant Professor. At that time, there was a lot of processor-related activity going on at Wisconsin: the Smith and Pleszkun paper on implementing precise interrupts [5] had just been published, and the PIPE project [3] was in full swing. I was looking for research topics to pursue. In graduate school, the papers that I had found the most fascinating were the IBM 360/91 papers. Even though I had written a Ph.D thesis about improving list-processing using associative structures, given the level of interest at Wisconsin in processor-related issues, it was natural to start working in that area.
