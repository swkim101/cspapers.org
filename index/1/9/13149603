We describe an Internet-based approach for teaching important concepts in a Junior-Senior level course on the design and analysis of data structures and algorithms (traditionally called CS7 or DS&amp;A). The main idea of this educational paradigm is twofold. First, it provides fresh motivation for fundamental algorithms and data structures that are finding new applications in the context of the Internet. Second, it provides a source for introducing new algorithms and data structures that are derived from specific Internet applications. In this paper, we suggest some key pedagogical and curriculum updates that can be made to the classic CS7/DS&amp;A course to turn it into a course on Internet Algorithmics. We believe that such a course will stimulate new interest and excitement in material that is perceived by some students to be stale, boring, and purely theoretical. We argue that the foundational topics from CS7/DS&amp;A should remain even when it is taught in an Internet-centric manner. This, of course, should come as no surprise to the seasoned computer scientist, who understands the value of algorithmic thinking.
