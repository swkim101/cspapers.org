Here, we introduce a machine learningbased approach that allows us to identify light verb constructions (LVCs) in Hungarian and English free texts. We also present the results of our experiments on the SzegedParalellFX English‚ÄêHungarian parallel corpus where LVCs were manually annotated in both languages. With our approach, we were able to contrast the performance of our method and define language-specific features for these typologically different languages. Our presented method proved to be sufficiently robust as it achieved approximately the same scores on the two typologically different languages.
