We propose to introduce an intrinsic motivation module that will select a reward function for the agent to learn to achieve. We will use a Universal Value Function Approximator, that takes as input both the state and the parameters of this reward function as the goal to predict the value function (or action-value function) to generalize across these goals. This module will be trained to generate goals such that the agent's learning is maximized. Thus, this is also a method for automatic curriculum learning.
