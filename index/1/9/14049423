We employed a white-noise velocity signal to study the dynamics of the response of single neurons in the cortical area MT to visual motion. Responses were quantified using reverse correlation, optimal linear reconstruction filters, and reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR and lower bound estimates of information rate were lower than we expected. Ninety percent of the information was transmitted below 18 Hz, and the highest lower bound on bit rate was 12 bits/s. A simulated opponent motion energy subunit with Poisson spike statistics was able to out-perform the MT neurons. The temporal integration window, measured from the reverse correlation half-width, ranged from 30-90 ms. The window was narrower when a stimulus moved faster, but did not change when temporal frequency was held constant.
