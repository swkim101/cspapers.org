In this paper, we study several issues involved in combinatorial auction across independent markets for individual goods. (i) We establish the complexity for the existence of Walrasian equilibrium of combinatorial auction. (ii) We consider incentive compatible mechanism that prices individual goods of single-minded auction, and improving the previous work on pricing bundles [7].
