Evaluating students in group projects is difficult. Both the end products of the group and the individual contributions of each group member must be evaluated in a fair manner. This paper will describe a set of evaluation procedures for a systems development group project. The procedures have three main features. First, the procedures structure the evaluation by partitioning the project grading into small components. Second the procedures incorporate the use of grading sheets for the group documentation at each project milestone. Third, the procedures provide for an interaction between the performance of the group and the performance of individual students in determining each individual's project grade. These procedures provide periodic feedback, allow students to clearly see how the project evaluation will be done, and encourage some objectivity and consistency in the grading process.
