XML technologies are quickly becoming ubiquitous within all aspects of computer and information sciences. Both industry and academics have accepted the XML standards and the large number of tools that support manipulation, transformation, querying, and storage of XML objects. Thus, tools and representations based on XML are very attractive with respect to adoption. This paper describes the experiences of the authors in the development and application of srcML, a XML application to support explicit markup of syntactic information within source code. Additionally, XML technologies are leveraged along with srcML to support various program analysis, fact extraction, and reverse engineering tasks. A short description of these tools is given along with the motivation behind using an adoption centric XML approach.
