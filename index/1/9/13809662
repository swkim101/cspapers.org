In the last few years, the smart city concept resulted in the development and deployment of platforms for providing innovative services to improve sustainability and the living standards. These platforms integrate data collected from devices and citizen-generated data and thereafter employ big data analytics to create insights from the data. These platform enable the creation of context-aware Intelligent traffic management systems (ITMS), however the involvement of various actors at different stages hampers development. In this paper, we propose a framework to support sustainable traffic management system for providing better commute, safety and security during travel based on real-time information. The framework should help to integrate the activities performed by the various actors. The main key elements of this framework are Datasets, Traffic Management Analytics, Actors and Actions which are taken by these users. The framework helps to create an overall overview of the activities needed. In this way it can be used to improve the quality of the traffic flow, increase efficient use of resources, smooth and safe commute of the citizens.
