The detection of consistent feature points in an image is fundamental for various kinds of computer vision techniques, such as stereo matching, object recognition, target tracking and optical flow computation. This paper presents an event-based approach to the detection of corner points, which benefits from the high temporal resolution, compressed visual information and low latency provided by an asynchronous neuromorphic event-based camera. The proposed method adapts the commonly used Harris corner detector to the event-based data, in which frames are replaced by a stream of asynchronous events produced in response to local light changes at Î¼s temporal resolution. Responding only to changes in its field of view, an event-based camera naturally enhances edges in the scene, simplifying the detection of corner features. We characterised and tested the method on both a controlled pattern and a real scenario, using the dynamic vision sensor (DVS) on the neuromorphic iCub robot. The method detects corners with a typical error distribution within 2 pixels. The error is constant for different motion velocities and directions, indicating a consistent detection across the scene and over time. We achieve a detection rate proportional to speed, higher than frame-based technique for a significant amount of motion in the scene, while also reducing the computational cost.
