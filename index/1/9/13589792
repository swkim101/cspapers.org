Three different load balancing algorithms for distributed systems that consist of a number of identical processors and a CSMA communication system are presented in this paper. Some of the properties of a multi-resource system and the balancing process are demonstrated by an analytic model. Simulation is used as a mean for studying the interdependency between the parameters of the distributed system and the behaviour of the balancing algorithm. The results of this study shed light on the characteristics of the load balancing process.
