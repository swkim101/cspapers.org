We present a polynomial time 2-approximation algorithm for the problem of finding the minimum tree that spans at least k vertices. Our result also leads to a 2-approximation algorithm for finding the minimum tour that visits k vertices and to a 3-approximation algorithm for the problem of finding the maximum number of vertices that can be spanned by a tree of length at most a given bound.
