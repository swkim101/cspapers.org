In this paper we highlight the important role of full-scale 3D Ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) transport simulations in the performance analysis of contemporary and future decananometer MOSFETs. Considering both electron and hole transport in alternative device structures and materials we demonstrate that conventional drift diffusion (DD) simulations using standard mobility models fail to capture the non-equilibrium transport effects present in these devices, limiting their effectiveness in terms of performing predictive simulation of Si based FinFETs. We clearly demonstrate the capabilities and the power of EMC in evaluating the scaling potential and performance of FinFETs and quantum well transistors employing high mobility materials and the impact that additional scattering sources has on their performance.
