The Advanced Information Management Prototype (AIM) is an experimental database system, developed and prototyped at the IBM Scientific Center in Heidelberg, Germany. The underlying data model is an extension of the NF’ data model. It is founded on the notions of tuple, set and list. These three constructors may be applied to any valid structure in any order, starting with some atomic domain(s), to get a valid AIM database structure. The corresponding database language, called HDBL (IIeidelberg Data Base Language) is an SQL-type language meeting the requirements of the extended NF’ data model. In this paper we investigate the problem of improving the evaluation of HDBL queries by transformation of the query. The first kind of transformation deals with view processing. Given an HDBL query containing a view it is often not necessary to materialize the view. We will give some rules on how to eliminate the view and evaluate the query against the base relations. Another kind of transformation will be used to remove variables from the query. Some of these transformations are equivalent to the removal of redundant join operations in the relational algebra; a second way to remove variables is the introduction of “complex projections” which can directly be mapped to operations at the storage access interface of the DBMS.
