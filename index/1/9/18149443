Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) has been a widely-used technique for collaborating team to design software. As the traditional CRC does not seem to include the argument analysis process, method interface and test case seem more difficult to devise. Therefore, we propose a method in CRC that incorporates argument extraction and method interface simplification, which helps evaluate arguments to move up their abstraction level and to reduce the number of arguments. In addition, test cases production seems facilitated.
