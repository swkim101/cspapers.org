Current client-server object database management systems employ either a page server or an object server architecture. Both of these architectures have their respective strengths, but they also have key drawbacks for important system and workload conÔ¨Ågurations. We propose a new hybrid server architecture which combines the best features of both page server and object server architectures while avoiding their problems. The new architecture incorporates new or adapted versions of data transfer, recovery, and cache consistency algorithms; in this paper we focus only on the data transfer and recovery issues. The data transfer mechanism allows the hybrid server to dynamically behave as both page and object server. The performance comparison of the hybrid server with object and page servers indicates that the performance of the hybrid server is more robust than the others.
