This paper reports the results of an in-water laboratory evaluation of the state estimation accuracy of a commercially available inertial navigation system (INS), and the effect of variations in the accuracy and the update rate of INS correction data on the accuracy of the INS state estimate. The navigation accuracy of the INS state estimate is evaluated by comparison with navigation data from a highly accurate navigation system available in our laboratory that employs high-frequency acoustic time-of-flight ranging, precision pressure depth sensing, bottom-lock Doppler sonar, and a true-North-seeking gyrocompass that is integral to the INS.
