The proliferation of databases into many areaa has resulted in the need for fast and efficient techniques for query processing. Large databases take too much time to process, and time constrained queries force the query processor to render a result in the available time. For applications such as these, partial query results (PQR) may be satisfactory. Sampling techniques have been used to estimate aggregate query results [3], [5], [6], [7], [13], however a direct application of the sampling algorithms to obtain partial results in non-aggregate queries is not optimal because the goals are different. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for obtaining PQR for non-aggregate queries. Our algorithm is baaed on stratification of the target relation and sampling of the strata over several stages. The results obtained from the preceding stages are used to guide the choice of which strata to sample in the following stages. In other words, strata that possess more of the desired quality (rich) get sampled more at the beginning of the query processing while those that are poor may be sampled at the later stages if time permits. The experimental performance of our algorithm is presented and compared with other techniques for obtaining partial or entire query results. The results show that our algorithm out-performs the other algorithms by finding more tuples that belong to the result set in the early stages of the query processing especiauy when the query selectivity is high or the sample size is at least five percent of the population size. -, ---l ----“rCIICM ‘9S, Baitimom MD USA a 1995 ACM 0-89791-8124/95/11. .$3.50
