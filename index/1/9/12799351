In this paper, we discuss a problem of finding risk patterns in medical data. We define risk patterns by a statistical metric, relative risk, which has been widely used in epidemiological research. We characterise the problem of mining risk patterns as an optimal rule discovery problem. We study an anti-monotone property for mining optimal risk pattern sets and present an algorithm to make use of the property in risk pattern discovery. The method has been applied to a real world data set to find patterns associated with an allergic event for ACE inhibitors. The algorithm has generated some useful results for medical researchers.
