The ease of setting up collaboration infrastructures for software engineering projects creates a challenge for researchers that aim to analyze the resulting data. As teams can choose from various available software-as-a-service solutions and can configure them with a few clicks, researchers have to create and maintain multiple implementations for collecting and aggregating the collaboration data in order to perform their analyses across different setups. The DataRover system presented in this paper simplifies this task by only requiring custom source code for API authentication and querying. Data transformation and linkage is performed based on mappings, which users can define based on sample responses through a graphical front end. This allows storing the same input data in formats and databases most suitable for the intended analysis without requiring additional coding. Furthermore, API responses are continuously monitored to detect changes and allow users to update their mappings and data collectors accordingly.
