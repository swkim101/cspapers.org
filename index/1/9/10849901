The research of image-based control for nonholonomic mobile robots is a recent topic of mobile robots. There are few researches about image-based control of mobile robots with central catadioptric cameras. A central catadioptric camera is very effective to keep target objects in the camera field of view because of its wide area view. In this paper, a new image-based path following control method for a nonholonomic mobile robot with a central catadioptric camera is proposed in the image parameter space. It is confirmed by several simulation, indoor and outdoor experiments that the designed system has high performance and robustness in real world.
