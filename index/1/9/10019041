Handheld computers provide a unique opportunity for teaching computer science. They are inexpensive (and keep dropping in price); they are powerful; they are accessible by students; and they run standard programming interfaces. These facets combine to provide a unique platform for teaching. This paper documents a project to integrate handheld machines into the classroom. We develop the case for using these machines; we overview our plans to use them; and we showcase two applications that we are using in classes. These applications are available for download from the Internet and represent a beginning for our project.
