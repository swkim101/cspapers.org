A unified hand/arm master-slave system was developed to conduct more dexterous tasks by teleoperation. Both the master and the slave consist of a two-fingered hand and a 3-DOF planer manipulator. The system is also aimed at investigating the bottleneck of autonomous robotic manipulation systems. To evaluate the performance of individual teleoperation systems all over the world in equal condition, we propose toy block assembling (LEGO) as the benchmark test for teleoperation systems. Using our hand/arm master-slave system, we announce the measured completion time for assembling some block structures, expecting other research group to try the same task in the future.
