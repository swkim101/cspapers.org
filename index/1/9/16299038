Extensive previous research has shown that searchers often require assistance with query formulation and refinement. Yet, it is not clear what kind of assistance is most useful, and how effective it is both objectively (e.g., in terms of task success) and subjectively (e.g., in terms of searcher percep- tion of the search difficulty). This work describes the results of a controlled user study comparing the effects of provid- ing specific vs. generic search hints on search success and satisfaction. Our results indicate that specific search hints tend to effectively improve searcher success rates and reduce perceived effort, while generic ones can be detrimental in both search effectiveness and user satisfaction. The results of this study are an important step towards the design of future search systems that could effectively assist and guide the user in accomplishing complex search tasks.
