We introduce EntityEngine, a system for answering entity-relationship queries over text. Such queries combine SQL-like structures with IR-style keyword constraints and therefore, can be expressive and flexible in querying about entities and their relationships. EntityEngine consists of various offline and online components, including a position-based ranking model for accurate ranking of query answers and a novel entity-centric index for efficient query evaluation.
