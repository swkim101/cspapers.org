JPie is a tightly integrated development environment supporting live object-oriented software construction in Java. JPie embodies the notion of a dynamic class whose signature and implementation can be modified at run time, with changes taking effect immediately upon existing instances of the class. The result is complete elimination of the edit-compile-test cycle. JPie users create and modify class definitions through direct manipulation of visual representations of program abstractions. This support is provided without modification of the language or run-time system. In this demonstration, we illustrate central features of JPie through the construction of a sample application. These include dynamic declaration of instance variables and methods, dynamic modification of method bodies and threads, dynamic user interface construction and event handling, and on-the-fly exception handling in JPie's integrated thread-oriented debugger.
