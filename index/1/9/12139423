Massively parallel computers — like the Connection Machines CM-1 and CM-2 — have demonstrated remarkable performance in applications like pattern recognition, database searching, dense linear algebra computations and so on. In this paper we discuss the use of these systems for the solution of nonlinear network optimization problems that appear is operations research, transportation, engineering design, financial modeling and other areas.
We describe the implementation of a distributed relaxation algorithm for strictly convex network problems on a massively parallel computer. A Connection Machine CM-1 configured with 16,384 processing elements serves as the primary testbed of the implementation. Experiments are also conducted on a CM-2. Computational results are reported with a series of stick percolation and quadratic transportation problems. The algorithm is compared with an implementation of the primal truncated Newton on an IBM 3081-D mainframe, an Alliant FX/8 shared memory vector multiprocessor and the IBM 3090-600 vector supercomputer.
