In this paper, we propose to employ two optimizations - multi-hop path splitting and multi-pathing - to improve the performance of data transfers over shared public networks. We present a path determination algorithm which integrates the aforesaid optimizations in order to improve the performance of single file transfers. Finally, we develop a file transfer scheduling algorithm based on this framework, and evaluate its effectiveness on a wide-area testbed.
