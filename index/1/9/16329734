A system for automatic test generation and fault location, FLT-700, is described in this paper. It can treat large digital systems with 100K blocks (logic gates) or more. This is realized by utilizing Scan-Path concept, automatic partitioning and test generation techniques and automatic fault location technique. Serviceability for large computer systems can, therefore, be improved and easy maintenance realized. can treat sequential circuits as combinational circuits. Flip-flops in logic cards are serially connected with Scan-Path as shown in Fig.l(b). Therefore these flip-flops can operate as a shift register. Gates for selecting logic cards are also incorporated in each card. Therefore, the specified card in a logic unit with many logic cards can be selected by X-Y address signals (Fig.l(c)). Then, test data can be scanned into the card and operational results be scanned out of it.
