The graphics capabilities and speed of current hardware systems allow the exploration of 3D and animation in user interfaces, while improving the degree of interaction as well. In order to fully utilize these capabilities, new software architectures must support multiple, asynchronous, interacting agents (the <italic>Multiple Agent Problem</italic>), <italic>and</italic> support smooth interactive animation (the <italic>Animation Problem</italic>). The <italic>Cognitive Coprocessor</italic> is a new user interface architecture designed to solve these two problems, while supporting highly interactive user interfaces that have 2D and 3D animations. This architecture includes <italic>3D Rooms</italic>, a 3D analogy to the Rooms system with Rooms Buttons extended to <italic>Interactive Objects</italic> that deal with 3D, animation, and gestures. This research is being tested in the domain of <italic>Information Visualization</italic>, which uses 2D and 3D animated artifacts to represent the structure of information. A prototype, called the <italic>Information Visualizer</italic>, has been built.
