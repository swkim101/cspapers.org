Human walk is achieved by the interaction between the dynamics of the human mechanical system and the rhythmic signals of the central pattern generator (CPG). In this paper, we analyze dynamic properties of a simple walking model of a biped robot driven by a rhythmic signal of an oscillator. This model consists of a hip and two legs which are connected at the hip. The swing leg is controlled by the rhythmic signal which is open loop. We analyze the stability of the periodic walking motion using a Poincare map. As a result, it is revealed that the simple walking model has the self-stabilization property, that is, the walking motion of the simple walking model converges to a periodic walking motion.
