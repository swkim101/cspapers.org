Enhanced route optimization for mobile IPv6 applies cryptographically generated addresses (CGAs) to improve security and reduce handover delays. However the use of CGAs requires computationally expensive algorithms. This may be an issue for small mobile devices with low processing power. It is a problem for correspondent nodes that simultaneously communicate with a large number of mobile nodes, such as publicly accessible servers. This paper investigates enhanced route optimization for mobile IPv6, concentrating upon the costs particularly for the correspondent node. The costs of implementing enhanced route optimization for mobile IPv6 are not negligible. The correspondent node will have to protect itself against potential denial-of service attempts from attackers by limiting the amount of resources it spends on CGA verification.
