This lightning talk describes the current effort to create a research group at Lincoln University to conduct Computational Research On Music & Audio (CROMA). A CROMA Team of Interdisciplinary Collaborators (CROMA-TIC) will be assembled to participate in different aspects and applications of computational audio signal processing, drawing from disciplines such as computer science, mathematics, music, psychology, and nursing. This effort is modelled upon the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) housed at McGill University, but it will be distinct in its focus on undergraduate research. Further, this research group will be unique among Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). A goal of assembling CROMA-TIC and establishing the CROMA-Lab is to inspire participants, especially including minority students, to seek graduate degrees while enriching their undergraduate learning experiences. The initial research aims will focus on sound event separation within musical audio, with the idea that the research conducted by CROMA-TIC will be applicable to a wide array of applications (such as improving the performance of hearing aids in noisy environments or automatic transcription of music recordings, among innumerable possibilities). This effort is just underway; interested faculty and students are invited to attend the presentation and consider participation in CROMA so that it may develop into a truly interdisciplinary, multi-institutional endeavour.
