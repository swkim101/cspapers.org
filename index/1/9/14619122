This paper explores the use of haptic and visual feedback during routine object-manipulation tasks. We conducted tests of slippage detection, contact detection, and grasp control, with the help of twelve human participants. During the tests, the subjects controlled the robotic arm of a UR5 Universal Robot that was mounted with a three-finger robotic gripper and equipped with tactile sensors. The participants used either their visual feedback, vibrotactile feedback, or pressure feedback to assess the movements of the robotic fingers as they attempted to complete each task. We analyzed their performance with each type of feedback in order to evaluate how haptic feedback may be used to reduce the need for visual attention, and thus improve the lives of upper-limb amputees.
