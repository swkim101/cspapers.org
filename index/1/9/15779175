Given an author-conference graph, how do we answer proximity queries (e.g., what are the most related conferences for John Smith?); how can we tailor the search result if the user provides additional yes/no type of feedback (e.g., what are the most related conferences for John Smith given that he does not like ICML?)? Given the potential computational complexity, we mainly devote ourselves to addressing the computational issues in this paper by proposing an efficient solution (referred to as iPoG-B) for bipartite graphs. Our experimental results show that the proposed fast solution (iPoGB) achieves significant speedup, while leading to the same ranking result.
