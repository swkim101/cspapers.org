In order to achieve these goals, the system provides 3 basic primitives: objects, folders, and agents. Users can keep track of and share knowledge about various objects such as people, tasks, projects, companies and many other things with which they work. In addition, they can use hypertext links to represent relationships such as between a message and its replies, between people and their supervisors, and between different parts of a complex product. Object Lens also lets users summarize information in many ways. For instance, task objects can be collected into a folder displayed as a “to do” list, as a PERT-chart like dependency graph, or as a calendar. Finally, users can create various kinds of intelligent agents to help them organize and respond to this knowledge. For instance, they can use intelligent agents to find electronic messages in which they are interested, to notice overdue tasks, and to notify people of upcoming deadlines. Much more detailed descriptions of Object Lens canbe found in [2].
