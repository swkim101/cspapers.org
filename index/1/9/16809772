This work presents an Object-Oriented framework for the implementation of language interpreters in an educational context. We use this framework to implement different programming language paradigms, including interpreters for the Functional, Object-Oriented and Logic paradigms. This framework focuses its structure on aiding the comprehension of the similarities and differences between the implementation of different paradigms.
