In a recent manuscript Dan Bernstein claims the successful extraction of an AES key from a network server through another client computer. His side-channel attack was actually the simplest conceivable timing analysis of AES. Although Bernstein gave no thorough analysis of his methodology or the underlying technique the paper contained the full C-source code. This was actually very useful to repeat, analyze and extend his experiments and technique. Our paper improves upon the work done by Bernstein in the following ways:
