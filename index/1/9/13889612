For languages with (semi-) free word order (such as German), labelling grammatical functions on top of phrase-structural constituent analyses is crucial for making them interpretable. Unfortunately, most statistical classifiers consider only local information for function labelling and fail to capture important restrictions on the distribution of core argument functions such as subject, object etc., namely that there is at most one subject (etc.) per clause. We augment a statistical classifier with an integer linear program imposing hard linguistic constraints on the solution space output by the classifier, capturing global distributional restrictions. We show that this improves labelling quality, in particular for argument grammatical functions, in an intrinsic evaluation, and, importantly, grammar coverage for treebank-based (Lexical-Functional) grammar acquisition and parsing, in an extrinsic evaluation.
