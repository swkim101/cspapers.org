Motivated by the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC), the application of operator assisted (semi-)autonomous robots with highly complex locomotion and manipulation abilities is considered for solving complex tasks in potentially unknown and unstructured environments. Because of the limited a priori knowledge about the state of the environment and tasks needed to achieve a complex mission, a sufficiently complete a priori design of high level robot behaviors is not possible. Most of the situational knowledge required for such behavior design is gathered only during runtime and needs to be interpreted by a human operator. However, current behavior control approaches only allow for very limited adaptation at runtime and no flexible operator interaction. In this paper an approach for definition and execution of complex robot behaviors based on hierarchical state machines is presented, allowing to flexibly change the structure of behaviors on the fly during runtime through assistance of a remote operator. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated not only in an example scenario, but also by application in two robot competitions.
