This paper describes an initial evaluation of systems that answer questions seeking definitions. The results suggest that humans agree sufficiently as to what the basic concepts that should be included in the definition of a particular subject are to permit the computation of concept recall. Computing concept precision is more problematic, however. Using the length in characters of a definition is a crude approximation to concept precision that is nonetheless sufficient to correlate with humans' subjective assessment of definition quality.
