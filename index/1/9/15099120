Multi-channel design has received significant attention for low-power wireless networks (LWNs), such as 802.15.4-based wireless sensor networks, due to its potential of mitigating interference and improving network capacity. However, recent studies reveal that the number of orthogonal channels available on commodity wireless platforms is small, which significantly hinders the performance of existing multi-channel protocols. A promising solution is to explore the use of partially overlapping channels for communications. However, this approach faces several key challenges such as increased inter-channel interference and significantly higher overhead of channel measurement. In this paper, we systematically study the inter-channel interference and its impact on link capacity and the performance of multi-channel protocols in LWNs. First, we develop empirical models for characterizing inter-channel signal attenuation based on experiments on TelosB motes. We then propose a novel measurement algorithm which can significantly reduce the overhead of multi-channel interference measurement by exploiting the spectral power density (SPD) of the transmitter. Finally, we apply our interference models to both link capacity analysis and channel assignment protocols. Our extensive experiments on a testbed of 30 TelosB motes show that our interference measurement algorithm has an average error of 2.95%. Our results also demonstrate that multi-channel protocols for LWNs can significantly benefit from using overlapping channels.
