The present paper is based upon case studies of EXPERT formalism. The studies aim to accomplish two goals; 1) Acquisition of knowledge from specific domain expert through a design of a small scale medical consultation system. 2) Evaluation of the system's performance through various case data. The prototype models on Glaucoma medical consultation system is running at DEC-20 under TOPS-20 operating system. There is a discussion which is based upon these case studies through EXPERT formalism.
