We consider several classical models in deterministic inventory theory: the single-item lot-sizing problem, the joint replenishment problem, and the multi-stage assembly problem. These inventory models have been studied extensively, and play a fundamental role in broader planning issues, such as the management of supply chains. We shall give a novel primal-dual framework for designing algorithms for these models that significantly improve known results in several ways: the performance guarantees for the quality of the solutions improve on or match previously known results; the performance guarantees hold under much more general assumptions about the structure of the costs, and the algorithms and their analysis are significantly simpler than previous known results. Finally, our primal-dual framework departs from the structure of previously studied primal-dual approximation algorithms in significant ways, and we believe that our approach may find application in other settings.We provide 2-approximation algorithms for the joint replenishment problem and for the assembly problem, and solve the single-item lot-sizing problem to optimality. The results for the joint replenishment and the lot-sizing problems also hold for their generalizations with back orders allowed. As a byproduct of our work, we prove known and new upper bounds on the integrality gap of the LP relaxations for these problems.
