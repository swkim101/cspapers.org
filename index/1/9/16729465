Motivated by the parallel nature of on-line internet help-desks and human inspections, we introduce the study of interviewing secretaries in parallel, extending upon the study of the classical secretary problem. In our setting secretaries arrive into multiple queues, and are interviewed in parallel, with the aim of recruiting several secretaries in a timely manner. We consider a variety of new problems that fit this setting, and provide both upper and lower bounds on the efficiency of the corresponding interviewing policies, contrasting them with the classical single queue setting.
