Existing software systems for automated essay scoring can provide NLP researchers with opportunities to test certain theoretical hypotheses, including some derived from Centering Theory. In this study we employ ETS's e-rater essay scoring system to examine whether local discourse coherence, as defined by a measure of Rough-Shift transitions, might be a significant contributor to the evaluation of essays. Our positive results indicate that Rough-Shifts do indeed capture a source of incoherence, one that has not been closely examined in the Centering literature. These results not only justify Rough-Shifts as a valid transition type, but they also support the original formulation of Centering as a measure of discourse continuity even in pronominal-free text.
