While there has been an increased interest in developing relational fully observable MDPs, there has been very little work on relational partially observable MDPs (POMDP), which deal with uncertainty in problem states in addition to stochastic action effects. This paper provides a concrete formalization of relational POMDPs making several technical contributions toward their solution. First, we show that to maintain correctness one must distinguish between quantification over states and quantification over belief states; this implies that solutions based on value iteration are inherently limited to the finite horizon case. Second, we provide a symbolic dynamic programing algorithm for finite horizon relational POMDPs, solving them at an abstract level, by lifting the propositional incremental pruning algorithm. Third, we show that this algorithm can be implemented using first order decision diagrams, a compact representation for functions over relational structures, that has been recently used to solve relational MDPs.
