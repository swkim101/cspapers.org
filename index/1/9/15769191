We introduce a novel ranking algorithm called GRASSHOPPER, which ranks items with an emphasis on diversity. That is, the top items should be different from each other in order to have a broad coverage of the whole item set. Many natural language processing tasks can benefit from such diversity ranking. Our algorithm is based on random walks in an absorbing Markov chain. We turn ranked items into absorbing states, which effectively prevents redundant items from receiving a high rank. We demonstrate GRASSHOPPERâ€™s effectiveness on extractive text summarization: our algorithm ranks between the 1st and 2nd systems on DUC 2004 Task 2; and on a social network analysis task that identifies movie stars of the world.
