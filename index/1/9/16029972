In this work, we deal with the problem of planning a manipulation task for a robotic system composed of at least one dexterous arm and a dexterous multi-fingered hand. The goal of the local planner is to include both, the arm and the hand, in the execution of the task in a coordinated way. This is achieved by using the workspace of the hand which is computed offline. During the online planning, the current in-hand manipulation capability is evaluated taking advantage of the dimensions of the hand workspace and considering the task itself. Dynamic weights enable the computation of the instantaneous contributions of the two subsystems on the motion of the manipulated object. The method is evaluated in simulation as well as in several experiments on the real robot.
