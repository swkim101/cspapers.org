We consider the problem of joint routing, scheduling and transmission power assignment in multi-hop wireless mesh networks with unknown traffic. We assume the traffic is unknown, but the traffic matrix, which specifies the traffic load between every source-destination pair in the network, always lies inside a polytope defined by hose model constraints. The objective is to minimize the maximum of the total transmission power in the network over all traffic matrices in a given polytope. We propose efficient algorithms that compute a two-phase routing, schedule and power assignment, and prove the solution to be 3-approximation with respect to an optimal two-phase routing, scheduling and power assignment. We show via extensive simulations that the proposed algorithm has good performance at its worst operating traffic compared to an algorithm optimized for that traffic.
