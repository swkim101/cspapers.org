We consider off-line permutation routing on trees. We are particularly interested in direct tree routing schedules where packets once started move directly towards their destination. The scheduling of start times ascertains that no two packets will use the same edge in the same direction in the same time step. In O(n log n log log n) time and O(n log n) space, we construct a direct tree routing schedule guaranteed to complete the routing within the general optimum of n - 1 steps. In addition, our scheme guarantees that at most two packets arrive at the same node in the same time step. Furthermore, if the length of the route of a given packet is d and the maximum number of other routes intersecting the route in a single node is k then the packet arrives to its destination within d + k steps.
