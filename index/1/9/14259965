In recent years, web services have become an indispensable part of our life. By use of personal computers, smart phones and wearable smart devices, people can enjoy the convenience brought by these web services and use them to not only enrich our daily life but also solve life issues. Thus, to more appropriately realize the performance of a web service, it is necessary to perform an overall and credible web service testing. Among the areas of current research and applications of web service testing issues, a tester can use a single-node testing tool to rapidly build a simple test environment on a single test node or LAN environment, the tester can also take advantage of the cloud testing method to create large-scale test environment. However, these existing tools and methods suffer some problems so that the test environment is neither close enough to the real context of the use cases nor able to meet tester's requirement (test node dispersion, resource management and ease of deploying a test, etc.). In this paper, we identify three essential requirements for web service testing applications (elastic test environment provisioning, large scale simulation capability, and geographical test support) and propose an efficient design of browser-based distributed testing service platform. As a result, the tester can significantly save their time and reduce the cost via the proposed of browser-based distributed testing service platform.
