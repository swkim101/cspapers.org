Word segmentation is a fundamental task for Chinese language processing. However, with the successive improvements, the standard metric is becoming hard to distinguish state-of-the-art word segmentation systems. In this paper, we propose a new psychometric-inspired evaluation metric for Chinese word segmentation, which addresses to balance the very skewed word distribution at different levels of difficulty 1 . The performance on a real evaluation shows that the proposed metric gives more reasonable and distinguishable scores and correlates well with human judgement. In addition, the proposed metric can be easily extended to evaluate other sequence labelling based NLP tasks.
