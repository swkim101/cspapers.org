In this paper, we present efficient mesh algorithms for performing n search processes on data structures that can be modeled as a tree T of n constant degree nodes. Each of the n search process consists of tracing a search path, i.e. a sequence ofadjacent nodes, in Tonline. Letkbe the maximum length of the traced search paths (note that k is not known ahead of time and must be determined online). We achieve the following time bounds on a @ x @ mesh of processors: (i) when each search path forms a simple path in T, we achieve the optimal 0(++ k) time bound, and (ii) when each search path forms an Euler traversal of a subtree of T, we achieve the 0(/7i(nc+ ~l_Lk)C )) time bound, for any fixed integer in> 2;, %: a constant e, o < c < Jâ€™_l. The best previous bound is â€”]) where a search path can be an ar%mlo;n bitrary sequence of adjacent nodes. As a consequence, we prove that a search tree of height O(W) performs as well as the conventional one of height O (log n) on a mesh of n processors, provided that each search path is a simple path. Our algorithms are based on tree decompositions which are of independent interest.
