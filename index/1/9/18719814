This paper introduces mobile camera robots with camera rotation capabilities. The motivation behind mobile camera robots is that as they rotate their camera their real sensing range moves from a FoV coverage to a disk coverage, therefore allowing neighboring nodes to decrease their activity level, thus their energy consumption. As a sensing nodeâ€™s activity is based on a criticality or risk approach, we proposed 2 interaction behaviors between fixed image sensors and mobile camera robots to dynamically adapt the activity level without decrease the surveillance quality. The performance of the interaction models is evaluated through simulation. The results show that mobile camera robots can successfully help to increase the network lifetime but, depending on the number of deployed mobile camera robots, care must be taken with the interaction behaviors to not decrease the detection quality.
