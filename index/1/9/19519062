Described is a possible mechanism of binocular fusion In visual system based on continlous estimation of resulting "cortical image" doubling degree during vergenoe eye movements. The mechanism does not require any search of corresponding sites in pair retinal images. The result of computer simulation of this mechanism are given. A sequence of information processing stages in binocular vision preceding recognition is discussed.
