We will present the architecture of an intermediate processing layer for large information systems. Tasks assigned to that layer include managing access to information resources as databases, knowledge bases, sensor-based processing systems, message processing systems, and systems that project into the future, as simulations can do. To convert the data into information, it has to be abstracted, correlated, fused, and labeled with certainty factors. Mediation requires domain-speciic knowledge and we expect that there will be many specialized mediators maintained by experts in their elds. The role of arti-cial intelligence technology is critical here. An application will call upon as many mediators as the number of domains it addresses. Each mediator will utilize as many data resources as needed for its speciic view. An important motivation is the structuring of knowledge maintenance, and, by extension, the maintenance of large information processing systems as well. We will argue that longevity of large systems requires such an approach. The isolation from changes that an architecture with an intelligent layer provides is likely to be crucial for systems with many applications and data sources. We will cite some examples from a pro-totyping eeort to insert this technology in a large, real and demanding application which has been initiated.
