Wireless LAN multicast can provide high quality location-aware content service. However, our research revealed that multicast might cause a significant increase in the power consumption. Flexible Multicast Service (FMS) which is defined in the IEEE 802.11v enables power efficient multicast service. In this paper, we prove that the FMS strategy is not optimal and a little extension on FMS will achieve great improvement in power efficiency without throughput or delay penalties.
