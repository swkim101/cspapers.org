NPL is developing a rigorous methodology for usability measurement and specification as part of the collaborative European ESPRIT project MUSIC (Metrics for Usability Standards in Computing). The methodology, being developed in conjunction with the HUSAT Research Institute, will enable a procurer to specify usability requirements for a product, so that the product can subsequently be assessed to find whether it meets these requirements. The project builds on and extends existing work in the area (eg [10]).
