This demonstration will feature overviews of the C-SAW and GenAWeave projects. The first half of the presentation will introduce the concept of two-level aspect weaving, which unites a <i>model transformation</i> tool with a <i>program transformation</i> engine. From models representing an avionics application, it will be shown how changes to model properties trigger corresponding adaptations to the related source code. The second half of the demonstration is focused on using a program transformation engine to perform the task of aspect weaving. In particular, several crosscutting concerns will be woven into an Object Pascal application.
