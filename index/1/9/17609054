Introduction The problem of spatial decision-making and choice behaviour has a long-standing tradition in geographic research. One can identify numerous approaches for studying the aforementioned, time-geography being one of them [1]. At the heart of time-geography there is the notion of space and time [2]. Space can be seen in both ways: acting as a restrictive unit and at the same time offering opportunities for different activities related to meaningful places. Allan Pred has made an effort in integrating time geography with the theory of structuration. He argues that place always involves an appropriation and transformation of space and nature that is inseperable from the reproduction and transformation of society in time and space [3]. From this point of view it becomes necessary to study human behaviour in time-space context in order to understand how cities “work” and how do they influence human behaviour.
