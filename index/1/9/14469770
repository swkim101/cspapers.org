We analyze a randomized pivoting process involving one line and <italic>n</italic> points in the plane. The process models the behavior of the <italic>Random-Edge</italic> simplex algorithm on simple polytopes with <italic>n</italic> facets in dimension <italic>n-2</italic>. We obtain a tight <italic>O(\log^2 n)</italic> bound for the expected number of pivot steps.  This is the first nontrivial bound for <italic>Random-Edge</italic> which goes beyond bounds for specific polytopes. The process itself can be interpreted as a simple algorithm for certain 2-variable linear programming problems, and we prove a tight <italic>&thgr;(n)</italic> bound for its expected runtime.
The combinatorial structure behind the process is a directed graph over pairs of points, with arc  orientations induced by the pivot steps. We characterize the class of graphs arising from one line and <italic>n</italic> points, up to oriented matroid realizability.
