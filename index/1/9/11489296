The proliferation of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) challenges data miners to discover potential and previously unknown patterns from a large collection of medical data. One of the tasks that we address in this paper is to reveal previously unknown effects of drugs on laboratory test results. We propose a method that leverages drug information to find a meaningful list of drugs that have an effect on the laboratory result. We formulate the problem as a convex non smooth function and develop a proximal gradient method to optimize it. The model has been evaluated on two important use cases: lowering low-density lipoproteins and glycated hemoglobin test results. The experimental results provide evidence that the proposed method is more accurate than the state-of-the-art method, rediscover drugs that are known to lower the levels of laboratory test results, and most importantly, discover additional potential drugs that may also lower these levels.
