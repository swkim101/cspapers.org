Random feature map is popularly used to scale up kernel methods. However, employing a large number of mapped features to ensure an accurate approximation will still make the training time consuming. In this paper, we aim to improve the training efficiency of shift-invariant kernels by using fewer informative features without sacrificing precision. We propose a novel feature map method by extending Random Kitchen Sinks through fast data-dependent subspace embedding to generate the desired features. More specifically, we describe two algorithms with different tradeoffs on the running speed and accuracy, and prove that O(l) features induced by them are able to perform as accurately as O(l2) features by other feature map methods. In addition, several experiments are conducted on the real-world datasets demonstrating the superiority of our proposed algorithms.
