Recognizing the plan underlying a query aids in the generation of an appropriate response In this paper we address the problem of how to generate cooperative responses when the user s plan is ambiguous We show that it is not al ways necessary to resolve the ambiguity and provide a procedure that estimates whether the ambiguity matters to the task of formulating a response If the ambiguity does matter we propose to resolve the ambiguity by entering into a clari cation dialogue with the user and provide a procedure that performs this task Together these procedures allow a question answering system to take advantage of the in teractive and collaborative nature of dialogue in recognizing plans and resolving ambiguity
