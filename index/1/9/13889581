This paper studies quality of human labels used to train search engines' rankers. Our specific focus is performance improvements obtained by using overlapping relevance labels, which is by collecting multiple human judgments for each training sample. The paper explores whether, when, and for which samples one should obtain overlapping training labels, as well as how many labels per sample are needed. The proposed selective labeling scheme collects additional labels only for a subset of training samples, specifically for those that are labeled relevant by a judge. Our experiments show that this labeling scheme improves the NDCG of two Web search rankers on several real-world test sets, with a low labeling overhead of around 1.4 labels per sample. This labeling scheme also outperforms several methods of using overlapping labels, such as simple k-overlap, majority vote, the highest labels, etc. Finally, the paper presents a study of how many overlapping labels are needed to get the best improvement in retrieval accuracy.
