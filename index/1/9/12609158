In this paper we compare and contrast computer science curricula in four universities in four different countries (and continents): Australia; Israel; South Africa and Sweden. Uppsala University in Sweden is a European university founded in 1477 with a long history of tradition. The University of Witwatersrand in South Africa and Deakin University in Australia evolved from 'Schools of Mines' (technical schools) in 1922 and 1977 respectively and have their roots in the British academic system. The Open University of Israel, established in 1974 by the Ministry of Education, began teaching in 1976. As new universities, Deakin University and the Open University of Israel sought to fill needs not met by existing universities, so both have concentrated on distance learning (off-campus) programs. For similar reasons, Deakin University and the Open University of Israel also provide special non-degree short courses and programs. We refer to undergraduate and graduate studies and consider degree requirements, methods of delivery, assessment, and costs. We also briefly mention such issues as programming languages and the development and evolution of programs of study and of individual courses in the four universities.
