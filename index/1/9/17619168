The residue number system is used to partition addition, subtraction, multiplication, or integer polynomial transforms into several simpler calculations, each of which can be processed in parallel with complete independence. These segments are computationally simple such that all the arithmetic interactions can be enumerated as mathematical mappings. By routing signals through various mappings a number may be encoded into residue form, processed in various ways, and eventually decoded back to a normal number system. The signals may be routed in a manner to reflect calculations involving a plurality of operands and operations. By routing several signals in close sequence calculations may be pipelined. By routing different types of signals independently several calculations may be multiplexed. Detection of abnormalities in a segment's signal may be used to exclude the segment from the decoding process, thus preserving the correctness of the calculations. By reducing and conveniently deferring the signal detections necessary, a greater variety of phenomena may be considered for digital computation. Optical implementations are of particular interest.
