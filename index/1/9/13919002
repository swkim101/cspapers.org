The embedding of one interconnection network into another is a very important issue in the design and analysis of parallel algorithms. Through such embedding the algorithms originally developed for one architecture can be directly mapped to another architecture. This paper describes novel methods, based on matrix transformations, for e~ciently embedding different networks into the hypercube (binary n-cube). First, we use this method to embed r-ary m-cubes into a binary n-cube of the same size with dilation 1. While our method has the same dilation as traditional methods using rejlected Gray code, it has the additional property of making the layout of the binary n-cube more suitable for divide-and-conquer algorithms. Second, we use our matrix transformation method to optimally embed hierarchical interconnection networks into the binary n-cube which we would not achieve using rejlected Gray code embedding. Thus, this embedding method has signi$cant practical importance in enhancing the capabilities of the hypercube..
