To engage a broader audience in computer science, we have developed a set of curriculum units embedded with computer science concepts for K-12 science education. We chose bioinformatics as a vehicle to deliver these units. Our curriculum development cycle began with the identification of a set of computer science concepts which are potentially relevant to life sciences. Problems in life sciences as well as bioinformatics tools to be used for solving these problems were carefully examined for the delivery of identified computer concepts. They were later presented to groups of regional K-12 science teachers in our summer workshop on bioinformatics. With their help, we adapted and polished these curriculum units to meet Minnesota state standards for K-12 science education. This paper describes our approach in developing the curriculum units.
