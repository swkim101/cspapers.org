When it comes to the minimax controller design, it could be extremely difficult to obtain such controllers in the nonlinear situations. One of the reasons is that the minimax controller must be robust against any kind of disturbances in the nonlinear situations. In this paper, we propose a difficulty-free design method of minimax control problems. First, based on the genetic programming and Jung's collective unconscious, this paper presents a very simple design technique to solve the minimax control problems, where the minimax controller may be constructed only paying attention to the minimization process. It could be surprising that the maximization process is not needed in the construction of minimax controllers. Then, some simulations are given to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed design technique with the identification problem, and minimax control problems
