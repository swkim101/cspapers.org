We illustrate the usefulness of communicating finite state machines in modeling a number of physical layer protocols that include (i) an asynchronous start-stop protocol and (ii) a protocol for synchronous transmission with modems. Each protocol is modeled as a network of four finite state machines that communicate by exchanging messages over unbounded, FIFO channels. (Two machines are used to model the protocol itself, while the other two are used to model its interface to the upper data link protocol in the protocol hierarchy.) We outline a methodology to verify communication boundedness and progress for each protocol model. The methodology is based on three techniques that were proposed earlier to verify networks of communicating finite state machines; they are network decomposition, machine equivalence, and closed covers.
