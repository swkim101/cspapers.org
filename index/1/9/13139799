A method for heuristically generating nested beliefs (what some agent believes that another agent-believes ... about a topic) is described. Such nested beliefs (points of view) are esential to many processes such as discourse processing and reasoning about other agents' reasoning processes. Particular interest is paid to the class of beliefs known as atypical beliefs and to intensional descriptions. The heuristic methods described are emboddied in a program called ViewGen that generates nested viewpoints from a set of beliefs held by the system.
