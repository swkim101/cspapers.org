Queuing models can be useful tools in comparing the performance characteristics of different flow control techniques. In this paper the window control mechanism, incorporated in protocols such as X.25 is compared to the ARPAnet buffer reservation scheme. Multiclass queuing models are used to examine message throughput and delay characteristics. The analysis highlights the interaction of long and short message (in terms of length in packets) transmitters under the two flow control techniques.
