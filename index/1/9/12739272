We propose a novel method for Japanese dependency analysis, which is usually reduced to the construction of a dependency tree. In deterministic approaches to this task, dependency trees are constructed by series of actions of attaching a bunsetsu chunk to one of the nodes in the tree being constructed. Conventional techniques select the node based on whether the new bunsetsu chunk and each node in the trees are in a parent-child relation or not. However, tree structures include relations between two nodes other than the parent-child relation. Therefore, we use ancestor-descendant relations in addition to parent-child relations, so that the added redundancy helps errors be corrected. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy.
