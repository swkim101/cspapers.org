We present "Turkalytics," a novel analytics tool for human computation systems. Turkalytics processes and reports logging events from workers in real-time and has been shown to scale to over one hundred thousand logging events per day. We present a state model for worker interaction that covers the Mechanical Turk (the SCRAP model) and a data model that demonstrates the diversity of data collected by Turkalytics. We show that Turkalytics is effective at data collection, in spite of it being unobtrusive. Lastly, we describe worker locations, browser environments, activity information, and other examples of data collected by our tool.
