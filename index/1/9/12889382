Computer science faculty from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Virginia Tech and Florida A&M will present their interventions and results. National Center for Women & Information Technology will share results from other institutions that also have used evidence-based practices resulting in increased enrollments and distribute materials describing those practices.
