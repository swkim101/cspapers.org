With the reduced IC design times provided by today's DA tools, it is no longer sufficient for the tools to end with a set of masks and a tester program; they must also participate in the design of associated electronic packaging technologies. The increased performance of today's IC's also demands new, high-performance packaging technologies if the speed of the chips is to be utilized effectively at the system level.
However, can these goals be achieved at low added cost to the system? 'Flip-chip,' solder-bump, and tab-attach substrates, high-density multi-chip boards, and wafer-scale interconnect present many new challenges to present CAD technologies.
Multi-layer place-and-route at IC densities, modeling and analysis of transmission-line effects, noise problems and the supply of clean power across the system are just a few of the new challenges facing the DA engineer. In addition, mechanical stress and vibration analysis, as well as thermal analysis techniques, are of increasing importance.
