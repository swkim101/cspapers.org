Net matching is often critical for the correct performance of a circuit. We adopt a conservative design to route all matched nets with identical topology and equal wire lengths in order to achieve zero skew. We formulate the problem as one special D-dimensional Steiner tree problem. An iterative improvement strategy is used to generate the Steiner tree topology. We provide a more efficient method of computing the optimal Steiner point positions over the linear programming method involving a 45-degree rotation of the domain, and approximation matrices.
