This report deals with the problem of discovering the differences between two implementations of the same partially specified function. It describes a heuristic approach to the boolean equivalence problem which yields information important for understanding structural differences. It also contains a formalization for the notion of "structural difference" and presents an algorithm for approximating this difference.
