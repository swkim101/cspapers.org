A central challenge in the design of multimedia databases is integrating information from different media sources while reducing the cognitive load imposed on users by the tasks of learning and operating the interface. In light of results from a prototype multimedia project developed at Apple, we believe that an agent-style interface addresses this challenge in several ways. This paper discusses techniques for achieving media integration and details the use of interface agents in facilitating 'navigation', enhancing content through point of view, and supporting users in a variety of instrumental and experiential tasks.
