Vector architectures have long been the of choice for building supercomputers. They first appeared in the early aeventies and had a long period of unquestioned dominance from the time the CRAY-1 was introduced in 1976 until the the appearance of “killer micros”, in 1991. They still have a foothold in the supercomputer marketplace, although their continued viability, in the face of micro-baaed parallel aystens, is being seriously questioned. We present a brief hiatory of supercomputing and discuss the merits of vector architectures. Then we relate the advantages of vector architectures with current trends in computer system and device technology. Although the viability of vector supercomputers is indeed questionable, largely because of coat issues, we argue that vector architectures have a long future ahead of them - with new applications and commodity implementations. Vector instruction sets have many fundamental advantages and deserve serious consideration for implementation in next generation computer systems, where graphics and other multimedia applications will abound.
