Urban spaces have a great impact on how people feel and behave. There are number of factors that impact our emotional responses to a space. In this paper, we propose an objective way to measure people's emotional reactions in places by monitoring their physiological signals that are related to emotion. By integrating wearable biosensors with mobile phones, we can obtain geo-annotated data relating to emotional states in relation to our spatial surroundings. We are the able to visualize the emotional response data by creating an emotional layer over a geographical map. This can then help us to understand how individuals emotionally perceive urban spaces and help us to illustrate the interdependency between emotions and environmental surroundings.
