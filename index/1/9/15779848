The decision functions constructed by support vector machines (SVM's) usually depend only on a subset of the training setâ€”the so-called support vectors. We derive asymptotically sharp lower and upper bounds on the number of support vectors for several standard types of SVM's. In particular, we show for the Gaussian RBF kernel that the fraction of support vectors tends to twice the Bayes risk for the L1-SVM, to the probability of noise for the L2-SVM, and to 1 for the LS-SVM.
