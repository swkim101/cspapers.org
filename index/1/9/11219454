In 1981 the APCS Development Committee recommended the use of Pascal in an AP course whose first exam was given in 1984. This decision was controversial; BASIC was in widespread use and serious consideration was given to a language-neutral exam and course. In 1985 an ad-hoc committee made recommendations on changing the exam format, essentially creating two courses that correspond roughly to CS1 and CS2. In 1995 an ad-hoc committee was convened to make recommendations on how best to incorporate C++ into the AP course and exam. The decision to adopt C++, made in 1994, was decidedly controversial. The ad-hoc committee made recommendations on a subset of C++ and on classes similar to those in the standard library, but which were safe for novice programmers to use.
