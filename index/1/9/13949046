High-level loop transformations are a key instrument in mapping computational kernels to effectively exploit the resources in modern processor architectures. Nevertheless, selecting required compositions of loop transformations to achieve this remains a significantly challenging task; current compilers may be off by orders of magnitude in performance compared to hand-optimized programs. To address this fundamental challenge, we first present a convex characterization of all distinct, semantics-preserving, multidimensional affine transformations. We then bring together algebraic, algorithmic, and performance analysis results to design a tractable optimization algorithm over this highly expressive space. Our framework has been implemented and validated experimentally on a representative set of benchmarks running on state-of-the-art multi-core platforms.
