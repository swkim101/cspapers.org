For a rectilinear Steiner tree <i>T</i> with a root, define its <i>k</i>-th moment<i>M</i><inf><i>k</i></inf>(<i>T</i>)= âˆ«<inf><i>T</i></inf>(<i>d</i><inf><i>T</i></inf>(<i>u</i>))<sup><i>k</i></sup><i>du</i>where the integration is over all edges of <i>T</i>, <i>d</i><inf><i>T</i></inf> (<i>u</i>) is the length of the unique path in <i>T</i> from the root to <i>u</i>, and <i>du</i> is the incremental edge length. Given a set of points <i>P</i> in the plane, a <i>k</i>-th moment Steiner Minimum Tree (<i>k</i>-SMT) is a rectilinear Steiner tree that has the minimum <i>k</i>-th moment among all rectilinear Steiner trees for <i>P</i>, with the origin as the root. The definition is a natural extension of the traditional Steiner minimum tree, and motivated by application in VLSI routing. In this paper properties of the <i>k</i>-SMT are studied and approximation algorithms are presented.
