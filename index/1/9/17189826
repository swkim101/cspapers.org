The heterogeneous collection of machines constituting the Processor Bank at Cambridge represents an important set of resources which must be managed. The Resource Manager incorporates these machines into a wider view of resources in a network. It will accept existing resources and specifications for constructing others from existing ones. It will then allocate these to clients on demand, combining existing resources as necessary. Resource management in a decentralized system presents interesting problems: the resources are varied and of a multi-level nature; they are available at different locations from where they are required; the stock of available resources varies dynamically; and the underlying system is in constant flux.
