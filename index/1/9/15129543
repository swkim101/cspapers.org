Rapid increase in speed and availability of network of supercomputers is making high performance global computing possible, in which computational and data resources in the network are collectively employed to solve large-scale problems. There have been several recent proposals of global computing including our Ninf system. However, critical issues regarding system performance characteristics in global computing have been little investigated, especially under multi-clients, multi-sites WAN settings. In order to investigate the feasibility of Ninf and similar systems, we conducted benchmarks with different communication/computation characteristics on a variety of combinations of clients and servers in their performance, architecture, etc. under LAN, single-site WAN, multi-site WAN situations.
