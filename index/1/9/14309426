Low-drift rotation estimation is a crucial part of any accurate odometry system. In this paper, we focus on the problem of 3D rotation estimation with dense depth sensors in environments that consist of piece-wise planar structures, such as corridors and office rooms. An efficient mean-shift paradigm is developed to extract and track planar modes in the surface normal vector distribution on the unit sphere. Robust and piece-wise drift-free behavior is achieved by registering the bundle of planar modes from the current frame with respect to a reference frame using a general â„“1-norm regression scheme. We furthermore add a memory scheme to the regular birth and death of modes, which further compensates accumulated rotational drift when previously discovered modes are revisited. We discuss the robustness issue and evaluate our algorithm on both custom synthetic as well as real publicly available datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate high robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
