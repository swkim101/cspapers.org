Being the ever-growing online encyclopedia, Wikipedia requires a keen investigation about which articles are to be included for it to maintain its indispensability. To prevent unnecessary articles from being included, official guidelines of Wikipedia demand these named entities to meet "notability" standards for their article inclusion. In this paper, we evaluate named entities for their notability by using reliability and entity salience features. Evaluations of our system provide evidence for the viability of our solution as an alternative to the manual decisions made by the reviewers for inclusion of an article using the notability rules.
