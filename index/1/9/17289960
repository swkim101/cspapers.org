This paper proposes a design technique of state-feedback H/sub /spl infin// control with transient response shaping. For direct transient response shaping, loose eigenstructure assignment technique is a effective technique. By using this technique, each of closed-loop eigenvalues (poles) and eigenvectors are assigned in the corresponding eigenvalue regions and eigenvector cones individually. The loose eigenstructure assignment problem is reduced to a rank-one LMI (linear matrix inequality) problem, and easily combined with H/sub /spl infin// control by means of enhanced LMI characterization.
