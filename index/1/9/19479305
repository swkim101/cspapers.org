The statement that computer networks executing essentially the same software (for example, a software's various versions and configurations; such as Linux or Windows) present a higher risk of cascading failures than more diversified networks when a serious vulnerability is discovered in that common software has two inherent problems. The first problem is with the concept of "essentially the same software", and the second is with the meaning of "cascading failures".
