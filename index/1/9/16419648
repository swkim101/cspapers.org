We illustrate the use of heuristic algorithms to improve the verification and validation of software process simulation models. To use this approach, an optimization problem is formulated to guide a heuristic search algorithm that will attempt to locate configurations of the system that yield surprising results. These surprising results often help the modeler to identify flaws in the model logic that would otherwise remain undetected. The general concepts are discussed and a simple example is provided.
