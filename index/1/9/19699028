Systems realizing shape change and tactile display remain hindered by the power, cost, and size limitations of current actuation technology. We describe and evaluate a novel use of switchable permanent magnets as a bistable actuator for haptic feedback which draws power only when switching states. Because of their efficiency, low cost, and small size, these actuators show promise in realizing tactile display within mobile, wearable, and embedded systems. We present several applications demonstrating potential uses in the mobile, automotive, and desktop computing domains, and perform a technical evaluation of the actuators used in these systems.
