The operation and maintenance of today's aircraft is a complex task. It requires use of some state-of-the-art data mining facilites that are not currently available. This paper is about dev elopment and use of data mining techniques to detect abnormal situations in aircraft operation. Using historical sensor data, that is normally generated during the operation of aircraft, w e induce models to predict abonormal situations in aircraft engines. The method involv es creating new features from raw data and identifying trends in particular parameters of interest. We describe how models generated from individual aircraft with abnormal situations can be combined to generate a single model. We evaluate our approach using over 5 y ears of historical data from the operation of engines of 34 Airbus A-320's.
