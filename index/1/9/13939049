Place recognition is a core component in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), limiting positional drift over space and time to unlock precise robot navigation. Determining which previously visited places belong together continues to be a highly active area of research as robotic applications demand increasingly higher accuracies. A large number of place recognition algorithms have been proposed, capable of consuming a variety of sensor data including laser, sonar and depth readings. The best performing solutions, however, have utilized visual information by either matching entire images or parts thereof. Most commonly, vision based approaches are inspired by information retrieval and utilize 3D-geometry information about the observed scene as a post-verification step. In this paper we propose to use the 3D-scene information from sparse-visual feature maps directly at the core of the place recognition pipeline. We propose a novel structural descriptor which aggregates sparse triangulated landmarks from SLAM into a compact signature. The resulting 3D-features provide a discriminative fingerprint to recognize places over seasonal and viewpoint changes which are particularly challenging for approaches based on sparse visual descriptors. We evaluate our system on publicly available datasets and show how its complementary nature can provide an improvement over visual place recognition.
