While MPLS has been extensively deployed in recent years, little is known about its behavior in practice. We examine the performance of MPLS in Microsoft's online service network (MSN), a well-provisioned multi-continent production network connecting tens of data centers. Using detailed traces collected over a 2-month period, we find that many paths experience significantly inflated latencies. We correlate occurrences of latency inflation with routers, links, and DC-pairs. This analysis sheds light on the causes of latency inflation and suggests several avenues for alleviating the problem.
