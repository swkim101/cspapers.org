Sorting is a fundamental operation in data processing. While the problem of sorting flat data records has been extensively studied, there is very little work on sorting hierarchical data such as XML documents. Existing hierarchy-aware sorting approaches for hierarchical data are based on creating sorted subtrees as initial sorted runs and merging sorted subtrees to create the sorted output using either explicit pointers or absolute node key comparisons for merging subtrees. In this paper, we propose SliceSort, a novel, level-wise sorting technique for hierarchical data that avoids the drawbacks of subtree-based sorting techniques. Our experimental performance evaluation shows that SliceSort outperforms the state-of-art approach, HErMeS, by up to a factor of 27%.
