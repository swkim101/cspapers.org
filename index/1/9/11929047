View occluders influence the image quality of a subject when occluders exist between a camera and a subject. For example, a blurred fence image interrupts a subject when an image of a scene is captured by a camera through a fence. In this paper, we propose an automatic removal method of foreground occluders from images using multiple focusing. Our method automatically detects foreground occluder regions by using two images with and without flashlight. The influence of foreground occluders is estimated and overlapping effects of foreground occluders are removed by using multiple focus images. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
