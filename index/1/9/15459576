Model-to-Model mapping should offer the advantage of fully operational bi-directional mapping between different models or formalisms that share some common properties. However in reality this is not easily achievable. It is acknowledged that previous work was presented where it was shown how Triple Graph Grammars are useful to achieve the mapping. UML 2 activities share some similarities with Petri nets. In this paper a simple condensed rule based solution for bi-directional mapping or transformation of UML 2 activities into Petri nets is presented. A practical example is used to illustrate the bi-directional transformation possibility and some conclusions are given.
