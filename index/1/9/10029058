This study summarizes various linguistic approaches proposed for document analysis in information retrieval environments. Included are standard syntactic methods to generate complex content identifiers, and the use of semantic know-how obtained from machine-readable dictionaries and from specially constructed knowledge bases. A particular syntactic analysis methodology is also outlined and its usefulness for the automatic construction of book indexes is examined.
