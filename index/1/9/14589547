Plant traits are a key to understanding and predicting the adaptation of ecosystems to environmental changes, which motivates the TRY project aiming at constructing a global database for plant traits and becoming a standard resource for the ecological community. Despite its unprecedented coverage, a large percentage of missing data substantially constrains joint trait analysis. Meanwhile, the trait data is characterized by the hierarchical phylogenetic structure of the plant kingdom. While factorization based matrix completion techniques have been widely used to address the missing data problem, traditional matrix factorization methods are unable to leverage the phylogenetic structure. We propose hierarchical probabilistic matrix factorization (HPMF), which effectively uses hierarchical phylogenetic information for trait prediction. We demonstrate HPMF's high accuracy, effectiveness of incorporating hierarchical structure and ability to capture trait correlation through experiments.
