As their prices decline, their storage capacities increase, and their endurance improves, NAND Flash Solid State Disks (SSD) provide an increasingly attractive alternative to Hard Disk Drives (HDD) for portable computing systems and PCs. This paper presents a study of NAND Flash SSD architectures and their management techniques, quantifying SSD performance under user-driven/PC applications in a multi-tasked environment; user activity represents typical PC workloads and includes browsing files and folders, emailing, text editing and document creation, surfing the web, listening to music and playing movies, editing large pictures, and running office applications.
 We find the following: (a) the real limitation to NAND Flash memory performance is not its low per-device bandwidth but its internal core interface; (b) NAND Flash memory media transfer rates do not need to scale up to those of HDDs for good performance; (c) SSD organizations that exploit concurrency at both the system and device level (e.g. RAID-like organizations and Micron-style (superblocks) improve performance significantly; and (d) these system- and device-level concurrency mechanisms are, to a significant degree, orthogonal: that is, the performance increase due to one does not come at the expense of the other, as each exploits a different facet of concurrency exhibited within the PC workload.
