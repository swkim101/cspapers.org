In theory, term-wise partitioned indexes may provide higher throughput than document-wise partitioned. In practice, term-wise partitioning shows lacking scalability with increasing collection size and intra-query parallelism, which leads to long query latency and poor performance at low query loads. In our work, we have developed several techniques to deal with these problems. Our current results show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art approach on a small distributed IR system, and our next objective is to evaluate the scalability of the improved approach on a large system. In this paper, we describe the relation between our work and the problem of scalability, summarize the results, limitations and challenges of our current work, and outline directions for further research.
