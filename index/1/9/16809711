This paper presents recent extensions to Poliqarp, an open source tool for indexing and searching morphosyntactically annotated corpora, which turn it into a tool for indexing and searching certain kinds of treebanks, complementary to existing treebank search engines. In particular, the paper discusses the motivation for such a new tool, the extended query syntax of Poliqarp and implementation and efficiency issues.
