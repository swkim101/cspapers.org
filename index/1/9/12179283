INTRODUCTION Although the l i terature dealing with formal and natural languages abounds with theoretical arguments of worstcase performance by various parsing strategies [e.g. , Grif f i ths & Petrick, 1965; Aho & Ullman, 1972; Graham, Harrison & Ruzzo, Ig80], there is l i t t l e discussion of comparative performance based on actual practice in understanding natural language. Yet important practical considerations do arise when writ ing programs to understand one aspect or another of natural language utterances. Where, for example, a theorist wi l l characterize a parsing strategy according to i ts space and/or time requirements in attempting to analyze the worst possible input acc3rding to ~n arbi t rary grammar s t r i c t l y l imited in expressive power, the researcher studying Natural Language Processing can be jus t i f ied in concerning himself more with issues of practical performance in parsing sentences encountered in language as humans Actually use i t using a grammar expressed in a form corve~ie: to the human l inguist who is writ ing i t . Moreover, ~ r y occasional poor performance may be quite acceptabl:, part icular ly i f real-time considerations are not invo~ed, e.g., i f a human querant is not waiting for the answer to his question), provided the overall average performance is superior. One example of such a situation is o f f l ine Machine Translation.
