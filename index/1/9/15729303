Sudan and others have considered the problem of reconstructing a bounded-degree polynomial f : F” + F from n data-points, only t of which are guaranteed to be consistent with f. For t << n/2, the solution may not be unique; but it may be possible to find a small set of candidates for f. Here we extend this work, proving results including the following: Pick 2(l), . . . ,?tn) E,, F”. Generate data-points (Z(l), f(Z(l))), . . . , (Z!(“l, f(Z(“))), and allow an adversary to corrupt any n t of them. We require t to be greater than a bound on the order of n*; we also require a lower-bound on IFI. Then, with high probability, we may reconstruct from the corrupted data a small set of candidates for f. Our results improve on past research in several respects. First, our bound on t is lower. Second, we allow for weaker restrictions on the distribution of Z(l) gradt;, . . 7 2tn): in particular, as in the previous parawe allow for the familiar case of learning a polynomial from its values at random locations. Third, we go on to prove that, if noise is assumed to be random in a specified sense, then a polynomial may be uniquely reconstructed from highly noisy data.
