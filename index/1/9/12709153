During the transition to packet-switched on-chip networks we lose the relative timing and ordering of requests, which are essential for shared memory coherency and the communication of spikes in hardware-based artificial neural networks. We present a bufferless network architecture that enforces a time-based sharing of multi-hop single-cycle paths, providing guaranteed services at low cost. We guarantee ordered delivery of requests, fixed network latency, and jitter-free neural spikes. In a 64-node network, we achieve a 84% lower latency and 7.5Ã— higher throughput than SCORPIO. Full-system 36-core simulations show a 9% lower runtime than SCORPIO, with 39% lower power and 36% lower area.
