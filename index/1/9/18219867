In this article, the design, system modeling and control of a new hybrid type of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is presented. Based on the flight principles of the Dos Samara UAV, a new vehicle that combines the capability of hovering, like a helicopter, and high speed-increased endurance flying, like a fixed-wing aircraft, is designed. The nonlinear dynamics model of the aircraft operating in helicopter mode is derived and linearized around hovering operation. Based on this model an LQ-controller is designed. The performance of the overall system is examined in simulation studies.
