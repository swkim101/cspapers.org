This paper introduced the main features of the UAM CorpusTool, software for human and semi-automatic annotation of text and images. The demonstration will show how to set up an annotation project, how to annotate text files at multiple annotation levels, how to automatically assign tags to segments matching lexical patterns, and how to perform crosslayer searches of the corpus.
