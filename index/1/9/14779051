Conducting polymer actuators such as polypyrrole can generate stresses over 10 times larger than skeletal muscle and have typical repeatable strains between 1% and 12%, making them potential candidates for lightweight, low-cost, robotic applications. Polypyrrole linear actuators under closed loop control have not been previously reported. Here we report the open and closed loop performance of polypyrrole linear contractile actuators evaluated at pre-loaded stresses of 1 MPa to 3 MPa. A standard PI control scheme driving a potentiostat was implemented in conjunction with positioning feedback from a DC/DC linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). A dynamic positioning range of 3400 is reported, with a positioning resolution of 125 nm (0.001% strain) and a maximum repeatable displacement of 427 microns (3.6% strain). The open loop frequency response of actuator strain shows characteristics of a first-order low pass filter with a log gain versus log frequency slope near âˆ’1 for frequencies tested between 0.05 Hz to 2 Hz. The closed loop frequency response of actuator strain when tracking a sinusoidal set-point signal of 0.5% strain shows characteristics of a first order system with one zero, with a corner frequency near 0.08 Hz and an operating bandwidth up to 1 Hz. Step responses at various controller output maximum voltages show a reduction in contractile response times by a factor of four, where higher voltages yield faster contractile responses.
