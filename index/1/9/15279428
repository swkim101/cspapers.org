We make the case for a sensor network model in which each mote stores sensor data locally, and provides a database query interface to the data. Unlike TinyDB and Cougar, in which a sink node provides a database-like front end for filtering the current sensor values from a data collection network, we propose that each sensor device should run its own database system. We present Antelope, a database management system for resource-constrained sensors. Antelope provides a dynamic database system that enables run-time creation and deletion of databases and indexes. Antelope uses energy-efficient indexing techniques that significantly improve the performance of queries. The energy cost of a query that selects 100 tuples is less than the cost of a single packet transmission. Moving forward, we believe that database techniques will be increasingly important in many emerging applications.
