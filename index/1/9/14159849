Learning in groups have different potential benefits for children. They have the opportunity to solve problems together, to share experiences and to develop social skills. However, from teachers point of view, creating a safe and inclusive positive environment for children is not an simple task since each child has differences that represent a challenge for implementing effectively group dynamics. The focus of this work is the design of a system that motivates children to approach to others and create opportunities of social interaction. The system creates a fun and enjoyable situation that is always supervised by the teacher, who can monitor and change the group dynamics at any moment during the activity.
