There are several applications for which it is important to both detect and communicate changes in data models. For instance, in some mobile robotics applications (e.g. surveillance) a robot needs to detect significant changes in the environment (e.g. a layout change) which it may achieve by comparing current data provided by its sensors with previously acquired data (e.g. map) of the environment. This often constitutes an extremely challenging task due to the large amounts of data that must be compared in real-time. This paper proposes a framework to detect, and represent changes through a compact model. The main steps of the procedure are: multi-scale sampling to reduce the computation burden; change detection based on Gaussian mixture models; fitting superquadrics to detected changes; and refinement and optimization using the split and merge paradigm. Experimental results in various real and simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's feasibility and robustness with large datasets.
