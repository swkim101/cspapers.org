A flexible building-block system is presented which allows setting up arbitrary operational computer networks or changing them with a minimum of effort. It is at present realized as an experimental system based on minicomputers but aimed to utilize microprocessors. The paper deals with the hardware concept, the basic operating system and the software concept. Finally some experiences with regard to programming and system optimization will be described.
