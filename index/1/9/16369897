This paper describes a logical machinery for computing decisions, where the available knowledge on the state of the world is described by a possibilistic propositional logic base (i.e., a collection of logical statements associated with qualitative certainty levels), and where the preferences of the user are also described by another possibilistic logic base whose formula weights are interpreted in terms of priorities. The computed decisions are in agreement with a qualitative counterpart to von Neumann and Morgen-stern theory of decision under uncertainty, recently proposed by two of the authors. Two attitudes are allowed for the decision maker : a pessimistic risk-averse one (one looks for the decision(s) which, for highly plausible states of the world, entail the satisfaction of at least high priority goals), and an optimistic one (what can be inferred plausibly about the consequences of the decision should be consistent with the preferences having high priority).
