Service robotics is becoming a leading application area of human-centered technologies, and the rise of household and personal assistance robots forecasts an utopist world of human--robot collaborative society. Along the road, one of the robotics community's major tasks is to work on the harmonization of trends, standardization of terms, interfaces and technologies. It is important to keep the scientific and social progress under control through sufficient public outreach and technology dissemination. Along those lines, the IEEE Robotics & Automation Society is sponsoring a working group entitled Ontologies for Robotics and Automation that will bridge cutting edge technology to users of the services---the general public. In this paper, the background of the project is presented, the definitions and examples of descriptive systems of relations are described, showing how ontologies can help to address the above challenges.
