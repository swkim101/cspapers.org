The most fundamental of these is determining the sequence of chemical reactions necessary to physically create the drug. Surprisingly, these organic syntheses can be modeled as branching paths in a discrete, fully-observable state space, making the construction of new medicines an application of heuristic search. We describe a model of organic chemistry that is amenable to traditional AI techniques from game tree search, regression, and automatic assembly sequencing. We demonstrate the applicability of AND/OR graph search by developing the first chemistry solver to use proof-number search. Finally, we construct a benchmark suite of organic synthesis problems collected from undergraduate organic chemistry exams, and we analyze our solvers performance both on this suite and in recreating the synthetic plan for a multibillion dollar drug.
