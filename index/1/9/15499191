We investigate whether a memory-based learning procedure can explain the development of expertise within the time-constraints of a fast-paced highly interactive task. Our computational cognitive model begins with novice-like knowledge of a domain, and through experience converges on behavior that matches a pre-existing GOMS model of expert human performance. The model coordinates perception, comprehension, strategic planning, learning, memory, and motor action to respond to the time demands of the task while continually improving its performance. Because the model was constructed within the Soar architecture, it is able to make predictions of learning and performance time.
