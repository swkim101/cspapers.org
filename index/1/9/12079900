Four recent trends have compounded this situation making the one sizefits all design strategy increasingly obsolete. Mobile computers define a dynamic computing world with intermittent communications, time varying capacities and important new cost considerations. Ultra-large interconnections offer a huge diversity of data, and optimal access is dependent on resource limitations, communication connectivity and the userâ€™s needs. High-speed workstation networks must use adaptive resource exploitation to suit the needs of individual applications. Multimedia applications and distributed databases entail differing, and often conflicting, expectations on system services. In each case, run-time flexibility, that is the ability to specialize or optimize, is needed, and the underlying operating system should provide tools to support this flexibility.
