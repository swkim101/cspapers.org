Current-flow and current-density are two major considerations for placement and routing of analog layout synthesis. The current-flow constraints are specified to the critical nets with monotonic current/signal paths to reduce parasitic impacts. The current-density constraints are usually specified on the nets with variable wire widths to avoid the IR-drop and electromigration problems. In this paper, we propose the first work to simultaneously consider current-flow and current-density constraints while placing and routing the analog circuits with minimized chip area, routed wirelength, bend numbers, via counts, and coupling noise at the same time. We first present an enhanced B*-tree representation to simultaneously model modules and interconnects for an analog circuit. Then a simultaneous placement and routing algorithm is presented to generate a layout while satisfying the current-flow and current-density constraints with minimized chip area, routed wirelength, bend numbers, via counts, and coupling noise. Experimental results show that our approach can obtain better layout results and satisfy all specified constraints while optimizing circuit performance.
