A paradigm for representing process information is described. It consists of a simple generic model and a specialization mechanism for customizing the model for any design method. The generic model supports the representation of design arti- facts, steps and heuristics. A specialization of the generic model for JSD is illustrated in detail. The JSD model is then applied to model episodes from a pedagogical design process: the design of a lift system controller.
