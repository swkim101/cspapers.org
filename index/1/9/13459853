Monolithic 3D IC (M3D) has the potential to provide a break-through in the power and performance scaling challenges. We, for the first time, present a comprehensive study of M3D on a commercial design across multiple technology nodes. The performance and power impact of M3D is investigated using a commercial, in-order, 32-bit application processor, implemented on foundry 28nm and 14/16nm process nodes, as well as a predictive 7nm node. We study the factors across the technology nodes that affect the efficiency of M3D, and propose a roadmap for optimum technology and design interaction that will enable the full entitlement of M3D.
