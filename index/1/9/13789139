It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Wiki Workshop at the Web Conference 2018. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers exploring all aspects of Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, and Wikimedia Commons. With members of the Wikimedia Foundation's Research team on the organizing committee and with the experience of successful workshops in 2015, 2016, and 2017, we aim to continue facilitating a direct pathway for exchanging ideas between the organization that coordinates Wikimedia projects and the researchers interested in studying them. We received 17 paper submissions (and counting) from all around the world covering a broad range of topics. Our program committee evaluated them regarding relevance, quality, and novelty, selecting 8 to be presented as posters and published in the workshop proceedings, and numerous others for poster presentation only.
