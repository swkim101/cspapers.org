It is the aim of this paper to investigate a system, which, with no manual or mechanical interference, permits the building, changing, processing and destruction of real (not simulated !) digital hardware.
 It can be seen, that by the above nothing else than a hardware-editor is outlined. Therefore first a “mini-model” of a usual text-editor is given within this paper. Then this model is transferred to problems of the editing of hardware.
 The main problem in particular, i.e. the problem of keeping the timing under control, will be discussed on the basis of an exact algebraic model of the time-behaviour of digital circuits.
 The result of these discussions will be the concept of an automatic hardware-editor.
 Finally a realization of this concept built by the author within the University of Dortmund, W. Germany, will be discussed.
