This work proposes a Human-Comfortable Path Planner (HCoPP) system for autonomous passenger vehicles. The aim is to create a path planner that improves the feeling of comfort of the passenger, this topic is different from collision free planning and it has not received much attention. For this purpose, in addition to the shortest distance constraint conventionally used in path planning, constraints related to relevant environmental features are introduced. For straight segments, the constraint is based on the lane-circulation pattern preferred by humans. In curved segments and intersections, the constraint takes into account the visibility. A multi-layered cost map is proposed to integrate these additional constraints. To compute the human-comfortable path, a graph search algorithm was implemented. The evaluation of the proposed approach was conducted by having 30 participants riding an autonomous robotic wheelchair. The paths computed by the proposed path planner were compared towards a state of the art shortest-distance path planner implemented in the navigation stack of ROS. Experimental results show that the paths computed by the proposed approach are perceived as more comfortable.
