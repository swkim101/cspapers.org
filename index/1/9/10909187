Cellular modems enable ubiquitous Internet connectivities to modern smartphones, but in doing so they become a major contributor to the smartphone energy drain. Understanding modem energy drain requires a detailed power model. The prior art, an RRC-state based power model, was developed primarily to model the modem energy drain of application data transfer. As such, it serves well its original purpose, but is insufficient to study detailed modem behavior, eg. activities in the control plane. In [2], we propose a new methodology of modeling modem power draw behavior at the event-granularity, and develop to our knowledge the first fine-grained modem power model that captures the power draw of all LTE modem radio-on events in different RRC modes. Second, we quantitatively demonstrate the advantages of the new model over the state-based power model under a wide variety of context via controlled experiments. Finally, using our fine-grained modem power model, we perform the first detailed modem energy drain in-the-wild study involving 12 Nexus 6 phones under normal usage by 12 volunteers spanning a total of 348 days. Our study provides the first quantitative analysis of energy drain due to modem control activities in the wild and exposes their correlation with context such as location and user mobility. In this abstracts, we introduce the essence of the methodology and the highlighted results from the in-the-wild study.
