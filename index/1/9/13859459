The DARPA Memex program was established with the goal of funding research into building domain-specific search systems that integrated state-of-the-art focused crawling (domain discovery) information extraction and semantic search, and that could be used by users and domain experts with no programming or technical experience. Domain-specific Insight Graphs (DIG) was proposed and funded under Memex and has led to an end-to-end search system currently being used by over 200 law enforcement for combating human trafficking, by investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US for investigating securities fraud, and for numerous other domains of a difficult, socially consequential (e.g., investigative) and unusual nature.
