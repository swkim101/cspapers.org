Due to its success and popularity, the core lexicon has been translated into Chinese and many other languages. However, the lexicon only contains several thousand of words, which is deficient compared with the number of common words in Chinese. Current approaches often require manually expanding the lexicon, but it often takes too much time and requires linguistic experts to extend the lexicon. To address this issue, we propose to expand the LIWC lexicon automatically. Specifically, we consider it as a hierarchical classification problem and utilize the Sequence-to-Sequence model to classify words in the lexicon. Moreover, we use the sememe information with the attention mechanism to capture the exact meanings of a word, so that we can expand a more precise and comprehensive lexicon. The experimental results show that our model has a better understanding of word meanings with the help of sememes and achieves significant and consistent improvements compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
