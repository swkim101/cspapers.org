This paper addresses the problem of speeding up functional (delay-independent) logic simulation for synchronous digital systems. The problem needs very little new motivation-cycle-based functional simulation is the largest consumer of computing cycles in system design. Most existing simulators for this task can he classified as being either event driven or levelized compiled-code, with the levelized compiled code simulators generally being considered faster for this task. An alternative technique, based on evaluation using branching programs, was suggested about a decade ago in the context of switch level functional simulation. However, this had very limited application since it could not handle the large circuits encountered in practice. This paper resurrects the basic idea present this technique and provides significant modifications that enable its application to contemporary industrial strength circuits. We present experimental results that demonstrate up to a 10X speedup over levelized compiled code simulation for a large suite of benchmark circuits as well as for industrial examples with over 40.000 gates.
