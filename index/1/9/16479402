The rapid advance of semiconductor device technology makes the current computer design tools inadequate. New tools need to be developed. This paper presents the development of a microcomputer design language for us as a tool to microcomputer engineers. Several unique language constructs have been conceived. One is the use of level numbers to permit hierarchical descriptions of a microcomputer; in this way, the descriptions at various degrees of detail can be obtained. Another is the description of interconnections among the chips. A third is the possible provision of three levels of chip descriptions. A most important benefit of using a design language is the use of a simulator for checking out the design. Another possible benefit is the use of a data base which stores chip descriptions. Together with the simulator and the data base, a microcomputer design system could be realized.
