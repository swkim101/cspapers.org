In recent years, as the development of wireless sensor networks, people do some deep research on cluster-based protocol, most about the prolongation of the lifetime of WSN and decline of energy consumed by the sensors .This article analyses the cluster-heads generating algorithm among LEACH and presents improved approach that adjusting the nodes, Threshold function. When non cluster-heads choose optimal cluster-head, they consider comprehensive nodes' residual energy and distance to base-station, then compare their performance, the simulation results show that the new strategy of cluster-heads election achieve great advance in sensor and networks' life-time.
