This paper investigates control schemes for task-space bilateral teleoperation with communication time delays. Teleoperation in task space R3Ã—SO(3) presents some distinctive features different from its joint-space counterpart, i.e., SO(3) is non-convex and bears quite different structure from Euclidean space Rn. Through advisable parametrization of the error attitude matrix between master and slave robots, we propose a new transpose Jacobian control algorithm for bilateral teleoperators with communication time delays. Passivity of the closed-loop teleoperator system is ensured by injecting additional task-space dissipation both at the master and the slave sides to accommodate the detrimental effects of the time delay. Using Lyapunov stability tool and Schwarz inequality, we show passivity of the closed-loop teleoperator system and illustrate the tracking and force-reflecting performance of the teleoperator. Simulation study on a master-slave teleoperator composed of two six-DOF manipulators is performed to illustrate the performance of the proposed control approach.
