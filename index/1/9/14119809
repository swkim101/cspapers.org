In light of recent revelations of mass state surveillance of phone and Internet communications, many solutions now claim to provide secure messaging. This includes both a broad range of new projects and several widely adopted applications that have added security features. However, despite the demand for better solutions, there is no clear winner in the race for widespread development and deployment of messaging products. Recently, the Electronic Frontier Foundation evaluated dozens of messaging tools based on security best practices, and publicized the results via the Secure Messaging Scorecard. Our goal is to expand the scorecard by evaluating messaging tools on a range of usefulness (utility and usability) attributes.
