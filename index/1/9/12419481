Travel route planning aims to mine user's attributes and recommend personalized routes. How to build interest model for users and understand their real intention brings great challenges. This paper presents an approach which mines the user interest model by multi-source social media (e.g., travelogues and check-in records), and understands the user's real intention by active behavior such as point of interest (POI) inputs. In order to unify heterogeneous data from different sources, a topical package is built as the measurement space. Based on the topical package, user topical package is modeled to find user interest and route topical package is constructed to describe the attributes of each route. User's active behavior can also be considered during route planning, where top ranked routes are finally recommended. The proposed multi-source topical package (MSTP) approach is evaluated on a real dataset and compared with two state-of-the-art methods. The result shows that MSTP performs better for providing personalized travel routes.
