Formal verification is becoming a useful means of validating designs. We have developed a methodology for formally verifying dataintensive circuits (e.g., processors) with sophisticated timing (e.g., pipelining) against high-level declarative specifications. Previously, formally verifying a microprocessor required the use of an automatic theorem prover, but our technique requires little more than a symbolic simulator. We have formally verified a pre-existing 16-bit CISC microprocessor circuit extracted from the fabricated layout.
