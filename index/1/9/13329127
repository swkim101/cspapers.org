We present the system nFOIL. It tightly integrates the naive Bayes learning scheme with the inductive logic programming rule-learner FOIL. In contrast to previous combinations, which have employed naive Bayes only for post-processing the rule sets, nFOIL employs the naive Bayes criterion to directly guide its search. Experimental evidence shows that nFOIL performs better than both its base line algorithm FOIL or the post-processing approach, and is at the same time competitive with more sophisticated approaches.
