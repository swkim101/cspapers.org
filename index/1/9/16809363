We describe a web-based programming environment designed to support teaching introductory programming for a massive open online class. We discuss some of the thought processes behind the design of this environment and then focus on two key innovations incorporated in our environment: a simplified GUI library for interactive Python programming and a browser-based tool for visualizing the execution of event-driven Python programs.
