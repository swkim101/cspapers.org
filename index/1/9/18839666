The paper presents a driving simulator of a combat vehicle aimed for driver-vehicle interaction studies and design of a full-scale driving simulator. The simulator incorporates a real-time combat vehicle dynamics simulation module, a graphical presentation module, a robotic seat motion system, and a haptic steering system. The simulation module simulates dynamic motion and interaction with the environment of a combat vehicle in real-time. The graphical presentation module generates driving scenes that are displayed on a screen by a back projection. The robotic system generates seat motion cues by means of a three degree-of-freedom hydraulically driven mechanism. The force feedback steering system built on the basis of a torque controlled induction motor is an interface between the driver and the simulator. The developed driving simulator is validated through comparison of motion and force feedback responses with those measured with real vehicle when performing standard test manoeuvres. The results verify matching in simulated and real driving environments.
