The focus of this article is on identifying what is known about the processes found in free and open source software development (F/OSSD) projects. The results and findings from a survey of empirical studies of F/OSSD give rise to an interesting variety of opportunities and challenges for modeling and simulating these processes, which are identified along the way. The article also presents a framework for organizing new studies according to their research focus, sampling strategy, data collection methods, modeling and simulation approach, and the strategy used to assure the quality of the modeling and simulation results. This framework thus serves to help guide research into F/OSSD processes in ways that maximize and bound their contribution.
