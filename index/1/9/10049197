With the advances of sensory, satellite and mobile communication technologies in recent decades, locational data become widely available. A lot of work has been developed to find useful information from these data, and various approaches have been proposed. In this work, we aim to use one specific type of locational data -- network connection logs of mobile devices, which is widely available and easily accessible to telecom companies, to identify and extract active areas of users. This is a challenging topic due to the existence of inaccurate location and fluctuating log time intervals of this kind of data. In order to observe user behavior from this kind of data set, we propose a new algorithm, namely Behavior Observation Tool (BOT), which uses Convex Hull Algorithm with sliding time windows to model the user's movement, and thus knowledge about the user's lifestyle and habits can extracted from the mobile device network logs.
