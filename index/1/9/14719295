The goal of the Warp Programming Environment (WPE) is to provide easy access to the Warp machine, a parallel supercomputer with a peak performance of 100 MFLOPS that is based on the systolic array architecture. The Warp Programming Environment offers a uniform environment for editing, compiling, debugging and executing Warp programs. It is based on an extensible shell written in Common Lisp and a runtime system written in C. It runs on a network of SUN-3 workstations under UNIX 4.2. This paper describes how the program development environment interacts with the Warp machine to support the development and execution of real-time programs on Warp.
