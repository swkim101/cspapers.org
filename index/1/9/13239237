A prototyped data mining system, DBLearn, has been developed, which efficiently and effectively extracts different kinds of knowledge rules from relational databases. It has the following features: high level learning interfaces, tightly integrated with commercial relational database systems, automatic refinement of concept hierarchies, efficient discovery algorithms and good performance. Substantial extensions of its knowledge discovery power towards knowledge mining in object-oriented, deductive and spatial databases are under research and development.
