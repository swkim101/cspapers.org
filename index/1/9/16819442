Understanding the security of encryption methods has been a major area of research in both modern and tradit ional cryptography. We investigate the relation between notions of security for symmetric (private) key encryption. The security goals of both indistinguishabili ty and non-malleabili ty are considered, each under all possible combinations of adaptive or n0n-adaptive chosen-plaintext and chosen-ciphertext attacks. We are thus able to construct a complete hierarchy of private-key security notions indicating equivalences, separations, and incomparabilities. Perhaps the most surprising result, which has no analogue in the public-key setting, is that adaptive access to an encryption oracle does not help the adversary. That is, any scheme which can be broken (in polynomial time) with an adaptive chosen plaintext at tack can be broken (in polynomial time) with a non-adaptive chosen plaintext attack. This holds under all security notions.
