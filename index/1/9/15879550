The choice of collision control algorithm has an effect on the performance of Ethernet. A linear incremental backoff algorithm is proposed and its performance is compared to the binary exponential backoff algorithm. Two variations of Ethernets are used in the comparison: one treats data and acknowledgement packets equally; the other gives priority to acknowledgement packets. The maximum throughputs achieveable by both variations are derived. The performance of both variations is then evaluated by discrete simulation. The evaluation is based on a Ethernet model with uniform or biased traffic.
