Network vulnerability and infection rates are key factors in mathematical models of botnet propagation dynamics, which in turn are increasingly deemed to have potential for playing an important role in various botnet mitigation strategies. In this paper we discuss research that draws on epidemiological models in biology in order to solve the problem of how to estimate network vulnerability and infection rates in relation to a botnet. This research provides botnet propagation models with concrete measures that make those models practical, and hence employable in mitigation of real world botnets in a timely fashion. The proposed estimation approach is based on random sampling and follows a novel application of statistical learning and inference in a botnet-versus-network setting. We have implemented this research in the Matlab programming language, and thus in the paper we also discuss an experimental validation of the effectiveness of this research with respect to realistically simulated botnet propagation dynamics in a GTNetS network simulation platform.
