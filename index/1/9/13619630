Matching people across non-overlapping camera views, known as person re-identification, is challenging due to the lack of spatial and temporal constraints and large visual appearance changes caused by variations in view angle, lighting, background clutter and occlusion. To address these challenges, most previous approaches aim to extract visual features that are both distinctive and stable under appearance changes. However, most visual features and their combinations under realistic conditions are neither stable nor distinctive thus should not be used indiscriminately. In this paper, we propose to formulate person re-identification as a distance learning problem, which aims to learn the optimal distance that can maximises matching accuracy regardless the choice of representation. To that end, we introduce a novel Probabilistic Relative Distance Comparison (PRDC) model, which differs from most existing distance learning methods in that, rather than minimising intra-class variation whilst maximising intra-class variation, it aims to maximise the probability of a pair of true match having a smaller distance than that of a wrong match pair. This makes our model more tolerant to appearance changes and less susceptible to model over-fitting. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that 1) by formulating the person re-identification problem as a distance learning problem, notable improvement on matching accuracy can be obtained against conventional person re-identification techniques, which is particularly significant when the training sample size is small; and 2) our PRDC outperforms not only existing distance learning methods but also alternative learning methods based on boosting and learning to rank.
