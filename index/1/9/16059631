Halftone visual cryptography is an encryption mechanism that a secret image is encoded into halftone shares for showing meaningful images. You only need to superimpose part of these share images. Then, images can be shown the original confidential. In this paper, we propose an encoding scheme to improve the efficiency of visual secret sharing technology. We use the relative location information of secret information pixel in the shared image to enable them to produce better quality images for sharing. In addition, we also provide our experimental results to illustrate and validate our improved methods are better than the traditional methods.
