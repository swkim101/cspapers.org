We present an approach for development of a decoder for any complex binary error-correcting code (ECC) via training from examples of decoded received words. Our decoder is a connectionist architecture. We describe two separate solutions: A system-level solution (the Cascaded Networks Decoder); and the ECC-Enhanced Decoder, a solution which simplifies the mapping problem which must be solved for decoding. Although both solutions meet our basic approach constraint for simplicity and compactness, only the ECC-Enhanced Decoder meets our second basic constraint of being a generic solution.
