The Bus Switch mechanism is a recently proposed bus encoding technique for low-power off-chip data buses. The approach is based on clustering, reordering and encoding the bus input lines according to a reordering pattern and a fixed coding function. This work presents a statistical approach for reducing the hardware overhead of the bus switch technique, by operating with a sub-set of the possible reordering patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach by ANSI C simulations, measuring the average switching activity savings. Our results show a modest switching activity degradation while saving 90% computation time, thus obtaining a suboptimal encoder configuration satisfactory for a large variety of benchmarks.
