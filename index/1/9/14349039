Data Dictionaries (DD) contain crucial information about the (technical) meaning of words used in a certain company. In linguistics a lexicon contains syntactic and semantic information about words used in the society. In this paper we study the possibility y of structuring a Data Dictionary as if it were a lexicon. The results of this study have successfully been applied to a Data Dictionary of a large Dutch company. It was possible to generate Natural Language (Dutch) sentences from the definitions of the words (concepts) in the lexicon, replacing the fixed strings originally put in the Data Dictionary.
