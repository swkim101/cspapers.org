This paper presents a method of topological representation and classification in home environment using only low-cost sonar sensors. Approximate cell decomposition and normalized graph cut are applied to sonar gridmap to extract graphical model of the environment. The extracted model represents spatial relation of the environment appropriately by segmenting several subregions. Moreover, node classification is achieved by applying template matching method to a local gridmap. Rotational invariant matching is used to obtain candidate location for each node and the true node can be classified by considering detail distance information. The proposed method extracts well-structured topological model of the environment and classification also results in reliable matching even under the uncertain and sparse sonar data. Experimental results verify the performance of proposed environmental modeling and classification in real home environment.
