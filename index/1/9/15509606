NonStop SQL is an implementation of ANSI/ISO SQL on Tandem Computer systems. In its second release, NonStop SQL transparently and automatically implements parallelism within an SQL statement. This parallelism allows query execution speed to increase almost linearly as processors and discs are added to the system -speedup. In addition, this parallelism can help jobs restricted to a fixed "batch window". When the job doubles in size, its elapsed processing time will not change if proportionately more equipment is available to process the job -scaleup. This paper describes the parallelism features of NonStop SQL and an audited benchmark that demonstrates these speedup and scaleup claims. Table of
