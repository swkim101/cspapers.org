In this document, we study the problem of optimally placing a mixture of directional and omnidirectional cameras. In our solution, the workspace is represented by an occupancy grid map [1]. Then, using surface-projected workspace and camera perception models, we develop a binary integer programming algorithm. The results of the algorithm are applied successfully to a variety of simulated scenarios.
