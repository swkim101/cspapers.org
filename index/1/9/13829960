This paper addresses human-home interaction mediated by everyday objects, with a particular focus on wrist watches. Everyday wrist-worn devices are turned into flexible home access points by exploiting a modular architecture independent from the underlying home automation system, and from the specific watch device, provided that the necessary capabilities are available. A first working prototype based on a cost-effective consumer watch is presented, and experimental results confirm the viability of the approach.
