Recently, a number of main memory algorithms for detecting the changes to XML data have been proposed. These approaches are not suitable for detecting changes to large XML document as it requires a lot of memory to keep the two versions of XML documents in the memory. We have developed a novel XML change detection system, called XANADUE that uses traditional relational database engines for detecting changes to large XML data. In this approach, we store the XML documents in the relational database and issue SQL queries (whenever appropriate) to detect the changes. This demonstration will showcase the functionality of our system and the effectiveness of XML change detection in relational environment.
