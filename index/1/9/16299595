A new framework for evaluating Multicast Ordering protocols is presented. It allows to compare solutions to the problem of ordering multicast messages in an identical way at all receiving sites when multiple senders operate concurrently. A new type of delay measure called Synchronization Delay forms the basis for this framework. It filters out network-dependent factors and accounts precisely for the excess delay that user messages suffer in order to achieve the ordering property. The usefulness of the evaluation framework is demonstrated by applying it to three protocols covered in the literature. As an example their delay behavior is analyzed for low-traffic environments. The evaluation results allow a user to choose the most suitable protocol for his application.
