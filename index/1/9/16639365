We present our framework called DUCS. DUCS supports on-the-fly updates of distributed component-based applications. DUCS has a layered architecture running on top of a virtual machine extended with a support for object unload and replacement. DUCS is a meta-level framework, so the impact on the application's implementation is minimal. It supports dynamic component replacement, state transfer among components, interface modifications, and automatic propagation of updates. The framework is expandable and can be applied to many programming languages as well as many hardware platforms.
