Microblogging websites, e.g. Twitter and Sina Weibo, have become a popular platform for socializing and sharing information in recent years. Spammers have also discovered this new opportunity to unfairly overpower normal users with unsolicited content, namely social spams. While it is intuitive for everyone to follow legitimate users, recent studies show that both legitimate users and spammers follow spammers for different reasons. Evidence of users seeking for spammers on purpose is also observed. We regard this behavior as a useful information for spammer detection. In this paper, we approach the problem of spammer detection by leveraging the "carefulness" of users, which indicates how careful a user is when she is about to follow a potential spammer. We propose a framework to measure the carefulness, and develop a supervised learning algorithm to estimate it based on known spammers and legitimate users. We then illustrate how spammer detection can be improved in the aid of the proposed measure. Evaluation on a real dataset with millions of users and an online testing are performed on Sina Weibo. The results show that our approach indeed capture the carefulness, and it is effective to detect spammers. In addition, we find that the proposed measure is also beneficial for other applications, e.g. link prediction.
