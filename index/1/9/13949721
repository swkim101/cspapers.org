We demonstrate an unifying graph-based model for representing the infrastructure, behavior and missions of an enterprise. We introduce an algorithm for recommending resilience establishing actions based on dynamic updates to the models and show its effectiveness both through software simulation as well as live demonstration inside a cloud testbed. Our demonstrate will illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm for preserving latency based quality of service (QoS).
