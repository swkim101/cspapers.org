Numerous systems for ranked retrieval on text databases have been implemented by both information retrieval researchers and in the commercial sector. In contrast, software for text categorization, message filtering, textual data mining, and related tasks is less common. ATTICS is an extensible text classification system we have implemented in C++. It supports incremental training and online application of classifiers and predictive models to streams of textual, numeric, symbolic, and hybrid data records. An object-oriented design allows easy addition of new preprocessors, machine learning algorithms, and classifier types.
