Most automatic programming research has focused on programs which terminate and which produce output values upon termination. By contrast, programs which operate on streams of data usually do not terminate and usually produce streams of output data during execution. Such stream programs may be specified with a technique which is a generalization of specification techniques for conventional programs The use of transformations also seems to be an appropriate technique for automatically synthesizing stream programs.
