A major roadblock that learners of the Japanese language encounter is the complex writing system which uses two different syllabaries (hiragana and katakana) in addition to thousands of characters originally borrowed from China (the kanji.) These characters can be very complex graphically and usually have several pronunciations (named onyomi and kunyomi, the first being derived from Chinese.) Achieving full literacy in Japanese means knowing more than 2,000 kanjiâ€“an intimidating prospect. Moreover, learning kanji traditionally takes years of education (from grade school through high school) and relies mostly on rote memorization, through incessant homework and tests. Such a process, and by extension the related learning material, are inadequate for most foreign learners. Our goal is to provide tools to help overcome literacy problems, by means of a twofold approach. The first aspect is automatic transliteration of Japanese text, allowing an easier way to read electronic text. The second aspect is a graphetic kanji dictionary which describes every kanji in terms of its graphical components (using XML and SVG), allowing for many interesting applications.
