Alphabet Independent Two Dimensional Matching Amihood Amir* Gary Bensont Martin Farach$ Georgia Tech Univ. of Maryland DIMACS There are many solutions to the string matching pmZllem whkh are strictly linear in the input size and independent ofalphabet.size. Furthermore, the model of computation for these algorithms is very weak: they allow only simple arithmetic and comparisons of equality between characters of the input. In contrast, algorithm for two dimensional matching have needed stronger models of computation, most notably assuming a totally ordered alphabet. The fastest algorithms for two dimensional matching have therefore had a logarithmic dependence on the alphabet size. In the worst case, this givea an algorithm that runs in 0(n2 log m) with 0(rn2 log m) preprocessing. We show an algorithm for two dimensional matching with an 0(n2) text scanning phase. Furthermore, the text scan requires no special assumptions about the alphabet, i.e. it runs on the same model as standard linear time string matching algorithm. the *College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332-0280; (404) 853-0083; amir@cc.gatecb. edu; Partially supported by NSF ~ant IR.I-90-13055. tDept. of Computer Scienee, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742; (301) 405-2715; benaon@cs.umd.edq Partially supported by NSF grant IRI-90-13055. :DIMACS, Box 1179, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08855; (808) 932-592% farach@Xhu.acs.mtgers.edw, Supported by DIMACS under NSF contract STC-88-09648.
