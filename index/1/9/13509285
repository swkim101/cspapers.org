This paper gives an overview of the different levels of sensor processing complexity found in force controlled tasks, and explains which techniques from Bayesian probability theory are appropriate to cope with uncertainties and missing information at each of the different levels. The paper reduces all approaches for "intelligent" compliant, motion sensor processing to a basis set of just four classes. Some of these algorithms have already been tested experimentally, while others are still beyond the current state-of-the-art. The major contribution of this paper is to bring a clear structure to the field, which should eventually result in an easier integration of different research results, and a more precise discussion about their relative merits and innovations.
