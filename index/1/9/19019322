Wave variables are a very popular approach for dealing with communication delay in bilateral teleoperation because of their effectiveness and of their simplicity. Nevertheless, the inherent dynamics of wave based communication channels is often deleterious for the transparency of the teleoperation system. Recently proposed architectures like TDPN, PSPM and two layers approach allow to achieve a high transparency at the price of a complex architecture, with some parameters to tune empirically. In this paper we propose a novel wave based architecture that blends the high performance that can be achieved by recently proposed architectures with the simplicity of wave based bilateral teleoperation.
