We have been made aware of a number of development programs for computer aided or assisted design. For example, work is going on under the direction of Prof. S. A. Coons at M. I. T. toward the development of a three-dimensional version of Ivan Sutherland's “Sketchpad” system. Also at M.I.T. under the guidance of Douglas T. Ross a new modular compiler for universal design application is being developed.
 The realization that topographical information can be communicated with more speed and accuracy by graphical means initiated work on these and many similar programs. Such communication might greatly augment the usefulness of complex applications programs of the type described by Drs. H. Simpson and J. Antebi in their report “Framed Structure Analysis”(1). A designer could observe loadings on a structure and could change parameters more quickly in a graphical environment.
