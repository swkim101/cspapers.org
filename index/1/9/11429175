It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2015 ACM Workshop Artificial Intelligence and Security (AISec 2015) - the eight annual workshop addressing technologies that fuse intelligent systems into computer security applications and the implications of these approaches. The workshop's aim is to advance research at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, privacy and security. In particular, AISec gives researchers and practitioners working within one or more of those fields a platform for interdisciplinary discussion, which would otherwise be lacking. Hopefully, the workshop leads to a high degree of cross-pollination between groups working across these areas. The papers to be presented in this year's program span topics ranging from adversarial learning, detecting fake OSN accounts, malware classification to privacy preserving data processing and game theoretic techniques in adversarial learning. We are delighted to again be co-located with the premier ACM Computer and Communication Security (CCS 2015) conference. This year we had 25 submissions from Asia, Europe and North America. After a rigorous reviewing process, involving at 2-3 referees per paper, 11 papers were accepted for presentation at the workshop, including presentation-only papers.
