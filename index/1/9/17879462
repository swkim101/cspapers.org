We present a light, actuated smart staff with 5DOF tip force sensing which can be used by a humanoid robot operating in challenging terrain. The staff has an extension mechanism that employs mechanical multiplexing to achieve a high extension ratio in a stiff and compact package. The tip force sensor uses two metal diaphragms to achieve decoupling of axial and radial forces and the ability to tune the maximum range of forces in each direction independently. With the force sensor, the robot can characterize the coefficient of friction and orientation of a surface with simple motion primitives. Two sets of experiments were conducted with the smart staff manipulated by a 7 DOF robot arm. Using the sensor, the robot was able to determine the orientations of sloped surfaces within two degrees in two orthogonal directions.
