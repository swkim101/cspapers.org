In these problems, communication may require both inter-processor communication and le I/O. We show that in certain cases, extra le I/O incurred in communication can be completely eliminated by reordering in-core computations. The in-core computation pattern is decided by: (1) how the out-of-core data distributed into in-core slabs (tiling) and (2) how the slabs are accessed. We show that a compiler using the stencil and processor information can choose the tiling parameters and schedule the tile accesses so that the extra le I/O is eliminated and overall performance is improved.
