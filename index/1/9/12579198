Computer based toggle switches cart be very confusing. The most common problem encountered is the confusion between state indication and possible action labe~ does the label ON indicates the state of the device or does it indicate the resulting state when the toggle is activated? Another common problem comes from the difficulty of deciding what to do to change the state of the device. The design needs to signal to the user the appropriate activity necessary to perform the desired action. For example, Valk showed that users were confused by a design which showed a slider switch where only touches on the end of the slider were permitted, but “sliding” was not possible [5],
