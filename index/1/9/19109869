One popular approach for this is to train small student networks to mimic larger and deeper teacher models, rather than directly learn from the training data. We propose a novel technique to train student-teacher networks without directly providing label information to the student. However, our main contribution is to learn how to learn from the teacher by a unique strategy---having the student compete with a discriminator.
