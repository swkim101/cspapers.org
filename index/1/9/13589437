This paper presents our study over the effect of Complementary Energy Feedback on Virtual Slope Walking, while Virtual Slope Walking is our new biped gait generation method inspired by Passive Dynamic Walking. The energy feedback strength is defined and the walking is modeled as a step-to-step function. The Jacobi Matrix eigenvalues of the function are calculated together with the basin of attraction. From the analysis, we find the characteristic of Complementary Energy Feedback is being effective on a fast gait but weak on a slow one. By making use of the Complementary Energy Feedback in walking experiment, our robot achieves speed change from 1.5leg/s to 4.1leg/s.
