We study a new problem---the wakeup problem---that seems to be fundamental in distributed computing. We present efficient solutions to the problem and show how these solutions can be used to solve the consensus problem, the leader-election problem, and other related problems. The main question we try to answer is ``How much memory is needed to solve the wakeup problem?'' We assume a model that captures important properties of real systems that have been largely ignored by previous work on cooperative problems.
