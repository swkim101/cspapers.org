An important problem in accessing and updating large scale data bases is the determination of when to reorganize the data and eliminate records that have been flagged for deletion but have not as yet been physically deleted. Such records take up valuable storage space and cause a degradation of access times to the active records, mainly because of the necessity to maintain overflow areas. After a certain length of time it is usually desirable to merge the old data and its overflow areas into a new data base of the original format, thus reallocating the physical storage for maximum efficiency within the constraints imposed by the data base organization. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of various system and user parameters on the choice of optimal reorganization points over a wide range of file organizations and user applications. The analysis of file reorganization is seen as a first step toward understanding large scale data base reorganization.
