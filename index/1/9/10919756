This paper suggests an architectural approach of representing knowledge graph for complex question-answering. There are four kinds of entity relations added to our knowledge graph: syntactic dependencies, semantic role labels, named entities, and coreference links, which can be effectively applied to answer complex questions. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how our knowledge graph can be used to solve complex questions such as arithmetics. Our experiment shows a promising result on solving arithmetic questions, achieving the 3folds cross-validation score of 71.75%.
