Discovering and acquiring appropriate, complex resource collections in large-scale distributed computing environments is a fundamental challenge and is critical to application performance. This paper presents a new formulation of the resource selection problem and a new solution to the resource selection and binding problem called integrated selection and binding. Composition operators in our resource description language and efficient data organization enable our approach to allocate complex resource collections efficiently and effectively even in the presence of competition for resources. Our empirical evaluation shows that the integrated approach can produce solutions of significantly higher quality at higher success rate and lower cost than the traditional separate approach. The success rate of the integrated approach can tolerate as much as 15%-60% lower resource availability than the separate approach. Moreover, most requests have at least the 98th percentile rank and can be served in 6 seconds with a population of 1 million hosts
