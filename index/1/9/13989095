The Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences at Stanford (IMSSS) has developed a synthesis system, MISS (Microprogrammed Intoned Speech Synthesizer), designed to test the effectiveness of computer-generated speech in the context of complex CAI programs. No one method of computer controlled speech production is completely satisfactory for all the uses of computer-assisted instruction (CAI). The choice of synthesis method is strongly related to the kinds of curriculums and instructional designs that will use speech. We chose to use acoustic modelling by linear predictive coding as the method of synthesis for MISS.(1)
 In Section 2 we describe criteria appropriate for organizing the comparison of voice response systems for use with instructional computers. Then we describe the particular requirements imposed by curriculums at IMSSS, review general voice synthesis techniques, and finally discuss our actual choice. In Sections 3 and 4 we outline the hardware and software that have been created to support MISS in operational CAI at Stanford.
 In Section 5 we discuss the applications of audio to CAI.
