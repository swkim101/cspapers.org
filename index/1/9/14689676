This paper presents the architecture of Almond, an open, crowdsourced, privacy-preserving and programmable virtual assistant for online services and the Internet of Things (IoT). Included in Almond is Thingpedia, a crowdsourced public knowledge base of natural language interfaces and open APIs. Our proposal addresses four challenges in virtual assistant technology: generality, interoperability, privacy, and usability. Generality is addressed by crowdsourcing Thingpedia, while interoperability is provided by ThingTalk, a high-level domain-specific language that connects multiple devices or services via open APIs. For privacy, user credentials and user data are managed by our open-source ThingSystem, which can be run on personal phones or home servers. Finally, we address usability by providing a natural language interface, whose capability can be extended via training with the help of a menu-driven interface. We have created a fully working prototype, and crowdsourced a set of 187 functions across 45 different kinds of devices. Almond is the first virtual assistant that lets users specify trigger-action tasks in natural language. Despite the lack of real usage data, our experiment suggests that Almond can understand about 40% of the complex tasks when uttered by a user familiar with its capability.
