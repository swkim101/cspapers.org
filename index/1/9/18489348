A formalism will be presented in this paper which makes it possible to realise the idea of assigning only one scope-ambiguous representation to a sentence that is ambiguous with regard to quantifier scope. The scope determination results in extending this representation with additional context and world knowledge conditions. If there is no scope determining information, the formalism can work further with this scope-ambiguous representation. Thus scope information does not have to be completely determined.
