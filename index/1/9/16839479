Transitioning capability and high payload capacity are problems for climbing robots. To increase the possible applications for climbing robots, these two abilities are required. We present a new climbing robotic platform named “Combot” to achieve both transitioning capability and high payload capacity. The robot is composed of three main modules with flexible magnetic treads, connecting links with torsion springs and torque-controlled motors, and an active tail at the end of the robot. The robot can perform internal and external transitions using compliant torques from the torsion springs and the active tail. The compliant torques are changed according to external structures; thus, a complex feedback controller is not required. The payload capacity of the robot is measured by 10 kg (1.56 times the robot mass) during flat surface vertical climbing. The robot is expected to be used to move heavy materials to high places in the ship building industry.
