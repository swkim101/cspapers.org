In this paper, we propose a new method that can remove view-disturbing noises from images of dynamic scenes. One of the thorny problems in outdoor surveillance by a camera is that adherent noises such as waterdrops or mud blobs on the protecting glass surface lens disturb the view from the camera. Therefore, we propose a method for removing adherent noises from images of dynamic scenes taken by changing the direction of a pan-tilt camera, which is often used for surveillance. Our method is based on the comparison of two images, a reference image and a second image taken by a different camera angle. The latter image is transformed by a projective transformation and subtracted from the reference image to extract the regions of adherent noises and moving objects. The regions of adherent noises in the reference image are identified by examining the shapes and distances of regions existing in the subtracted image. Finally, regions of adherent noises can be eliminated by merging two images. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method.
