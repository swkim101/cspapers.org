The paper describes a package that can be used to present the parsing algorithms. The package fully animates the top-down LL(1) and bottom-up SLR(1) parsing algorithms. By full animation we mean that the input string being parsed, the corresponding actions that take place in the stack, and the building of the parse tree are all simultaneously animated on the same screen, thus enabling the user to get a full appreciation of all the intricate details that occur during parsing. The package makes use of XTANGO and can be used in the beginning of the semester as a teaching tool. Later, the students could be asked to write their own animations of the compiling process.
