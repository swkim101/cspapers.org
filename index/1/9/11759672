In this paper we describe some of the key technologies of a mobile manipulator that are used for package transportation in a pharmaceutical warehouse. The paper presents, beyond the functional aspects of the system, the main modules of the software that controls the mobile manipulator. The robot is a demonstrator of technologies for transporting safely and efficiently goods in partially structured, dynamic and public environments. Several issues are discussed such as the design and integration of mechanical elements, the development of non invasive localization and guidance procedures, the design and control of grasping devices for specific box/storage combinations, and the development of testing, verification and validation procedures satisfying strict pharmaceutical regulations. Results of the laboratory tests demonstrate the capability of the prototype.
