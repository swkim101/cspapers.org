The probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) is built upon a global linear mapping, with which it is insufficient to model complex data variation. This paper proposes a mixture of bilateral-projection probabilistic principal component analysis model (mixB2DPPCA) on 2D data. With multi-components in the mixture, this model can be seen as a 'soft' cluster algorithm and has capability of modeling data with complex structures. A Bayesian inference scheme has been proposed based on the variational EM (Expectation-Maximization) approach for learning model parameters. Experiments on some publicly available databases show that the performance of mixB2DPPCA has been largely improved, resulting in more accurate reconstruction errors and recognition rates than the existing PCA-based algorithms.
