Promoting CAD techniques within industry encounters usually three stumbling blocks:
 - the use of conventional computer tools requires acquaintance with intricate “indications for use” with too much of a computer flavor. Potential users are reluctant to accept this “unnecessary” burden which might make their job more difficult and wipe out expected gains in time and efficiency.
 - cost for using and developping computer tools is, as a rule, high. Frequently, this cost is perceived by users, having to operate with a tight budget, as mere extra expenses to be added to those entailed by the different steps in their specific engineering work.
 - there is common tendency among engineers to consider their work as very specific and not amenable to general methods. In particular, non-creative steps in the design process are underestimated; design engineers are confident in their ability to easily create, in due time, the tools, and especially computing tools, that they will need.
 A “distressing” feature of the above difficulties is that it does not seem feasible to eradicate them simultaneously. As a matter of fact, any solution for eliminating one tends to reenforce the two remaining ones.
 The BAL system presented in this paper corresponds to a tradeoff taking into account inclinations of software engineers, needs of designers in an industrial environnement, and available financial resources. This systems is aimed at smoothing away the above difficulties in the particular context of the THOMSON-CSF group, a large electronics concern.
