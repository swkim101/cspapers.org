Due to successful modeling attacks against arbiter PUFs (Physically Unclonable Functions), the trend towards consideration of XOR arbiter PUFs has emerged. Nevertheless, it has already been demonstrated that even this new non-linear structure, with a restricted number of parallel arbiter chains, is still vulnerable to more advanced modeling attacks and side channel analyses. However, so far the security of XOR arbiter PUFs with a large number of parallel arbiter chains has not been appropriately assessed. Furthermore, as another countermeasure against modeling and physical attacks, the concept of controlled PUFs, i.e., with a limited access to challenges and responses, has also been developed. Towards a better understanding of the security of XOR arbiter PUFs, the present paper simultaneously addresses all above mentioned countermeasures by introducing a novel attack, which is a combination of a lattice basis reduction attack and a photonic side channel analysis. We present how our new attack can be successfully launched against XOR arbiter PUFs with an arbitrarily large number of parallel arbiter chains. Most interestingly, our attack does not require any access to challenges or responses. Finally, by conducting an exhaustive discussion on our experimental results, the practical feasibility of our attack scenario is proved as well.
