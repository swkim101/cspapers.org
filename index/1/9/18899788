Microblogs contain the most up-to-date and abundant opinion information on current events. Aspect-based opinion mining is a good way to get a comprehensive summarization of events. The most popular aspect based opinion mining models are used in the field of product and service. However, existing models are not suitable for event mining. In this paper we propose a novel probabilistic generative model (ASEM) to simultaneously discover aspects and the specified opinions. ASEM incorporate a sequence labeling model(CRF) into a generative topic model. Additionally, we adopt a set of features for separating aspects and sentiments. Moreover, we novelly present a continuously learning model. It can utilize the knowledge of one event to learn another, and get a better performance. We use five real world events to do experiment. The experimental results show that ASEM extracts aspects and sentiments well, and ASEM outperforms other state-of-art models and the intuitive two-step method.
