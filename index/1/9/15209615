With recent declines in the cost of semiconductor memory and the increasing need for high performance I/O disk systems, it makes sense to consider the design of large caches. In this paper, we consider the effect of caching writes. We show that cache sizes in the range of a few percent allow writes to be performed at negligible or no cost and independently of locality considerations.
