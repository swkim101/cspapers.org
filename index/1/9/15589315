This paper addresses the problem of relational queries processing in the domain based database machine DBMAC. A brief description of the storage organisation of the domain based DBMS is first given. Then the operating principles of the domain based data-model, called D-model, is described through some examples. The central part of the paper deals with the translation of relational queries into operations on objects of the D-model. Objects of the D-model and a set of operations on these objects are first defined : this set S of operations is shown to be complete in that any relational query can be translated into D-model operations belonging to S.Finally we give a method for processing relation queries using D-model operations.The basic advantages to be expected from a domain based physical organization of data are :1. fast equi-join execution,2. a compact representation of intermediate results.The latter should lead to efficient processing of complex queries, provided a powerful parallel physical architecture is chosen for implementation.
