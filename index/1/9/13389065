We design and develop DNS X-Ray which performs analyses of DNS platforms on the networks where it is invoked. The analysis identifies the caches and the IP addresses used by the DNS platform, fingerprints the DNS software on the caches, and evaluates vulnerabilities allowing injection of spoofed records into the caches. DNS X-Ray is the first tool to perform an extensive analysis of the caching component on the DNS platforms. In addition, DNS X-Ray also provides statistics from previous invocations, enabling networks to check which for popular DNS software on the caches, the number of caches typically used on DNS platforms and more. We set up DNS X-Ray online, it can be accessed via a website http://www.dns.xray.sit.fraunhofer.de.
