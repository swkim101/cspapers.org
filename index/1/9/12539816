In this paper, we present a new routing approach for MCMs in which the routing space is partitioned into several towers. The routing is carried out in three steps. In the first step, the routing density is uniformly distributed over the three dimensional routing space. In the next step, the exact locations of nets on the faces of each tower are determined. Finally, the exact paths for the nets in each tower are determined and routed. Unlike the traditional MCM routing which converts the three dimensional routing problem into a set of two dimensional routing problems, our approach decomposes the problem into a set of smaller, yet three dimensional tower routing problems. Experimental results show the validity of our methodology.
