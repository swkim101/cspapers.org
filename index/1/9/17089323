Link elasticity is commonly understood to be a detrimental side-effect of imperfect mechanical designs of robotic arms and comparable machinery. In contrast to this notion, this paper demonstrates a novel approach to exploit intrinsic robot link compliance in order to estimate a priori unknown payload masses, measure and also control end effector forces. In this way, the intrinsic link elasticity can be seen as an enabler for new sensing and control capabilities instead of a purely detrimental effect.
