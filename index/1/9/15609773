This paper describes an algorithm for determining if an event occurs persistently within an interval where the interval is periodic but the event is not. The goal of the algorithm is to identify events with this property and also determine the minimum interval in which they occur. This solution is geared towards discovering human routines by considering the triggering of simple sensors over a diverse set of spatial and temporal scales. After describing the problem and the proposed solution, in this paper we demonstrate using testbed data and simulations that this approach uncovers components of routines by identifying which events are parts of the same routine through their temporal properties.
