This paper reports a novel capillary microgripper. The microgripper is fabricated from silicon using deep reactive ion etching and is designed to be especially suitable for self-alignment. The gripper is shown to retain its self-alignment capabilities even when the head of the gripper does not match the size of the component. This mechanism is analyzed using numerical simulations and tested in pick-and-place experiments using commercial laser diode components. The advantage of the capillary microgripper has been demonstrated in picking and aligning microchips from adhesive films, which requires substantial picking force.
