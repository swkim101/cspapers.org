In this paper~ we focus on techniques for incremen- tal constraint-based configuration with discrete and continuous variables. We show how to formalize constraint knowledge using compatibility and activ- ity constraints (Mittal 1990) and how this knowl- edge is used for reasoning within an intelligent CAD system. Most technical as opposed to spatial constraint configuration systems use algorithms for solving discrete problems (Haselboeck 1994). claim that configuration is both di.~cre~e and con- ~inuous in nature and that new methods for han- dling both constraints in a unified way must be in- tegrated in configuration systems. Visualization of the globally consistent configuration problem space allows for a systematic exploration of the space in an interactive fashion (Haroud 1995). Knowledge maintenance in configuration sys- tems must be simplified, because configuration knowledge of todays products evolves over the whole product life cycle. The knowledge repre- sentation in deductive rule-based systems as of- ten used in intelligent CAD systems will always be context dependent; maintenance problems result- ing from this context dependency are often insur- mountable. We have identified the context inde- pendence of constralnt-based knowledge represen- tation as an important feature for facilitating the incremental development and maintenance of large evolving knowledge bases (Faltings & Weigel 1994).
