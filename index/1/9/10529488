The standard problem of finding the optimal layout of structural material associated with maximum stiffness is expanded to include consideration of thermal criteria. The problem is posed as a three-phase layout problem where the phases include an insulating or fire retardant material and an unknown distribution of heat sources, in addition to the structural material. The model used is simple, yet results suggest that the introduction of measures to control the temperature in the structure when subjected to significant heat transfer rates can result in layouts that differ substantially from solutions where thermal issues are ignored.Copyright Â© 2003 by ASME
