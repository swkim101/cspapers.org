This paper presents an approach to the control of the KNTU CDRPM using an integrated control scheme. The goal in this approach is achieving accurate trajectory tracking while assuring positive tension in the cables. By the proposed controller, the inherent nonlinear behavior of the cable and the target tracking errors are simultaneously compensated. In this paper asymptotic stability analysis of the close loop system is studied in detail. Moreover, it is shown that the integrated control strategy reduces the tracking error by 80% compared to that of a single loop controller in the considered manipulator. The closed-loop performance of the control topology is analyzed by a simulation study that is performed on the manipulator. The simulation study verifies that the proposed controller is not only promising to be implemented on the KNTU CDRPM, but also being suitable for other cable driven manipulators.
