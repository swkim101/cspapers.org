This paper makes several contributions to address the challenge of supervising HLS tools for design space exploration (DSE). We present a study on the application of learning-based methods for the DSE problem, and propose a learning model for HLS that is superior to the best models described in the literature. In order to speedup the convergence of the DSE process, we leverage transductive experimental design, a technique that we introduce for the first time to the CAD community. Finally, we consider a practical variant of the DSE problem, and present a solution based on randomized selection with strong theory guarantee.
