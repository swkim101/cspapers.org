An efficient package for construction of and operation on ordered Kronecker Functional Decision Diagrams (OKFDD) is presented. OKFDDs are a generalization of OBDDs and OFDDs and as such provide a more compact representation of the functions than either of the two decision diagrams. In this paper basic properties of OKFDDs and their efficient representation and manipulation are presented. Based on the comparison of the three decision diagrams for several benchmark functions, a 25% improve ment in size over OBDDs is observed for OKFDDs.
