Tools emerge as the result of necessity - a job needs to be done, automated, and scaled. In the ""early days" - compilers, code management, bug tracking, and the like - resulted in mostly local home-grown tools - and when broadly successful - spawn (from either industry or university origins) independent tools companies - for example Klocwork from Nortel and Coverity from Stanford University. This panel will bring together academics and industry professionals to discuss challenges in tools research.
