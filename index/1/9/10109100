With t,ha exponential proliferation of databases and advances in wide area networking, interest, in worldwide dat,abase interoperability has gained momentum. Scalability and language support for this new environment remain open questSions. We propose a scheme where database nodes are dynamically clustered around current, areas of ibresl. Data sharing is then pursued, with any relationship informat8ion discovered being fed bac,k for reclustering. In order to achieve scalability, t,he proposed architect(ure sub-divides both the rrlntionship and illformntiorl spaces.
