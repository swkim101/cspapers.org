In recent years, however, the simple structural models such as lasso are frequently proved to be insufficient. Accordingly, there has been a lot of work on "superposition-structured" models where multiple structural constraints are imposed. To efficiently solve these "superposition-structured" statistical models, we develop a framework based on a proximal Newton-type method. Employing the smoothed conic dual approach with the LBFGS updating formula, we propose a scalable and extensible proximal quasi-Newton (SEP-QN) framework. Empirical analysis on various datasets shows that our framework is potentially powerful, and achieves super-linear convergence rate for optimizing some popular "superposition-structured" statistical models such as the fused sparse group lasso.
