Time domain reflectometry, a technique originally used in diagnosing cable faults, can also locate where a cable is being touched. In this paper, we explore how to extend time domain reflectometry in order to touch-enable thin, modular, and deformable surfaces and devices. We demonstrate how to use this approach to make smart clothing and to rapid prototype touch-sensitive objects of arbitrary shape. To accomplish this, we extend time domain reflectometry in three ways: (1) Thin: We demonstrate how to run time domain reflectometry on a single wire. This allows us to touch-enable thin metal objects, such as guitar strings. (2) Modularity: We present a two-pin connector system that allows users to daisy chain touch-sensitive segments. We illustrate these enhancements with 13 prototypes and a series of performance measurements. (3) Deformability: We create deformable touch devices by mounting stretch-able wire patterns onto elastic tape and meshes. We present selected performance measurements.
