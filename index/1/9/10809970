This paper introduces a system of advanced control of the automatic pouring process, including the control of liquid level in the sprue cup, the flow control as the liquid is poured into a mold and sloshing (liquid vibration) suppression in the ladle. Through the pouring process model built in this paper, we calculated a forward tilting control input to hold the liquid in the sprue cup at a constant level. A backward tilting input is obtained by means of the Hybrid Shape Approach applied to suppress the slosh after backward tilting. We also designed a model by which supervisory control can take into account the After-Flow that occurs when switching the forward tilting input to the backward tilting input, and thus achieve the accurate poured quantity. The validity of the proposed total control system was demonstrated through experiments.
