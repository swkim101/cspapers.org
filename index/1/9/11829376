Global Positioning System (GPS) technology is widely used for outdoor navigation, but it is still challenging to apply this technology to a mid-scale or indoor environment. Using GPS in this way raises issues, such as reliability, deployment cost, and maintenance. Recently, companies like Google have begun to provide accurate indoor mapping. However, current implementations rely on both Wi-Fi and cellular technologies which have a hard time identifying the user's exact location in an indoor environment. There are two research questions in this paper: (1) How do we design a flexible and cost efficient indoor navigation system for organizations? (2) How to find an optimized path in a mid-scale/local environment. Here we propose Jaguar, which is a novel navigation system that utilizes a customized KML map with NFC technologies to address above questions. Our system includes an Android mobile application, a web-based map authoring tool and an implementation of a Cartesian plane based path finding algorithm. The initial testing of the system shows successful adaptation for a school campus environment.
