In this work, we address a critical task of detecting the user behavior of driving and texting simultaneously using smartphones. We propose, design, and implement TEXIVE which achieves the goal of distinguishing drivers and passengers, and detecting texting operations during driving utilizing irregularities and rich micro-movements of users. Without relying on any external infrastructures and additional devices, and no need to bring any modification to vehicles, TEXIVE is able to successfully detect dangerous operations with good sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. We conduct experimental study of TEXIVE with the help of a number of volunteers using various vehicles and smartphones. Our results indicate that TEXIVE has a classification accuracy of 87.18%, and precision of 96.67%.
