The Compartmented Mode Workstation project (CMW) is an effort to provide a prototype implementation of enhanced computer security features on a workstation. The ultimate goal of this project is to demonstrate that the compartmented mode workstation requirements detailed in "Security Requirements for System High and Compartmented Mode Workstations" [CMWREQS] can be met in an operationally useful manner. One of the necessary security enhancements that must be made to a workstation is the inclusion of a comprehensive auditing facility. For any computer system to be considered secure, it must have the ability to generate and store audit information on significant events. This information shall then be provided to authorized personnel for security and system monitoring. This document describes the design and implementation of the CMW'S auditing subsystem. The auditing subsystem was developed in conjunction with other parts of the total CMW project.
