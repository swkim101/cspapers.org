Harnessing the computational capabilities of dynamical systems has attracted the attention of scientists and engineers form varied technical disciplines over decades. The time evolution of coupled, non-linear synchronous oscillatory systems has led to active research in understanding their dynamical properties and exploring their applications in brain-inspired, neuromorphic computational models. In this paper we present the realization of coupled and scalable relaxation-oscillators utilizing the metal-insulator-metal transition of vanadium-dioxide (VO2) thin films. We demonstrate the potential use of such a system in pattern recognition, as one possible computational model using such a system.
