Due the the explosion in the number of online databases, there has been increased interest in leveraging the highquality information present in these databases [6, 1, 8]. However, finding the right databases can be very challenging. For example, if a biologist needs to locate databases related to molecular biology and searches on Google for the keywords “molecular biology database” over 27 million documents are returned. Among these, she will find pages that contain databases, but the results also include a very large number of pages from journals, scientific articles, etc. Recognizing the need for better mechanisms to locate online databases, people have started to create online database collections such as the Molecular Biology Database Collection [4], which lists databases of value to biologists. This collection, however, has been manually created and is manually maintained by the National Library of Medicine. Since it is estimated that there are over 20 million online databases [6], manual approaches to this problem are not practical. Besides, since new databases are constantly being added, the coverage of a manually maintained collection can be greatly compromised. In this paper, we describe a new approach to the problem of automatically locating and organizing online databases that belong to a given domain. There are a number of issues that make this problem particularly challenging. Since online databases are sparsely distributed on the Web, an efficient strategy is needed to locate the forms that serve as entry points to these databases. In addition, online databases do not publish their schemas and their contents are often hard to retrieve. Thus, a scalable solution must determine the relevance of a form to a given database domain by examining just the information available in (and around) the form. As shown in Figure 1, our framework for constructing topic-specific online database collections consists of two key
