Software development is ill-understood, as distinct from merely ill-coordinated. To understand software development we need to build models. These models need to be formal, that is constructed within representation schemes with precise, unambiguous and analysable semantics: explicit. that is capable of being directly examined and manipulated; and enactable, that is executable, interpretable or amenable to automated reasoning. What sort of representation schemes can we use to build these models?
