Social semantic web creates read/write spaces where users and smart agents collaborate to produce knowledge readable by humans and machines. An important issue concerns the ontology evolution and evaluation in man-machine collaboration. How to perform a change on ontologies in a social semantic space that currently use these ontologies through requests? In this paper, we propose to implement a continuous knowledge integration process named K-CIP. We take advantage of man-machine collaboration to transform feedback of people into tests. This paper presents how K-CIP can be deployed to allow fruitful man-machine collaboration in the context of the Wikitaaable system.
