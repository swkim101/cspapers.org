A commitment protocol is a fundamental cryptographic primitive used as a basic building block throughoutmodern cryptography. In STOC 1991, Dolev Dwork and Naor showed that in many settings the implementation of this fundamental primitive requires a strong non-malleability property in order not to be susceptible to a certain class of attacks. In this paper, assuming that a common random string is available to all players, we show how to implement nonmalleable commitment without any interaction and based on any one-way function. In contrast, all previous solutions required either logarithmically many rounds of interaction or strong algebraic
