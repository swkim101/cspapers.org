Ezafe construction is an idiosyncratic phenomenon in the Persian language. It is a good indicator for phrase boundaries and dependency relations but mostly does not appear in the text. In this paper, we show that adding information about Ezafe construction can give 4.6% relative improvement in dependency parsing and 9% relative improvement in shallow parsing. For evaluation purposes, Ezafe tags are manually annotated in the Persian dependency treebank. Furthermore, to be able to conduct experiments on shallow parsing, we develop a dependency to shallow phrase structure convertor based on the Persian dependencies.
