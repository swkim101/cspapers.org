In this paper, a generic architecture of interactive video databases is proposed. It is a platform for video applications. It consists of six major modules : Video Indexing, Interactive Browser, Object Annotator, Query Processing Tool, Video Management Module and Content Retrieval Module. The considerations and requirements of the video database in the aspects of video data management, annotation capability, content-based query and browsing interfaces are described. This paper also describes a Video Object Description Model (VODM) for annotations. The notion of VODM is based on the Entity-Relationship model for the database conceptual level organization. Unlike keyword or framebased knowledge representation, VODM can record the detail attribute information about video objects, store and retrieve annotations in many different video files. To construct VODM, we give a recursive definition of the video object and describe the operations of annotation storage structures. A two-step query processing method is introduced that can reduce the processing time of each video object query.
