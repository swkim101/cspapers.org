This paper shows ways to speedup simulation of digital designs described in VHDL by executing them on parallel machines. An efficient sequential simulator based on compile time analysis is first described. Two approaches to parallelizing simulations are then shown. One is based on fine grain task scheduling, and the other on coarse-grain partitioning. Each has its domain of utility depending on the nature of the designs. Experimental results validate the different approaches.
