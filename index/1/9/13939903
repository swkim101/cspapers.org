Dynamic oracle training has shown substantial improvements for dependency parsing in various settings, but has not been explored for constituent parsing. The present article introduces a dynamic oracle for transition-based constituent parsing. Experiments on the 9 languages of the SPMRL dataset show that a neural greedy parser with morphological features , trained with a dynamic oracle, leads to accuracies comparable with the best non-reranking and non-ensemble parsers.
