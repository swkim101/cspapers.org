Array programming shines in its ability to express computations at a high-level of abstraction, allowing one to manipulate and query whole sets of data at once. This paper presents the OPA model that enhances object-oriented programming with array programming features. The goal of OPA is to determine a minimum set of modifications that must be made to the traditional object model in order to take advantage of the possibilities of array programming. It is based on a minimal extension of method invocation and the definition of a kernel of methods implementing fundamental array programming operations. The OPA model presents a generalization of traditional message passing in the sense that a message can be send to an entire set of objects. The model is validated in FS, a new scripting language.
