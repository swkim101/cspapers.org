The ham-sandwich theorem states that, given <i>d</i> â‰¥ 2 measures in <i>R</i><sup><i>d</i></sup>, it is possible to divide all of them in half with a single (<i>d</i> - 1)-dimensional hyperplane. We study an orthogonal version of the ham-sandwich theorem and define an orthogonal cut using at most <i>d</i> hyperplanes orthogonal to coordinate axes. For example, a hyperplane orthogonal to a coordinate axis and the boundary of an orthant are orthogonal cuts. We prove that any three measures in <i>R</i><sup>3</sup> can be divided in half each with a single orthogonal cut. Applied to point measures, it implies that any three finite sets of points in <i>R</i><sup>3</sup> can be simultaneously bisected by an orthogonal cut. We present an algorithm for computing an orthogonal ham-sandwich cut in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) time.
