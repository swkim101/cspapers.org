We describe a framework for specifying conditional desires "desire α by e degrees if β" and evaluating preference queries "would you prefer σ1 over σ2 given ϕ" under uncertainty. We refine the semantics presented in (Tan & Pearl 1994) to allow conditional desires to be overridden by more specific desires in the database. Within this framework, we also enable consideration of surprising worlds having extreme desirability values and the determination of degrees of preference.
