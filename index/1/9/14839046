Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) are a prominent statistical relational model that consist of weighted first order clauses. Many of the current state-of-the-art algorithms for learning MLNs have focused on relatively small datasets with few descriptive attributes, where predicates are mostly binary and the main task is usually prediction of links between entities. This paper addresses what is in a sense a complementary problem: learning the structure of an MLN that models the distribution of discrete descriptive attributes on medium to large datasets, given the links between entities in a relational database. Descriptive attributes are usually nonbinary and can be very informative, but they increase the search space of possible candidate clauses. We present an efficient new algorithm for learning a directed relational model (parametrized Bayes net), which produces an MLN structure via a standard moralization procedure for converting directed models to undirected models. Learning MLN structure in this way is 200-1000 times faster and scores substantially higher in predictive accuracy than benchmark algorithms on three relational databases.
