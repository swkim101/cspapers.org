A file allocation problem in a hierarchical distributed computer network is examined. It is shown that the problem is NP-hard. An approximation algorithm is suggested. It is estimated that the approximation algorithm has a high chance of obtaining the optimal solution. Experimental results show that the difference between the optimal solution and the solution generated by the approximation algorithm is no more than 4% away from the optimal solution.
