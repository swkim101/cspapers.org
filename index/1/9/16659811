A technique is introduced that gives an engineer greater control over the design space considered by a high level synthesis tool. This is accomplished by allowing the engineer to make assertions about temporal and structural relationships between operations in a data-flow graph that must be reflected in any synthesized result. An engineer can use these assertions to make design trade-offs and improvements while working with a high-level synthesis tool.
