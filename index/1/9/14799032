We discuss an analytical method to judge whether an exoskeletal robotic orthosis has the possibility of producing assisting forces while guaranteeing the user's safety. First, an explanation of this judgment is given. Second, a theoretical method to simultaneously evaluate the mechanical safety for the user and the possibility of assistance is proposed based on the force analysis. Then, an application of the proposed method to the mechanical design of the exoskeletal robotic orthosis is described.
