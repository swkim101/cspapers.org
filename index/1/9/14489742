In this paper we propose a version control mechanism that enhances the modularity and extensibility of multiversion concurrency control algorithms. We decouple the multiversion algorithms into two components: version control and concurrency control. This permits modular development of multiversion protocols, and simplifies the task of proving the correctness of these protocols. An interesting feature of our framework is that the execution of read-only transactions becomes completely independent of the underlying concurrency control implementation. Also, algorithms with the version control mechanism have several advantages over most other multiversion algorithms.
