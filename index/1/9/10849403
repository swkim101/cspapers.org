This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of a parameter estimation based cellular neural network algorithm for estimating the time-to- contact from a one dimensional image. The algorithm uses a model of the image motion based upon the assumption that the camera is approaching a planar object oriented parallel to the image plane, which also implies that the time to contact is identical for every point in the image. Using Gabor-type spatial filtering and adaptive temporal filters, the algorithm adjusts the parameters of the model to match the image velocity variation across the image. The parameter values can be used to compute the time to contact.
