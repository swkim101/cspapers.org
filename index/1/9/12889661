Each year in the US, 628,000 people suffer an ankle sprain, and 795,000 suffer a new or recurrent stroke. Due to improved survival rates after stroke, significant increases in stroke population are projected by 2030. So far, there is no cost-effective robotic ankle/balance trainer in the market. In this paper, we present the Virtually-Interfaced Robotic Ankle and Balance Trainer (vi-RABT), a low-cost robotic system that will improve overall ankle / balance strength, mobility and control. The system is equipped with 2 degrees of freedom (DOF) controlled actuation along with complete means of force and angular measurements. The preliminary results on a single robotic footplate confirm the system design. The system will be used for measurement of ankle kinematics, ankle kinetics and balance function, as well as for retraining motor control and strength of the ankle during plantarflexion / dorsiflexion (PF/DF), ankle inversion / eversion (IN/EV) and circumduction motions.
