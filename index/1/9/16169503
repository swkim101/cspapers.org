We give an overview over the challenges in developing secure embedded systems and show how to use the approach of model-based security engineering (MBSE) to address them. In MBSE, recurring security requirements (such as secrecy, integrity, authenticity and others) and security assumptions on the system environment, can be specified either within a UML specification, or within the source code (Java or C) as annotations.
