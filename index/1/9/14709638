This paper describes a course I taught at the Technion --- The Israel Institute of Technology --- which addressed human aspects of Software Engineering. More specifically, three human aspects involved in developing software systems were the focus of the course: problem solving methodologies in general and their application in developing software systems in particular; mental processes; and social processes of software-system developers.
