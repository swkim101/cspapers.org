In this work we present a novel method for the challenging problem of depth image up sampling. Modern depth cameras such as Kinect or Time-of-Flight cameras deliver dense, high quality depth measurements but are limited in their lateral resolution. To overcome this limitation we formulate a convex optimization problem using higher order regularization for depth image up sampling. In this optimization an an isotropic diffusion tensor, calculated from a high resolution intensity image, is used to guide the up sampling. We derive a numerical algorithm based on a primal-dual formulation that is efficiently parallelized and runs at multiple frames per second. We show that this novel up sampling clearly outperforms state of the art approaches in terms of speed and accuracy on the widely used Middlebury 2007 datasets. Furthermore, we introduce novel datasets with highly accurate ground truth, which, for the first time, enable to benchmark depth up sampling methods using real sensor data.
