A "grid-free" channel router (termed GFR) is reported. GFR does not employ grid lines and can obtain better results than the fixed-grid method. Additionally, GFR has several optional functions, such as "constraint loop breaking", "total branch length minimization", "constraint chain cutting" and "layer changing". The algorithms of these functions are outlined and results obtained by using them are presented.
