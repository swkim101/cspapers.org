This paper briefly describes the evolution and content of the Open University's new introductory course in Computing which has been designed for delivery internationally to over 3500 students per year. It replaces a conventional procedural programming course and introduces computing through object technology---specifically, through Smalltalk. Unlike its predecessor it is being designed to be accessible by non-computing majors and with an intention to address the gender imbalance in our student population. Multimedia technologies are used in the delivery of this distance learning course which is being developed by the course team for presentation in 1997.
