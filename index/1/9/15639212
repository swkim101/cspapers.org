The IBM Engineering Design System is a corporate-wide electronic design automation system used for the development of the 3081 and other machines incorporating LSI chips and their carriers. Initially planned in the late 1960s, the system has evolved to respond to a changing set of requirements. This paper describes the evolution of the system data base, as well as the steps taken to ensure the integrity of the data and the correctness of the design.
