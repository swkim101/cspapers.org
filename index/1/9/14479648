Even researchers make mistakes when labeling data, and consistent, reliable labels from low-commitment users are rare. In particular, users may give identical labels to activities with characteristically different signatures (e.g., labeling eating at home or at a restaurant as "dinner") or may give different labels to the same context (e.g., "work" vs. "office"). In this scenario, labels are unreliable but nonetheless contain valuable information for classification. To facilitate learning in such unconstrained labeling scenarios, we propose Community-Guided Learning (CGL), a framework that allows existing classifiers to learn robustly from unreliably-labeled user-submitted data. CGL exploits the underlying structure in the data and the unconstrained labels to intelligently group crowd-sourced data. We demonstrate how to use similarity measures to determine when and how to split and merge contributions from different labeled categories and present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.
