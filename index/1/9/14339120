Pattern matching and regular expression matching are all the critical components for content inspection based applications. But current regular expression matching algorithms or architecture cannot provide a perfect solution for whole matching problem. In some real network security applications, exact strings are the biggest part of rule set, and the second part is simple regular expressions (dot-star and AND-logic), and the other complex regular expressions only occupy a very small part. So, we propose a new hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture, called MSRM, for Dot-Star and AND-logic regular expressions. Firstly, software compiler splits simple regular expressions into exact strings and relations. Multi-string-matching module judges whether strings match and outputs the matched ID. Based on these matched information and pre-generated RAM data, MSRM can judge whether dot-star and AND-logic regular expressions are satisfied easily and quickly. Experiments with random test data and ClamAV rule set show that MSRM can achieve a high throughput of 2.1 and 2.8 Gbps using Virtex2 and Virtex4 devices respectively which is much higher than software algorithms.
