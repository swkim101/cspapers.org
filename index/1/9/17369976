The PrismTM multi-process debugger was designed from its inception to support scalable debugging paradigms, implemented on top of a scalable architecture. Its features provide a good base for developing MPI programs, and we have extended them in a number of ways to improve its support for MPI. We have added more visualization support, including the ability to specify the geometry of globally-distributed arrays, to visualize MPIÂ’s internal message queues, and to visualize linked data structures. We have provided an integrated MPI performance analysis capability in the form of an event-capture and display tool. Lastly, we have further enhanced the Prism architecture to improve scalability and ease-of-use for MPI debugging.
