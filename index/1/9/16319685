When robot applications become more elaborated software becomes a critical success factor. Over the last years several robot middleware platforms have been developed to support the development of robot applications. These platforms rely on two software technologies: software components and distributed middleware. This paper proposes to add a third software technology to robot middleware platforms: scripting technology. Scripting technology improves the ease-of-use of developing robot applications. It makes configuring software components easier and simplifies the integration into one application. Additionally, this paper presents a software architecture called dynamic script generation to cope with more complex applications requirements.
