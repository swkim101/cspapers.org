WISER is a series of international workshops that focus on identifying and transferring techniques from other disciplines that might usefully be applied to software engineering research and practice.The workshops address this topic through presentations and discussions of both actual case studies and of ways in which potentially useful approaches can be identified, adapted and adopted within software engineering.
