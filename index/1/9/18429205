Object recognition is a fundamental topic for the development of robotic systems able to interact with the environment. Most existing methods are based on vision systems and assume a broad point of view over the objects, which are observed in their entirety. This assumption is sometimes difficult to fulfill in practice, and in particular in swarm systems, constituted by a multitude of small robots with limited sensing and computational capabilities. We have developed a method for object recognition with a heterogeneous swarm of low-informative spatially-distributed sensors employing a distributed version of the naive Bayes classifier. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this approach highlighting some nice properties of the developed algorithm.
