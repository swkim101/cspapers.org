Many models have been devised to represent the processes involved in developing software with hopes of providing foundations for increasingly useful environment support tools. They have met with varied success in their abilities to relate to “reality”. This paper presents a model called the Software Evolution Management (SEM) Model. The SEM Model focuses on the problems and situations that commonly arise in commercial software development organizations, although it is probably relevant to other situations as well. This paradigm establishes a structure within which a tracking system can be implemented that smoothly integrates many different types of management and development activities.
