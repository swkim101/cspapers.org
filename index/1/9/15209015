Five years ago, Dwight Bolinger [1] wrote that efforts to represent meaning had not yet made use of the insights of lexicography. The few substantial efforts, such as those spearheaded by Olney [2,3], MelOCuk [4], Smith [5], and Simmons [6,7], made some progress, but never came to fruition. Today, lexicography and its products, the dictionaries, remain an untapped resource of uncertain value. Indeed, many who have analyzed the contents of a dictionary have concluded that it is of little value to linguistics or artificial intelligence. Because of the size and complexity of a dictionary, perhaps such a conclusion is inevitable, but I believe it is wrong. To avoid becoming irretrievably lost in the minutiae of a dictionary and to view the real potential of this resource, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive model within which a dictionaryOs detail can be tied together. When this is done, I believe one can identify the requirements for a semantic representation of an entry in the lexicon to be used in natural language processing systems. I describe herein what I have learned from this type of effort.
