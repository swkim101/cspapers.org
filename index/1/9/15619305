Frequently situations are encountered where the ability to differentiate between objects is necessary. The typical situation is one in which one is in a current state and wishes to achieve a goal state. Abstractly, the problem we shall address is that of comparing two data structures and determining all differences between the two structures. Current comparison techniques work well in determining all syntactic differences but fall short of addressing the semantic issues. We address this gap by applying Al techniques that yield semantic interpretations of differences.
