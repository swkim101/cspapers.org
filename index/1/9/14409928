Holographic algorithms were introduced by Valiant as a new methodology to derive polynomial time algorithms. Here information and computation are represented by exponential sums using the so-called signatures. These signatures express superpositions of perfect matchings, and are used to achieve exponential sized cancellations, and thereby exponential speedups. Most holographic algorithms so far used symmetric signatures. In this paper we use unsymmetric signatures to give some new holographic algorithms. We also prove a characterization theorem for a class of realizable un-symmetric signatures, each of which may be used to design new holographic algorithms.
