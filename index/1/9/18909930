In this paper new intelligent control strategies are presented allowing a cooperative work between a human operator and a microassembly platform working in a partially structured microworld. Human integration is essential in the microworld where autonomous control alone would not be successful. The allocation of the control among human and robot occurs dynamically according to the state of the task execution. In the following, different task-level control issues (shared, traded, cooperative and priority) are discussed and tested on a micro device assembly workcell.
