Characterizing the evolution of these systems is important for understanding their limitations and gaining insights into the interplay between learning and reasoning. We describe an inverse ablation model for studying how large knowledge-based systems evolve: Create a small knowledge base by ablating a large KB, and simulate learning by incrementally re-adding facts, using different strategies to simulate types of learners. For each iteration, reasoning properties (including number of questions answered and run time) are collected, to explore how learning strategies and reasoning interact. We describe several experiments with the inverse ablation model, examining how two different learning strategies perform. Our results suggest that different concepts show different rates of growth, and that the density and distribution of facts that can be learned are important parameters for modulating the rate of learning.
