Many computer systems assist users in the performance of tasks by providing metaphors for the tasks themselves. The success of such systems hinge on how accurately and effectively the user interface represents those tasks. In this paper we describe such a representation for the task of loading boxed appliances into truck trailers. This representation was used to provide the format for the loading plans generated by an expert system constructed to plan the loading of such products. These plans tell the warehouse personnel that actually load the trucks just where each product is to be placed in the truck, how it is to be oriented, as well as where extra padding and filler material should be placed.
