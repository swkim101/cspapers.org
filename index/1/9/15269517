We describe an expert system that has been applied to the task of application design. Users supply the system with problem specifications, such as the required output data, and the system produces a graphic representation of the completed application in the form of a flow diagram. The application design task has forced us to consider two important issues in expert system architecture: constraint processing and the explicit representation of control flow. The resulting knowledge representation and control logic are discussed.
