Planning with kinodynamic constraints is often required for mobile robots operating in cluttered, complex environments. A common approach is to use a two-dimensional (2-D) global planner for long range planning, and a short range higher dimensional planner or controller capable of satisfying all of the constraints on motion. However, this approach is incomplete and can result in oscillations and the inability to find a path to the goal. In this paper we present an approach to solving this problem by combining the global and local path planning problem into a single search using a combined 2-D and higher dimensional state-space.
