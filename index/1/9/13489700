URL shortening services (USS) have been widely used on the Internet, but are currently prone to abuse. In this poster, we exploit the possibility of building a novel stealthy and robust message transmission channel through use of USS. A text string or binary file can be transmitted stealthily using this channel. Our preliminary results show that the proposed channel is feasible and affects many popular USS, thus posing a practical threat to attackers.
