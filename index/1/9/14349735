A novel gene regulatory network model via the fuzzy logic is proposed. Fuzzy logic can effectively model gene regulation and interaction to accurately reflect the underlying biology. By judging genes expression level on the fuzzy rule, Fuzzy Boolean network (FBN) makes it possible to handle simultaneously the randomness and fuzziness of biological phenomena
