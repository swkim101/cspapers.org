Vertical monolayer heterojunction FETs based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCFETs) and planar black phosphorus FETs (BPFETs) have demonstrated excellent sub-threshold swing, high ION/IOFF, and high scalability, making them attractive candidates for post-CMOS memory design. This paper explores TMDCFET and BPFET SRAM design by combining atomistic self-consistent device modeling with SRAM circuit design and simulation. Our simulations show that at low operating voltages, TMDCFET and BPFET SRAMs exhibit significant advantages in static power, dynamic read/write noise margin, and read/write delay over both nominal and read/write-assisted 16nm CMOS SRAMs.
