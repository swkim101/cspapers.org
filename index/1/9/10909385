Partially ordered preferences generally lead to choices that do not abide by standard expected utility guidelines; often such preferences are revealed by imprecision in probability values. We investigate (cid:2)ve criteria for strategy selection in decision trees with imprecision in probabilities: (cid:147)extensive(cid:148) (cid:0) -maximin and (cid:0) -maximax, interval dominance, maximality and E-admissibility. We present algorithms that generate strategies for all these criteria; our main contribution is an algorithm for E-admissibility that runs over admissible strategies rather than over sets of probability distributions.
