In this paper, a new pose selection criterion for the kinematic calibration of parallel mechanisms is proposed. It enables one to take into account the measurement noise amplification that may occur for parallel mechanisms, as well as the variation of amplitude and anisotropy of the measuring device accuracy. This new criterion is applied to vision-based calibration of an Orthoglide mechanism, both in simulation, with comparison to existing criteria, and experimentally.
