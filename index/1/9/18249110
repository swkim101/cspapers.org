The observation of robotic assembly tasks is required as feedback for decisions and adaption of the task execution on the current situation. A sequential Monte Carlo observation algorithm is proposed, which uses a fast and accurate collision detection algorithm as a reference model for the contacts between complex shaped parts. The main contribution of the paper is the extension of the classic random motion model in the propagation step with sampling methods known from the domain of probabilistic roadmap planning in order to increase the sample density in narrow passages of the configuration space. As a result, the observation performance can be improved and a risk of sample impoverishment reduced. Experimental validation is provided for a peg-in-hole task executed by a lightweight-robot arm equipped with joint torque sensors.
