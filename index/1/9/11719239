We present a scalable parallel memory architecture with skew scheme. It achieves equal conflict-free vector access strides among different numbers of memory modules. With previous skew schemes, conflict-free strides depended on the number of memory modules. Therefore the skew scheme should be independent of the number of memory modules. We analyze two kinds of cause of conflicts, permanent concentration in the limited memory modules and transient concentration in one memory module. The conflict-free strides are proved to be independent of the number of memory modules by solving two concentrations separately. The strategy is to increase the interval of the shifting address assignment of the memory modules in order to reduce the permanent concentrations, and to provide buffers for each memory module in accordance with this interval in order to absorb the transient concentrations. The skew scheme uses the same period for memory systems with different numbers of memory modules. Consequently, scalability for conflict-free strides can be realized, independent of the number of the memory modules.
