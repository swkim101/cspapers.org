This paper presents a new type of debugging tool for FORTRAN programs. We call this the “DOCK” system, referring to the dock where ships stay during repairs. DOCK provides new debugging functions such as slow display of program execution. Major functions and a brief indication of the methods of implementation are given in this paper.
 Four “execution modes” control execution speed. Execution is displayed on the screen in full screen mode. The source program listing is displayed with the executing statement shown in a different color or brightness. At certain places, the program stops temporarily in a status called “Stationary mode”. In the stationary mode, several debugging functions are available.
