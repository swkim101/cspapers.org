We have investigated the performance of simultaneously estimating the 3D motion and structure for navigation when the scale information is obtained by utilizing the cooperative efforts of multiple robots. The method determines the relative positions of robots by tracking a specific geometric feature that is part of their structure, and then uses the extended Kalman filter to estimate the motion and structure. For implementation we used two CRAWLER Scouts, and performed several experiments to explore the effects of cooperative running of robots on the motion estimation.
