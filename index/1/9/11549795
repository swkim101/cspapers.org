Matlab Simulink models, mainly used for the specification of continuous embedded systems, employ a data flow-driven notation well understood by engineers. This notation abstracts from the underlying computational model, hiding run time failures such as over-/underflows and divisions by zero. They are often detected late in the development process by the use of static analysis tools on the completely developed system. The responsible underlying faults are sometimes attributable to a single operation in a model. 8Cage is an automated test case generator for the early detection of such single operation related faults. It is configurable to detect these faults and runs automatically in the background. It tries to find potentially failure-causing operations and generates a test case to gather evidence for an actual fault. 8Cage is usable by developing/testing engineers with knowledge of Matlab. It does not require an expert to perform result validation or fault localization.
