In this paper, we first extend the Sparse Discriminate Analysis (SDA) of Clemmensen et al.. We call this Multi-task Sparse Discriminate Analysis (MtSDA). MtSDA formulates multi-label prediction as a quadratic optimization problem whereas SDA obtains single labels via a nearest class mean rule. Second, we propose a class of equicorrelation matrices to use in MtSDA which includes the identity matrix. MtSDA with both matrices are compared with singletask learning (SVM and LDA+SVM) and multi-task learning (HSML). The comparisons are made on real data sets in terms of AUC and F-measure. The data results show that MtSDA outperforms other methods substantially almost all the time and in some cases MtSDA with the equicorrelation matrix substantially outperforms MtSDA with identity matrix.
