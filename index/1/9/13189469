We introduce a query intent probabilistic model, whose input is the number of clicks on documents from different regions and in different language, while the output of this model is a smoothed probabilistic distribution of multilingual and multi-regional query intent. Based on an editorial test to evaluate the accuracy of the intent classifier, our probabilistic model could improve the accuracy of multilingual intent detection for 15%, and improve multi-regional intent detection for 18%. To improve web search quality, we propose a set of new ranking features to combine multilingual and multi-regional query intent with document language/region attributes, and apply different approaches in integrating intent information to directly affect ranking. The experiments show that the novel features could provide 2.31% NDCG@1 improvement and 1.81% NDCG@5 improvement.
