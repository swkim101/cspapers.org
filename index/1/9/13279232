We propose to emulate this process in machines, by transforming new problems into old ones. These transformations are called metaphors. Obviously, the learner is not given a metaphor, but must acquire one through a learning process. We show that learning metaphors yield better results than existing transfer learning methods. Moreover, we argue that metaphors give a qualitative assessment of task relatedness.
