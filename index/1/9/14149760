Self-assembling robots can be transported and deployed inexpensively and autonomously in remote and dangerous environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-assembling method with a planar pneumatic system. Inflation of pouches translate into shape changes, turning a sheet of composite material into a complex robotic structure. This new method enables a flat origami-based robotic structure to self-fold to desired angles with pressure control. It allows a static joint to become dynamic, self-actuate to reconfigure itself after initial folding. Finally, the folded robot can unfold itself at the end of a robotic application. We believe this new pneumatic approach provides an important toolkit to build more powerful and capable self-assembling robots.
