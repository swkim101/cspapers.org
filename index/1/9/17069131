The bio-inspired materials and bio-inspired robotics laboratory at the University of Tennessee developed a swimming robot with a rigid body and flexible propellers inspired from the whirligig beetle. We improved the propulsion efficiency by identifying the optimal structure for the propellers and beating patterns to minimize the energy consumption for this swimming robot. In this video, we present the design, simulation, and experiment of the robot platform.
