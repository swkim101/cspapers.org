Software complexity metrics attempt to define the unique chaxacteristics of computer programs in an analytical way. Many such metrics have been developed to explain various perceived differences among programs. Many studies have been conducted to show the similarity among classes of these metrics. What is lacking in this body of literature is a technique which will aid in the establishment of the true dimensionality of the complexity problem space. The objective of this paper is to examine some recent investigations in the area of software complexity using factor analysis to begin an exploration of the actual di- mensionality of the complexity metrics. This technique can expose the relationships of these many metrics, one to another. Some correlation coefficients from recent empirical studies on software metrics were factor analyzed, showing the probable existence of five complexity dimensions within thirty five different complexity measures.
