Based on an analysis of errors in a piece of Pascal software a new language feature is introduced to increase the degree of compile time checking of program logic and thus improve the confidence of the programmer in the correctness of a program. Specifically this involves a form of abstract data type, augmented by restrictions on the use of operations provided with the type, and a means of allowing the programmer to bring logically related segments of program together textually.
