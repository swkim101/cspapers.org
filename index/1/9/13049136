Many anti-phishing schemes have recently been proposed in literature. Despite all those efforts, the threat of phishing attacks is not mitigated.

It demands neither user expertise nor prior knowledge of the Web site. The evasion of our phishing detection entails high cost to the adversary. As shown by the experiments, our phishing detector functions with low miss rate and low false-positive rate
