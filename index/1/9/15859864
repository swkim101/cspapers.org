We investigate an important and challenging problem in summary generation, i.e., Evolutionary Trans-Temporal Summarization (ETTS), which generates news timelines from massive data on the Internet. ETTS greatly facilitates fast news browsing and knowledge comprehension, and hence is a necessity. Given the collection of time-stamped web documents related to the evolving news, ETTS aims to return news evolution along the timeline, consisting of individual but correlated summaries on each date. Existing summarization algorithms fail to utilize trans-temporal characteristics among these component summaries. We propose to model trans-temporal correlations among component summaries for timelines, using inter-date and intra-date sentence dependencies, and present a novel combination. We develop experimental systems to compare 5 rival algorithms on 6 instinctively different datasets which amount to 10251 documents. Evaluation results in ROUGE metrics indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on trans-temporal information.
