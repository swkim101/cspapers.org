This paper presents a flexible framework, using a System Monitor, to design error-resistant software. The System Monitor contains the code and data for error detection, error containment and recovery at the module level, program level, and system level. It contains five types of components: the Internal Process Supervisor, the External Process Supervisor, the Interaction Supervisor, the System Monitor Kernel, and the Maintenance Program. The functions of each component is discussed, followed by a discussion of the strategies to handle errors in the module, program, and system levels.
