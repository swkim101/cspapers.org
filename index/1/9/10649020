We introduce a theoretical and algorithmic framework for multi-way graph partitioning that relies on a multiplicative cut-based objective. We refer to this objective as the Product Cut. We provide a detailed investigation of the mathematical properties of this objective and an effective algorithm for its optimization. The proposed model has strong mathematical underpinnings, and the corresponding algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark data sets.
