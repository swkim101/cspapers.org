This paper presents a new model for use in scheduling processes for the sharing of a processor. The model may be used in various modes of operation, including multiprogramming, real time and time sharing. Because the model is applicable for various modes of operation and because it is significantly useful only within a well-defined system hierarchy, the context for discussion is Hansen's system for the RC 4000.3,4,5
 Only the preliminary work has been reported in this paper, but the author believes that the model is worth investigating further, and, therefore, research into its effects and properties will continue.
