In this paper, we propose a hierarchical control method for manipulation/grasping tasks using multi-fingered robot hands. This method imitates human motion control. Human motion can be divided into two classes, reflex and voluntary movement. Reflex is suppressed by voluntary movement. In the proposed method, a robot hand's grasping control corresponds to human reflex and manipulation control corresponds to voluntary movement. We constructed a controller composed of a manipulation controller, grasping controller and suppresser. The grasping controller has fast feedback but can only execute simple motion. The manipulation controller has slow feedback, and can execute complex motion. Finally, the validity of the hierarchical method is confirmed by computer simulation of various tasks, i.e. grasping, manipulation, and re-grasping motion.
