A method for the definition of verb predicates is proposed. The definition of the predicates is essentially tied to a semantic interpretation algorithm that determines the predicate for the verb, its semantic roles and adjuncts. As predicate definitions are complete, they can be tested by running the algorithm on some sentences and verifying the resolution of the predicate, semantic roles and adjuncts in those sentences. The predicates are defined semiautomatically with the help of a software environment that uses several sections of a corpus to provide feedback for the definition of the predicates, and then for the subsequent testing and refining of the definitions. The method is very flexible in adding a new predicate to a list of already defined predicates for a given verb. The method builds on an existing approach that defines predicates for WordNet verb classes, and that plans to define predicates for every English verb. The definitions of the predicates and the semantic interpretation algorithm are being used to automatically create a corpus of annotated verb predicates, semantic roles and adjuncts.
