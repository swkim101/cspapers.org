This paper describes an e-mail system for wearable computing environments. In this system, we extend the conventional mail format and the server/client(browser) architecture by considering the specific features of wearable computing environments, i.e., full time operation, hands-free use of computer, and close relationship to our daily life. A mail author can specify the behavior of his/her mail by embedding several useful commands in the mail. A user can specify in the mail various conditions as commands such as time, location of the recipient, and status of various sensors to allow an adaptive behavior in the mail. We also describe other features of the system to support user's wearable computing life.
