Abstract This paper presents a deterministic sorting algorithm, called Sharesort, that sorts n records on an n -processor hypercube, shuffle-exchange, or cube-connected cycles in O (log n (log log n ) 2 ) time in the worst case. The algorithm requires only a constant amount of storage at each processor. The fastest previous deterministic algorithm for this problem was Batcher's bitonic sort, which runs in O (log 2 n ) time.
