This paper describes how to model uncertain provenance and provenance of uncertain things in a flexible and unintrusive manner using PROV, W3C's new standard for provenance. Three new attributes with clearly defined values and semantics are proposed. Modeling this information is an important step towards the modeling and derivation of trust from resources whose provenance is described using PROV.
