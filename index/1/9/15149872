This work presents a manipulation strategy for a anthropomorphic robotic hand based on the use of distinct model topologies and the analytical solution for the inverse kinematics. To evaluate the approach a pencil handling example is implemented using the Brazilian Anthropomorphic Hand - BRAHMA, a five fingers artificial robotic hand with 22 degree of freedom. Additionally a state space position control for the joints was implemented. The non-linear model is piece-wise linearized and linear models are used to design the control. The manipulation strategy is tested imposing a movement to the pencil that the BRAHMA controller and the results are presented through numeric simulation.
