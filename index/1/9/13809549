In this paper, we make two main contributions. First, we describe the construction and evaluation of TeKnowbase, a knowledge-base of technical concepts in computer science. And second, we show how to use TeKnowbase in a variety of applications, including, generation of pre-requisite concepts for learning a new topic, classification of technical text and querying and ranking computer science articles.
