This study demonstrates a paradigm for modeling speech production based on neural networks. Using physiological data from speech utterances, a neural network learns the forward dynamics relating motor commands to muscles and the ensuing articulator behavior that allows articulator trajectories to be generated from motor commands constrained by phoneme input strings and global performance parameters. From these movement trajectories, a second neural network generates PARCOR parameters that are then used to synthesize the speech acoustics.
