Bridge is a behavioral synthesis system being developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories. Two slicing techniques are implemented in this system to drive structural allocation; one is local slicing and the other is global slicing. Global slicing supports the synthesis of concurrent processes with a centralized control. A variable in a behavioral description can be either a storage element or a signal. The impacts of treating a variable as a signal on data flow scheduling, control flow scheduling, and lifetime analysis are discussed. Intelligent bindings of the variables in a behavioral description to registers and signals not only reduce the implementation cost but also improve the circuit performance. Using global slicing and signal variables, a mircoarchitecture model can sometimes be reduced to the view of a finite state machine or a combinational circuit. Experimental data for the behavioral descriptions of the Intel 8251 are presented.
