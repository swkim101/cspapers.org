We consider the problem of finding long paths and cycles in Hamiltonian graphs. The focus of our work is on sparse graphs, e.g., cubic graphs, that satisfy some property known to hold for Hamiltonian graphs, e.g., k-cyclability. We first consider the problem of finding long cycles in 3-connected cubic graphs whose edges have weights wi _> 0. We find cycles of weight at least ( ~ w~) ~ for a = log~ 3. Based on this result, we develop an algorithm for finding a cycle of length at least m 0°g3 2)/2 in 5-cyclable graphs with vertices of degree at most 3. We then consider 3-cyelable graphs with vertices of degree at most 3, and show how to find a cycle of length at least 2 ~ . We consider the graph property of 1-toughness that is common to Hamiltonian graphs and 3-connected cubic graphs, and try to determine if 1toughness implies the existence of long cycles. We show that 2-connectivity and 1-toughness, for constant degree graphs, may give cycles that are only of logarithmic length. However, we exhibit a class of 3-connected 1-tough graphs with degrees up to 6 where we can find cycles of length at least ml°ga 2/2 .
