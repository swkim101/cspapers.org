Origami robots (Robogamis) use architecture to strategically activate different sets and sequence of actuators to achieve large variety of reconfigurable forms. Tribot is a unique mobile origami robot that can simultaneously choose between two modes of locomotion: jumping and crawling. When assembled, Tribot measures 64 × 34 × 20 mm3, weighs 4 g, crawls at 17% of its body length per gait cycle and jumps seven times its height repeatedly without needing to be reset. To optimize the practicality of the nominally 2D design, we made two different approaches to build the prototypes. For one of them, we used the “traditional”, monolithic, layer-by-layer robogami fabrication method and the second, we printed out most parts using a multi-material 3D printer. By showing the performance of two prototypes side-by-side, we show that with the 3D printer, we can minimize the number of functional layers and reduce the fabrication time. The embedded sensors allow Tribot's crawling gait pattern and jumping height to be modulated with a closed loop control. We compare the expected gait step size and displacement to that of the presented prototype while describing the design and control parameters to achieve the experimental results. We also illustrated the preliminary graphical design tool platform developed to optimize the next design iteration of Tribot.
