Malware residing in dedicated isolated hardware containing an auxiliary processor such as present in network, video, and CPU chipsets is an emerging security threat. To attack the host system, this kind of malware uses the direct memory access (DMA) functionality. By utilizing DMA, the host system can be fully compromised bypassing any kind of kernel level protection. Traditional anti-virus software is not capable to detect this kind of malware since the auxiliary systems are completely isolated from the host CPU. In this work we present our novel method that is capable of detecting this kind of malware. To understand the properties of such malware we evaluated a prototype that attacks the host via DMA. Our prototype is executed in the chipset of an x86 architecture. We identified key properties of such malware that are crucial for our detection method. Our detection mechanism is based on monitoring the side effects of rogue DMA usage performed by the malware. We believe that our detection mechanism is general and the first step in the detection of malware in dedicated isolated hardware.
