Agile development emphasizes collaborations among customers, business analysts, domain experts, developers, and testers. However, the large scale and rapid pace of many agile projects presents challenges during testing activities. Large sets of test artifacts must be comprehensible and available to various stakeholders, traceable to requirements, and easily maintainable as the software evolves. In this paper we describe Legend, a toolset that leverages domain-specific language to streamline functional testing in agile projects. Some key features of the toolset include test template generation from user stories, model-based automation, test inventory synchronization, and centralized test tagging.
