Conventional motion planners for wheeled vehicles often assume no-slipping and no-skidding conditions and construct motion trajectories in the context of nonholonomic motion planning. However, in some practical situations slipping and skidding cannot be ignored or can even be useful. To take them into account in the construction of planning algorithms, it is important to model the friction force between the tire and the contact plane. In this paper, we first construct a model of the friction force as an extension of the two-dimensional Coulomb model, considering both the slipping conditions and the nonholonomic constraints. Next, we formulate the motion planning problem as a drift parking problem and propose a motion planning strategy combining the nonholonomic planner and the control in the slipping mode. The feasibility and the performance of the proposed strategy are tested under simulation.
