In most 6 DOF robot arms, considerable amounts of gravitational torques due to the robot's own weight are applied to pitch joints of the robot, which causes most arms to use high capacity motors and speed reducers. A spring-based counterbalance mechanism can compensate for this gravitational torque, thus leading to a significant reduction in the effect of gravity. However, a simple installation of counterbalance mechanisms at each pitch joint does not work properly because the gravitational torque at each joint is dependent also on the other joints. To achieve multi-DOF counterbalancing, we propose a parallelogram linkage combined with dual counterbalance mechanisms, each being composed of a slider-crank mechanism and springs. Simulations and experimental results showed that the counterbalance robot arm based on the proposed counterbalance mechanisms effectively reduced the torques required to support the robot mass, thus allowing the prospective use of much smaller motors and speed reducers than traditional industrial robots.
