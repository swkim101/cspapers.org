When robots cooperate with humans it is necessary for robots to move safely on sudden impact. Joint torque sensing is vital for robots to realize safe behavior and enhance physical performance. Firstly, this paper describes a new torque sensor with linear encoders which demonstrates electro magnetic noise immunity and is unaffected temperature changes. Secondly, we propose a friction compensation method using a disturbance observer to improve the positioning accuracy. In addition, we describe a torque feedback control method which scales down the motor inertia and enhances the joint flexibility. Experimental results of the proposed controller are presented.
