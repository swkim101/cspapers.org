Knowledge is manifested in an enterprise in various forms ranging from unstructured operational data, to structured information like programs, as well as relational data stored in databases to semi-structured information stored in XML files. This information embodies the core of an enterprise knowledge base and analyzing the knowledge base can result in intelligent decision making. In order to realize this goal we begin with representing and analyzing unstructured knowledge present in an enterprise. In particular, this paper presents a real life example of a document intensive business process (International Trade) and attempts to model and analyze the process in a formal way. Typically, the information contained in a document intensive business process is of operational nature and requires extensive manual verification, which is both time consuming and error prone. Therefore, this research aims to eliminate such exhaustive manual verification by constructing a knowledge base in the form of ontology and apply suitable rule based reasoners to automate the verification process.
