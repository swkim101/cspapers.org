DBLP is a well-known online computer science bibliography. As nearly all important journals and conferences on computer science are tracked in DBLP, how to effectively search DBLP records has become a valuable topic for the computer science community. In this paper we present DBLP-Filter, a new DBLP search tool. The major features of DBLP-Filter are: (1) it provides new search options on concepts and literature importance; (2) it can maintain user profiles and can support user-area-aware search; (3) it provides the service of new literatures alert. Compared with the existing DBLP search tools, DBLP-Filter is more functional and also shows better effectiveness in terms of MAP and F-measure when tested under a set of randomly-selected queries.
