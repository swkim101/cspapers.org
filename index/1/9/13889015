As an alternative to the usual Mean Average Precision, some use is currently being made of the Geometric Mean Average Precision (GMAP) as a measure of average search effectiveness across topics. GMAP is specifically used to emphasise the lower end of the average precision scale, in order to shed light on poor performance of search engines. This paper discusses the status of this measure and how it should be understood.
