There is a serious problem of aging of the craftsmen who have tie-dyeing technique of Japanese traditional craft “Shibori”. In substitution for “tying” process by thread on tie-dyeing, this paper proposes usage of elastic cap with different thickness at the both ends. A cloth is pushed into the cap by a needle of 1 mm diameter attached on the robot hand. It was confirmed that the cloth was tightened at the both ends of the elastic cap and the effect of the tie-dyeing was valid. The usage of the elastic plastic cap realizes the tie-dyeing pattern similar to the conventional method using thread. Moreover, these elastic caps are reusable. To improve the work efficiency, a cap cartridge and a sub robot attached on the robot hand were examined. The high efficiency of the work was achieved and an increase in the speed of robot was also effective. In regard to polyester cloth, its elasticity increases with projections that are created when the wet heat treatment is applied with the caps on. In this case, the stretch properties are also effective.
