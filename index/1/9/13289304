The subject of computer architecture as currently taught in most computer engineering and computer science programs is a mixture of architectural principles, organizational strategies, and implementation techniques. This blurring of the hierarchy of system levels that characterize the structure of a computer has made it very difficult for students (and often instructors as well) to determine what were the forces that led to the design decisions they have seen reflected in machines.
 In view of these circumstances, a task force was established by the IEEE Computer Society to prepare a detailed specification for a course of study in computer architecture for students whose major interest is in computer engineering or computer science.
