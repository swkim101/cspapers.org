The methodology proposed is intended to aid in the development of cooperative interactive tools (i.e., those which are natural, helpful, and consistent). Cooperative tools must incorporate knowledge of their own capabilities, limitations, and requirements. This required knowledge of tool functionality is provided by programming the tool in the process script formalism. The process script formalism is a specialized procedural/declarative language for writing tools. The key aspect of the process script specification of a tool is that, besides being executable, process scripts can be analyzed and understood for the purpose of cooperative interaction with the end user. This paper describes the process script formalism and explains its role in the development of a cooperative interactive system.
