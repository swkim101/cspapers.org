Task-based computing paradigm enables new kinds of mobile applications which are composed by networking services and heterogeneous resources. These applications use explicit user task descriptions to bind resources at runtime, thus making it easier to achieve application adaptation in changing context. In this paper, we will present an algorithm for application composition which performs resource allocation in real time according to user requirements. We will present a resource model and a system architecture for dynamic application composition. We will focus on the implementation of an application composition algorithm and demonstrate preliminary testing results.
