People have faced conflicts for shifting scheduled meetings to other time slots in order to fit incoming meetings or to find a time slot to book a meeting. The goal of this research is to develop a personal distributed meeting scheduler in FCVW (Federated Collaborative Virtual Workspace) that assists users to deal with these situations. FCVW is an extension of CVW [6] developed by MITRE. In our approach to meeting scheduling, is to provide each user with meeting scheduler agent. Each agent is able to manage, negotiate and schedule tasks, meetings, events, appointments for its user. This paper describes the objective of our research to develop an automated distributed meeting scheduler.
