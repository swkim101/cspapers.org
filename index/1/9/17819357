Our department received funding from the National Science Foundation to establish a three-year Research Experience for Teachers site in Data Analysis & Mining, Visualization, and Image Processing. The objective is to provide twelve in-service high school teachers and community college faculty to work with faculty mentors and their graduate and undergraduate assistants to conduct research in these fields. During this six-week summer program, participants gain skills that they can utilize to assist their students to solve interdisciplinary problems. In addition, participants design learning modules to teach STEM concepts in their courses. The goal of our program is for teachers to bring knowledge of computer science and its application to their classroom exposing their students to computer science. This paper will share some of the activities of this experience.
