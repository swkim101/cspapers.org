This paper shows the results of an experiment in dialogue segmentation. In this experiment, segmentation was done on a level of analysis similar to adjacency pairs. The method of annotation was somewhat novel: volunteers were invited to participate over the Web, and their responses were aggregated using a simple voting method. Though volunteers received a minimum of training, the aggregated responses of the group showed very high agreement with expert opinion. The group, as a unit, performed at the top of the list of annotators, and in many cases performed as well as or better than the best annotator.
