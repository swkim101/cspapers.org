Second-order recurrent networks that recognize simple finite state languages over {0,1}* are induced from positive and negative examples. Using the complete gradient of the recurrent network and sufficient training examples to constrain the definition of the language to be induced, solutions are obtained that correctly recognize strings of arbitrary length. A method for extracting a finite state automaton corresponding to an optimized network is demonstrated.
