The entity set expansion problem is to expand a small set of seed entities to a more complete set of similar entities. It can be applied in applications such as web search, item recommendation and query expansion. Traditionally, people solve this problem by exploiting the co-occurrence of entities within web pages, where latent semantic correlation among seed entities cannot be revealed. We propose a novel approach to solve the problem using knowledge graphs, by considering the deficiency (e.g., incompleteness) of knowledge graphs. We design an effective ranking model based on the semantic features of seeds to retrieve the candidate entities. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the proposed solution significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.
