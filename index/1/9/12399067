The Prospector Multimedia Object Manager prototype is a general-purpose content analysis multimedia server designed for massively parallel processor environments. Prospector defines and manipulates user defined functions which are invoked in parallel to analyze/manipulate the contents of multimedia objects. Several computationally intensive applications of this technology based on large persistent datasets include: fingerprint matching, signature verification, face recognition, and speech recognition/translation [OIS96].
