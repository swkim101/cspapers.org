Method for the hydroformylation of olefins with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of soluble cobalt compounds as the catalyst at an elevated temperature and under increased pressure, and optionally in the presence of paraffins and/or other inert diluents. The hydroformylation is conducted, in a first stage, up to a conversion of about 40-75 percent with remixing of the reaction mixture, and then, in a second stage, up to a conversion of at least 95 percent, preferably 95-98 percent, without remixing.
