We demonstrate iGlasses, a novel recommendation system that accepts a frontal face photo as the input and returns the best-fit eyeglasses as the output. As conventional recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering become inapplicable in the problem, we propose a new recommendation method which exploits the implicit matching rules between human faces and eyeglasses. We first define fine-grained attributes for human faces and frames of glasses respectively. Then, we develop a recommendation framework based on a probabilistic graphical model, which effectively captures the correlation among these fine-grained attributes. Ranking of the frames (glasses) is done by their similarity to the query facial attributes. Finally, we produce a synthesized image for the input face to demonstrate the visual effect when wearing the recommended glasses.
