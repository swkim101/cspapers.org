The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois typifies current, high-performance computing centers that support a diverse user base of both academic and industrial accounts. The data requirements of this user community, coupled with resource constraints, mandate the use of an archival file system. This paper analyzes the spatial and temporal patterns of file archive transactions on the NCSA file archive. Analysis of archive transaction traces shows that the access patterns differ from those observed during studies of secondary storage systems: the files are larger, there are large temporal and spatial variations in transaction patterns, and a small number of research groups can easily account for twenty percent of the total traffic.
