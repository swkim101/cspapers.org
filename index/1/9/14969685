Software architecture is a distinct and developing discipline in the software profession. Many practitioners have apparently entered the field with little effort; adding the word "architect" to a title is easy to do. However, beneath the surface appearance, distinct approaches and toolsets are required to succeed. Reports of IT overspending and project failures emphasize the fact that these skills must be leveraged and developed. The practical application of this growing body of knowledge will continue to play an important role in the maturing of our profession, and its ability to deliver effective solutions. The software architect possesses a unique perspective and mental framework that guides the development of software systems. Additionally, strong interpersonal skills are vital to the software architect's success. In this paper, I explore the unique approaches and characteristics of the successful software architect.
