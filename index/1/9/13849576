In this paper, we propose an attention network for diffusion prediction problem. The developed diffusion attention module can effectively explore the implicit user-to-user diffusion dependency among information cascade users. Besides, the user-to-cascade importance and the time-decay effect are captured and utilized by the model. The superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art methods is demonstrated by experiments on real diffusion data.
