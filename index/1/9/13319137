In a mixed environment of autonomous driverless vehicles and human driven vehicles operating on the same road, identifying intentions of human drivers and interacting with them in a compliant and responsible manner becomes a challenging problem for the driverless vehicles. In this paper, the problem of vehicle interaction at an intersection merging scenario is formulated as an Intention-Aware motion planning problem using the tools from Mixed Observability Markov Decision Process (MOMDP). We utilize the tools from recent intention aware planning framework to demonstrate a merging behavior in the presence of human drivers by trying to infer and act according to the intentions of the human drivers. A driver behavior model for T-junction intersections is developed in order to calculate the probabilistic state transition functions of the MOMDP model. With proposed solution, it is demonstrated that using intention aware planning improves performance in comparison to present time to merge approach by lowering accident probability and intersection navigation duration. The proposed method is tested on a real autonomous vehicle (AV) in the presence of human driven vehicles to validate our approach.
