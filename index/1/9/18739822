This paper describes the process of bonding a MEMS (Micro-ElectroMechanical System) microgripper to the distal end of a robotic manipulator arm using a molten solder bonding technique. This task is part of ongoing work which involves the development of a general microassembly workstation. The goal of this workstation is to construct 3-D microstructures from MEMS sub-components. The microgrippers bonded using the method described here are 1.5 mm by 0.6 mm in size. The methodology behind the solder bonding approach is presented, along with the design of a custom soldering device referred to as the contact head. The contact head is used as the interface between the robotic manipulator and the microgripper. Experimental results are given in a qualitative discussion. An explanation of the bonding procedure using automated calibration is described, along with pictures from the associated microscopy system, and some scanning electron microscope images.
