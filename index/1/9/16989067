Recommender Systems are learning systems that make use of data representing multi-user preferences over items (e.g. Vote [user, item] matrix), to try to predict the preference towards new items or products regarding a particular user. User preferences are in fact the learning target functions. The main objective of the system is to filter items according to the predicted preferences and present to the user the options that are most attractive to him; i.e. he would probably like the most. We study Recommender Systems viewed as a pool of independent prediction algorithms, one per every user, in situations in which each learner faces a sequence of trials, with a prediction to make in each step. The goal is to make as few mistakes as possible. We are interested in the case that each learner has reasons to believe that there exists some other target functions in the pool that consistently behaves similar, neutral or opposite to the target function it is trying to learn. The learner doesnâ€™t know a priori which ones, but is willing to discover and use this information for the benefit of its own prediction. A simple, yet effective method is introduced for constructing a compound algorithm for each learner. Prediction is based on transformations over the original preferences, recorded as votes over the same items by other users, according to similarity patterns and updated weights, combining memory-based individual prediction and on-line weighted-majority voting. We prove mistake bounds for this algorithm that are closely related to the total loss of the best predictor in the pool.
