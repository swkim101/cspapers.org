There are several practical difficulties with the widespread application of artificial neural networks to predictive data mining. The inscrutability of the fitted model limits their suitability for many database marketing applications and can even have legal ramifications in credit scoring applications. Other difficulties concern determining the architecture of the network (the number of layers, the number of neurons) and trouble with numerical optimization such as local minima. Generalized additive neural networks (GANNs) have constraints on their architecture that lessen these difftculties. Graphical methods can be used for interpreting the effect of each input variable on the fitted model. Partial residual plots can be used to visually determine network complexity. With the addition of direct connections, GANNs can be initialized using generalized linear models. These methods are illustrated using a banking marketing example.
