Rsim is a switch-level simulator which can simulate large digital MOS integrated circuits with speedups of over three orders of magnitude over SPICE. Unfortunately, Rsim's simple switched-resistor model renders it incapable of simulating certain CMOS and most BiCMOS and ECL digital circuits. We observe that the switched-resistor model is just one particular piecewise linear model and that Rsim's simulation framework can accommodate more elaborate piecewise linear models. The resulting simulator, Mom, combines the efficiency of switch-level simulation with the ability to simulate a wider variety of circuits. We demonstrate Mom's efficiency and flexibility on a variety of circuits.
