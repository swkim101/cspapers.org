We devise several procedures based on signatures (or hashing functions) to determine equivalence of expressions in Random Polynomial Time (also called Probabilistic Polynomial Time) (RPT). These procedures return as result: “equivalent” or “not-equivalent”. The result “not-equivalent” is always correct, while the result “equivalent” is correct with probability at least 1-ε. This probability depends on a random number generator and is independent of the problem being solved. In all our procedures, the value ε can be made arbitrarily small. This method works for determining equivalence over an important class of functions as well as answering other questions like linearity, polynomial dependence, squareness, independence, etc.
