Over the past ten years, researchers in computational linguistics and information retrieval have made a number of advances in document retrieval, categorization, entity recognition and other areas. This drew the attention of venture capitalists who provided the money needed to commercialize this work. There have been some successes, but the landscape is littered with failed startups and applications that didn't live up to expectations.
