A low-loss millimeter-wave Wilkinson power divider has been developed on a 0.18-μm SiGe BiCMOS process. By employing a capacitive loading and slow-wave CPW structure, the power divider can be realized with more compact size and lower insertion loss compared to the conventional Wilkinson power divider. The developed power divider has extremely wideband performance from DC to 67 GHz with less than 1-dB insertion loss up to 61 GHz, amplitude and phase mismatches less than 0.5 dB and 2 degrees up to 67 GHz, respectively, and isolation greater than 15 dB across 37-67 GHz. Specifically at 60 GHz, 0.9 dB of insertion loss and better than 25 dB of isolation are obtained. The core chip size of the power divider is 150 μm × 525 μm.
