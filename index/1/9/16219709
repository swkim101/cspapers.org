A new parallel computer, ADENART (previously it was called ADENA,) for numerical applications has been developed. It is composed of 256 processing elements (:PEs) and interconnection networtcHXnet.) Each PE consists of a dedicated floating-point processor VLSI whose sustained performance is 10 MFLOPS, a communication controller VLSI and locally-distributed memories. The peak performance of the system is, therefore, 2.56GFLOPS. HXnet supports two types of efficient data-transfer modes; FAST mode and SLOW mode. Both of them are useful for various applications. The practical performance of ADENART system has been evaluated by several application programs. In partial differential equation solver, the system performance was measured as 475 MFLOPS.
