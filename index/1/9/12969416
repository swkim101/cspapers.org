Most one-way constraint solvers use directed dataflow graphs to represent the dependencies among variables in a constraint. Unfortunately, dataflow graphs require a great deal of storage. These storage costs can help push a large application into virtual memory, thus significantly degrading interactive performance. Reducing the storage costs of dataflow graphs is therefore an important goal in constraint research. This paper describes a study that makes two contributions to solving this problem:
