This paper considers an M-member "individual-based" continuous time swarm model with individuals that moving with a nutrient profile (or an attractant/repellent) in an n-dimensional space. The swarm behavior is a result of a balance between inter-individual interplays as well as the interplays of the swarm agents with their environment. It is proved that the swarm members aggregate and eventually form a cohesive cluster of finite size around the swarm center in a finite time under certain conditions.
