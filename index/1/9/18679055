Volunteer computing is a powerful platform for solving complex scientific problems. MindModeling@Home is a volunteer computing project available to the cognitive modeling community for conducting research to better understand the human mind. We are interested in optimizing search processes on volunteer resources, yet we are also interested in exploring and understanding changes in model performance across interacting, non-linear mechanisms and parameter spaces. To support both of these goals, we have developed a stochastic optimization approach and integrated it with MindModeling@Home. We tested this approach with a cognitive model on a sample parameter space, demonstrating significant decreases in computational resource utilization and search runtime, while also providing useful visual representations of performance surfaces. Future work will focus on scaling the technique to more volunteers and larger parameter spaces, as well as optimizing the performance of the search algorithm in regards to the challenges inherent with volunteer computing.
