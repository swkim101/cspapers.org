This paper describes our use of a 1970's era PDP-11/10 to support an hour long module which we have incorporated into our computer organization course for the past few semesters. The module is designed to reinforce standard concepts such as number systems and two-pass assemblers while at the same time exposing the students to some historical issues. After providing some background information about the PDP-11/10 we explain the motivation for our approach. Then we describe a fifteen minute instructional video which we have produced on the topic of developing programs on the PDP/11-10. The video is available from the authors either on VHS tape or as a QuickTime file, thereby allowing instructors at other schools to try our approach by showing the video to their students.
