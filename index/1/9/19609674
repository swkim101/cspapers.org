In this work we present two mobile, locative and collaborative distributed games that are played using wireless sensor devices. We briefly present the architecture of the two games and demonstrate their capabilities. The key characteristic of these games is that players interact with each other and their surrounding environment by moving, running and gesturing as a means to perform game related actions, using sensor devices. We demonstrate our system's implementation, which uses a combination of JAVA Standard and Mobile editions.
