In this paper, we present a mechanism for automatic management of the memory hierarchy, including secondary storage, in the context of a global address space parallel programming framework. The programmer specifies the parallelism and locality in the computation. The scheduling of the computation into stages, together with the movement of the associated data between secondary storage and global memory, and between global memory and local memory, is automatically managed. A novel formulation of hypergraph partitioning is used to model the optimization problem of minimizing disk I/O. Experimental evaluation of the proposed approach using a sub-computation from the quantum chemistry domain shows a reduction in the disk I/O cost by up to a factor of 11, and a reduction in turnaround time by up to 49%, as compared to alternative approaches used in state-of-the-art quantum chemistry codes
