Given this reality, our goal is to create algorithms that learn effectively in repeated games played with minimal information. As in other applications of machine learning, the success of a learning algorithm in repeated games depends on its learning bias. To better understand what learning biases are most successful, we analyze the learning biases of previously published multi-agent learning (MAL) algorithms. We then describe a new algorithm that adapts a successful learning bias from the literature to minimal information environments. Finally, we compare the performance of this algorithm with ten other algorithms in repeated games played with minimal information.
