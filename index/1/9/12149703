OSprof is a versatile, portable, and efficient profiling methodology based on the analysis of latency distributions. Although OSprof has offers several unique benefits and has been used to uncover several interesting performance problems, the latency distributions that it provides must be analyzed manually. These latency distributions are presented as histograms and contain distinct groups of data, called peaks, that characterize the overall behavior of the running code. By automating the analysis process, we make it easier to take advantage of OSprof's unique features.
 We have developed the Dynamic Analysis of Root Causes system (DARC), which finds root cause paths in a running program's call-graph using runtime latency analysis. A root cause path is a call-path that starts at a given function and includes the largest latency contributors to a given peak. These paths are the main causes for the high-level behavior that is represented as a peak in an OSprof histogram. DARC performs PID and call-path filtering to reduce overheads and perturbations, and can handle recursive and indirect calls. DARC can analyze preemptive behavior and asynchronous call-paths, and can also resume its analysis from a previous state, which is useful when analyzing short-running programs or specific phases of a program's execution.
 We present DARC and show its usefulness by analyzing behaviors that were observed in several interesting scenarios. We also show that DARC has negligible elapsed time overheads for normal use cases.
