It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the first edition of WWW 2018 Journal Track. The track is new track within WWW conference series and it is intended as a forum for presentations of significant Web-related research results that have been published recently in well-known and established journals, and have never been presented at any Web-related conference. The goal is to give visibility of these results to a conference audience as well as to promote discussions concerning such results. The call for papers of the journal track was open for two categories of papers: 1) self-nominations from authors promoting their own journal publication(s) and matching the prerequisites reported above; 2) invited papers, selected on the basis of interest, appropriateness and attractiveness for the WWW 2018 audience, from articles published since January 1st 2015 (even only in the electronic version) in the following journals: Journal of Network and Computer Applications, Journal of Web Semantics, Semantic Web Journal, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, Journal of Machine Learning Research, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, ACM Transactions on the Web, ACM Computing Surveys, Knowledge-based systems, Artificial Intelligence. Exceptions have been also considered for papers judged as potentially very influential but published before January 2015 or in a journal not included in the list. We received 61 submissions and accepted 12 of them for presentation to the WWW 2018 Journal Track. The papers have been evaluated according to the following criteria: novelty, relevance to the conference, quality of the extended abstract, metrics values (e.g. number of citations) computed for the original journal paper, representativeness and impact factor of the journals in which the papers have been published (secondarily). We also took in account the coverage of the different areas related to WWW.
