In this paper, we present a control strategy using real-time feedback combined with feasible path planning to manipulate a type of microorganism, Tetrahymena pyriformis (T. pyriformis), as a micro-bio-robot using artificial magnetotaxis. Artificially magnetotactic T. pyriformis cells were created by the internalization of iron oxide nano particles. Following the magnetization of the internalized particles, the cells become controllable using an external time-varying magnetic field. The behavior of artificially magnetotactic T. pyriformis under a magnetic field has been investigated in a manual control experiment. A feasible path planner called rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) and a feedback control scheme are implemented to guide the cell to a desired position and orientation. Since the motion of T. pyriformis is nonlinear like that of a car, combining the RRT and feedback control allows the cell to be controlled in 3-dimensional (x, y, Â¸) space. In the results, real-time feedback control of T. pyriformis in 3-dimensional space demonstrated the potential of utilizing T. pyriformis as a micro-bio-robot for microscale tasks.
