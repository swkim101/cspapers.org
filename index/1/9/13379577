Recently, analysts and vendors have been promoting event driven architecture as the "next big thing". Simple event-driven processing has been in common use for at least ten years with technology such as message-oriented middleware and, in the past few years, message-driven Enterprise JavaBeans. However, the next big thing to which they refer is the architecture that supports processing complex business events to address real-time business needs. Recognizing the importance of this topic, a one-day workshop was held in conjunction with OOPSLA 06 to address issues related to EDA on Sunday October 22, 2006, at the Oregon Conference Center.The workshop provides a forum in which researchers and practitioners from academia and industry can discuss various aspects of event-driven processing and its relationship to other architecture and programming paradigms, particularly with service-oriented architecture.Topics to include (but are not limited to): definition and classification of events, event modeling, tooling for event processing, methods for developing event driven systems and applications, event processing languages and toolsEvent driven business process management, event processing for business activity management, relationship with service-oriented architecture and other architecture, information delivery services and implementation of 'publish/subscribe' protocols, event pattern detection, implementation issues, potential inhibitors to the adoption of EDA, security and privacy issues in event-based systems and application.The primary expected outcomes of this workshop are: 1. Cross-fertilization between researchers and practitioners in all aspects of event processing; 2. A report on the discussions of the workshop which, based on the quality of the outcome, can be published as a technical paper.
