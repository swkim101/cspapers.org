This paper develops a novel approach to compute and search for context-specific similarity relationships between ETML resources (EyperText Markup Language). The similarity is computed by decomposing resources into parts, finding similar parts among resources, and then extracting the pattern of matched parts into a feature vector. This general approach for resource-resource linking is termed part-linking and its specialization to HTML resources is termed ktmllinhing. Given the vectors describing resource-resource associations, the following search process can be employed: â€œEnd all resources similar to rs in the same manner that R5OUKe fd i5 Simih tO Ts.= A neighborhood search modal is developed to execute and control thii style of request and find all resources in the network matching the sample structure within well-defined windows of approximation. The innovation of the html-linking model is its matching of textual resources based on the locality and organizational structure of the content found to be matching between resources.
