A framework for the study of computer capacity is given by means of a definition of capacity in terms of speeds of various parts of a computer as well as memory size. In addition to these machine parameters, we also include certain parameters of the programs to be run on a given machine. The calculation of theoretical capacity is given for several combinations of processor, memory, and I/O bandwidth for overlapped machines. The tradeoff between primary memory size and I/O bandwidth is discussed in terms of the new definition.
