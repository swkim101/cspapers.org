Results of cognitive psychology research are analysed to explain why it is difficult for retrieval system users to bring to mind alternative search terms. A human memory model is modified in such a way that it produces additional search terms instead of human associations. A small experiment shows that such a spreading activation network can find alternative terms with a performance similar to the normally used similarity measures.
