Materials and textures identification is a desired ability for robots. Developing such systems require tactile sensors that have enough sensitivity and spatial resolution, and the computational intelligence to meaningfully interpret sensor data. This paper introduces a texture classification algorithm utilizing support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Data taken from a novel three axis tactile sensor that utilize magnetic flux measurements for transduction was used to obtain the three dimensional tactile data. Frobenius norm calculated from the covariance matrix of the above data and the mean values of the three dimensional sensor data were used as features. Palpation velocity and small vertical load variances had minimum influence on the proposed algorithm. We have compared this algorithm with two other classification methods. They are: classify using the feature spatial period that is calculated from principal frequencies of the textures/material, and classify using neural network classifier with special properties of each material's tactile signals as features. For eight classes of material, the proposed algorithm performed faster and more accurately than the comparators when the scanning velocity and the vertical load varied.
