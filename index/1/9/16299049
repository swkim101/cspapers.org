We describe our system, GSPIM, used for visualization of low-level MIPS Assembly programming and simulation. Although many visualization tools for algorithms and high-level programs have been considered in educational settings, visualization specific to low-level programs have not received enough consideration. One desirable property of such a visualization is that it should close the gap between high-level programming constructs and the sequential nature of low-level programs. Secondly it should provide techniques to present information specific to the simulation of the code. GSPIM supports both properties and is publicly available at http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~cesim/gspim.tar.gz
