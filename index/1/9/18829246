The paper presents methods that we have implemented to improve the quality of the def-uses reported for dynamically allocated locations. The methods presented are based on the Ruggieri/Murtagh naming scheme for dynamically created locations. We expand upon this scheme to name dynamically allocated locations for some user written allocation routines. Using this expanded naming scheme, we introduce an inexpensive, non-iterative, and localized calculation of extended must alias analysis to handle dynamically allocated locations, and show how this information can be used to improve def-use information. This is the first attempt to specify must alias information for names which represent a set of dynamically allocated locations. Empirical results are presented to illustrate the usefulness of our method. We consider this work a step towards developing practical re-engineering tools for C.
