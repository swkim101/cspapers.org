We describe a general technique for expressing domain knowledge in constraint satisfaction problems, and using it to develop optimized parallel arc consistency algorithms for the solution of problems in the domain. The technique is applied to reduce the space complexity of the the massively parallel AC Chip algorithm. Results of the optimizations are shown for an object recognition domain in which they reduce the complexity of the chip by many orders of magnitude. The technique can be applied analogously to reduce the time complexity of the uniprocessor arc consistency algorithm AC-4.
