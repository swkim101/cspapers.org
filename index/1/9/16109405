This paper presents a methodology for the development of a multi-axis force/torque sensor based on optoelectronic technology. The advantages of using this sensing principle are the low manufacturing costs, the simple fabrication, and the immunity to electrical noise. The force/ torque sensor makes use of six optical sensors: each sensor measures the displacement of a reflective surface that moves integrally with a simply-supported beam. The proposed mechanical structure allows for a variety of shapes on the mechanical structure to be easily adaptable to many robot applications. In this paper, we present a five-axis force/torque sensor based on this optoelectronic principle. To measure force/torque components, two identical three-DoF force/torque sensor structures (comprised of three beams) are mounted on top of each other. Photo sensors and mirrors are fixed inside the structure to measure the six beam deflections. In this paper, we describe the sensor structure, design, fabrication, calibration, and verify our sensor development methodology.
