In this paper we present a wearable Haptic Feedback Device to convey intuitive motion direction to the user through haptic feedback based on vibrotactile illusions. Vibrotactile illusions occur on the skin when two or more vibrotactile actuators in proximity are actuated in coordinated sequence, causing the user to feel combined sensations, instead of separate ones. By combining these illusions we can produce various sensation patterns that are discernible by the user, thus allowing to convey different information with each pattern. A method to provide information about direction through vibrotactile illusions is introduced on this paper. This method uses a grid of vibrotactile actuators around the arm actuated in coordination. The sensation felt on the skin is consistent with the desired direction of motion, so the desired motion can be intuitively understood. We show that the users can recognize the conveyed direction, and implemented a proof of concept of the proposed method to guide users' elbow flexion/extension motion.
