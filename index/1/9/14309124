Recently, it has been shown that this problem can be solved efficiently, without the need of a plan library, using slightly modified planning algorithms. In this work, we extend this approach to the more general problem of probabilistic plan recognition where a probability distribution over the set of goals is sought under the assumptions that actions have deterministic effects and both agent and observer have complete information about the initial state. We show that this problem can be solved efficiently using classical planners provided that the probability of a partially observed execution given a goal is defined in terms of the cost difference of achieving the goal under two conditions: complying with the observations, and not complying with them. This cost, and hence the posterior goal probabilities, are computed by means of two calls to a classical planner that no longer has to be modified in any way. A number of examples is considered to illustrate the quality, flexibility, and scalability of the approach.
