A fundamental change in the Internet backbone routing started in January 2011: The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has officially been deployed by the Regional Internet Registries. It leverages the validation of BGP prefix updates based on cryptographically verified data and may lead to secure inter-domain routing at last. In this talk, we present RTRlib, a highly efficient reference C implementation of the RPKI router part. We deploy RTRlib and conduct a long-term measurement using live BGP streams to evaluate the current impact of RPKI-based prefix origin validation on BGP routers. We observe that most of the invalid prefixes are most likely the result of misconfiguration. RTRlib is the only openly available tool for monitoring RPKI validation activities in real-time. We measure a relatively small overhead of origin validation on commodity hardware (5% more RAM than required for full BGP table support, 0.41% load in case of â‡¡ 92,000 prefix updates per minute).
