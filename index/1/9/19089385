People use gestures to communitcate with other people without difficutlty. As a method of computer/human interaction, gestures are more intuitive and more direct than existing input devices, such as keyboards, mice, etc., and futhermore, are more functional. Using hand gestures, which are important human gestures, is a key technique to build a friendly user interface.Some gestures are considered to be simbols, such as "OK" gesture, American sign language. Others have numerical meaning, i.e. how long, how large, how fast. etc. To deal with both kinds of hand gestures, we propose a hand shape representation method.The method represents a hand shape with 15 dimensional data of 5 finger tip positions in 3D. To implement both static and dynamic hand gestures in a graphic object manipulation system, at each measurement time the current hand shape is classified into 10 classes of hand shapes using subspace method and the hand movement is evaluated using recurrnet neural network.The system allows a user to manipulate graphic objects intuitively and directly.
