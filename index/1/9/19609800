Open architecture CNC control systems are demanded for modem intelligent material processing. On-line monitoring and real-time feedback control is necessary in many applications. With the advance of PC technology, it is now possible to develop PC-based CNC systems, which are open-architecture in nature, powerful in the capacity, and yet affordable. It is desired to develop a new PC-based CNC control system which can be integrated with other systems and perform intelligent material processing control.
