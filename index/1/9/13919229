In this paper, we study the parallelization of lagged Fibonacci plus and minus generators, which we collectively call additive lagged Fibonacci generators. Two popular ways of generating a random sequence in parallel are studied the contiguous subsequence technique and the leapfrog technique. We show that the additive lagged Fibonacci generators can be parallelized efficiently using the contiguous subsequence technique on any parallel computer. For the leapfrog technique, we present an efficient parallelizat ion for hypercubic networks and permutation networks.
