We are in a phase of 'Participatory Web' in which users add value' to the information on the web by publishing, tagging and sharing. The Participatory Web has enormous potential for an enterprise because unlike the users of the internet an enterprise is a community that shares common goals, assumptions, vocabulary and interest and has reliable user identification and mutual trust along with a central governance and incentives to collaborate. Everyday, the employees of an organization locate content relevant to their work on the web. Finding this information takes time, expertise and creativity, which costs an organization money. That is, the web pages employees find are knowledge assets owned by the enterprise. This investment in web-based knowledge assets is lost every time the enterprise fails to capture and reuse them. iCollaborate is tooled to capture user's web interaction, persist and analyze it, and feed that interaction back into the community - the enterprise.
