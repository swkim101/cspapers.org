Consider a set I of even cardinality, and assume that for each member a c I there is given a subset I(a) of “acceptable” partners ranked according to a’s individual preferences. A stable matching problem is to find a partition of I into \II /2 admissible pairs with a property that no two unpaired members both prefer each other to their partners under matching. In 1962, Gale and Shapley [1] introduced and studied a “stable marriages” problem, which is a bipartite version of the stable matching problem, that is I = 11+12, 1111= 1121= 111/2, and I(a) =12 or 11 dependent upon whether a ~ II or a G 12. The sets 11, 12 can be interpreted as the set of men and the set of women, and a matching between 11 and 12 as a marriage assignment. Gale and Shapley described a finite-step algorithm; it consists of rounds of proposals of currently free men, each to his next best woman, with every collision of suitors resolved in favor of the better suitor and all the rejected men having to propose in the next round. They proved that a final round results in a stable matching, thus establishing that at least one such matching (marriage) always exists. In 1971, McVitie and Wilson [2] suggested an alternative proposal algorithm in which, unlike Gale-Shapley’s algorithm, the proposals by men are made one at a time. Remarkably, this algorithm yields the same stable matching, and it requires in the course of its work the same set of proposals, as the algorithm in [1].
