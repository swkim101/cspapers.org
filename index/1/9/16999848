Human-computer interface development tools are interactive systems that support production and execution of the human-computer interface. With their recent proliferation, evaluations and comparisons are constantly done, but without a formal, structured approach. Addressing these problems is difficult, largely because of the relative newness of such tools, because of the many different kinds of systems that are called UIMS, and because of their inherent complexity. These tools are complex because human-computer interfaces, which produce tools, are complex.
