This paper demonstrates a “Grasp X” robot arm manipulation using a 2.5D disparity map and a Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm for recognizing the target object. The SIFT algorithm is applied after stereo segmentation, which reduces the matching time. Due to the high inaccuracy of the stereo disparity map and the maneuverability limitation of a twofinger gripper of the robot, RT 100, a cube model is used in order to calculate the object centroid as a grasp point.
