My thesis investigates fault tolerance for cooperative agent systems that have some equivalent of self-replication and self-death. Utilizing biologically-inspired mechanisms, I increase multi-agent system robustness for faulty agents when it is unknown exactly which agent is malfunctioning. It is important to determine new ways to increase robustness of a system, as otherwise it cannot be guaranteed to function in all situations and thus cannot be relied upon. Robustness of a system allows agents to recover from errors and thus function continuously, an increasingly important trait as agent systems are deployed in real world scenarios such as sensor networks or surveillance systems where faulty or malicious nodes could disrupt application performance. To achieve robustness, there must either be prevention of all errors, or a technique for recovering from errors after they have occurred. My thesis creates a new fault tolerance mechanism inspired by cancer biology to remove faulty agents, and then re-applies the developed technique to study the removal of biological cancer cells in simulation.
