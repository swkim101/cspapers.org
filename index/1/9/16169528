With the growing interest in wireless sensor networks, techniques for their systematic analysis design and optimization are essential. Despite numerous research efforts in optimizing hardware, algorithms and protocols for these networks, it remains largely unexplored how these innovations can be all tied together to design a sensor network for a specific practical application. We propose a methodology that starts from four independent quality of service (QoS) parameters and allows the user to completely and unambiguously describe the desired performance, without having to deal with the details of individual devices or protocols. By making appropriate choices in terms of device capabilities and run-time techniques, a design can be positioned in this four-dimensional QoS space. Furthermore, we describe a technique to explore the associated tradeoffs at design time, using both analytical expressions and simulations. To illustrate the benefits of our approach, a design example is worked out, which shows a five fold improvement in network operational lifetime by adapting the event reporting delay.
