The need to ease the user's handling of data banks concerning natural insertions and deletions, requires more data independencies. A fundamental trend to 'normalize' relations in first and second normal forms has been indicated by Codd and Kent. When it comes to the third normal form, obscurities are spreading. This touches the very moment, when adequate content relations of programming morphologies to content realities are missing. As Chamberlin, Gray and Traiger pointed out, a so called 'rectangle of a base relation' aids to clarify natural function dependencies. These indications have been further developed and advanced to a level, where each tuple and entity is subdivided into six deuter-criteria: 1. identity, 2. age, 3. association, 4. frequency, 5. significance and 6. truth. The validity of each criterion is related to all potential components within a relational data base. The metric data of each deuter criterion can be derived by analytical methods within three- and four dimensional realities in the model of a deuter-sphere. This leads to fundamental insertion- and deletion rules and an improved updating.
