We describe two algorithms for solving this problem, one exact and one a top-down novel approach, and we derive a consistency results for the case of two segments and no outliers. Robustness to outliers is evaluated on two real-world tasks related to speech segmentation. Our algorithms outperform baseline segmentation algorithms.
