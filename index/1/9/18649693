Present commercial turbomachinery design is based on past experience and trial and error methods and is a relatively slow process. Mathematically complete three dimensional solutions are not available yet. Approximate two dimensional solutions are limited to laboratory model study and are impractical for commercial application. To improve the present commercial design method and to increase the designer's independence, a computer program was developed. The program input can be varied from minimum customer specification (Head, capacity and RPM) to a large number of defined parameters. While present hand design time is measured in weeks, this program will accomplish the same task with a few three minute runs.
