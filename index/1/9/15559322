We present in this paper an original model to simulate visual perception based on the detection of salient features. Salient features correspond to the maximum of conspicuity in a static image or in a sequence of images. We intend to use this information to provide visually interesting targets that can be used in multiple contexts. The extraction process of such an information is performed through multiple steps that correspond to different features locally encoding the conspicuity of a spatial location. We mainly use for those features spatial orientation and motion information, but other types of feature could be used as well. Two kinds of application are presented in this paper: video surveillance application and simulation of the visual perception of a synthetic actor.
