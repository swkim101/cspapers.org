This paper describes the introduction of a feedback-revision-resubmission cycle for homework assignments in two introductory courses. The goal was to increase student engagement with homework assignments as an important tool for concept practice and mastery. A review of the effects in both an object-oriented programming course and a relational databases course shows positive outcomes as reflected in both course evaluations and a decision tree analysis of student performance on assignments.
