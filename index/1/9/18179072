In this paper the user interface and program organization of the SYMPLE VLSI symbolic layout editor is examined. The user interface is driven by a small interpreter that is constructed from a LISP-like language at run time and has access to a consistent library of menus and graphical information-gathering functions. To improve maintainability, the editor has been constructed in a modular form with well-defined interfaces.
