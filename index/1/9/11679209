This poster introduces an application-specific trace log compression mechanism targeted for execution on wireless sensor network nodes. Trace logs capture sequences of significant events executed on a node to provide visibility into the system. The application-specific compression mechanism exploits static program control flow knowledge to automate insertion of trace statements that capture trace data in a concise form. Initial evaluation reveals that these compressed trace logs, when generated, consume just over a fifth of the space required by standard trace logging techniques.
