There have been numerous testimonies to the inadequacies of our educational system [83]. For undergraduate computer science educators, major concerns regarding student preparation include poor problem solving and critical thinking skills, weak mathematics background, an inability to convey thoughts and concepts, and a lack of motivation. These problems can be addressed in the introductory computer science course by developing an integrated approach to effectively teaching discrete mathematical foundations, fundamental computer science concepts, and problem-solving skills. This paper is conceptual in nature and introduces some specific examples of possible approaches to overcoming these deficiencies and problems.
