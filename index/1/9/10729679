In addition, several of these semantic types have multiple heterogeneous representations, while sharing syntactic structure with other types. In this work, we propose a new approach to use conditional random fields (CRFs) to perform semantic annotation of structured data that takes advantage of the structure and labels of the tokens for higher accuracy of field labeling, while still allowing the use of exact inference techniques. We compare our approach with a linear-CRF based model that only labels fields and also with a regular-expression based approach.
