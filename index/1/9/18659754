A B S T R A C T Modern application software often includes operations that are performed by complex mathematical algorithms. These algorithms--far from being the "black boxes" typically portrayed in computer science courses-may instead be viewed as interactive processes, each presenting its own particular "interface" to the user. This paper, then, offers a number of intepface guidelines for mathematical algorithms--principles whose purpose is to suggest ways in which users may employ algorithms with greater control and expressiveness. As a source of examples, we illustrate the guidelines through a particular complex mathematical problem--that of generating a "folding net" for a three-dimensional solid.
