For online reviews, sentiment explanations refer to the sentences that may suggest detailed reasons of sentiment, which are very important for applications in review mining like opinion summarization. In this paper, we address the problem of ranking sentiment explanations by formulating the process as two subproblems: sentence informativeness ranking and structural sentiment analysis. Tractable inference in joint prediction is performed through dual decomposition. Preliminary experiments on publicly available data demonstrate that our approach obtains promising performance.
