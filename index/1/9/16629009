In our implementation, the auction is able to automatically detect, as the rounds progress, whether price expressiveness must be increased to clear the market. The auction also features a configurable step size which can be tuned to trade-off between monotonicity in prices and the number of bidding rounds, with no impact on efficiency. An empirical evaluation against a state of the art ascending-price auction demonstrates the performance gains that can be obtained in efficiency, revenue, and rounds to convergence through various configurations of our design.
