In this paper we describe a type of data fusion involving the combination of evidence derived from multiple document representations. Our aim is to investigate if a composite representation can improve the online detection of novel events in a stream of broadcast news stories. This classification process otherwise known as first story detection FSD (or in the Topic Detection and Tracking pilot study as online new event detection [1]), is one of three main classification tasks defined by the TDT initiative. Our composite document representation consists of a semantic representation (based on the lexical chains derived from a text) and a syntactic representation (using proper nouns). Using the TDT1 evaluation methodology, we evaluate a number of document representation combinations using these document classifiers.
