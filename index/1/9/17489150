Community detection is a hot topic for researchers in the fields including graph theory, social networks and biological networks. Generally speaking, a community refers to a group of densely linked nodes in the network. Nodes usually have more than one community label, indicating their multiple roles or functions in the network. Unfortunately, existing solutions aiming at overlapping-community-detection are not capable of scaling to large-scale networks with millions of nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose a fast overlapping-communitydetection algorithm â€” FOX. In the experiment on a network with 3.9 millions nodes and 20 millions edges, the detection finishes in 14 minutes and provides the most qualified results. The second fastest algorithm, however, takes ten times longer to run. As for another network with 22 millions nodes and 127 millions edges, our algorithm is the only one that can provide an overlapping community detection result and it only takes 238 minutes. Our algorithm draws lessons from potential games, a concept in game theory. We measure the closeness of a node to a community by counting the number of triangles formed by the node and two other nodes form the community. Potential games ensure that the algorithm can reach convergence. We also extend the exploitation of triangle to open-triangle, which enlarges the scale of the detected communities.
