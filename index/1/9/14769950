This paper details our experience building and validating six different expert-based Web effort estimation models for ICT companies in New Zealand and Brazil. All models were created using Bayesian networks, via eliciting knowledge from domain experts, and validated using data from past finished projects. Post-mortem interviews with the participating companies showed that they found the entire process extremely beneficial and worthwhile, and that all the models created remained in use by those companies.
