We present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a fiber optically sensorized robotic hand for multi purpose manipulation tasks. The robotic hand has three fingers that enable both pinch and power grips. The main bone structure was made of a rigid plastic material and covered by soft skin. Both bone and skin contain embedded fiber optics for force and tactile sensing, respectively. Eight fiber optic strain sensors were used for rigid bone force sensing, and six fiber optic strain sensors were used for soft skin tactile sensing. For characterization, different loads were applied in two orthogonal axes at the fingertip and the sensor signals were measured from the bone structure. The skin was also characterized by applying a light load on different places for contact localization. The actuation of the hand was achieved by a tendon-driven under-actuated system. Gripping motions are implemented using an active tendon located on the volar side of each finger and connected to a motor. Opening motions of the hand were enabled by passive elastic tendons located on the dorsal side of each finger.
