The token bus based local area network, REDPUC, designed and implemented at the Pontíficia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro is briefly described. Analytic models are presented, which allow one to obtain an approximation for the average packet delay, as well as exact upper and lower bounds for the same performance measure. A performance evaluation of interconnected local networks is also given.
