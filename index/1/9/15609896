In this poster, we present a novel spectrum monitor, named AirEye, that monitors a wide spectrum band using only a narrowband radio. Unlike previous work, AirEye blindly extracts cyclic features from received waveform and performs classification without any prior knowledge on the transmitted signals. Although AirEye uses only a narrowband radio, it can still identify any signal that is wider than the radio bandwidth. Finally, AirEye exploits the signal sparsity in both radio and cyclic frequency dimensions to significantly speedup the feature extraction.
