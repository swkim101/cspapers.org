CHI 2014 received over 2000 submissions. Those papers and notes were from diversified research domains â€” psychologists and computer scientists began to meet new visions from sociology, engineering and manufacturing, communication sciences, design and arts, among others. Here, I would like to introduce progress in HCI research which will bring new opportunities and challenges to AI community.
