Scenario-based esign techniques are increasingly popular in KC1 design Although many techniques exist, we see a growing demand for more structured and systematic methods of scenario generation and development. This paper describes a case study in which a collaborative science learning environment was designed using an evolutionary scenario-based design approach. The case study has attempted to make consistent use of scenarios and claims as design representations, to integrate the desigu aE both the system and the activities that incorporate if and to evolve design in an organized and principled manner. We have termed this approach progressive cbesign.
