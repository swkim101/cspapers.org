An outline of a theory of comprehension of declarative contexts is presented. The main aspect of the theory being developed is based on Kant's distinction between concepts as rules (we have called them conceptual specialists) and concepts as an abstract representation (schemata, frames). Comprehension is viewed as a process dependent on the conceptual specialists (they contain the inferential knowledge), the schemata or frames (they contain the declarative knowledge), and a parser. The function of the parser is to produce a segmentation of the sentences in a case frame structure, thus determininig the meaning of prepositions, polysemous verbs, noun group etc. The function of this parser is not to produce an output to be interpreted by semantic routines or an interpreter, but to start the parsing process and proceed until a concept relevant to the theme of the text is recognized. Then the concept takes control of the comprehension process overriding the lower level linguistic process. Hence comprehension is viewed as a process in which high level sources of knowledge (concepts) override lower level linguistic processes.
