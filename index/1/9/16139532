We present a few modifications that stabilize nonlinear reduced order models generated by discrete empirical interpolation methods. We combine a different approach to linearization with a multipoint stabilization technique. The examples used to demonstrate our method's effectiveness are a nonlinear transmission line, a micromachined switch, and a nonlinear thermal model for an RF amplifier.
