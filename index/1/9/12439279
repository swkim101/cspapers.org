Recently, a family of global, non-submodular energy functions has been proposed that is expressed as coupling edges in a graph cut. This formulation provides a rich modelling framework and also leads to efficient approximate inference algorithms. So far, the results addressed binary random variables. Here, we extend these results to the multi-label case, and combine edge coupling with move-making algorithms.
