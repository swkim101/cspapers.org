Nowadays, robotic systems are more and more equipped with catadioptric cameras. However several problems associated to catadioptric vision have been studied only slightly. Especially algorithms for detecting rectangles in catadioptric images have not yet been developed whereas it is required in diverse applications such as building extraction in aerial images. We show that working in the equivalent sphere provides an appropriate framework to detect lines, parallelism, orthogonality and therefore rectangles. Finally, we present experimental results on synthesized and real data.
