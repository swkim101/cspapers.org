INTRODUCTlON The Boeing Advanced Technology Center (ATC) for Computer Science is a Boeing-wide resource that resides in Boeing Computer Services (BCS), a division of The Boeing Company. The role of the ATC is to identify, understand, and determine how to convert and transfer emerging technology into Boeingâ€™s computing environment. The ATC focuses on technologies related to artificial intelligence, knowledge-based computing, and advanced parallel and vector processing architectures ap plied to both engineering and office environments. Many ATC projects address human-computer interaction issues or related issues such as natural language processing. Reponsibility for managing the ATC is shared by George Roberts, Bruce Wilson, and Miroslav Benda. This review will summarize the ATC projects most closely related to human-computer interaction issues.
