We propose a biomechatronics-based master/slave topology which is going to provide an Extended Physiological Proprioception (EPP)-equivalent control but without the use of a harness, cineplasty, or Bowden cable. The proposed control uses an implanted micro servo actuator. The original Bowden-cable EPP topology is compared to the proposed one and their simulation results are presented. The simulation results are encouraging since they indicate the materialization potential of the topology, both in terms of control and of low power, two essential factors in making the presence of an implant in the human body feasible. This control topology will provide a modern EPP-equivalent control scheme for upper-limb prostheses without the disadvantages of previous EPP configurations but with the control advantages of proprioceptive feedback.
