In this paper we present a decision support scheme to help managing and optimizing two critical activities in intermodal terminals, namely the containers allocation in the terminal yard and the freight trains composition. In particular, the focus of this paper is on the first problem and the goal is that of maximizing the utilization of the available space while keeping into account several constraints. The approach was successfully tested on a real case study, the rail-road terminal of a leading intermodal logistics company.
