Thanks to an electro-sensible skin, some species of fish can feel the surrounding electric field generated by them-self or other fish. Known under the name of “electric-sense”, this ability allows these fish to navigate in confined surroundings. Based on a bio-inspired electric sensor, this article presents how this electric sense can be used for the navigation in formation of several underwater vehicles. The formation considered is a file, each vehicle is assumed to follow its predecessor at a given distance. In confined environment, the file formation is interesting since fish can follow the same safe path. Being based on the servoing of the electric measurements, these laws do not require the knowledge of the location of the agents. The underwater vehicle studied have non holonomic properties, their forward velocity has no lateral component. Depending on the choice of the controlled outputs (combination of electric measures) we will see that path followed by the follower agents can be different and a methodology to choose the output will be defined in order that all the agents follow the leader path in presence of curved motion of the leader. The influence of the number of electrodes is discussed. Simulation results illustrate the proposed approach.
