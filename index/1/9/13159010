For its third edition, TempWeb includes 9 papers out of a total of 18 papers submitted. The quality of papers has constantly improved, so that we have been “forced” to accept every second paper submitted to the third edition. We like to interpret paper quality and slightly increased submission figures as a clear sign of a positive dynamic in the study of time in the scope of the Web and an indication of the relevance of this effort. The workshop proceedings are published by ACM DL as part of the WWW 2013 Companion Publication.
