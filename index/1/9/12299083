Software vendors rarely acknowledge their debt to research, indeed often are unaware of it, and rarely even appreciate the importance of such acknowledgement. The long lead times, and tortuous adoption paths, for software engineering research contributions also cloud perception of the actual source of popularly adopted software engineering technologies. Whatever the reasons, this panel proposes to address the problem of lack of appreciation of software engineering research by presenting evidence of the ways in which the work of the community has had tangible, and often substantial, impact. The case studies we will trace include: the growth of software design and architecture from the early work of Parnas, Jackson, et al.,. the growth of software testing and analysis technology from the early work of Howden, Miller, et. al., and the growth of software measurement from the work of Boehm and others. It is hoped that this panel will prove to be the springboard for a larger community effort to document in a scholarly and articulate way the successes and impacts of our community. It is hoped that this documentation will lead to improved self-image, greater respect from other communities, and a more favorable attitude from funding sources. Part of the panel discussion will focus on how to achieve these goals.
