The mass parameters of the human body segments are important when studying motion dynamics and the in-vivo method to obtain accurate parameters is required in biomechanics studies and for some medical applications. In our previous works, we proposed the method to identify inertial parameters of human body segments in real-time during measurement of motion. However, some obtained parameters are not physically consistent; some masses are negative and inertia tensor matrices are not positive definite. These parameters generate problems in the analysis and the simulation requiring physical consistency. In this paper, we propose the real-time identification method considering physical consistency.
