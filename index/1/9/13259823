Iterative and incremental development seems to be a viable approach providing several benefits in interorganizational distributed software development. This paper presents initial results from an interview study on the usage of iterative and incremental development in interorganizational distributed software development projects. We describe identified practices, such as delivery synchronization, design and code reviews, communication emphasis, feature-based development, behavioral patterns, and frequent deliveries. We also present the benefits that the use of these practices brought, such as transparency of progress, increased developer motivation due to rapid feedback, flexibility regarding changes, the possibility to involve subcontractors early, ensuring joint understanding of requirements, and the avoidance of “big bang” integration. It seems that the advantages of using the practices overweigh the extra communication and coordination cost they incur.
