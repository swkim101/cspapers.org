Algorithm UCB1 for multi-armed bandit problem has already been extended to Algorithm UCT which works for minimax tree search. We have developed a Monte-Carlo program, MoGo, which is the ﬁrst computer Go program using UCT. We explain our modiﬁcations of UCT for Go application, among which efficient memory management, parametrization, ordering of non-visited nodes and parallelization. MoGo is now a top-level Computer-Go program on 9 x 9 Go board.
