In this paper we present an overview of the integration of a nonlinear arithmetic reasoning package into ACL2. We provide a brief operational description of the entire arithmetic package and describe how it fits into ACL2â€™s operation, including what was needed for the successful introduction of such a facility into an existing automated theorem prover. We describe most of the changes we made to the previous version of ACL2 as well as a couple of recent improvements to the nonlinear package we made based upon our experiences using the same. The resulting system lessens the human effort required to construct a large arithmetic proof by reducing the number of intermediate lemmas that must be proven.
