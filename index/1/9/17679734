We present our approach for pose verification with monocular cameras in 3-dimensional space based on the image-based control paradigm. We describe the extensions to our previous control system for mobile navigation that allow us to estimate the complete set of those parameters in space. The major contribution of this approach is a sensor-independent formulation that allows a flexible configuration with a variety of sensor systems including standard cameras, omnidirectional cameras and laser systems. Our second contribution is a way to re-initialize the tracked landmarks during a multi-segment navigation in applications with significant derivations from the pre-taught trajectory as it is the case for handheld systems and flying robots. The presented system can be used as a guidance system for visitors. The localization is based on known landmarks that are in our case natural landmarks in the environment. These landmarks correspond to the satellites of a GPS system. We call it V-GPS (vision-based GPS) because of this similarity in the concept. A camera carried by a person allows to navigate along pre-specified paths through environments, like galleries, hospitals, parks, and other public places.
