The possibility to provide an adequate task assistance using underactuated robots for human-robot tool comanipulation is investigated. This novel approach does not take into account any a priori knowledge about user depending parameters however optimizes the robot-user synergy, for instance during US breast examinations. Results show that the examination time can be reduced and a tendency for increasing scanning accuracy using underactuated robots.
