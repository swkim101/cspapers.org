The need to integrate several versions of a program into a common one arises frequently, but it is a tedious and time consuming task to integrate programs by hand. The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm, called <italic>integrate</italic>, that takes as input three programs <italic>A, B</italic>, and <italic>Base</italic>, where <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> are two variants of <italic>Base</italic>. Whenever the changes made to <italic>Base</italic> to create <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> do not “interfere” (in a sense defined in the paper), Integrate produces a program <italic>M</italic> that integrates <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>.
