The focus of this paper is the provision of computer-aided message services between users of computers in a multinetwork environment. An assembly of interconnected networks is called an internetwork. The task at hand is to provide an internetwork computer message service.
 It can be expected that a large number of message services will arise with some general aspects of equivalent functionality and some will have a few unusual, possibly unique, features. Certainly there will be many distinct user interface models for the human interaction with message systems.
 For these reasons the internetwork message system suggested here is based on the assumption of a standard for the internal machine-oriented representation of a message and the assumption that a variety of user interface programs will be available.
 The proposed system provides for the transmission of messages composed of a rigidly defined and structured set of command information fields and an arbitrarily defined and structured message content. Within the content may be transmitted text, facsimile, graphics, or voice data.
 This paper is based on a more detailed proposal for an internetwork message system [1].
