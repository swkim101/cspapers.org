With the increased complexity of integrated circuits, a true top-down methodology is mandatory in their design. A construct that enables a modular description of a system design is added to DDL. The Translator, Simulator and Synthesis Software has been modified to retain this modularity throughout the design cycle. These enhancements allow a multi-level simulation and multi-technology synthesis of an integrated circuit.
