With the rise of digital publishing and open access it has become increasingly important for publishers to store information about ownership and licensing of published works in a robust way. In a fast moving environment Elsevier, a leading science publisher, recognizes the importance of sound models underlying its data. In this paper, we describe a data model for copyright and licensing used by Elsevier for capturing elements of copyright. We explain some of the rationale behind the model and provide examples of frequently occurring cases in terms of the model.
