Holographic Recurrent Networks (HRNs) are recurrent networks which incorporate associative memory techniques for storing sequential structure. HRNs can be easily and quickly trained using gradient descent techniques to generate sequences of discrete outputs and trajectories through continuous space. The performance of HRNs is found to be superior to that of ordinary recurrent networks on these sequence generation tasks.
