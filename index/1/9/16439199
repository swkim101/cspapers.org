In this paper, we will discuss the use of RDF-based metadata to achieve the semantic integration of corporate information resources. This approach uses the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS) for the representation of all metadata characterizing the content of the information source as well as an interlinqua for standardizing all communications between system components. We will discuss the integration architecture and describe the metadata structures used. We will also describe how metadata facilitates information browsing and a practical approach to query optimization.
