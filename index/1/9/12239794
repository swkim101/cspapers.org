In this paper, we present an approach for the structuring and exploitation of organizational memories. We propose a system to build organizational memories (OMBS) with multiple dimensions, each dimension being defined for a different exploitation mode. An advantage of this OMBS approach resides in the incremental construction of domain knowledge networks including numerous knowledge units and links. We begin by discussing some ideas related to the structuring of an organizational memory (OM) using flight safety as an application domain. Then we describe the purpose, the formalism and the structuring of the knowledge networks. We also propose some directions to exploit the OMBS system along its various dimensions.
