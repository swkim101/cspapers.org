In Statistics-Based Summarization - Step One: Sentence Compression, Knight and Marcu (Knight and Marcu, 2000) (KM Knight and Marcu use a corpus of 1035 training sentences. More data is not easily available, so in addition to improving the original K&M noisy-channel model, we create unsupervised and semi-supervised models of the task. Finally, we point out problems with modeling the task in this way. They suggest areas for future research.
