This paper presents a framework to use collision avoidance methods in the majority of existing mobile robots (that have any shape, kinematic and dynamic constraints). The solution proposed is a vehicle abstraction layer based on transforming the space where these methods work, onto another one in which the constraints are implicitly represented. This space incorporates the vehicle kinematics and dynamics in such a way that when the reactive navigation methods are used, the motions computed comply with the motion constraints. We validate the utility of this framework by applying a classic reactive method in a real vehicle with motion constraints (whereas the original method does not address the kinematics and dynamics).
