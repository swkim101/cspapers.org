Mining frequent structural patterns from graph databases is an important research problem with broad applications. Recently, we developed an effective index structure, ADI, and efficient algorithms for mining frequent patterns from large, disk-based graph databases [5], as well as constraint-based mining techniques. The techniques have been integrated into a research prototype system--- GraphMiner. In this paper, we describe a demo of GraphMiner which showcases the technical details of the index structure and the mining algorithms including their efficient implementation, the mining performance and the comparison with some state-of-the-art methods, the constraint-based graph-pattern mining techniques and the procedure of constrained graph mining, as well as mining real data sets in novel applications.
