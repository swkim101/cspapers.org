Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is an alternative architecture for computer networks, where the communication is focused on the data being transferred instead of the communicating hosts. This paper describes a demo of an experience sharing application for mobile phones built on an ICN platform designed for devices with intermittent connectivity. In particular, we detail how this application will be showcased in an indoor exhibition where experience is shared with media content that is geo-tagged using Bluetooth beacons and spread opportunistically to other users.
