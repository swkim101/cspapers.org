OntoNotes is a five year multi-site collaboration between BBN Technologies, Information Sciences Institute of University of Southern California, University of Colorado, University of Pennsylvania and Brandeis University. The goal of the OntoNotes project is to provide linguistic data annotated with a skeletal representation of the literal meaning of sentences including syntactic parse, predicate-argument structure, coreference, and word senses linked to an ontology, allowing a new generation of language understanding technologies to be developed with new functional capabilities.
