The goal of a recommender system is to suggest items of interest to a user based on historical behavior of a community of users. Given detailed enough history, item-based collaborative filtering (CF) often performs as well or better than almost any other recommendation method. However, in cold-start situations - where a user, an item, or the entire system is new - simple non-personalized recommendations often fare better. We improve the scalability and performance of a previous approach to handling cold-start situations that uses filterbots, or surrogate users that rate items based only on user or item attributes. We show that introducing a very small number of simple filterbots helps make CF algorithms more robust. In particular, adding just seven global filterbots improves both user-based and item-based CF in cold-start user, cold-start item, and cold-start system settings. Performance is better when data is scarce, performance is no worse when data is plentiful, and algorithm efficiency is negligibly affected. We systematically compare a non-personalized baseline, user-based CF, item-based CF, and our bot-augmented user- and item-based CF algorithms using three data sets (Yahoo! Movies, MovieLens, and EachMovie) with the normalized MAE metric in three types of cold-start situations. The advantage of our "na√Øve filterbot" approach is most pronounced for the Yahoo! data, the sparsest of the three data sets.
