Actuator arrays are planar arrangements of two degree-of-freedom actuators that cooperatively translate and orient objects for efficient manipulation. This paper derives the equations of motion for an object with the friction interface switching between slip and no-slip contact at each actuator. A controller derived from kinematics is presented and its stability analyzed with the multivariable circle criterion. Stability results are verified through simulation.
