This paper presents a new type of magnetic fluid and the rotational drive with simple magnetic field. We have proposed a driving principle and developed the verification models and the generator of magnetic field. It became clear that our proposed driving principle results from collision of the magnetic particles to the outer cover, deformation of the whole form of magnetic particles and movement of the center of gravity. We have succeeded to drive a rolling model by simple magnetic field control.
