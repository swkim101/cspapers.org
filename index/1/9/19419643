We present an approach for estimating the absolute poses of a swarm Micro Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (Î¼AUVs) by decomposing the problem into few absolute position estimations and many relative pose estimations. As power constraints are critical to small mobile robots, we develop an extension of active marker pose estimation using color information to solve the marker correspondence problem, and show that this approach is more energy efficient than reflective estimation approaches. We show the feasibility of this approach by localizing a robot navigating in an underwater test tank environment. Detailed analysis is presented characterizing the noise and error properties when estimating robot poses from fixed on-board markers. Moreover, we provide comparisons in power and computational cost for other popular methods of underwater localization.
