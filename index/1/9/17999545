Associative networks are a connectionist language model with the ability to categorize large sets of documents. In this research we combine monolingual associative networks based on Wikipedia to create a larger, multilingual associative network, using the cross-lingual connections between Wikipedia articles. We prove that such multilingual associative networks perform better than monolingual associative networks in tasks related to document categorization by comparing the results of both types of associative network on a multilingual dataset.
