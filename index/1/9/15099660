This paper demonstrates a system for the automatic extraction of novelty in images captured from a small video camera attached to a subject's chest, replicating his visual perspective, while performing activities which are repeated daily. Novelty is detected when a (sub)sequence cannot be registered to previously stored sequences captured while performing the same daily activity. Sequence registration is performed by measuring appearance and geometric similarity of individual frames and exploiting the invariant temporal order of the activity. Experimental results demonstrate that this is a robust way to detect novelties induced by variations in the wearer's ego-motion such as stopping and talking to a person. This is an essentially new and generic way of automatically extracting information of interest to the camera wearer and can be used as input to a system for life logging or memory support.
