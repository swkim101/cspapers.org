Using the concepts of stimulus and response frames of scheduled Knowledge source instantiations, competition among alternative responses, goals, and the desirability of a knowledge source instantiation, a general attentional control mechanism is developed. This general focusing mechanism facilitates the experimental evaluation of a variety of specific attentional control policies (such as best-first, bottom-up, and top-down search strategies) and allows the modular addition of specialized heuristics for the speech understanding task. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the focusing principles, and possible directions for future research are considered.
