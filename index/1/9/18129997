We introduce a copula mixture model to perform dependency-seeking clustering when cooccurring samples from different data sources are available. The model takes advantage of the great flexibility offered by the copulas framework to extend mixtures of Canonical Correlation Analysis to multivariate data with arbitrary continuous marginal densities. We formulate our model as a non-parametric Bayesian mixture, while providing efficient MCMC inference. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the increased flexibility of the copula mixture significantly improves the clustering and the interpretability of the results.
