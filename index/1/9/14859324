In this paper we present a novel approach to multichannel blind separation/generalized deconvolution, assuming that both mixing and demixing models are described by stable linear state-space systems. We decompose the blind separation problem into two process: separation and state estimation. Based on the minimization of Kullback-Leibler Divergence, we develop a novel learning algorithm to train the matrices in the output equation. To estimate the state of the demixing model, we introduce a new concept, called hidden innovation, to numerically implement the Kalman filter. Computer simulations are given to show the validity and high effectiveness of the state-space approach.
