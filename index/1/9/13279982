The use of annotated listings of compiler-generated code has the potential to make teaching more effective in several different courses. We consider the production of such listings for several popular compilers and computer systems, including Turbo Pascal on MS-DOS machines and Pascal on Ultrix and VMS systems. The usefulness of these listings in assembly language, computer organization/architecture, and compiler courses, as well as introductory courses, is also considered.
