Recent years, the availability of public accessible structured resources like XML on the web has led to active developments of structural retrieval systems. With these systems, users will be able to query for information from structured resources on the web efficiently. When querying, it is obvious that usage of structural information in query increases the precision of retrieval system. However, general web users are more familiar with unstructured query such as natural language or keywords, which contains no structural information. Therefore, a retrieval method that can handle matching between a simpler form of query (e.g. natural language, keywords, or less rigid syntax), and structured resources is required.
