A variety of tools have been developed to bring about the realization of pervasive context-aware systems. However, there are still many challenges faced by such applications when trying to determine the context of who, what, when, where, why and how activities are being performed. One such challenge is obtaining the necessary data to train such context-aware systems. In this paper we present a real-time annotation tool which has been developed to streamline the process of collecting and annotating data in an experimental setting. By decreasing the amount of time needed to collect and annotate data, we can increase the rate at which applications can be developed and trained to recognize the current context and react accordingly. These applications can then deliver relevant information in a timely manner supporting a broad range of tasks.
