Interest in sensemaking has recently gained prominence in human-computer interaction research. Efforts are being made to better understand sensemaking to help inform the design of appropriate computer-based tools. In this position paper we address the problem of design by presenting a propositional classification of sensemaking situations from a representational perspective. When people engage in sensemaking they organize information into structures which they use as a basis for guiding interpretation and the search for further data. It is these structures that we look at in terms of representations and classify them accordingly. This position paper argues that such a classification can be used as a starting point which would inform the design of sensemaking support tools. Author Keywords
