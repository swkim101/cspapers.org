Adaptive Random Testing (ART) denotes a family of testing algorithms that have a better performance compared to pure random testing with respect to the number of test cases necessary to detect the first failure. Many of these algorithms, however, are not very efficient regarding runtime. A new ART algorithm is presented that has a better performance than all other ART methods for the block failure pattern. Its runtime is linear in the number of test cases selected, which is nearly as efficient as pure random testing, as opposed to most other ART methods. This new ART algorithm selects the test cases based on a lattice.
