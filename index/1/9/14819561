The growth of the World-Wide Web has created a new kind of data management problem: building and maintaining Web sites. Building a Web site involves several tasks, such as choosing what information will be available at the site, organizing that information in individual pages or in graphs of linked pages, and specifying the visual presentation of pages in HTML. Creating and managing large sites is tedious, because a user often must perform these tasks simultaneously when creating HTML pages. The task of building and managing Web sites presents a unique opportunity for applying concepts from database management systems, such as the separation between the logical view of information and its storage and maintenance and the ability to restructure information via queries. Furthermore, recent research results on information integration [Ill1971 and managing semi-structured data [ACM97, Abi97] can play a key role in managing Web sites. The goal of STRUDEL project is to extend and adapt these concepts to the problem of Web-site management. Consider several tasks required of a Web-site manager. Site managers often want to manage a single repository of site data, but present different browsable “views” of the site based on criteria such as the type of user accessing the site, e.g., external or internal, expert or novice. Morever, a manager might want to modify the data repository by editing simple text files or by updating external databases, to reorganize the structure of the pages by manipulating graphs that represent the linked pages, or to design multiple presentations of a single page by editing HTML files or by using a WYSIWYG HTML generator. Currently, such operations on Web sites involve significant effort. The key idea in the STRUDEL system is the separation of the logical view of information available at a Web site, the structure of that information in linked pages, and
