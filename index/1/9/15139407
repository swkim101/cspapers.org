In this paper, we propose the concept of using query execution feedback for improving database buffer man- agement. A query feedback model which adaptively quantifies the page fault characteristics of all query ac- cess patterns including sequential, looping and most im- portantly random, is defined. Based on this model, a load control and a marginal gain ratio buffer allocation scheme are developed. Simulatidn experiments show that the proposed method is consistently better than the previous methods and in most cases, it significantly outperforms all other methods for random access refer- ence patterns.
