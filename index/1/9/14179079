Runtime monitoring of aging effects in pipeline circuits is the key to dynamic reliability management techniques which can maximize the performance and energy-efficiency under a reliability envelope without imposing worst-case margin. The existing monitoring techniques are, however, severely limited: for sensor-based techniques, monitoring accuracy is significantly compromised due to the mismatches in aging conditions between sensors and the target circuits, as well as random variation of aging effects; for in-situ techniques, measurement results are sensitive to environmental variations during test phases, also severely reducing monitoring accuracy. We propose a new technique that enables accurate in-situ aging monitoring even under large environmental variations by (i) scaling the supply voltage for temperature-insensitive delay and (ii) reconfiguring target paths into ring oscillators, whose oscillation periods are measured and compared to pre-aging measurement to estimate aging-induced delay degradations. With additional accuracy-improving strategies, the technique achieves highly-accurate monitoring with an error of 15.5% across the temperature variations in self-test phases from 0°C to 80°C, exhibiting >30× improvement in accuracy as compared to the conventional technique operating at nominal supply voltage.
