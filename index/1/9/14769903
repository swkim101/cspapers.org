We present a deterministic algorithm <i>A</i> that, in <i>O</i>(<i>m</i><sup>2</sup>) time, verifies whether a given <i>m</i> by <i>m</i> bipartite graph <i>G</i> is <i>regular,</i> in the sense of Szemerédi [18]. In the case in which <i>G</i> is <i>not</i> regular enough, our algorithm outputs a <i>witness</i> to this irregularity. Algorithm <i>A</i> may be used as a subroutine in an algorithm that finds an ε-regular partition of a given <i>n</i>-vertex graph Γ in time <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>). This time complexity is optimal, up to a constant factor, and improves upon the bound <i>O</i>(<i>M</i>(<i>n</i>)), proved by Alon, Duke, Lefmann, Rödl, and Yuster [1, 2], where <i>M</i>(<i>n</i>) = <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2.376</sup>) is the time required to square a 0-1 matrix over the integers.Our approach is elementary, except that it makes use of linear-sized expanders to accomplish a suitable form of deterministic sampling.
