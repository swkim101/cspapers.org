INTRODUCTION A strategy is mapped out to successfully integrate both traditional and object-oriented approaches to software development in CS 1, CS2 and Software Engineering. This paper describes the authorsâ€™ experiences during the transition from Pascal to Ada as the introductory programming language in CSE200-220, Fundamentals of Computer Science I-II, and the restructuring of CSE422, Introduction to Software Engineering, to focus on object-oriented design with Ada 95. Similar CS 1 and CS2 experiences at other institutions are described in [3]. CSE200-220 serve as the introductory CS 1-CS2 sequence and CSE422 is the required software engineering course for the Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CPE) curricula in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department. These are also popular electives for non-majors, primarily mathematics, business, and other engineering disciplines. CSE200 provides a general introduction to structured programming, and CSE220 is a continuation which includes traditional data structure topics. CSE422 introduces the broad field of software engineering and then focuses on object-oriented design. CSE200, 220, and 422 are each a single quarter in duration and CSE200 and 220 each carry four credit hours 3 hours of lecture (28 meetings per quarter) and a 3-hour weekly supervised lab (9 weeks). CSE422 is three credit hours -2 hours of lecture (19 meetings per quarter) and a 3-hour weekly supervised lab (9 weeks). Enrollment is approximately 45 students per quarter in CSE200, 35 per quarter in CSE220, and 35 per quarter in CSE422. CSE200-220 are offered every quarter of the academic year, and frequently also in the summer. CSE422 is currently
