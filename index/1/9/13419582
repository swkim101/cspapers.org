Click fraud is jeopardizing the industry of Internet advertising. Internet advertising is crucial for the thriving of the entire Internet, since it allows producers to advertise their products, and hence contributes to the well being of e-commerce. Moreover, advertising supports the intellectual value of the Internet by covering the running expenses of publishing content. Some content publishers are dishonest, and use automation to generate traffic to defraud the advertisers. Similarly, some advertisers automate clicks on the advertisements of their competitors to deplete their competitors' advertising budgets. This paper describes the advertising network model, and focuses on the most sophisticated type of fraud, which involves coalitions among fraudsters. We build on several published theoretical results to devise the Similarity-Seeker algorithm that discovers coalitions made by pairs of fraudsters. We then generalize the solution to coalitions of arbitrary sizes. Before deploying our system on a real network, we conducted comprehensive experiments on data samples for proof of concept. The results were very accurate. We detected several coalitions, formed using various techniques, and spanning numerous sites. This reveals the generality of our model and approach.
