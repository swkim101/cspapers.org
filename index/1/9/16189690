We present the adaptation of an optimal terrain coverage algorithm for the aerial robotics domain. The general strategy involves computing a trajectory through a known environment with obstacles that ensures complete coverage of the terrain while minimizing path repetition. We introduce a system that applies and extends this generic algorithm to achieve automated terrain coverage using an aerial vehicle. Extensive experimental results in simulation validate the presented system, along with data from over 100 kilometers of successful coverage flights using a fixed-wing aircraft.
