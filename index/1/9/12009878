Based on the integrated design concept of using the robot's mechanical arm for both locomotion and manipulation, we proposed a compact and transformable robot, i.e. the WALS-Robot, which utilizes combination and switch among four components: wheels, arms, legs and suckers. The WALS-Robot could transform among five locomotion modes to fulfill locomotion requirements in indoor unstructured environments, and have dexterous manipulation, and low power consumption. To reduce the redundancy of mechanical structure and the moving payload for the robot, the mobile platform and the mechanical arm could work as a unity, i.e. the mechanical arm can switch into a leg of the robot to reduce payload during moving modes. Experimental results validated key performance of the robot, including locomotion accuracy and efficiency, compact volume and low power consumption. The integrated design concept illustrated the adaptability in diverse unstructured indoor environments, enlarging the manipulation workspace, and enhancing the energy efficiency.
