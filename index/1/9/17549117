This study analyzed the performance and energy consumption of multicore applications, using three techniques to manage concurrent execution in a set of benchmarks. We conclude that these constructs can heavily impact on energy consumption. Nonetheless, the trade-off between performance and energy consumption in multicore applications is not so obvious.
