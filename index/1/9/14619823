In this paper a parallel algorithm for Lagrange interpolation is applied on a n-pancake graph. The n- pancake graph is a Cayley graph with N=n! vertices and with attractive properties regarding degree, diameter, symmetry, embeddings and self similarity. Using these properties the algorithm carries the calculation in O(N) steps of communication and arithmetic operations instead of O(N2) steps for a single processor system.
