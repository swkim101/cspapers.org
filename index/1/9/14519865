An interpreter for logic programs is defined which executes some goals in parallel. OR parallelism exploits the parallelism defined from nondeterministic choices, and is essentially a replacement for backtracking. AND parallelism comes from solving goals in the body of a single clause in parallel, and is the only way to exploit parallelism in deterministic functions written as logic programs. A unique feature of our model is that it allows both forms of parallelism for the same computation.
