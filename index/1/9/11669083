We analyse epistemic boolean games in a computationally grounded dynamic epistemic logic. The agents' knowledge is determined by what they see, including higher-order visibility: agents may observe whether another agent observes an atom or not. The agents' actions consist in modifying the truth values of atoms. We provide an axiomatisation of the logic, establish that the model checking problem is in PSPACE, and show how one can reason about equilibria in epistemic boolean games.
