In this paper we incorporate a randomized kinodynamic path planning approach with image-based control for a robotic arm equipped with an in-hand camera in a servoing task. The proposed approach yields C2-smooth camera trajectories by taking camera dynamics into account while accounting for a critical set of image and physical constraints. The proposed planner explores the camera state space (i.e., a space of camera poses and velocities) for permissible trajectories by iteratively extending a search tree in this space and simultaneously tracking these trajectories in the robot configuration space (i.e., joint space). The planned camera trajectories are then projected into the image space to obtain desired feature trajectories. In the execution stage an image-based visual servoing scheme is then adopted to track the feature trajectories. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been experimentally demonstrated on a robotic arm with an in-hand camera executing servoing tasks in complex environments.
