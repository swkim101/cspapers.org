We also situate the work in the broader context of contemporary AI. Our second point is that the work in this area might well be done as a broad collaborative project. Hence our "Blue Sky'' contribution is a proposal to organize a polymath-style effort aimed at developing formal tools for the study of state of the art question-answer systems, and other large scale NLP efforts whose architectures and algorithms lack a theoretical foundation.
