In this paper we use KUKA's Fast Robot Interface (FRI) to design and implement a tracking controller on the Lightweight Robot (LBR) IIWA. We seek low latency, accurate and smooth tracking of the link positions to facilitate human interaction tasks. Focusing on a single joint and its low-level series elastic dynamics, we identify the internal torque control structure and its characteristics. Tracking controllers of varying complexity are tested in an optical motion capture system to provide an independent external reference measurement. Using full state feedback of both motor position and sensed joint torque, we achieve smooth and good tracking of the unsensed link positions.
