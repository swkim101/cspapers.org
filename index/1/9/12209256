In this paper, the development and the experimental testing phases of an innovative assistive device for hand disabilities are presented. This robotic device is based on an parallel kinematic chain applied to a single phalanx architecture and it is designed to be extremely portable to easily assist people with physical disabilities in their everyday lives. Focusing on patients with hand opening disabilities, the authors have developed a model-based methodology which starting from the motion capture of the patient fingertip trajectories is able to define the mechanism that better fits with such trajectories. The authors have validated the proposed innovative mechanism by developing a portable Hand Exoskeleton System (HES) prototype and performing a suitable preliminary testing campaign. The testing phase of the real prototype on a group of patients is currently ongoing.
