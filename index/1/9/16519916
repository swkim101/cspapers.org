One powerful cue for breaking down the entire household's energy consumption is user's daily energy usage behavior, which has so far received little attention: existing works on energy disaggregation mostly ignored the relationship between the energy usages of various appliances across different time slots. To model such relationship, we combine topic models with Hawkes processes, and propose a novel probabilistic model based on marked Hawkes process that enables the modeling of marked event data. The proposed model seeks to capture the influence from the occurrence and the marks of one usage event to the occurrence and the marks of subsequent usage events in the future. We also develop an inference algorithm based on variational inference for model parameter estimation. Experimental results on both synthetic data and three real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in decomposing the entire consumed energy to each appliance. Analyzing the influence captured by the proposed model provides further insights into numerous interesting energy usage behavior patterns.
