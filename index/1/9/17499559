This paper presents a model for the description of communication protocol in view of the total behavior of terminal equipment. In this model, a protocol entity is modeled as a group of processes and monitors, and synchronization between input and output processes is represented by the synchronizing mechanism based on the concept of the monitor. Furthermore, it is possible to specify the relation between entities of different layers of the protocol, including the relation between communication and local functions of terminal equipment. As an example of protocol description based on this model, TELETEX document layer protocol written in concurrent PASCAL language is illustrated.
