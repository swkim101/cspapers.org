This paper presents a novel image space path planning method that takes mechanical constraints into consideration. The aim is to synthesize sub-goal images that can be used as reference inputs for image-based visual servoing systems. Synthesized images are constructed based on screw decompositions represented in a projective space. The projective representation allows image synthesis for three-dimensional objects to be made without any metric information or calibration processes. In the heart of the method, an orientation-generating operator is defined in the projective space to generate an image for an arbitrarily orientated object. The proposed scheme not only ensures field of view conditions by planning a straight path, but also provides physically realizable images of a properly oriented gripper to avoid mechanical constraints such as joint limits. Computer simulations are conducted to show the feasibility of the proposed scheme.
