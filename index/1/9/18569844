In this paper, we empirically demonstrate what we call the domain restriction hypothesis, claiming that semantically related terms extracted from a corpus tend to be semantically coherent. We apply this hypothesis to define a post-processing module for the output of Espresso, a state of the art relation extraction system, showing that irrelevant and erroneous relations can be filtered out by our module, increasing the precision of the final output. Results are confirmed by both quantitative and qualitative analyses, showing that very high precision can be reached.
