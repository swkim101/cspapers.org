AnyType is a creative application that lets people transform elements and objects in the physical world into novel digital typefaces. The portability, computational power and network capabilities of AnyType allow the user to take design into the wild so that they can create and share in the same moment in which they are inspired. With AnyType, we invite people to reinterpret their everyday environment and transform it into a set of possible creative inputs.
