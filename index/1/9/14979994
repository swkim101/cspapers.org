Shared-cache memory organizations for parallel-pipelined multiple instruction stream processors avoid the cache coherence problem of private caches by sharing single copies of common blocks. A shared cache may have a higher hit ratio, but suffers performance degradation due to access conflicts.
 Effective shared cache organizations are proposed which retain the cache coherency advantage and which have very low access conflict even with very high request rates. Analytic expressions for performance based on a Markov model have been found for several important cases. Performance of shared cache organizations and design tradeoffs are discussed.
