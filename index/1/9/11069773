Cyclically-coupled quasi-cyclic LDPC (CC-QC-LDPC) block codes have been shown to achieve outstanding bit error performance with extremely low error floor. In this paper, we propose two new types of CC-QC-LDPC block codes which can achieve a larger girth. We present the error performance of the CC-QC-LDPC codes constructed by the new mechanism. We show that with similar codelengths, the new codes outperform the original CC-QC-LDPC codes by 0 3 to 0 35 dB at a bit error rate of 10-12.
