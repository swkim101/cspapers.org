This paper describes an educational version of the SAC-1 list processing system. Educational systems such as WATFIV, WATBÃ˜L, and PL/C are available for teaching programming languages. However, the authors could find no comparable systems for list processing. Since such facilities would be useful in many courses (e.g., data structures, operating systems, symbol manipulation), EDUSAC was developed.
