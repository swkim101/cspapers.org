Many existing data mining techniques often p roduce a large number of rules, which make it very difficult for manual inspection o f the rules to identify those interesting ones. This problem represents a major gap between the results of data mining and the understanding and use of the mining results. In this paper, we a rgue that t he key problem is not with the large number of rules because if there are indeed many rules that exist in data, they should b e discovered. The main p roblem is with ou r inability to organize, summarize and present the rules in such a way that they can b e ea sily analyzed b y the user. In this paper, we propose a technique to intuitively organize a nd summarize the discovered rules. With this organization, the discovered rules can b e presented to the user in the way as we think and talk about knowledge in ou r daily lives. This organization also allows the user to view the discovered rules at different levels of details, and to focus his/her attention on those interesting aspects. This paper presents this technique a nd u ses it t o o rganize, summarize a nd present t he knowledge e mbedded in a decision tree, and a set of association rules. Experiment results and p ractical applications show that the technique is both intuitive and effective.
