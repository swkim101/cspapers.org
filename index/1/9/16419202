In this paper, we present a novel dimensionality reduction algorithm called multilinear maximum distance embedding (M2DE), which includes three key components. To preserve the local geometry and discriminant information in the embedded space, M2DE utilizes a new objective function, which aims to maximize the distances between some particular pairs of data points, such as the distances between nearby points and the distances between data points from different classes. To make the mapping of new data points straightforward, and more importantly, to keep the natural tensor structure of high-order data, M2DE integrates multilinear techniques to learn the transformation matrices sequentially. To provide reasonable and stable embedding results, M2DE employs the L1-norm, which is more robust to outliers, to measure the dissimilarity between data points. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that M2DE achieves good embedding results of high-order data for classification tasks.
