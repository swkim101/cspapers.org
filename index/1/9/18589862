We present the first general framework for proving lower bounds for randomized online algorithms using the von Neumann/Yao principle. This framework encompasses and explains many existent lower bound results, and allows us to prove several new ones. The foremost of the new results is a lower bound of 1.58197 for the online TCP acknowledgment problem of Dooly, Goldman and Scott [11]. Other new results include: a lower bound of 1.34880 for randomized online two-machine flow shop scheduling, a lower bound of 1.15775 for randomized online total completion time scheduling on parallel machines and a lower bound of 1.06532 for scheduling with machine cost. Out method provides a sort of 'Master theorem' for proving randomized lower bounds.
