However, these works either do not generate consistent results when the constituent patches contain large domain variations (i.e., from face and sketch domains) or cannot generate high-resolution images with limited facial patches (e.g., the inpainting approach tends to blur the generated region when the missing area is more than 50%). Motivated by the mental imagery and simulation in human cognition, we exploit the potential of deep learning networks in filling large missing region (e.g., as high as 95% missing) and generating realistic faces with high fidelity in cross domains.We propose the recursive generation by bidirectional transformation networks (r-BTN) that recursively generates a whole face/sketch from a small sketch/face patch. The large missing area and domain variations make it difficult to generate satisfactory results using a unidirectional cross-domain learning structure. We explore that the bidirectional transformation network can lead to the consistent result by minimizing the forward and backward errors in the cross-domain scenario. On the other hand, a forward and backward bidirectional learning between the face and sketch domains would enable recursive estimation of the missing region in an incremental manner to yield appealing results. r-BTN also adopts an adversarial constraint to encourage the generation of realistic faces/sketches. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superior performance from r-BTN as compared to existing potential solutions.
