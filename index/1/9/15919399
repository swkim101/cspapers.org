We present the first efficient universal oblivious sampler that uses an optimal number of random bits, up to an arbitrary constant factor bigger than 1. Specifically, for any a >0 and c(m) ~ exp(–cr210K* ‘m), our sampler can use (1 + a) (m + log 7-1 ) random bits to output d = poly(c-l, log-y-l, m) sample points Z1, ..., z~ C {O, I}m such that for any function ~ : {O, l}m ~ [0, 1], Our proof is based on an improved extractor construction. An extractor is a procedure which takes as input the output of a defective random source and a small number of truly random bits, and outputs a nearly-random string. We present the first optimal extractor, up to constant factors, for defective random sources with constant entropy rate. We give two applications of these tools. First, we exhibit a constructive O(log n) round protocol for leader election in the full information model that is resilient against any coalition of size /3n for any constant ~ < 1/2. Each player sends only log n bits per round. Second, given a 2g (n) round AM proof for L in which Arthur sends l(n) random bits per round and Merlin responds with a q(n) bit string, we construct a g(n) round AM proof for a language L in which Arthur sends O(l(n) + q(n)) random bits per round and Merlin’s response remains of polynomial length. “ Dept. of Computer sciences, The University af T.sxaa at Austin, Austin, TX 7S712, diz@cs.utexas.edu.
