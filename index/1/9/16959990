Wireless Fair Service Algorithm For Packet Cellular Networks Sonwu Lu Thyagarajan Nandagopal Vaduvur Bharghavan Coordinated Science Laboratory University of Illinois email: {sIu, thyagu, bharghav}~timely. crhc .uiuc. edu b order to support diverse communication-intensive redtirne and non red-time data flows over a scarce, varying and shared wireless channel with location-dependent and bursty errors, we defie a service model that has the following charxteristi~ short-tern fairness among flows which perceive a clean channel, worst-case delay bounds for packets, short-term throughput bounds for flows with clean channels and Iong-tem throughput bounds for dl flows with bounded channel error, optimal schedulable region, and support for both delay sensitive and error sensitive data flows. We present a wireless fair service algorithm, and show that it achieves the requirements of the service model through both analysis and simulation. The key aspects of the dg~ rithm are the following (a) an enhanced fair queueing based service scheme that supports decoupling of delay and bandwidth, (b) graceful service compensation for lagging flows and graceful service degradation for leading flows, (c) support for red-time delay sensitive flows as well as non realtime error sensitive flows, and (d) implementation of the wireless fair service rdgorithm within the fiarnework of the simple and robust CSMA/CA wireless medium access pro tocol.
