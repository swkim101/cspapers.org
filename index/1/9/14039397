Large software development teams require welldefined development processes. The problems encountered by large teams are compounded exponentially when an organization consists of many such large teams simultaueously codeveloping new software functionality. At USF&G, we have developed a model that enables our project development teams to implement diverse projects within a single deployment environment. Despite corresponding complexity introduced during project integration, our model has enabled us to successfully advance the functionality of our system in a development cycle of extremely short duration. This paper discusses the implementation of the model for concurrent project development in a Smalltalk application known as Foundation.
