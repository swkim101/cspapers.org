Keyword search in XML has gained popularity as it enables users to easily access XML data without the need of learning query languages and studying complex data schemas. In XML keyword search, query semantics is based on the concept of Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA), e.g., SLCA and ELCA. However, LCA-based search methods depend heavily on hierarchical structures of XML data, which may result in meaningless answers. To obtain desired answers, a successful system should be able to (i) match a semantic entity for each keyword, (ii) discover the relationships of the matched entities, (iii) support efficient query processing, (iv) release users from having the knowledge of the XML content, and (v) visualize the search results. None of the existing XML keyword search systems completely meet the above requirements. In this paper, we design a system called SpiderXto completely solves the above challenges. We propose a query semantics Entity-Relationship Graph (ERG), which adopts the RDF subject-predicate-object semantics to capture the information of search entities along with associated attributes and the relationships between entities. SpiderX proposes a novel index structure, which has small space cost by combining the optimizations of column databases and the data compression schemes. In addition, SpiderX processes queries in a bottom-up way to achieve high performance, which is about 100X faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms. To demonstrate the high performance of SpiderX, we implement an online demo for SpiderX, which operating on three real-life datasets. The demo also provides (1) query auto-completion to guide users to formulate queries; and (2) visualization panel to display the query answers, which interacts with users by providing zoom-in and zoom-out exploration features.
