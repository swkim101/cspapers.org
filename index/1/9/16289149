Locomotion on the rough and variable ground surfaces is crucial for robots to complete various tasks. Recent advancement in numerical computation allow such locomotive robots to manipulate in real environments using a model-based control framework. This approach is successful if the precise model it is obtained. However, it is not always feasible to use the precise model because there are various factors related to both the robot and its surroundings. In this paper, we report the locomotion experiments with 2 types of legged robot that can change its behavior by switching connection patterns among hydraulic cylinders mounted on the robot's legs. An actuator network system (ANS) is used to switch mutual interconnection of cylinders. The switching connection allows the robots to realize not only adaptive locomotion to the environment but also operation of the traveling direction.
