This paper discusses the introduction of explicit metaclasses รก la ObjVlisp into the Smalltalk-80 language. The rigidity of Smalltalk metaclass architecture motivated this work. We decided to implement the ObjVlisp model into the standard Smalltalk-80 system. The resulting combination defines the Classtalk platform. This platform provides a full-size environment to experiment with class-oriented programming by combining implicit metaclasses รก la Smalltalk and explicit metaclasses รก la ObjVlisp. Obviously, these experiments are not limited to the Smalltalk world and will be useful to understand and practice the metaclass concept advocated by modern object-oriented languages such as ObjVlisp and CLOS.
