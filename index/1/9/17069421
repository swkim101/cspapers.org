Operating systems can be taught using DOS as the basis for an introductory course. This approach is both practical and pedagogically sound. It leads to a course which is valuable both as a terminal course on operating systems and as the basis for further theoretical study. It is possible to use DOS as an environment for teaching rudiments of multitasking.
