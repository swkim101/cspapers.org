In our previous work we have developed a logic-based approach for the refinement of ontology-based queries that enables a user to search through a repository in a step-by-step fashion. Since the set of refinements in a step can be large, they should be ranked according to their relevance for fulfilling a user's need. In this paper we present such a ranking model, which takes into account the information content (informativeness) of a refinement as well as the preferences of the user.
