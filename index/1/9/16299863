In this paper, mimetic communication is extended to human-robot interaction tasks, in which physical contact transitions must be handled. The mimetic communication consists of imitation learning for learning low level motion primitives and a higher level interaction learning stage in which also the information about the human-robot contacts is included. For the imitation learning, Cartesian marker data from a motion capture system is used. A modification of the low level marker trajectory following algorithm is presented, which allows to reshape the trajectory of the motion primitive in accordance with the human hand motion in real-time. Moreover, for performing safe contact motion, an appropriate impedance controller is integrated into the setting. All the presented concepts are evaluated in experiments with a humanoid robot.
