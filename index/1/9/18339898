Interoperability requires the resolution of syntactic and semantic variations among system data models. To address this problem, we developed the Intelligent Mapping Toolkit (IMT), which employs a distributed multi-agent architecture to enable the mixed-initiative mapping of metadata and instances. This architecture includes a novel federation of service-encapsulated matching agents that leverage case-based reasoning methods. We recently used the IMT matching service to develop several domain-specific search applications in addition to the IMT mapping application.
