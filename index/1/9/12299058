The knowledge of a short substring constitutes a good basis for guessing the next character in a natural language text. This observation, i.e. repeated guessing and encoding of subsequent characters, is very fundamental for the predictive text compression. The paper describes a family of such compression methods, using a hash table for searching the prediction information. The experiments show that the methods produce good compression gains and, moreover, are very fast. The one-pass versions are especially apt for “on-the-fly” compression of transmitted data, and could be a basis for specialized hardware.
