In this paper, we develop an RST-style text-level discourse parser, based on the HILDA discourse parser (Hernault et al., 2010b). We significantly improve its tree-building step by incorporating our own rich linguistic features. We also analyze the difficulty of extending traditional sentence-level discourse parsing to text-level parsing by comparing discourse-parsing performance under different discourse conditions.
