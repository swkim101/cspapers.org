We prove a hierarchy theorem for the representation of monotone Boolean functions by monotone formulae with restricted depth. Specifically, we show that there are functions with π<subscrpt>k</subscrpt>-formula of size n for which every &sgr;<subscrpt>k</subscrpt>-formula has size exp ω(n<supscrpt>1/(k−1)</supscrpt>). A similar lower bound applies to concrete functions such as transitive closure and clique. We also show that any function with a formula of size n (and any depth) has a &sgr;<subscrpt>k</subscrpt>-formula of size exp o(n<supscrpt>1/(k−1)</supscrpt>). Thus our hierarchy theorem is the best possible.
