CS1 and CS2 have been revised and currently ACM is exploring the revision of the CS core. General dissatisfaction has been broadly voiced with Curriculum '78 as not being sufficiently mathematical and theoretical. In the same vein the accreditation criteria have been attacked as being too technical and vocational. A strong voice has been raised for a liberal arts view of computer science. Recent texts are incorporating a higher level of abstraction into the freshman year as well as trying to cater to a demand for a survey of the discipline. Does this portend a decline in programming skill? Who will write code in the future? What will be their knowledge and aesthetics? This paper cannot answer all these questions, but it does develop a near-term approach to presenting programming more efficiently in the undergraduate CS curriculum and it suggests that the discipline needs to give some thought to its technology.
