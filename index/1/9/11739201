The nonlinear and cross-coupled dynamics of motor-manipulator systems is studied, and a control strategy is developed for achieving ease of controller design and high control performance. By using the algorithm developed in this paper, not only can the highly complicated motor-manipulator dynamics be effectively controlled, but the motors are also made "sensible" for sensing and compensating for the uncertain dynamics acting at manipulator joints. Furthermore, as a significant result, the modeling difficulty and control complexity of the manipulator dynamics can be significantly reduced.
