Hierarchical file systems and file browsers offer powerful capabilities for managing and organizing folders and files. Yet they lack robust tools for annotating and documenting these files-individually or collectively-with descriptive text. In contrast, Web pages and wikis make it easy to create rich and meaningful narratives around digital artifacts, allowing files to be embedded within explanatory text and images. Unfortunately, considerable effort is required to manage files stored on Web servers and to ensure that the published content remains up-to-date. In this note, we describe WikiFolders, a hybrid system for annotating file folders that draws upon the strengths of both the hierarchical file system and wikis.
