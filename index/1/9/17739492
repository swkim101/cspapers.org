Remotely accessible services enable current day systems to gather information, generate programs, access server data and interoperate throughout environments. Such techniques may be associated with the web, service discovery, and remote object based technologies. However, there is no technique which incorporates all the positive aspects of each of the currently used methods. This paper presents a remote class loading structure that expands the reach of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to beyond its host system. By interlinking remote classloaders within an environment the structure allows dynamic access, via advertisement and discovery, to each systemâ€™s accessible class files.
