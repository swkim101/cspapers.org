This paper describes logical winnowing methods from multiple identification candidates using corresponding appearance identification results with chronological pedestrian tracking results. It is difficult to identify individual using appearance identification, because appearance identification has some properties. This research proposes two methods that logically winnow out the identification candidates as methods that effectively fuse different directional identification results without the directional information. Experiments were made to verify the validity of the proposed methods. A mobile robot equipped with a laser scanner and a camera was used in the experiments. A pedestrian tracking method uses the laser scanner. The appearance identification uses the camera. The experimental results verified the validity of the logical winnowing method taking the logical product of identification candidates determined by each round of identification. In this paper, the appearance identification properties, the proposed methods and the experiments are described.
