As the development of Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly emphasized, how to adopt interconnected sensors and devices in conjunction with situation-awareness based system to smarten living applications has paid great attentions. On a multiple-units connected environment, a scheme of event-condition-action (ECA) is frequently used to serve automatic operation functions in the light of defined rules. According to the previous works, the ECA approach was often adopted in IC designs but less applied in advancing human-centered IoT applications, one of the main problems is the difficulty in directly generating ECA rules from human-centered application scenarios. This paper proposes a scenario-triggered, state-based rule generation (shortly S2RG) process which enables a complete but simplified way to conduct ECA rule for human-centered IoT applications. With the operation of the presented S2RG process, this paper also demonstrates ECA rules for two exemplary power saving scenarios for smarter energy applications.
