The use of social robots for elderly care is becoming ever more relevant, thus introducing new challenges which need to be solved to achieve acceptable performance. One fundamental task for a social robot is to move to the person of interest in order to start interacting or perform a service. In this paper we address the task of a robot having to navigate to a possibly occluded person, which needs assistance, based only on audio and range information. Our approach is based on forming a heuristic cost function which is based on combining two audio features, and then moving to the optimum position indicated by this cost function after every interaction with the person. The method is compared to a greedy approach in 20 different tasks using a loud speaker playing at approximately 60dB sound pressure level (SPL) to mimic a human speaker, and the proposed method shows superior performance. A second experiment with an increase of 13dB SPL of the loud speaker is conducted and the proposed method is able to handle this.
