Stakeholder consultation during course accreditation is now a requirement of new Australian government regulations as well as the Australian ICT professional society accreditation. Despite these requirements there remains some differences between universities and industry regarding the purpose, nature and extent of industry involvement in the curriculum. Surveys of industry and university leaders in ICT were undertaken to provide a representative set of views on these issues. The results provided insights into the perceptions of universities and industry regarding industry involvement into the curriculum. The results also confirmed previous research that identified a tension between industry's desire for relevant skills and the role of universities in providing a broader education for lifelong learning.
