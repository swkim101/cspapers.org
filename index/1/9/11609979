The purpose of the automated wire routing for VLSI and printed circuit board design is to connect a number of terminal pairs distributed throughout wiring plane with net paths which do not intersect each other. Although maze running and line search are well known algorithms used for this purpose, they need a considerable computing time. To reduce it we have developed a new parallel routing algorithm in which a number of processors compete in wiring different nets independent of each other, and one master processor verifies their results and judges. The master processor also delivers an assignment message to the processors. The efficiency of this algorithm was evaluated on a binary-tree multicomputer and more than 50 times of speedup was obtained when 3000 random nets were routed by using 63 processing elements.
