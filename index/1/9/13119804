Many techniques are employed in numbering lines for text editing. The simplest approach uses a single integer that changes each time a line is added or deleted (1). BASIC, in addition to other systems, uses fixed multi-digit numbers bound to each line. This approach has problems: only a fixed number of lines can be inserted between two consecutive lines of text, otherwise the original text must be renumbered. This negates one advantage of line numbers: the ability to compare different versions of the same document.
 In order to overcome these disadvantages, two basic schemes have been proposed and implemented. The following grammar defines the two schemes: fractional line numbering (FLN) and hierarchical line numbering (HLN).
