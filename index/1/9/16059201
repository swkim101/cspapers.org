Descriptions of the capabilities, implementation, and pedagogic worth of operating system projects based on two simulated machines are presented. One machine requires a batch-oriented operating system, involving a complete spooling system and multiprogramming. The other machine requires a terminal-oriented operating system that handles a command language and performs simple file operations. The simulators perform the actions of a real machine, monitor the operating system's performance as it handles simulated workloads, generate reports on the quality and quantity of service provided by the students' systems, and help the students debug their programs by providing traces and dumps on request.
