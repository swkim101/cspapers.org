In the following sections, the needs of structured architecture from the point of view of a single-user HLLCS is discussed. A prototype machine is introduced, and its design is treated as an ongoing experiment in structured machine design. This approach is relevant because historical evidence suggests that computer architecture (hardware and software) evolves slowly, requiring valuable information obtained through everyday use.
