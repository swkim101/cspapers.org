This paper presents a motion planner for a digital mannequin carrying objects in cluttered environments. The goal is to account for 3-dimensional obstacle avoidance, eye-convincing locomotion as well as manipulation constraints within an integrated motion planning approach. This approach combines probabilistic path planning methods, a motion capture based walking controller and inverse kinematics techniques.
