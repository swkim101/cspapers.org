Can libraries written without explicit support for Design by Contractâ„¢ in the language or the method benefit from a posteriori addition of contracts? To help answer this question, we performed an empirical study of library classes from the .NET Collections library, which doesn't use Design by Contract, to search for unexpressed contracts. This poster reports on what we have found, and discusses whether the results could be used to improve the design of the classes and make them easier to learn and use.
