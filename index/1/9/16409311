In the following paper, we present a framework for quickly training 2D object detectors for robotic perception. Our method can be used by robotics practitioners to quickly (under 30 seconds per object) build a large-scale real-time perception system. In particular, we show how to create new detectors on the fly using large-scale internet image databases, thus allowing a user to choose among thousands of available categories to build a detection system suitable for the particular robotic application. Furthermore, we show how to adapt these models to the current environment with just a few in-situ images. Experiments on existing 2D benchmarks evaluate the speed, accuracy, and flexibility of our system.
