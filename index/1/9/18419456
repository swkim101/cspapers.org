ATOPSS (<underline>A</underline>dage <underline>T</underline>utorial <underline>O</underline>perating <underline>S</underline>ystem <underline>S</underline>imulator) was designed to provide both a learning tool and a teaching aid for the presentation of elementary operating system concepts to graduate or advanced undergraduate computer science students. As a real learning tool, the simulator itself offers real time interaction and observation of a parametric, discrete time event oriented operating system. For a teaching aid, a series of short movies has been produced using ATOPSS solely as its basis, demonstrating both the use of the simulator and the different concepts it portrays. These movies thus offer the portability necessary for in-classroom presentation and provide a basis for further discussion.
