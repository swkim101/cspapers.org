Poor data quality has become a persistent challenge for organizations as data continues to grow in complexity and size. Existing data cleaning solutions focus on identifying repairs to the data to minimize either a cost function or the number of updates. These techniques, however, fail to consider underlying data privacy requirements that exist in many real data sets containing sensitive and personal information. In this demonstration, we present PARC, a Privacy-AwaRe data Cleaning system that corrects data inconsistencies w.r.t. a set of FDs, and limits the disclosure of sensitive values during the cleaning process. The system core contains modules that evaluate three key metrics during the repair search, and solves a multi-objective optimization problem to identify repairs that balance the privacy vs. utility tradeoff. This demonstration will enable users to understand: (1) the characteristics of a privacy-preserving data repair; (2) how to customize data cleaning and data privacy requirements using two real datasets; and (3) the distinctions among the repair recommendations via visualization summaries.
