With the trend of globalization, increased customer demand and advancement in technology development, firms are experiencing ever intense pressure to collaborate with their trading partners to compete with other supply chains. Firms are seeking to collaborate with their partners at greater extent in the areas such as knowledge management to exploit the potentials of an efficient and effective supply chain. Collaborative Knowledge Management System (CKMS) is the discipline of enabling individuals in a series of organizations to collectively create, share, access, and apply knowledge across company boundaries to achieve the business objectives of the entire supply chain. It allows firms to better understand each other and to learn from each otherâ€™s expertise, thus improve the overall efficiency of the supply chain. The theoretical implications of the research include providing understanding to the factors that facilitate knowledge collaboration in supply chain. The effects of CKMS on supply chain knowledge quality, supply chain integration and supply chain performance was also confirmed with large effect sizes. Practitioners can benefit from the result of the study. It can help practitioner to understand the current CKMS adoption rate. The research identified major components of CKMS, important antecedents, potential outcomes, and provided valid measurement instrument to these Systems, so that practitioners can take it as a roadmap to guide them through the implementation process.
