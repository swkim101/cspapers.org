In recent years, the steady emergence of digital communication, especially social media, has increased the "placelessness" of inter-person communication practices, i.e., lessening the need to reside co-located in order to communicate. When these communication practices carry over to co-located settings, they introduce redundancy and potentially even harm the co-located context, since use of personal technologies tends to isolate users from their surroundings. In this position paper, we want to raise awareness on how interactive public displays could alleviate this redundancy and potential isolation. We present a model of reinforcing co-located communications, and illustrate it through example use cases.
