We prove that polynomial time bounded RAMs with the instruction set [shift, +, X, boolean ] accept exactly the languages in PSPACE. This generalizes previous results: [5] showed the same for the instruction set that does not include multiplication, [5] and [7] proved the weaker theorems, that RAMs (and even PRAMs) with this instruction set could be simulated in EXPTAPE. The PRAM result is a simple corollary to our theorems. We also introduce other powerful string-manipulating instructions for RAMs, show a nontrivial simulation of Turing machines by these RAMs, and show that in a sense such simulations are optimal.
