Many of the principles that guide user-interface design for commercial systems do not scale down to simple applications developed on personal computers. These “very small systems” are typicaly designed within a high-level application such as a database or a spreadsheet. The entire development process may take no more than a few days. In this restricted context, iterative design and usability testing are unaffordable luxuries, while detailed task analysis and early focus on users fail because the task and users will not coalesce until the system is in place. We describe our experiences with developing and using a very small sytem. We present suggestions for successful design in similar situations.
