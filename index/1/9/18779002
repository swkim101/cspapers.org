The short and informal nature of tweets, along with the imbalanced characteristics of suggestion tweets, makes the task extremely challenging. To this end, we develop a classification framework on Factorization Machines, which is effective and efficient especially in classification tasks with feature sparsity settings. Moreover, we tackle the imbalance problem by introducing cost-sensitive learning techniques in Factorization Machines. Extensively experimental studies on a manually annotated real-life data set show that the proposed approach significantly improves the baseline approach, and yields the precision of 71.06% and recall of 67.86%. We also investigate the reason why Factorization Machines perform better. Finally, we introduce the first manually annotated dataset for suggestion classification.
