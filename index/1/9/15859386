The size of data sets subjected to statistical analysis is increasing as computer technology develops. Quick estimates of statistics rather than exact values are becoming increasingly important to analysts. We propose a new technique for estimating statistics on a database, a "top-down" alternative to the "bottom-up" method of sampling. This approach precomputes a set of general-purpose statistics on the database, a "database abstract", and then uses a large set of inference rules to make bounded estimates of other, arbitrary statistics requested by users. The inference rules form a new example of an artificial-intelligence "expert system". There are several important advantages of this approach over sampling methods.
