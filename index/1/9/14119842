The term relevance weighting method has been shown to produce optimal information retrieval queries under well-defined conditions. The parameters needed to generate the term relevance factors cannot unfortunately be estimated accurately in practice; futhermore, in realistic test situations, it appears difficult to obtain improved retrieval results using the term relevance weights over much simpler term weighting systems such as, for example, the inverse document frequency weights.It is shown in this study that the inverse document frequency weights and the term relevance weights are closely related over a wide range of the frequency spectrum. Methods are introduced for estimating the term relevance weights, and experimental results are given comparing the inverse document frequency with the estimated term relevance weights.
