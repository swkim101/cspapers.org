Modern programs require useful and robust APIs to guarantee applications' responsiveness. Given that large APIs can be used by novice developers and that not all experts are infallible, a well-designed API should inform developers about all the possible exceptions that an application can throw when it calls specific API methods. This research aims to identify automatically which exceptions should be included in an API reference. For this, there will be an evaluation of the Android API with an emphasis on its Java error-handling mechanism. First goal will be the automatic identification of as many as possible critical exceptions that each API method of the system can throw.Second goal will be the recommendation of undocumented exceptions that can lead client applications to execution failures (crashes). Consequently, the contribution of this research would be the decrease of possible application crashes that are associated with undocumented exceptions.
