This paper describes a technique for extracting idioms from text. The technique works by finding patterns such as "thrills and spills", whose reversals (such as "spills and thrills") are never encountered. 
 
This method collects not only idioms, but also many phrases that exhibit a strong tendency to occur in one particular order, due apparently to underlying semantic issues. These include hierarchical relationships, gender differences, temporal ordering, and prototype-variant effects.
