In this paper we propose a human-in-the-loop approach for teaching robots how to solve part assembly tasks. In the proposed setup the human tutor controls the robot through a haptic interface and a hand-held impedance control interface. The impedance control interface is based on a linear spring-return potentiometer that maps the button position to the robot arm stiffness. This setup allows the tutor to modulate the robot compliance based on the given task requirements. The demonstrated motion and stiffness trajectories are encoded using Dynamical Movement Primitives and learnt using Locally Weight Regression. To validate the proposed approach we performed experiments using Kuka Light Weight Robot and HapticMaster robot. The task of the experiment was to teach the robot how to perform an assembly task involving sliding a bolt fitting inside a groove in order to mount two parts together. Different stiffness was required in different stages of the task execution to accommodate the interaction of the robot with the environment and possible human-robot cooperation.
