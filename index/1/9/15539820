This paper presents the design and simulation results of a self-organizing neural network which induces a grammar from example sentences. Input sentences are generated from a simple phrase structure grammar including number agreement, verb transitivity, and recursive noun phrase construction rules. The network induces a grammar explicitly in the form of symbol categorization rules and phrase structure rules.
