Noise is a stark reality in real life data. Especially in the domain of text analytics, it has a significant impact as data cleaning forms a very large part of the data processing cycle. Noisy unstructured text is common in informal settings such as on-line chat, SMS, email, newsgroups and blogs, automatically transcribed text from speech, and automatically recognized text from printed or handwritten material. Gigabytes of such data is being generated everyday on the Internet, in contact centers, and on mobile phones. Researchers have looked at various text mining issues such as pre-processing and cleaning noisy text, information extraction, rule learning, and classification for noisy text. This paper focuses on the issues faced by automatic text classifiers in analyzing noisy documents coming from various sources. The goal of this paper is to bring out and study the effect of different kinds of noise on automatic text classification. Does the nature of such text warrant moving beyond traditional text classification techniques? We present detailed experimental results with simulated noise on the Reuters- 21578 and 20-newsgroups benchmark datasets. We present interesting results on real-life noisy datasets from various CRM domains.
