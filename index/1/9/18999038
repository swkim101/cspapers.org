INTRODUCTION Since Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) is leading edge technology, a strong argument can be made for including CASE in an Information Systems or Computer Science curriculum. Is the time, effort and financial investment necessary for adoption of CASE in a classroom setting offset by the benefits of CASE? The goal of this research was to determine whether there were any significant differences in the students~ performance when CASE technologies were used. We found a significant improvement.

Since CASE is leading edge technology, a strong argument can be made for including CASE in an Information Systems or Computer Science curriculum. Similar to an introduction of CASE into a commercial environment, this raises questions about the feasibility of CASE. The financial burden may be handled by either a grant or university funds but both the students and faculty must invest additional time and effort in order to incorporate CASE in the
