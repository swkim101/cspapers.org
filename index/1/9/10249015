This paper describes a novel method for displaying and examining the execution space of a rule interpreter. This method provides both coarse-grained and fine-grained views. The coarse-grained view, based on temporal rather than logical dependencies, provides an abstraction of the execution history not available from text or tree based traces. The fine grained views allow the user to examine sections of the execution history in detail. A detailed scenario with screen snapshots is presented.
