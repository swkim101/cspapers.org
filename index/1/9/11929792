Proving program termination plays an important role in ensuring reliability of software systems. Many researchers have lent much attention to this open long-standing problem, most of them were interested in proving that iterative programs terminate under a given input. In this paper, we present a method to solve a more interesting and challenging problem, namely, the generation of the termination condition of while loops i.e. condition over initial states under which a loop terminates normally. To this effect, we use a concept introduced by Mili et al., viz. invariant relation.
