In this paper, the relation between B-splines and FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters is demonstrated and exploited to design a digital filter for trajectory planning, combining the very simple structure and computational efficiency of FIR filters with the flexibility of splines. In particular, the trajectory generator consists of two main elements. The former is devoted to the solution of an optimization problem that, given a set of points to be interpolated (or approximated), provides the control points defining the spline. The latter, a cascade of moving average filters, gives the trajectory profile at each sampling time on the basis of such points. The proposed method has been applied to several robotic and industrial applications, and in this paper two case studies are reported as examples: an industrial robot performing a welding operation and a mobile robot moving in an environment with obstacles. With respect to these tasks, the main features of the trajectory generator are shown: the possibility of planning trajectories with high degree of smoothness (continuity of the derivatives), the possibility of easily changing the duration of the trajectory (and therefore the velocity, acceleration, jerk, etc. of the trajectory) maintaining the same geometric path, the possibility of locally modifying the pre-planned path.
