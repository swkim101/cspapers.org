The Oviedo/VanVerth model of program quality has been implemented in a system for automatically grading quality in Pascal programs. Besides the obvious practical advantages of such a system, it also functions as a testbed in the process of validating the model. A study was conducted to test the performance of the model by comparing rankings obtained from measures produced by the model with rankings produced by grades for quality given by expert human graders. Results from the study showed that for the sets of programs tested, the model and the experts tended to agree about the relative quality of the programs under consideration.
