This paper describes an implemented mechanism for handling bound anaphora, disjoint reference, and pronominal reference. The algorith maps over every node in a parse tree in a left-to-right, depth first manner. Forward and backwards coreference, and disjoint reference are assigned during this tree walk. A semantic interpretation procedure is used to deal with multiple antecedents.
