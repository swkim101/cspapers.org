We present Mime, a compact, low-power 3D sensor for unencumbered free-form, single-handed gestural interaction with head-mounted displays (HMDs). Mime introduces a real-time signal processing framework that combines a novel three-pixel time-of-flight (TOF) module with a standard RGB camera. The TOF module achieves accurate 3D hand localization and tracking, and it thus enables motion-controlled gestures. The joint processing of 3D information with RGB image data enables finer, shape-based gestural interaction. Our Mime hardware prototype achieves fast and precise 3D gestural control. Compared with state-of-the-art 3D sensors like TOF cameras, the Microsoft Kinect and the Leap Motion Controller, Mime offers several key advantages for mobile applications and HMD use cases: very small size, daylight insensitivity, and low power consumption. Mime is built using standard, low-cost optoelectronic components and promises to be an inexpensive technology that can either be a peripheral component or be embedded within the HMD unit. We demonstrate the utility of the Mime sensor for HMD interaction with a variety of application scenarios, including 3D spatial input using close-range gestures, gaming, on-the-move interaction, and operation in cluttered environments and in broad daylight conditions.
