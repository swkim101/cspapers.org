This paper considers robust H/sub 2/ control problem of continuous-time systems with time-varying norm-bounded uncertainties. A necessary and sufficient condition for the analysis of robust H/sub 2/ control is derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Using the analysis result, a state feedback controller and a dynamic output feedback controller are designed respectively so that the closed-loop uncertain system is quadratically stable and all its transfer matrices have H/sub 2/-norm bounded by a prescribed value. With LMI manipulations, two necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of above design problems are addressed.
