This paper describes a peer-to-peer (p2p) system (beacond) that is suitable for teaching important concepts in ubiquitous computing. The system exposes issues in peer location, p2p services, security and privacy issues. The system provided enough background to compliment class lectures and assisted students in designing their own course projects. Students continue to explore ideas exposed by beacond; some of these ideas are being further developed for publication in research conferences[1]. We present our experiences in using this framework for three different course offerings.
