This experiment in representing knowledge has the goal of studying what kind of help existing knowledge representation tools might provide, for the process of designing switching systems. We offer some tentative positive as well as negative conclusions. The experiment is principally successful in that it has allowed us to point out some important representation problems, particularly in the checking and maintenance of consistency, and the expression of several points of view of a model.
