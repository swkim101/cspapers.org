An experiment was run in which elderly and younger people used a keyboard editor and a simulated listening typewriter to compose letters. Performance was measured and participants rated the systems used.
Our general conclusions were as follows:There are no major differences in performance between elderly computer users and their younger counterparts in carrying out a computer-based composition task.
Elders appear to be more enthusiastic users of computer systems than are younger people. This is shown by preference ratings, behavioral observations, and post-experimental debriefings.
Voice input does not improve performance on composition tasks, but it is greatly preferred over the traditional keyboard input method.
