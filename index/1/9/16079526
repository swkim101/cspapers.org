There have been many approaches in the past to generalize the ElGamal signature scheme. In this paper we integrate all these approaches in a Meta-ElGamal signature scheme. We also investigate some new types of variations, that haven't been considered before. By this method we obtain in our example settings numerous variants of the ElGamal scheme. From these variants, we can extract new, highly efficient signature schemes, which haven't been proposed before. As an example, we present efficient DSA-variants.
