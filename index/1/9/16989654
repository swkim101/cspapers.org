We present better random sampling algorithms for maximum flows in undirected graphs. Our algorithms apply to capacitated or uncapacitated graphs, and find a maximum flow of value v in ~ O(pmnv) time. This improves on a previous bound of ~ O(m2=3n1=3v) given by the author recently, which in turn improved on the O(mv) time bound for a typical augmenting path algorithm. In uncapacitated graphs without parallel edges, the bound is no worse than ~ O(n5=2). We give another algorithm that finds a (1 ) times maximum flow in time ~ O(mpn= ), regardless of v.
