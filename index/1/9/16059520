In such interactional the speaker can encode his intentions that the hearer act in a variety of sentence types. Instead of telling the hearer what to do. the speaker may Just state his goals, and expect a response that meets these goals. This paper presents a new model for recognizing the speaker's Intended meaning in determining a response. We show that this recognition makes use of the speaker's plan, his beliefs about the domain and about the hearer's relevant capacities.
