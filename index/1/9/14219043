Data abstraction is a valuable method for organizing programs to make them easier to modify and maintain. Inheritance allows one implementation of a data abstraction to be related to another hierarchically. This paper investigates the usefulness of hierarchy in program development, and concludes that although data abstraction is the more important idea, hierarchy does extend its usefulness in some situations.
