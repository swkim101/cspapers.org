In order to reach high performance, many levels of parallelism should be exploited simultaneously on massively parallel architectures. The efficiency of a large system heavily depends on the interconnection between the processing elements and the memories: asynchronous buffering networks allow a high throughput of requests when independent tasks are run, but a strict control of the network is necessary for fine grain parallelism.
We show that the ordering of the requests delivery can be controlled by a simple mechanism on an asynchronous buffering interconnection network, the @@@@ network. This network is shown to be efficient in various situations as MIMD, micro-tasked, vector and pipelined computations.
