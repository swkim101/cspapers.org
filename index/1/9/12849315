In this paper, we present CREWW, a tool for co-located, collaborative CRC modeling and use case analysis. In CRC sessions role play is used to involve all stakeholders when determining whether the current software model completely and consistently captures the modeled use case. In this activity it quickly becomes difficult to keep track of which class is currently active or along which path the current state was reached. CREWW was designed to alleviate these and other weaknesses of the traditional approach.
