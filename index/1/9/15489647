Operating systems is a central subject in computer science curriculum, and teaching it successfully has been a challenge. Effective learning requires carefully designed programming projects that can facilitate deep thinking and enhance hands-on experience. This paper presents MiniOS, an instructional embedded operating system designed to carry out operating systems projects successfully. We explain MiniOS approach, the rationale behind it, and compare it with other similar approaches.
