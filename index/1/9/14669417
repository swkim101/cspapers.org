Designer's Workbench (DWB) is a systematic approach to design aids integration that overcomes most of the barriers that frequently restrict the use of those aids. In combination with the UNIX (FOOTNOTE: UNIX is a trademark of Bell Laboratories.) operating system [1][2], DWB manages both the flow and the form of data that is required by application programs that reside on various computer systems. The techniques described in this paper enable the Designer's Workbench development team to respond quickly to electrical and physical designers' needs. Because of this ability to respond quickly to users' needs Designer's Workbench has had uncommon growth and acceptance in the user community.
