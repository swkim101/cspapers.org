In clinics, customized archwires are demanded for lingual orthodontic treatment. However, only very experienced orthodontists can handle the manual appliance preparation. This pattern not only occupies lots of the orthodontist's labor time, but also can not ensure the accuracy of the appliances. Therefore, a robotic system was developed for automatic and accurate orthodontic archwire bending in our study. First, a method for customized archwire parameterization was developed. Second, an adaptive sampling-based bending planner with collision checker in time-varying environment was designed. Finally, a bending control strategy was used to eliminate the springback effect of the archwires and bending point shift during the bending process. A self-developed simulation platform based on Robot Operating System with MoveIt was used for preliminary validation of the proposed method. Physical experiments for multi-functional orthodontic bends on the robotic system were conducted as well. The results have shown that the developed robotic system using the proposed planning and control method was able to accomplish the automatic and accurate orthodontic archwire bending.
