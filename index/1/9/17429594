This paper provides a detailed analysis of various implementations of digital tries, including the «ternary search tries» of Bentley and Sedgewick. The methods employed combine symbolic uses of generating functions, Poisson models, and Mellin transforms. Theoretical results are matched against real-life data and justify the claim that ternary search tries are a highly efficient dynamic dictionary structure for strings and textual data.
