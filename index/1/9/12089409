The year was 1994; the place, Phoenix Arizona. A panel session moderated by Barbara Boucher Owens entitled New Models for the CS1 Course: What Are They and Are They Leading to the Same Place? [1] took place before a packed audience at SIGCSE ’94. At the time, the World Wide Web was just over the horizon, and disk drives held at most a few hundred megabytes. The most popular language for CS1 was Pascal. At the SIGCSE’94 panel we heard about four diverse approaches to introductory computer science: the “breadthfirst” approach, which includes discrete mathematics, logic and problem solving; the “object-oriented” approach, which introduces objects from the beginning; the“formal”approach, which mandates correctness proofs; and the “Scheme” approach, which focuses on abstraction. For SIGCSE’09 three of the four panelists from the ’94 panel have returned to update the discussion. Joining this group is a younger faculty member who, as a student in the 1990’s, was directly affected by the teaching philosophies of the time. The veteran panelists will comment on how their approaches have evolved over the years. Have the expectations of today’s student population forced these educators to adjust their philosophies, or have they been able to adapt their core beliefs to the current environment? Looking ahead, the most important question remains, how does one craft a CS1 curriculum that can appeal to a wide audience and best prepare students for the road ahead.
