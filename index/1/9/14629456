In this paper we introduce a new statistical modeling technique for building occupancy maps. The problem of mapping is addressed as a classification task where the robot's environment is classified into regions of occupancy and unoccupancy. Our model provides both a continuous representation of the robot's surroundings and an associated predictive variance. This is obtained by employing a Gaussian process as a non-parametric Bayesian learning technique to exploit the fact that real-world environments inherently possess structure. This structure introduces a correlation between points on the map which is not accounted for by many common mapping techniques such as occupancy grids. Using a trained neural network covariance function to model the highly non-stationary datasets, it is possible to generate accurate representations of large environments at resolutions which suit the desired applications while also providing inferences into occluded regions, between beams, and beyond the range of the sensor, even with relatively few sensor readings. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in a simulated data set with known ground-truth, and in an outdoor urban environment covering an area of 120,000 m2.
