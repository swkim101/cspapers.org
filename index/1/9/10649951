NoA is an agent architecture that supports the development of agents motivated by norms: obligations, permissions and prohibitions. Obligations motivate a normative agent to act: a motive to achieve a state of affairs or to perform some action. Prohibitions restrict an agent's behaviour, whereas permissions allow an agent to pursue certain activities. To test the architecture, NoA agents arc applied to automated business transaction scenarios where the correct execution of contracts is paramount to create a situation of trust.
