Since tagging information is usually very sparse, effective learning of the content representation for these resources is crucial to accurate tag recommendation. Recently, models proposed for tag recommendation, such as collaborative topic regression and its variants, have demonstrated promising accuracy. However, a limitation of these models is that, by using topic models like latent Dirichlet allocation as the key component, the learned representation may not be compact and effective enough. Moreover, since relational data exist as an auxiliary data source in many applications, it is desirable to incorporate such data into tag recommendation models. In this paper, we start with a deep learning model called stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) in an attempt to learn more effective content representation. We propose a probabilistic formulation for SDAE and then extend it to a relational SDAE (RSDAE) model. RSDAE jointly performs deep representation learning and relational learning in a principled way under a probabilistic framework. Experiments conducted on three real datasets show that both learning more effective representation and learning from relational data are beneficial steps to take to advance the state of the art.
