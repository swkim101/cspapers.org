This paper describes a method for estimating the 6-DoF viewing parameters of a calibrated vehicle-mounted camera. Visual features are combined with standard in-vehicle sensors and a single-track vehicle motion model in a bundle adjustment framework to produce a jointly optimal viewing parameter estimate. Results show that the vehicle motion model in combination with in-vehicle sensors exhibit good accuracy in estimating planar vehicle motion. This property is preserved, when combining these information sources with vision. Furthermore, the accuracy obtained from vision-only in direction estimation is not only maintained, but in fact further improved, primarily in situations where the matched visual features are few.
