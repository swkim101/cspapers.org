SimSE is an educational software engineering simulation game that uses a unique software process modeling approach. This approach combines both predictive and prescriptive aspects to support the creation of dynamic, interactive, graphical models for software engineering process education. This paper describes the different constructs in a SimSE process model, the associated model builder tool, and discusses the underlying tradeoffs and issues involved in this approach.
