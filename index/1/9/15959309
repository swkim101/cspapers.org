Search result diversification (SRD) aims to select diverse documents from the search results in order to cover as many search intents as possible. A prerequisite is that the search results contain diverse documents. For this purpose, we investigate a new approach to SRD by diversifying the query. Expansion terms are selected from ConceptNet so as to cover as diverse aspects as possible. The experimental results on several TREC data sets show that our method can outperform the existing state-of-the-art approaches that do not diversify the query.
