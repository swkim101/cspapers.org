An algorithm is given to translate a relatively low-level intermediate representation of a program into assembly code or machine code for a target computer. The algorithm is table driven. A construction algorithm is used to produce the table from a functional description of the target machine. The method produces high quality code for many commercially available computers. By replacing the table, it is possible to retarget a compiler for another kind of computer. In addition techniques are given to prove the correctness of the translator.
